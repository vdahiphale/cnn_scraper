Congressman, appreciate you being with us. Are you surprised Robinson has refused to drop out of the race? REP. JEFF JACKSON, (D-NC): No, this has been who he's been. And frankly, I'm not surprised by the recent revelations. If you're from North Carolina, this is not a surprise. I know the rest of the country is just now learning about him, but we've known who Mark Robinson is for a long time. He's referred to gay people as filth. He has said that God doesn't call women to lead. He's been carrying around a lot of anger and lot of hatred for years.",

So, the thing getting that you can distance yourself from this individual without actually saying that is I don't think is a good strategy, but I also think because it's the governor's race. Maybe if this was a state senator that was running, it wouldn't be as prominent, but this is the person who's going to lead the state of North Carolina, it's the second name under Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on the ballot. So they are very closely related and I think that it could have an impact, particularly because North Carolina is so close right now in a way that most folks didn't think it was going to be with Joe Biden on the ticket.

What would that look like?And do you think Trump should address this or do you think he'll do the \"I don't know this person\". ERIN PERRINE, FORMER DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: I anticipate Trump will do the 'I don't know this person', but it's already clear in polling that North Carolinians were already separating Donald Trump from Mark Robinson because Mark Robinson was polling so far behind Donald Trump at this point. So, I understand the strategy of Kamala Harris and her campaign putting out an ad to try to tie the two of them together more were closely, but Trump was already well ahead of Robinson on the ballot as of this point in the race. So I anticipate most Republicans in North Carolina will be putting a space between themselves and Robinson not doing events with him, not hugging him in, and trying to create that space. Because ultimately, it's the top of the ticket that people will be voting for. Donald Trump is the one that will likely be the one that drives the voters either to the ballots for him or against him. But ultimately his numbers really don't shake a or move much at all, given any controversy that's happened at any point in any other races.

You need to hand count the number of ballots that have been turned in. You need to compare that to the number of ballots that voting machines say were cast and compare those two numbers. And so, there are a lot of concerns about this from the perspective of statewide election officials and local election officials. One, is you know, they've been working all day, hand counting paper ballots is not a perfect science. Usually, the machine-count numbers are better and that you have a chain of custody issue with these ballots.

It would not be the first time the state election board has been sued as a result of rules they've passed. Just this year, they're already in court over a rule regarding election certification and saying state or local boards can conduct their own reasonable inquiries before they certify the election results. So, I expect were going to see more lawsuits.

There's no confirmation on the deaths from Hezbollah, which the U.S. and many countries have designated as a terrorist organization.Lebanon's health ministry says about at -- says 14 people were killed and dozens more were wounded. Now this comes after the remote detonation, as you know, across Lebanon of explosive laden pagers and walkie talkies used by Hezbollah this week that killed dozens and injured thousands. Israel hasn't officially taken responsibility for those attacks, but CNN has reported the exploding pagers were a joint operation by Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad and the IDF. Well, tonight, we're also learning more about one of the six hostages who was executed by Hamas late last month and found in a tunnel. Eden Yerushalmi was kidnapped on October 7th from the Nova Music Festival. She tried to flee with two friends in a car, but Hamas gunmen shot up the vehicle, killing her friends. Eden survived that attack, which is incredible when you see all the car's bullet holes in this video. She pretended to be dead and was able to call her sisters. She later left the car and hid in a eucalyptus bush. She remained in contact with her sisters the whole time, until a gunman found her there. \"They've caught me,\" were the last words she spoke on the phone. Eden turned 24 in captivity. Recently, I spoke with her two sisters, Shani and May. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

For decades, it has been devouring mountains of coal in Minnesota and belching out gigatons of planet cooking gases, making this power plant the state's biggest climate polluter. But in a vivid example of energy transition, Sherco's owners are changing its diet, swapping out coal for renewables, until the last fire goes out in 2030.
