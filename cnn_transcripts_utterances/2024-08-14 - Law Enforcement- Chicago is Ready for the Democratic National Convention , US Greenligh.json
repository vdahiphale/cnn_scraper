Kellyanne Conway, who was in that clip you just played earlier, actually recently went to Bedminster to talk to Trump about this very issue, according to sources who spoke with Kristen Holmes and I.

They say, quote, \"Harris won't say it this bluntly in public, but her advisers do so privately. She wants to break with Biden on issues on which he's unpopular. First up rising prices.

She and Governor Walz are out talking about what they intend to do if they went a term in the White House to help working people. And he's out complaining about himself.I think one of the opportunities that Vice President Harris has here is to take the meat of the Biden economic agenda and run on policies that are very popular, capping the cost of insulin, taking on junk fees. I mean, these are things that resonate in people's lives that she and President Biden were able to do during their time in the White House. her opportunity now is to take those successes and talk about them in her own voice and lay out a vision for how she intends to build on that success and make life more affordable for working people. So she has a great foundation of the work she's done over the last four years, which I can also tell you from my time in the White House, a lot of those accomplishments, capping insulin, for example, polls through the roof, enormous bipartisan support for some of what she and President Biden have been able to achieve.

When J.D. flipped on Donald Trump, on his position with Donald Trump, when he ran, we knew what his position was with Donald Trump. So what we see today is voters passing judgment on their flip and saying that's OK. The problem with Harris's flips, and there's many. I suspect she isgoing to flip on the death penalty pretty soon. Her and Walz is the most anti-death penalty ticket we've ever experienced in U.S. history. They're going to be flipping on that because that results with KSM sort of being released on the death penalty. She's running, and this is her first time running on her flipping these positions, so she has to explain them. We haven't seen her have success explaining them. I suspect she can't, which is why she's avoiding press interviews. But flipping is a common thing, but Trump and Vance have already gone to the voters with their flip and they accepted it. We'll see if the voters accept Kamala's flip.",

Vance who once called Donald Trump America's Hitler, and is now running on the ticket with him, I don't think that a shift in policy position holds the same kind -- gives voters the same kind of concern that it used to 20 years ago, 30 years ago, as John was saying. But I think for Harris, she has for years in the White House where she can talk about her experience, she can talk about what she's learned. AND again, we go back to the underlying policies of the Biden-Harris administration are very popular. The issue that Joe Biden had was that people were concerned about his age, didn't think he was going to be able to complete a second term. And that was dragging down the overall popularity, his overall popularity in the race, I should say. Vice President Harris doesn't have that issue. So she has a slate of policies to run on. You have violent crime has come down to a 50-year low, border crossings are back down to where they were in fall of 2020 when Donald Trump was president. She has a lot of good stuff to run on. And I think she's going to be making that case over the next three months.",

But that's also where the -- let's get off the terrorism piece for a minute and go to the potential for disorder and disruption.Protest groups have come to Chicago. They've announced their plans. They want to shut down the convention. We've heard that before but outside the perimeter, you've got factors that you can't fully control in a big city like, you know, the delegate buses have to get from the hotels to cross into the perimeter that puts them in traffic, that puts them in Chicago. They will be escorted by police, but you know, protest groups are looking to say, what street can we seize? What route can we shut down?

And the interpretation in this region by diplomats in the region, is that the United States was going to have to do something to change the calculus for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's thinking. So, the decision which has been part of a very long process yesterday to say that this provisionally $20 billion of weapons, up to 50 F-15 fighter aircraft, ammunition for tanks, that that would be sent to Israel potentially, part of a long process, the announcement coming yesterday is seen here as potentially part of the pressure of package on Prime Minister Netanyahu.
