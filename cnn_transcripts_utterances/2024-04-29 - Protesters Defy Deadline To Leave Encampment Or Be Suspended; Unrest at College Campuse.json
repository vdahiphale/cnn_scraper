They now face suspension if identified by campus officials.On the right, you're seeing the University of Texas at Austin, where state and local police have moved in on a rather actually small at this point contingent of protesters who tried to set up an encampment there on an area that is supposed to be used for commencement in not too long. But this is something that is affecting a number of universities. And in particular, we see active situations on these two right now.",

They held a press conference a little while ago saying that they are not going to refuse that encampment -- they're refusing to leave that encampment.The university has said, we have identified a lot of you, and you will face the consequences, including suspension, if you don't leave. Let's dig into this more with senior law enforcement analyst, Charles Ramsey who led the police forces of both Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Chief, we are looking at these dueling protests in Austin and in New York. When you are law enforcement and you're looking at and you're dealing with these protesters who are perhaps not violent, but they are refusing to leave, that we have seen some detentions in the case of UT Austin. How is that decision made by law enforcement, whether to remove those protesters by force?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, it's up to the university. The police are only there at the invitation of the university. And I think we need to continue to emphasize that. What we see are the police taking action, but they're only there because the university president and the board has requested them to come and to dismantle the encampment or move people off their property or whatever.So it makes it look as if it's just a police action, but reality is they're invited. Now, is it difficult? Yes, it's difficult. You know, when I look at what's going on in Texas, for an example, the students are there with their arms locked, obviously refusing to leave. That just raises the possibility of someone getting injured because the police will arrest them, but you have to pull them apart. And that makes it even more difficult and dangerous, quite frankly, for everyone. But police will continue to try to use a minimal amount of force, but some force will be used. Now, Colombia, we don't know yet what's going to happen, but eventually they're going to want to dismantle that particular encampment. I mean, personally, I think the last thing and the worst thing you could ever do is allow those encampments to take place to begin with. The longer they're there, the larger they grow, and the more difficult it becomes to move people out of those sites.",

This is before the October 7th attacks by Hamas.And now we're being told that the U.S. is still debating whether to restrict American aid to one of those units, which is an IDF battalion. Kylie Atwood has been reporting on this from the State Department. I want to bring her in. Kylie, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had indicated recently that there might be restrictions placed on this IDF battalion, which would be a major move by the United States. But Israel has pushed back aggressively on that. So where do things stand right now?",

And it appears that those conversations with regard to that one unit, that one IDF unit, are still ongoing.So just kind of to broaden the scope here, there are five units, as you said, Alex, that have been found to have committed gross human rights abuses, five Israeli security units. And of those four of them, the Israelis have taken effective remediation. According to the deputy State Department spokesperson who spoke with us today, we don't know exactly what that remediation looks like. But presumably it's something where they were scolded, where there, you know, were Israeli officials who were held accountable for those actions that were taken, those human rights abuses. Now, in the case of that one lasting IDF unit, the State Department remains in contact with the Israelis on that. And the Israelis have provided more information to the United States surrounding this incident, this IDF unit. Presumably that was provided information recently, though the State Department didn't say when it came, because the State Department is still reviewing that information to determine if this unit is still eligible to receive U.S. arms. At this moment in time, all of those units are still eligible, however, to receive U.S. arms -- Alex.",

In the past almost seven months, nearly seven months since October 7, we were under the impression on so many occasions that a breakthrough is here, it's imminent, that a deal that is on the table is going to be accepted by Hamas. And yet every time we are waking up to yet another rejection by Hamas and their accomplices.It's clear that now Egypt entered the discussions in a more urgent manner. I think it is a result of pressure that the Israeli government is threatening to have in Rafah. And so perhaps we'll have the breakthrough we're all hoping for. We as families, as we said today in the press conference in Tel Aviv, the Siegel and the Miran family, on behalf of so many other families of hostages, are going to continue pushing our policymakers to make it a priority, a primary objective, as they promised us, to bring home the hostages, to uphold their social contract. But we also recognize that Hamas as a terrorist organization that committed the atrocities of October 7 and countless other atrocities against Israelis and against Gazan Palestinians, is not negotiating in good faith. But hopefully we'll have that breakthrough. And I think the next couple of days we will ask the answer to your question.",
