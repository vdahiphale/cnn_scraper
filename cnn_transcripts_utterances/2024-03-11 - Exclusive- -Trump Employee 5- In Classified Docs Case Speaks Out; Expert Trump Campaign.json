Hear what he has to say about moving Trump's boxes of classified documents. Plus, he is a software engineer hired by Trump's campaign to find voter fraud. And he found none. We'll give you all the details tonight as he's warning this evening, Trump will try to overturn the election again if he doesn't win. He'll be my guest this hour. And a passenger on that terrifying flight that plummeted midair speaking out, says bodies were flying everywhere, hitting the ceiling, leaving blood like a scene from \"The Exorcist\". Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: we begin with the breaking news. Trump's employee number five speaking out. The man who was only been known as Trump employee number five in the classified documents indictment from Jack Smith revealing his identity, explaining for the first time how we help move classified documents for Trump. His name is Brian butler, a long time chauffeur to Trump's family. Now, Butler spent about 20 years working for Trump and he claims it was on June 3rd, 2022, when Trump's personal aide, Walt Nauta, the name may be familiar, asked him if he could borrow Butler's SUV be to move luggage from Mar-a-Lago to the former president's personal plane. Now, that date is the same date that Trump's attorneys met with the FBI, touring a basement storage room to look for documents. It's the same day they signed a document saying they hunted for additional papers and found few. And Butler telling Kaitlan Collins that the luggage he moved included the white banker's boxes in Jack Smith's indictment.

The facts are very, very clear convictions would be damaging and erase that is marginal and could cost them the election. So they're pushing this off. The second thing is tomorrow we have the Hur hearings and those are I think one of the reasons that the Republicans are leaning so hard into all of this isn't just to talk about the question of age that her raised, but they want to muddy the waters. And you can see on social media, its like in reaction to this story, people saying, you know, Biden did it, Trump, did it, Trump gets indicted. That's his narrative.

And just to go back to something David said, I do think tomorrow we're going to hear from the special counsel Hur and the hearings at the House side about his report and Biden's handling of classified documents, but it is important to remember that in Hur's report, he actually says that the Trump case is much worse than Biden, and he actually says things that now we have Mr. Butler talking about the ways in which Trump tried to hide the documents from the government, putting him on a plane instead, and trying to delete footage.
