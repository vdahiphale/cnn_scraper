Anna Coren for us in Hong Kong, appreciate it.Now, the Chinese city of Zhengzhou has now lifted a five day lockdown. The city is home to the world's largest iPhone factory owned by Foxconn where employees revolted over the past few weeks over working conditions and COVID restrictions. CNN's Selina Wang has our report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Anger boils over into violent protests at the world's largest iPhone factory. Workers stream out of Foxconn's factory dorms in central China, protesting unfair treatment, dirty living conditions, and chaotic COVID rules at the Apple supplier. Videos obtained by CNN show a group of police in white hazmat suits beating workers with batons and metal rods. The police are hitting people, a worker shouts in the video. A Foxconn employee at the protest told CNN, the scene turned into a river of blood. Police hit the workers ruthlessly. Earlier, squadrons of riot police had rolled in. They're going to start beating us, protesters yelled in fear, facing off rows of law enforcement with riot gear. The protest escalated into the evening, workers tearing down COVID barriers using metal beams against police. Masses of them hurling metal parts towards law enforcement, even using a COVID barrier as a shield against rows of authorities. They worked together to push over a police car, cheering and chanting. Since October, the Foxconn plant has been sealed off from the outside world after a COVID outbreak that forced employees to live and work on site, in what videos obtained by CNN show are filthy conditions, garbage piling up in the hallway. The factory plunged into chaos. Videos showed workers scrambling, fighting to get enough food and supplies. Then came the exodus, masses of workers walked miles along highways to escape the plant. Analysts estimate this factory produces more than half of Apple's iPhones. Apple already warned customers they'll need to wait even longer to get their new products because of China's COVID lockdowns. So, to attract workers, Foxconn promised higher pay and bonuses. New workers signed up. But when they got to the factory, the pay package was worse than what Foxconn advertised. A Foxconn employee said workers felt cheated, leading to thousands of people protesting. Foxconn later blamed the payment discrepancy on a \"technical error\" and sent text messages to workers offering to pay them $1,400 to quit and go. Soon after, videos showed long lines of workers boarding buses to leave the factory. Their departure possibly putting an end to another violent and dramatic scene, but increasing the pressure on Apple, it's just the latest victim of China's zero COVID policy.

What is the danger you think in the months ahead? Given the first issue, which is the seemingly relentless draw down of weapons from the U.S. and other NATO countries, you know, as this war continues to draw down on more and more stockpiles and equipment? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Paula, that's one of the big issues that's confronting the entire Western alliance, because the defense industrial base, as it's known, of all these countries, the NATO countries in Europe as well as the United States and Canada, it's really not built for this kind of a war. And that very fact has made it really difficult for the West to resupply Ukraine. Ukraine is using weapons at a very high rate. It's using ammunition of course as part of this. And then the other thing that we're confronted with is the barrels of the various artillery pieces are overheating because of overuse. So, that's a major issue for the Ukrainians and for the West, especially if the West wants to continue to help the Ukrainian send -- help the Ukrainian stop the Russians.",

LEIGHTON: Somewhat creative, in the sense that the Ukrainians of course, have had this Soviet-era weapon systems ever since they gain their or regain their independence in 1991. So, they're used to this, they've been trained on this. And even if they've had a break in service between their initial military service and their call up for this war, they're so familiar with these -- with these weapons systems. So, in that sense, it makes sense to do that. But on the other hand, these systems are old, they are not as effective as their western counterparts, especially the modern Western counterparts. And the Ukrainians would be better served if they could receive the western systems, and they could be trained on them. So, that's a big and. But that is one of the key things that would need to happen in this case. So, I think that requires a lot of creative solutions, you know, using the old Soviet equipment, but also ramping up the training for modern Western equipment to be used by the Ukrainians themselves.",

And this is -- certainly falls within that category. And these landslides are particularly dangerous, especially in the communities at the bottom of the ravines, at the bottom of the canyons, because when they pick up momentum, they can pick up anything, from boulders to full trees, even houses and vehicles, and in this instance, trucks as well. Now, the Brazilian Meteorological Agency on Wednesday did have the highest likelihood of flash flooding and landslides in the area that was struck hardest by our landslides. Basically, the heavy rain was just too much, soaking into the soil, gravity one, and we saw the landslide take out so -- so much infrastructure within that particular area. Rainfall totals here in excess of 150 millimeters from the recent rains in the Southern portions of Brazil. This is the wettest time of the year. We're talking November, December, even into January, where climatologically speaking, this particular area in the Southern states of Brazil receive over 200 millimeters within a monthly period.
