Star Caitlin Clark led her team to a 94 to 87 victory against the LSU Tigers in a much-anticipated repeat matchup of the title game last year. But this time Iowa came out on top again. Take a look at the pandemonium there in that arena.CNN Sports Analyst and USA Today Columnist Christine Brennan joins me now to discuss. Christine, I was watching this game last night and Caitlin Clark is just unbelievable to watch. I mean, she is almost automatic every time she fires off a three.",

And Angel Reese gave Caitlyn Clark a little smack, a little trash talk back at Caitlyn. Caitlyn, of course, is known for having fun on the court, and doing some things. Well, Angel did it back.And it started a national conversation, Jim, that frankly I thought was great because we were talking about women's sports and women's basketball. My goodness, I was at the masters and I was still talking about Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. And so, that that was good. And last night what we saw was a measure of sportsmanship that I think both of women obviously were able to rise to the occasion and also give the nation. And that is class dignity. A big hug. And conversation afterwards and even before the game about how important each one is to the other and the respect and just everything about the game that they both love about each other. So, I think that was a good ending, even though certainly it was not the ending that LSU wanted.",

I mean, you know, years ago, a lot of evangelicals would talk about facing a binary choice in the general election in 2016 between Trump and Clinton. But I think it's clear now, if you look at exit polls from the last two general elections, as well as exit polls from the primary this year, evangelicals have consistently and overwhelmingly back Donald Trump. I should say white evangelicals, specifically.And one reason is pragmatic. Trump is seen as someone who will deliver on their policy goals, and he did that in his first term. The overturning of Roe v. Wade is the prime example. And also, as you noted, he taps into this idea of persecution, and this idea of a declining influence of Christianity in America. This has been a long- standing theme in American evangelicalism, and white evangelicalism in particular. And it's something that we hear from Trump, including when he was selling those Bibles the other day.",

I mean, I remember well, I was a teenager in the 1990s, and I remember that the way the evangelical community responded to Bill Clinton's moral failings, and it's been noted the striking difference, the response to Trump, of course. But I think if you look at data, white evangelicals understand that Trump is not a particularly devout person. There's polling that backs that up.But again, they see him as understanding their concerns and tapping into, again, this long-standing theme that I've been hearing my whole life, that Christianity is on the decline. That it's central to American identity. When he talked -- when he holds up that Bible and he talks about bringing the Bible back, bringing Christianity back, that resonates for many evangelicals, regardless of his personal behavior. And they see the legal -- many of them see the legal troubles he's facing as a sign of persecution, and in many ways a sign that he's on the right track.",

There's a chapter on alternative facts, and you talk about that moment where Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump advisor during the White House, talked about alternative facts.And that resonated with you as somebody who grew up in the evangelical community, in your hometown of Kansas City and sort of had a falling out with that community.

And -- but I think the last few years have been something that have catalyzed a lot of conversations for many people with ties to that community about what it means to be evangelical. And the thing that I remember so well is the emphasis on, sort of, building a narrative and in many ways sticking to it.You know, I write about it. an entire curriculum in my Christian school that many evangelical kids grew up with in Christian schools or homeschools or even in their youth groups and churches centered around the idea that, you know, the earth was 6,000 to 10,000 years old. And not all evangelicals believe that, I should say, but there's kind of an entire intellectual infrastructure that backs up a narrative.
