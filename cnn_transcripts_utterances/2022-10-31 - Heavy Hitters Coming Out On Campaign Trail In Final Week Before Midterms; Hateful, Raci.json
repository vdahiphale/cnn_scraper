And joining us now is Miles Taylor, former chief- of-staff to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Also back is Ashley Allison. [23:29:55] You know, I really wanted to cover this story in part because we oftentimes look to the U.K. or our European allies in some respect to draw a comparison about what might be happening here in the United States.

He's the first Brazilian president in their history to have been booted from office, so they are probably digesting this. And I think the good news is most of his allies have come out and since congratulated Lula on winning the presidency. But this is still big concern.

They talk about these places like they're terrible places. Well, why are you letting basically Bolsonaro's twin brother do exactly what Bolsonaro is doing down there?So, this is the thing about Republicans who support Trump. They need to pay attention to these authoritarian regimes because what they do is heighten people's anxiety with these populist tendencies, sort of promising them this eutopia, and we all know that's not possible. So, I think, let's back up here for a second. Like you alluded to earlier, they're going to -- what is going to happen here is Bolsonaro is going to fight the process.
