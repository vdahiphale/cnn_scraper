Bone chilling arctic air grips much of the U.S. as millions of Americans are traveling home from the Thanksgiving holiday.Plus, shocking stowaway, how a woman evaded multiple airport screening checkpoints and made it on board a Paris bound Delta flight. And just a day after an organic egg recall, the FDA is investigating yet another salmonella outbreak. We'll tell you what to check for in your refrigerator. Hello, everyone, and thank you so much for joining me this weekend after Thanksgiving holiday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. We begin this holiday weekend with ferocious winter weather trapping residents and travelers in parts of the Great Lakes region and leaving more than 6 million people under winter weather alerts. Just a look at this highway in Pennsylvania. Cars already getting stranded in near whiteout conditions there. The National Weather Service is advising people to delay their travel, if possible, as up to five feet of lake effect snow will paralyze some areas. And on top of all of that, a bone chilling blast of arctic air is bringing below freezing temperatures to nearly 70 percent of the U.S. population over the next few days. That deep freeze is being felt from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast. Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is here with the latest forecast. I mean, this is dangerous weather, if not very uncomfortable.",

      "sentences": "Especially when you're talking about that amount of snow. When you're talking four to six feet in a short period of time, there are stretches of Interstate 90 that are shut down right now between Buffalo and Cleveland, and for good reason, because it's simply whiteout conditions. And it's not the only area. Even portions -- look at this. This is Blue Mountain Lake, New York. Now, I looked at the same camera yesterday, and I want you to know there is a lake in the background. You could see it yesterday. You can't see it today. And it's because of how thick the snow is coming down, but also the fog that's in some of these areas. So imagine driving through similar conditions. It makes it extremely difficult. You've got all of these lake effect bands coming down across portions of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. The heaviest snow at the time is coming down now across portions of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. And that's where we're likely going to see some of the highest accumulations when this is all said and done, could be four to even six feet -- again, not inches, feet of snow total.You also have an entirely separate system down here that's causing some winter weather advisories in place across the Ohio and mid- Mississippi Valley. That includes St. Louis and also Louisville, Kentucky. Those areas could see two to five inches. So again, not necessarily as high as the other areas we're seeing, but still impactful if you have to drive through those areas today to maybe either get home or drive to or from wherever you need to go. Overall, most of the areas up along the Great Lakes, that's where you're going to see those higher totals. Keep in mind for some of these areas, we've already had two feet of snow come down. Now we could be adding another several feet on top of that. And some of these snow shower bands are coming down at two to four inches an hour. So even if you have plows out there trying to clear it, it makes it very difficult for them to get back to these same spots so quickly. The reason you have this lake effect snow is you have those warm lakes and the cold air, at least you know by comparison speaking. I'm not saying the lakes themselves are warm, but you have that very cold air over top of it that creates the lake effect snow. But even in other areas where you don't have the snow, you still have that bone-chilling cold. Look at Minneapolis, for example. The actual temperature right now is seven degrees. It feels like minus eight with the wind chill. The Minneapolis National Weather Service office telling folks, get ready. This is about as warm as it's going to be all day, OK. Chicago, currently 17, but it feels like only three degrees. But this isn't just a northern problem. All of these areas you see here in blue are expected to have those temperatures at or below freezing as we go through the next several days, and that does include, Fred, even some areas as far south as the gulf coast.",

If you bought a flight through an online travel agency, sometimes your information isn't given to the airline. So the airline can't contact you to let you know that it's delayed. So go in and make sure that your flights are still on time and that the airline has your information.And just know the Department of Transportation has new rules that went into effect in October. If your domestic flight is delayed by three hours or more, you can cancel for a full refund. You don't have to take a voucher. You can just try travel again, and that's six hours for internationally. So for some families who might say, you know what, we're going to put our travel on hold this week. At least knowing that you can get a full refund is peace of mind. But otherwise, I use an app called Flighty. Flighty, actually, will alert you usually before your airline does if there's a delay. I will say one thing, though, even if your flight is delayed, you still have to go to the airport and go to the gate, because I had an experience recently where the airline un-delayed my flight and it went out without me because I thought it was still delayed. So still go to the airport if you intend to fly.",

Now, American Airlines this holiday season is rolling out a program where they will -- they will buzz you in line if you try to board too early, because the airlines also want you to get their credit cards and to pay for that priority boarding. My best tip is just try to get to the gate early, get in line wherever you're boarding is, and honestly, even if you fly once or twice a year, getting that airline co-brand credit card, you might get -- you're going to get more miles than it is the annual fee for several years, and you'll get priority boarding.

They have a little tab called \"explore\" where you can put in your home airport and then say you're open to going anywhere in the Caribbean. You just want to get away for these certain dates. It will show you a map, or Europe, say. Europe's a great time over New Year's. Its off peak. Hotels are cheap. You can actually just put in your home airport or just put in anywhere, and it will show you a map of all the cheapest flights.

Oh, and I left out Doug Burgum, Donald Trump's selection to lead the Interior Department.But look, as you mentioned, Fred, this is a very important moment in their relationship. And it does come just days after Donald Trump had issued that threat to both Mexico and Canada, saying that on his first day in office, one of the first executive orders that he wants to sign would be a massive hike on tariffs -- in tariffs on goods coming from both Canada and Mexico. He threatened a 25 percent tariff and said that that was mainly if the countries did not do more to crack down on drugs and crime, and also more migrants coming over both the northern and southern borders. Now, this is actually something that we heard the prime minister address yesterday in an unrelated press conference before he flew to Florida to meet with Donald Trump. Take a listen to what he said.

A source familiar with the call said that it was a productive conversation. And then this morning as well, we saw Trudeau leaving his hotel in West Palm Beach.
