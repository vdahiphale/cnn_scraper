He's reportedly asked members of his own party to block a bipartisan deal and save it as a campaign issue, request that is seen as divisive, even among his fellow Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): We have a catastrophe at our southern border. It is because the border has been deliberately opened wide that we see the terrific horrors that are taking place across our country right now. Mr. President, it says very clearly you have all the tools and the executive authority necessary to reverse the catastrophe that you have created. SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump.
