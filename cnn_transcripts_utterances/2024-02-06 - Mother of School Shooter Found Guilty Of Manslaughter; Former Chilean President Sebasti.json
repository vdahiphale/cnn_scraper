Two landmarkdecisions in two very different cases, each potentially massive consequences here in the United States and beyond. In Michigan, the mother of a school shooter has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a case that's the first of its kind. And in Washington, judges have rejected former President Donald Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution for his behavior after the 2020 election. And we do want to begin this hour in Michigan. An historic ruling in the trial for the mother of a school shooter. Just moments ago, Jennifer Crumbley was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Her son, Ethan killed four students in a Michigan High School in 2021. The trial is testing the limits of who is responsible for a mass shooting. Jennifer Crumbley is due to be sentenced in April and her husband is scheduled to go on trial next month. A father of one of the victims spoke to reporters just after the verdict. Listen.

Most states who are not controlled byRepublican legislatures and the NRA are passing gun laws that require that guns be secured within a home, and that was passed by Michigan after this event took place, not before. In fact, measures like that had been fought and defeated in the Michigan legislature for, I don't know, the last 10 years or so. So this brought it to bear. Miss McDonald made it clear that this was her issue, and that's what she was going to go forward with. As it relates to its long lasting effect outside of that, there is a real danger here that it sets a precedent persuasively and also gives aid and comfort to those prosecutors who would like to find parents responsible for every act that is done by their children for just being bad parents. That is you should have seen this coming, so therefore you are negligent, therefore you are responsible. And we have an adage in the law that says you're not responsible for somebody else's acts. I think that this has far-reaching effects to go beyond firearms. It can go to knives you have in your home, it can go to a baseball bat that you didn't secure and one of your kids got to beat somebody up with it. There are so many other things that come to play here that I'm not sure that you can stop this slippery slope from becoming even more slippery and people going down, and I think parents really are going to have to be concerned about what they do, how they deal with their kids, and how they are responsible even for things that are peripherally present and they don't see it.",

Now Pinera served two terms as president. The first one was from 2010 through 2014, during which the world saw the rescue of 33 trapped Chilean miners. His other term was from 2018 through 2022. I want to bring in Patrick Oppmann. I mean, Patrick, let's first get to this incident. Obviously, a helicopter crash. I do understand it was a small helicopter, other people on board.

We don't know their condition just yet, but apparently, this small helicopter that Sebastian Pinera, not only a two- term president of Chile, but one of Chile's richest men crashed apparently in bad weather earlier today in the south of Chile. This of course, comes on the heels of already another terrible tragedy that the country is carrying out a national mourning for, these wildfires that we've been reporting on that have killed over 100 people. So of course, a tragedy on top of a tragedy that is affecting all Chileans. You know, Sebastian Pinera was not only the president of Chile, but he was on the site of that rescue of those 33 Miners. He was following it hour by hour. He would congratulate each miner when they were pulled from that mine. I remember covering it and seeing him around the clock. He was there following the rescues minute by minute and that was one of Chile's proudest moments. As he came back in a second term, a very different mandate as protests took the streets -- protesters took the streets of Chile and the government, his government was criticized for their crackdown, a heavy- handed crackdown on those protests. So Chileans already mourning from this terrible wildfire, the worst wildfires in this country's history, are now mourning a president that, you know, depending on where you are in the political spectrum, and people have very different views of him. But certainly Chileans are mourning a president, a two-term president that just, you know, year-and-a-half ago was president of this country, and now has died tragically in a helicopter crash, and apparently was the only fatality of that crash, and certainly is compounding the tragedy that all Chileans are feeling right now.",

Trump is accused of falsifying records in connection to hush money payments to a porn star, Stormy Daniels. That trial is set to start in New York next month.

It means what? It is going to keep presidents in line so that they won't do bad things. They address the question in terms of saying that this is necessary to promote the structure of democracy in terms of holding former presidents accountable. On every score, they addressed all the points that the Trump campaign, rather than Trump legal team made and rejected it. So it's a pretty powerful opinion at this point.

It is going to take four justices to agree to want to hear thecase, and I have a suspicion that the Supreme Court may choose not to take this case, because this is an unusual appeal. Generally, when you're facing a criminal trial, you can't appeal the case until after a verdict has been rendered. What happened here was something called an interlocutory appeal, basically, an appeal pending a trial court. What I think the Supreme Court might do at this point is to say, we're going to send this back to District Court. District Court, hold the trial, if in fact, Trump is acquitted, then we don't have to deal with this issue. If he is convicted, then we may take this up at a later point. So I think the Supreme Court has an out on this, but I also think what the Trump campaign and what the Trump legal team has to worry about is if they keep pushing this stuff, pushing it far enough, they might push some of these cases to where they're actually taking place starting, or potentially rendering verdicts in October. And we always like to talk about what the October surprise, the October surprise could very well be with just within a matter of a couple of weeks of the election, a verdict comes down.

We know that the Princess of Wales left in that manner from hospital. That state limousine is designed to be very clear, so you can see exactly who is inside and how they feel. So that was intentional. And I think the message there was, within himself, he feels well enough to go out in public. It is just the doctors are saying, that's not safe, considering your current treatment to be amongst crowds, and you might pick something up. So I think that was one part of the messaging. The other side of it, we're seeing him fly off with a helicopter off to Sandringham, to his country estate. Just the fact that he's able to leave London, away from the specialist hospitals is very telling in itself as well. You know, this is how the family communicates in many ways. It is through vision, without necessarily saying something and backing it up with statements, so I think a very clear messaging today. And you know, I think there may come a point where King Charles does reveal exactly what type of cancer he has got. It has been made clear to me, it's not necessarily the rule anymore, that you keep these things private. He wants to -- he has worked with cancer charities before. He has raised awareness of cancer. This is a big opportunity for him to do so again, and show that their head of state is suffering from a similar illness that other people suffer from, so I think that's a watch.",

But as an advocate of gun violence prevention, as a leader in this movement and as a mom, I celebrate this verdict because ultimately what it stands for is the idea that parents have a unique role in the life of their children. And it's appropriate that in this instance and for all parents there is the real risk that if you are facilitating access to a firearm for your child, you can be held criminally responsible for that. And clearly, when I heard that CNN reported what the juror said who deliberated, that's right. What she's saying is that Jennifer Crumbley was in a unique position and had access to that firearm before her son obtain that weapon. And across this country, I hope it also really points the obvious fact here if you look from Columbine forward at the tragedy of school shootings in this country, about 76 percent of all school shooters get their firearm from a home. We have more guns than people in this country. So the message that I hope most Americans take away is that safe storage is mandatory if you want to protect your own family, others coming in contact to your home and stop violence like school shootings from happening, safely store firearms in the home.

But ultimately the principle that parents can be held liable for the actions of their child and for providing access to a firearm, I think will have an important message to households across this country. My friend Kristen Song has been working day and night to pass laws like Ethan's Law, which stands for the principle that safe storage should be required if you have a child with access to firearms in a home. And I hope that Congress also takes that up. I think we have to use all of the tools at our disposal to end family fire. And it's not just school shootings it's also that you have an appreciably increased risk of suicide in your home if you have access to loaded and unsecured firearms. And eight kids a day are killed or injured with guns in their own home. The number one risk factor of that is whether or not your firearm is safely stored.

You have reports that Adam Neumann's lawyers sent a letter to WeWork last nighturging them to engage with his takeover bid and saying he has this partnership going with Third Point, but Third Point told me today that again, while they've had preliminary conversations with Neumann about his ideas for WeWork, they have yet to commit any funding to such a deal. WeWork also was pushing back on the idea that they were going to play ball with Adam Neumann today. They told me that while they regularly receive expressions of interests from third parties, and I'm quoting here, \"We continue to believe that the work we're currently doing, addressing our unsustainable rent expenses and restructuring our business will ensure WeWork as best positioned as an independent and sustainable company into the future.\" So WeWork clearly not playing ball here. And look, even if it did, it's really WeWork's creditors at this point who Adam Neumann would have to convince to be on board with this deal. And I think that's probably going to be tricky for him given his controversial history with the company.",

Meta says it's planning to label images created by AI. Now images created by tools from Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutter Shock -- Shutter Stock, pardon me, are to be included. Meta says it's also working on new standards for pictures made by AI like adding invisible metadata or, there you go, those watermarks. So they can easily be identified. AI generated content has already begun to muddy the waters of the 2024 election cycle. Marietje Schaake is the international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center. And she joins me now from California. And happy to have your expertise on this. I'm going to ask you straight up. Can this work? Because some in the tech universe have already suggested that AI will outsmart this attempt in order to label AI.",

But we should not have any illusions about the ecosystem within which political ads, manipulated ads, AI generated ads, or content will be shared. And if you look at a social media platform like Facebook, then the targeting aspects, so those features that help advertisers reach their audiences on the basis of very detailed data profiles are essential to the harms that can be done. And so knowing that the content is created with artificial intelligence or generative artificial intelligence is, you know, a step in the right direction, but it's by no means everything that a social media platform like Facebook can do.",

I'm currently no longer in a regulatory -- I work at Stanford University, but indeed, as you mentioned, the European Union has taken the lead with binding AI legislation that will come into force, but only after this election year, and so we do have to look at a mix of measures that can be taken quickly enough for this year that will see an unprecedented amount of people around the world going to the polls with generative AI truly being a wildcard. And it's important that we understand the technology for what it is, not to underestimate it, but also not to overestimate it so that people begin to believe that they cannot trust anything anymore. And that the whole hype around generative AI is distracting from, you know, the very surveillance capitalism as Shoshana Zuboff calls the business model of these social media platforms that actually allow for the very targeted advertisements in the first place.",
