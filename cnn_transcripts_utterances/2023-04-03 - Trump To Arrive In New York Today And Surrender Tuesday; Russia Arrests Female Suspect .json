Russia detains a woman in connection with the bombing death of a prominent military blogger. OPEC and its allies unexpectedly cut more than a million barrels of oil from the market. And Chelsea Football Club sacks its manager Graham Potter after just six months in the job. Well, security is tight in New York ahead of former U.S. President Donald Trump's expected arrival just hours from now. This is a live look at his personal plane on the tarmac in West Palm Beach in Florida. Sometime in the next two hours. He is expected to board that plane and fly to Manhattan. After arriving is scheduled to travel to his New York building, Trump Tower. Tomorrow Tuesday, Mr. Trump is set to be arraigned in Manhattan on criminal charges. Those charges tied to alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Well, outside that courtroom security is tight. Secret Service, New York police and court officers coordinating security arrangements. Some point today the judge hearing the case should rely on requests from media outlets including CNN to allow cameras in the courtroom and to unseal the indictment. Meanwhile, a new CNN poll released within the past hour shows that 60 percent of Americans questioned approve of the decision to indict Donald Trump. Let's get to it. CNN's Kristen Holmes is near Trump's residence at Mar-a- Lago in Florida. At this point, his critics, of course, say that Trump is using indictment to his own benefit. How? Explain if you will.",

This is obviously a legal fight, but they are looking at ways to tout this and take advantage of it. We know that he had spent the weekend calling and texting advisors, allies, Republicans in general, talking about how he believes this is a political win. He said that he -- that new poll numbers out he talked about his fundraising. And note that the campaign said they raised $5 million in the 45 -- 48 hours after the indictment was released. So, that is how they are trying to build on this. They do believe, of course, that it could help them with fundraising, that it could help him politically. Now not everybody is so sure. They do believe it generally consensus of those people around him that this will help them in a contested primary. But a lot of questions still about what this will mean for him politically, if he does get the nomination and in a general election.",

It also allows the Kremlin to attack or criticize the opposition to the war. And then also there's a third, which, of course, is they can criticize Navalny and his movement. But I think, you know, there's another theory, of course, there are many about this, is that it could be an indication of this internal fighting among various groups who either are against the war, but maybe extremely against the war, and there could be some internal fighting.
