And in Pennsylvania, it's a close contest between candidates Mehmet Oz, a Republican and Democratic lieutenant governor John Fetterman. Georgia's candidates met in a lively debate last night. Democratic senator Raphael Warnock faced off against Republican Herschel Walker after weeks of bombshell allegations leveled at the former football star. CNN's Even McKend has more.

He also went out west to California, Los Angeles and Irvine area before coming up here to Portland. Notably, two of the states that he skipped on this western string are Nevada and Arizona where two of -- this year's most contested senate races are underway with Senator Mark Kelly and also Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. The White House has been very keen and aware and careful to try to not to nationalize some of those races as the president's approval rating is still sitting around 44 percent. And both of those candidates are facing tough reelection fights.

And the key question is whether they can continue to do so in the remaining weeks through Election Day. I mean, if you look at these key senate races, polls that have come out in the last 10 days or so, everywhere from New Hampshire and Pennsylvania to Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, in all of those states.Even Colorado, a state that it is more democratic than any of the ones I just mentioned. In all of those days, Biden's approval rating is stuck at around 40 percent. We don't have many examples in recent political history of Senate candidates from the president's party winning a state when his approval rating is that low. For example, in 2018, Republicans lost every state where Trump was at 48 percent or below. And in 2010, Democrats lost 13 of the 15 states in the Senate, where Obama is at 47. But those Democrats are exceeding Biden. And the question is, can they continue to do so or escape that undertow? The president's real capacity and which has been successful, I think, is to change the basic frame of the election from a referendum solely on how he and Democrats are doing into something much more of a choice. And that's a big reason why Democrats are still in a fight -- have a fighting chance of so many of these states despite Biden's weak numbers.",

If you look at where we are, Republicans have a very good shot to win in Nevada.But that's maybe it in terms of beating seats -- taking seats the democrats now hold to offset that, the Democrats' best chances to win Pennsylvania. And what's striking is that in Pennsylvania, John Fetterman is running a little better than many democrats are with blue collar white voters who have been of course drifting Republican for year -- for years, but also are especially exposed to and squeezed by inflation. So I'm suspecting that we're going to see a very meat and potatoes argument from the president. They're focusing on the steps that they have taken in the climate bill, the chips bill and the infrastructure bill to promote domestic manufacturing, you know, kind of plant openings that we saw in Ohio a few weeks ago with Intel.

Now if it is the case of these four men, they were all friends, as you mentioned it, all between the ages of 29 and 32.And they were believed to be hanging out on Sunday night, all of them with their bikes, at least two of them had their cell phones on them. So what police did was track that cell phone data and try to figure out where they were or where they could have been. They searched the areas where the cell phone data took them to. Unfortunately, that did not end up in any sort of way that helped the investigation, at least as far as we know. They were not found in those areas where the cell phone data tracked them. And according to police, in fact, the river where these four bodies were found was not in the area where the cell phone data appeared to show them to be. So it could have been that either they were taken somewhere else, or they left their phone somewhere. Of course, all of this is unknown. At some point though, those phones either were turned off or lost power. But what happened on Friday was that someone saw something suspicious near the river and told police about this. When they went to the river they in fact found these four bodies, the families of the four men that were missing were notified about these bodies because of course, everyone was going to assume that these four bodies were in fact, the men who were reported missing.

Then in 2020, that percentage dropped to 0.2 percent. In 2021, it dropped to 0.1 percent. And now, it's up again around 3.3 percent.
