I'm Wolf Blitzer in New York.We're waiting for President Joe Biden to make a statement any moment now on the death of former president Jimmy Carter. We're going to bring that to you live once the president starts speaking. The American flag, by the way, is flying at half-staff right now over at the White House. You can see it there. That's where President Carter held sway in the Oval Office from 1977 until 1981. The 39th president of the United States was surrounded by family as he passed away earlier today at his home in Plains, Georgia, at the age of 100. During his single four-year term in office, Carter forged a rare and enduring peace deal between Israel and Egypt, formalized relations between the United States and Communist China, and put human rights right at the forefront of U.S. foreign policy. But his presidential career was also four years long -- was only four years long as voters blamed him for the serious inflation at home during that time, and the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran, which ended just one day after Jimmy Carter left office. But for the next four decades after leaving office, he changed the world view of what American presidents do after they leave the White House, blazing a path forward that has become a shining example of doing good for other people here in the United States and indeed around the world. Here's a closer look back at President Carter's truly extraordinary life and career. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIMMY CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We just want the truth again. BLITZER (voice-over): Jimmy Carter was elected president barely two years after the law-breaking and cover-ups of the Watergate scandal forced President Richard Nixon to resign.

It flowed from his faith and the principles of his faith. And he acted on that after he left the presidency, certainly during the presidency and after the presidency.So, you know, I mean, into his 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s, he was traveling the world trying to resolve conflicts. He helped eradicate the Guinea worm in Africa, saved countless lives by doing that. You know, as I said in that tweet, you know, was a human rights advocate to the end, sometimes to the consternation of policy makers here. But he held the U.S. to the principles that he articulated in that tape you just ran, that the United States should stand for human rights in the world. And that continues to be a big debate. Remember, he followed Richard Nixon, who's a real politick, placed human rights way down on the list of priorities. And Carter changed that. And he lived those principles in his life, and he stood up for human rights around the world. He was incredibly impactful, which is why he won the Nobel Prize well after he left the presidency. And, you know, so I think as you think of Jimmy Carter, you can't just think of the four years he was president in which he did it -- he accomplished some major things. He also presided over some major, major problems. But when you look at the totality of his life, uh, you can think of few, if any Americans who have lived as remarkable a life of service.",

Every president respects what it's like to go through crisis as a president. And Carter had his share. Obama had his share.But he also had enormous respect for what Carter did after the presidency and the impact that he had around the world. You know, Carter could be -- every president probably prefers that former presidents keep their counsel more than not, because they're going to be heard.

But in prizing human rights, civil rights, the dignity of people, the need to resolve conflicts in the world.I mean, the Camp David accord remains one of the great diplomatic achievements.
