The Ukrainian President said he believes the conflict could end as soon as next year. And tonight's meeting comes just over one month before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump moves back into the White House, January the 20th. Of course, Trump has pledged to bring a swift end to the conflict, but there is growing concern that he could pull U.S. support for Kyiv. And if that happens, Zelenskyy may be forced to make painful concessions to Moscow. We now turn to Moscow and the aftermath of a deadly blast that killed senior Russian General Igor Kirillov. One day later, a suspect from Uzbekistan is in custody. The 29-year-old man seen here -- you're looking at him there, has been identified by Russian state media. They published a video in which the suspect appears to confess to planting the bomb. But it is not clear if that confession was made under duress. Russian investigators say the man was recruited by Ukraine's security service. Our Frederik Pleitgen has more, and we want to warn you, some of the video in this report is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Russian state media has named the suspect that the Russian investigative committee says has been arrested as 29-year-old Uzbek citizen Akhmad Kurbanov. Now, the Russian authorities are saying that he is suspected in connection with the assassination of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who of course, was killed when leaving his apartment yesterday by a bomb blast. And the Russian investigators are saying that they believe that Kurbanov was recruited by Ukraine's Intelligence service, the SBU. They say that he was told to get an electric scooter and then was given a homemade bomb and parked the scooter with the bomb in front of the door that later, the General, together with an aide, would come out of. Now, as part of this plot, the Russians say that Kurbanov also got a car- sharing car -- rented a car-sharing car and parked it outside of the door of that building as well. They say that, that car was outfitted with a camera that had a live feed that went straight to the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine where it was monitored by Ukrainian security services, and when the General left his building, that is when the bomb was detonated. Obviously, General Kirillov was killed yesterday when he left his apartment building. That blast seemed to be massive, when we were on the scene, we saw that even in the houses adjacent to where this blast took place, that windows had been shattered there. Russian politicians, obviously irate about all of this, the Kremlin came out and commented on all of this for the first time today. The Kremlin spokesman saying that all of this shows that Kyiv, as he put it, does not shy away from terrorist methods. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One survivor says the devastating scene speaks for itself. Turning to Syria, life is slowly returning to normal after the abrupt collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime. For the first time since his fall more than a week ago, a domestic flight departed from Damascus airport. Also today, a U.N. special envoy called for free and fair elections in Syria, saying there's a lot of hope that the country can now move toward democracy. The U.N. says about a million Syrian refugees are expected to return in the first half of next year. But of course, many challenges remain, including a tense situation in a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli troops moved into the area after Assad's regime fell and have resisted calls from the U.N. Secretary General to withdraw. Well, with all manner, of course, of geopolitical issues, my next guest writes that U.S. President Joe Biden in many ways has given the incoming President a gift. Quote, \"Donald Trump is a lucky man. The combination of allied courage and American support has inflicted serious losses on America's enemies and created a serious strategic openings for the United States. The Iranian Axis of Resistance is a state -- in a state of collapse. Russia is facing an economic crisis and is chewing through men and materiel in Ukraine at an unsustainable rate.\" Those words from David French; an opinion columnist with the \"New York Times\". And David, welcome to the show, and we did just there mentioned just the opening of your article from December 12th for the \"New York Times\". And there was Ukraine, Iran, but I think it's important to remind our viewers right around the world, and we mentioned Gaza, but there's also the Houthis in Yemen. There's a war in Sudan.

It's facing a crisis in material on the battle front. Now, of course, Ukraine is under intense pressure as well, but these developments create strategic opportunities. There's absolutely a lot of risk. Any time you have hot wars going, there is an enormous amount of risk.

And there's indication that Turkey might be assembling forces to take on American allied, Kurdish forces in northern Syria. There are -- there is more than one faction in play. You have Israel bombing Syrian military sites to weaken Syria. So, there are a lot of factors in play. And this is exactly the wrong time to lean out of the international scene. And so, again -- once again, you've got another situation just like in Ukraine, where there's an opportunity and a risk side-by-side. The opportunity is to lean in, to re-order at least parts of the Middle East so that the Iranian influence is waning for a generation. The risk is you lean out and let chaos take its place with unpredictable results. And so, time and again, you have a dangerous situation where current American policy has created opportunities, but Iran, alongside the opportunities are risks, and unfortunately, a lot of Trump's instincts, which are isolationist, which are to pull away a lot of those instincts are exactly wrong for this moment.

Webrought you that news at the top of the hour. He said they're laser focused on inflation, said economy remained strong. He said inflation has eased, but remains elevated above the bank's, of course, 2 percent target. He did say we're not on any preset course, which gives them sort of signal over the next year and how they may move. But he did say that over the last year, this is a third rate cut since September. They've lowered policy roughly by 1 percent. If we just leave that there, I want to show you before we go, the stock market, because at the top of the hour, we have brought you the breaking news. And just to point out, this is very much priced in this cut. The numbers was on the green. Can we bring up the -- there we go. Now, they've turned, we're seeing the Dow Industrials down half a percent, NASDAQ also down seven-tenths and S&amp;P 500 down half a percent. So, although it's priced in, the markets will be listening to Jerome Powell right now and the questions he'll take after that for some sort of signal of how the Fed may move next year. Although, he did say we're not in a preset course it's what he says and it's kind of reading a bit of the tea leaves as how he may move and those pressures over inflation you know, and what that may mean. So, we're keeping an eye on those markets to see how they move. But -- and we'll keep an ear out, of course, for Jerome Powell.

I want to stay in the United States, because the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments from TikTok next month over its potential ban. Justices will decide whether a controversial ban on the social media app violates the First Amendment. And this adds a major case to the docket just before President-Elect Donald Trump takes office.

The nine justices have agreed to hear the company's challenge to a federal law that would be Ban it from the United States. The court will hear the case on January 10th, and the justices will really be racing against the clock. Under the disputed federal law. TikTok could be banned in America on January 19th. The controversy traces to last April when Congress passed and Joe Biden signed a ban on the popular social media platform. The law was responding to years of concern in Washington that TikTok's Chinese parent company posed a national security risk. The government argues that China could covertly manipulate the app to affect content and also to access user's data. TikTok Incorporated is an American company, but the ultimate parent is ByteDance, which has Chinese ownership. The TikTok platform would be banned in the U.S. unless it is divested of that Chinese ownership. If that doesn't happen, TikTok would lose the opportunity to be available through platforms and apps here. TikTok has argued that the law unfairly singles it out and violates speech rights. The company lost in an important federal court below, an appellate court, which said the federal government had made a good case on national security grounds. We'll see whether the federal government can do the same before the justices. It will be the last major argument by the Biden administration at the High Court. Again, the law is set to take effect in about a month on January 19th, which is a day before Donald Trump's inauguration and his return to the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The quake caused a network outage and damaged many buildings including the U.S. embassy. Rescue efforts are continuing and a state of emergency is in place in the worst impacted areas. Authorities and aid workers in the French territory of Mayotte are working around the clock to keep the peace and prevent the spread of disease after the worst cyclone to hit the region in at least 90 years. At least 31 people are dead and more than 1,400 injured, and that is according to a local mayor. But those numbers could rise significantly as crews move further into areas blocked by debris. Much needed supplies began arriving on Tuesday. The French government expects half of the islands water supplies will be restored soon, and nearly all of it by early next week. We will, of course, stay across that story for you. Now to Ghana, where the Supreme Court has today rejected two challenges to an anti LGBT bill. It is one of Africa's most restrictive pieces of legislation, increasing a crackdown on the rights of LGBT people, and it will see anyone promoting or indeed supporting LGBT identities or activities receiving a prison sentence of up to five years. The bill was approved unanimously back in February, but President Nana Akufo-Addo has delayed signing it into law while these challenges were being filed. Our Larry Madowo has more for you.

But one of the lawmakers who was the biggest supporters of this bill helped bring it to Parliament. Sam George tweeted that it is done. To God be the glory. Gay sex in Ghana was already punishable with up to three years in prison, but this makes it even harder to even identify as LGBTI in Ghana, it criminalizes the promotion of LGBT rights in the country, and that is why it's getting a lot of criticism. However, the finance ministry in Ghana had already warned that if this were to become law Ghana risk losing out on $3.8 billion from the World Bank, another $3 billion from the IMF. These are funds that the country badly needs for an economic revival. But for the men on the street, they think it needs to become law. Larry Madowo, CNN, Nairobi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
