      "sentences": "Welcome back.This morning Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas is threatening more legal action in a closely watched abortion case. In a new letter Paxton says that Kate Cox, the 20-week pregnant woman seeking an abortion, does not qualify for an exemption to the state's strict six- week ban and threatens to prosecute her doctor. This is despite a judge's order allowing Cox to end her pregnancy. Cox and her lawyers have argued that her baby, who has been diagnosed with a fatal disorder, is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb, and that continuing with the pregnancy, quote, \"puts Cox at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and her future fertility.\" And that's key because Texas' abortion ban allows exceptions to save the life of a pregnant woman. Cox wrote this about her decision in \"The Dallas Morning News.\" \"An abortion was not something I ever imagined I would need. I just never thought I'd be in the situation I'm in right now, 20 weeks pregnant with a baby that won't survive and could jeopardize my health and a future pregnancy.\" And here is what she told NBC \"Nightly News.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And let's begin with, you won, but you also say that this cannot be the new normal. MOLLY DUANE, SR. STAFF ATTORNEY, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: That's right. I mean, I want to start with just how outrageous it was that we had to come to court in the first place so that Ms. Cox could essentially beg for her life and her future fertility. The reality is that 99 percent of pregnant people seeking abortion care for whatever reasons that they have are not going to be able to do the same. But what is even more stunning is what the attorney general's response has been, which is that not only is Ms. Cox not sick enough to get an abortion, she's not even sick enough to come to court, and - and we have right here an order, a duly enacted order, of a court of his state, of which he is an officer of that court, that he's saying he's just going to disregard.",

Your organization represents, for example, a group of 20 women who are seeking to get clarity on what the exceptions actually mean in the Texas law now. What does Kate's case mean for that? And I ask that also pointing to Ken Paxton's letter, another sentence that is so striking is he writes that this order from the court yesterday, quote, \"does not enjoin actions brought by private citizens.\" Remember, Texas has this unique law where private citizens can bring these cases.",

And the state of Texas is saying, this order from the court, which explicitly says that it applies to both the vigilante lawsuits under SB-8, and the, you know, severe penalties to physicians under the trigger ban, says to physicians and people in the state that the law doesn't mean anything.If the attorney general says it's so, he doesn't need to follow what a court of his own state, of which he is an officer and has taken an oath to uphold what it means. You know, I'm a lawyer, just like he is. And I took an oath to follow the laws of this country. And I am, frankly, stunned by what we are seeing out of Texas.",

The economy adding 199,000 new jobs last month. Slightly exceeding economists expectations. Let's get straight to CNN business correspondent Rahel Solomon to break down the numbers.

So, 199,000, Phil, as you pointed out.So, the expectation was 180,000, right? And that is pretty much in line with the decade before the pandemic. If you look at the prior two months, October actually remained at 150,000 jobs. September was revised down about 35,000 jobs. So, if you look at sort of where the jobs were added, these were industries like health care, they added jobs, government, manufacturing added jobs. Now, part of the boost this month is, of course, those striking workers that have - exactly, that have come off the payroll. So, you think about the auto workers, for example. You think about the actors who have come off the payrolls. So, that is sort of boosting the top line number. We did see some declines in retail trade. Wages increased. This is, of course, huge for the Fed. Wages increased on a monthly basis 0.4 percent. Unemployment, this is something that Citibank, for example, said is the most important aspect of this report. Unemployment edged down slightly. So, it went from 3.9 percent to 3.7 percent. And if you're thinking, well, I feel like I've heard you say that a lot over the last year, you have, because unemployment has been stuck in this range of about 3.4 to, let's call it, 3.9 for the last 18 months. So we're still in that range. But this is still a tight labor market. The Fed meets next week. The last I checked, the markets weren't super thrilled with this report. They actually dipped on this report. Yes, I mean, they're marginally lower. But this is a - this is a labor markets that is still tight, robust, but maybe not so hot, as you called it, Phil.",
