I'm Becky Anderson live for you from Doha in Qatar.A four-day truce between Israel and Hamas appears to be taking effect with plans for the first Israeli hostages to be released by the militant group later on today. And a CNN crew near the border with Gaza reports what sounded like Israeli artillery fire in the early minutes of the truth -- of the truce, but that subsided very quickly. Now, Qatar, where I am, which helped broker this deal, says the first 13 hostages from Israel are expected to be released at or around 4 p.m. local time today, about six hours from now. And Israel in turn has agreed to free 39. Palestinians held in Israeli jails today and dozens more over the coming days if Hamas keeps freeing the hostages it holds. Well the first aid shipments under this agreement, hundreds of trucks packed with food, medical supplies and, critically, fuel are scheduled to begin crossing into Gaza today as part of that deal. Let's bring in CNN's Eleni Giokos in Cairo. Eleni Giokos, we knew that there was an enormous convoy set up, including fuel trucks on the Egypt side of that border crossing. Do we know whether that convoy has begun crossing into Gaza at this point?",

      "sentences": "So this is what we have, that seven fuel trucks have now crossed into Gaza. They're on the Gaza side of the border which is really significant and I'll give you sort of the context of that in just a bit. But we also know that 208 trucks right now have also crossed into the Egypt side of the border where they are currently being checked. We've got to remember the logistical challenges with this because they've got to be inspected first. You have it going through x-rays and then they go to anothercheckpoint where the Israelis do another check before they can actually be deployed and distributed in Gaza. But the overall number is 130,000 liters of fuel as well as four gas trucks will be entering Gaza every single day, every single day as long as this truce holds up. 200 trucks of aid of medical supplies of food and water is the quota that is allowed. Now in order to make that happen, Becky, you've got to think about the logistical delays which we've seen time and time again playing out since this deal was struck to try and get more aid into Gaza over the past few weeks. And I'm going to refer to what the U.N.'s Martin Griffiths also said, that while they negotiate with Egypt as well as Israel on a day-to-day basis to get more trucks into Gaza, the final word, the final decision of how much gets in is in Israel's hands and has always been. Then in terms of the process, and we're speaking to Egyptian sources here, we also know that the delay really comes from the second checkpoint that is done by Israel. Well, the hope is that they'll be able to meet that 200 trucks per day quota, because we know that more aid definitely does need to go in under this agreement. Importantly, we've also seen some of those trucks, and we've got some footage for you. Some of the aid trucks that we saw entering, we saw banners up that says, Together for Humanity for our Brothers in Gaza. That's from some of the Egyptian humanitarian organizations sending goods in. Look, President Sisi, Egyptian President Sisi said that the Rafah border was never closed and that was just a really interesting comment that he said yesterday that they're willing to send as much in as possible. We also spoke to the Egyptian health minister who says they want more injured Palestinians but there's always delays in terms of getting people on a list. Injured Palestinians being evacuated, foreign nationals, dual passport holders being evacuated will still continue. So we will see a lot more action at the Rafah border over the next few days and frankly these aid trucks have been gathering at the border in Al Arish for many days now actually since Wednesday nights in anticipation for this truce. So I think everyone is on board ready and waiting to try and meet that quota that has been given to them. It's a window of opportunity to alleviate the humanitarian crisis that is playing out right now.",

Now, remember, there were 36 hospitals functioning in Gaza prior to the conflict, only 11 of them are functioning now.So we have to get -- we have to protect and stabilize the functioning of those facilities, get the supplies in. We're still continuing with medical evacuations from Northern Gaza because the hospitals there have stopped functioning and it's been such a difficult security environment with high levels of violence. Of course, as you mentioned, the fuel is, really, is the lifeline for the humanitarian operation. We've got to get those desalination plants working, the water treatment plants working, the hospital generators working, the ambulances working.

He said he was not yet ready to provide an update but would be able to do so once that first wave of hostages was released. Now the White House has been keenly focused on the implementation of this deal and one big question is whether any Americans would be included in that initial round of hostages that were released by Hamas.It is the White House's expectation that about three Americans would be part of this overall deal. That includes two women and that three- year-old Abigail Adan, whose parents were killed in the October 7th Hamas attack. The White House has a working list of who they will believe will be released on that first day, but it's unclear whether any Americans would in fact be released on Friday. President Biden said that he was keeping his fingers crossed that three-year-old Abigail Adan would be part of that list. Now the U.S. Is planning on notifying the host the families of the American hostages once they are departing Gaza. That's according to a U.S. Official. Essentially what needs to happen is an American official or a trusted third party needs to set eyes on these hostages and then at that point the U.S. would be prepared to notify these families. But President Biden and the White House is hopeful that this will move forward and that some hostages will be released starting Friday.

It's 10This truce started well into effect at seven. We did see some evidence of some activity for around the first sort of 15 minutes or so but it looks as if it's quiet. We have been told by the IDF quiet does not mean truce lull does not mean that Israeli soldiers will not be moving around on the ground. Of course there are thousands of them in Gaza City and in the north of the enclave now. They as far as the IDF are concerned are allowed to move around in this deal but hostilities must stop on both sides. Well, it was Qatar, of course, who played a key role in mediating this deal. And the lead negotiator told me that it took very intensive work to broker the release deal. CNN's Brian Todd now has more for you on how Qatar here, where I am, became an essential mediator in these prison deals. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A pivotal player in getting the hostages freed from Hamas captivity is a tiny emirate over a thousand miles away from Gaza, smaller than the state of Connecticut, with about a quarter of the population of New York City. Qatar, an oil-rich nation on a peninsula in the Persian Gulf, ruled by a 43-year-old Sheikh named Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who took over when his father abdicated 10 years ago.

A humanitarian response requires something that is efficient and it's not efficient because we like it. It's efficient because that's the only way to sustain the scale of need, a scale of aid that matches the needs that we are facing. We are anywhere farther from that, as you said earlier. And until we have all the actors agree of the necessity of this happening, we will have a continuously growing amount of risk and death in Gaza from health, from food, from lack of water illness and now the cold, the winter is also starting so people have left their home and they could not bring blankets or anything with them and they cannot find anywhere to purchase that locally.
