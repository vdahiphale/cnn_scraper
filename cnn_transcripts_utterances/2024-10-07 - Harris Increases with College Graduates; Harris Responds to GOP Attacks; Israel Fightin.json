That's three points higher than Joe Biden did four years ago. At six points higher than Hillary Clinton did eight years ago.The bottom line is this, Mr. Berman, the electorate is becoming more polarized along education and Democrats, at least among those with a college degree, are the beneficiaries of it.

An increasing share of the electorate, you know you go back 44 years ago, just 21 percent of the electorate had a college degree. You go back 24 years ago, 31 percent. You go back four years ago, you're up to 40 percent. This year it looks like a historically high proportion of the electorate, 41 percent will have a college degree.You know who those voters are. They're in the suburbs of places like Philadelphia, of Detroit. You go, obviously, to Madison, Wisconsin, right? A rising tide. More and more voters with a college degree. It's what flipped the great state of - part of what flipped the great state of Georgia, right? Those voters with a college degree in the suburbs of Atlanta. This is a big reason Kamala Harris is still in the race right now because even though she is losing a little bit of support among voters without a college degree, she's gaining rapidly among those with a college degree, specifically white voters with a college degree.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble, two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life.

They can't completely see the boat (ph).And it's the same thing with men, right? We have definitely seen this historic gender gap. Women are fired up to vote for Harris and Walz. Men, for whatever reason, are slightly less so, right? Obviously, again, there's a bit of a divide between whether you're a college educated man, if you're non-college, that's always been Trump's base. But, again, you cannot completely seed the vote. So, that's why you see her going to somewhat friendly interviewers, like Howard Stern. He's definitely a, you know, Harris supporter. He does not like Donald Trump anymore. And he's got his number a little bit because he, you know, knows him from way back, from the '80s and '90s in New York City. So, that makes a lot of sense why she would show up on his program.",

Twelve months later, 101 hostages, including Americans, are still being held hostage in Gaza. Health officials in Gaza say the subsequent war after that attack has left more than 41,000 Palestinians killed since the war began, though they do not make a distinction between civilians and combatants.CNN's Erin Burnett is live in Tel Aviv, has been following all of this for us.

There's also anger and outrage at the fact that some of - many of those hostages are still in Gaza. Ninety-seven of those hostages that you mentioned still known to be there who were actually taken on October 7th. And right now it's unclear. And, in fact, we're hearing that the Israeli government has less intelligence on the status of those hostages and where they are as every day passes. Up to a third or half of them may already be dead. That is what causes so much of the outrage here as Israel is on a knife's edge in this ongoing war. Now on multi-fronts.Just moments ago, more explosions in Beirut. The IDF operating along that northern border. Also today saying that they are operating with, quote/unquote, great force in the area of northern Gaza, where they have been engaging in mass evacuations throughout the day. You know, Kate, we were up along that northern border. And here, you know, they've already been alerts for incoming rockets today. That's - that's the life here that people are living. But look at what they're living in Beirut, the constant mass explosions. And we saw what appeared to be some sort of munitions depot exploding overnight. And the Israeli soldiers on that border that we saw in the confrontation line, you hear the constant thud of artillery. You see outgoing Iron Dome perhaps defenses. And those soldiers who have come from Gaza up to the north now, tens of thousands of them, Kate, they are eager. There's really no other word to describe it. They are eager to go in. They made it very clear, they believe that this is a moment for them of destiny as they are fighting a war on so many fronts. And everyone is awaiting for when this decision will be in terms so what Israel will do on striking back. It could come as soon as tonight. What we're hearing from U.S. sources, Kate, is that Israel has a target list that is - obviously, it seems to be much more aggressive when it comes to regime members and nuclear targets than the United States might like. But I think the key thing to emphasize is that Israel expects, and Israel will receive, complete U.S. backing after it does whatever it is going to do. So, even if the U.S. doesn't like it, they're going to be there on the back end to defend Israel for the consequences of whatever this massive strike and this ongoing war will be, Kate.",
