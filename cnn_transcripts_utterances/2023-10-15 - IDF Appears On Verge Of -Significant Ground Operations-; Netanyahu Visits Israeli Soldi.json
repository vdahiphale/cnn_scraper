There are growing indications that an Israeli Military ground operation into Gaza could get underway at any moment. The U.S. is now sending a second carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, as well as additional fighter jets.The move is intended to deter Iran, Hezbollah and others from entering the conflict. Some 300,000 Israeli troops began massing on the Gaza border soon after last weekend's terror attacks. On Saturday, Israel declared that it's ready to open a new phase in the war with a focus on significant grounds operations. And earlier Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met soldiers on the frontlines offering words of support and telling them to be prepared. Palestinian authorities in Gaza say the death toll from the Israeli airstrikes is now more than 2200 including more than 700 children. According to the health ministry, 300 of those deaths happened in the past 24 hours. The majority were women and children. Elliott Gotkine is covering all the developments for us and joins us live from London. Good to have you with us, Elliot. So Israel has been striking Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas terror attack. It's already carried out some raids. What more can you tell us about this next stage of this war?",

As you say, it's really carried out a couple of raids, to carry out reconnaissance missions according to the IDF. But this ground invasion as and when it comes is expected now to be imminent.And that, of course, is one reason why it was telling Gazans in the northern part of the Gaza Strip specifically in Gaza City, to evacuate towards the south, to get out of harm's way in order to minimize civilian loss of life. Hamas, of course, which runs the Gaza Strip has been telling Gazans to ignore these Israeli warnings. But nevertheless, most of them have been erring on the side of believing the Israelis and moving towards the south. We have of course seen those reports of strikes hitting and some more civilians losing their lives as they've tried to move south. But the situation right now is that Israel is continuing to carry strikes, you know, just in the last few minutes we've been hearing more reports of strikes. It says overnight, it's been targeting command and control centers, anti-tank missile launchers, rocket launchers, and also command centers belonging to Islamic Jihad and also specific militants. It says that among its targets, which has succeeded in hitting overnight was the target of one of the commanders of the Hamas commando unit that it holds us principally responsible for that attack a week ago, just over a week ago.

Now we know that there are eight trucks to the Egyptian border crossing with the Gaza Strip, that are unable to get in just yet. And that is also kind of preventing the alleviation of the humanitarian situation.The World Health Organization, for example, saying that asking, you know, residents or people evacuating Gaza hospitals is equivalent to a death sentence in its word. So there is a growing concern not just from international aid organizations, but also from the international community about the unraveling humanitarian situation there. Linda .",

It's all part of a tidal wave of viral mis and disinformation circulating around the Israel-Hamas conflict. Adi Cohen works with Memetica, an online Threat Intelligence Service.

We are we have recruited several hundreds of thousands of soldiers of reservists some 300,000 rallying, many of them in the area of southern Israel, on the border with Gaza, in the anticipation and preparation, if the instructions from the government to mobilize into Gaza does come and we need to be prepared for that. KINKADE: Lieutenant Colonel, Israel has instructed residents in northern Gaza to evacuate, they were told they would have a safe passage for six hours.

And also it appears that they have booby trapped some of the roads in anticipation. And what we see and what we understand is that the people that were killed yesterday, in -- in a convoy going down was not a result of an IDF strike. So I would say first of all, our instructions to people to move south is in our policy and to differentiate between the people, the hostages of Hamas, the people of Gaza, and to -- to enable us to target Hamas, the terrorist organization that has used the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for this brutal massacre last Saturday.",

You know, there has been some skirmishes and exchanges and indeed, there has been mortar fire and rocket fire and anti-tank guided missile attacks against forces operating on the border.I would caution Hezbollah; look very closely of how we are dismantling Hamas. They need to be very, very cautious. With regard to Iran, I would say they have invested extensively in the network of terrorism, their proxies here on our border. So of course they're concerned.
