And President Biden said, but that would be wrong. And we the United States are not going to abandon the U.N. Charter. And what's been so inspiring over the past year and a half, as you've seen multiple votes in the U.N.

Azerbaijan has effectively blockaded the vital and only road from Armenia proper to the enclave through the Latin corridor.Russian peacekeepers there have not been effective in getting that humanitarian aid into enclave. This has brought about this hugely tense situation of spiking -- a spike in tensions and in the violence.

But just the opposite has happened. Whistle-blowers in a number of African countries have told CNN that the Kremlin is consolidating its power over Wagner's networks -- in the Central African Republic, in Sudan, in Libya and in Mali. And now that network has expanded further, this time into Chad. Chad has really been impacted by the fighting in neighboring Sudan. And yet, it's emerging as a key transit point for supplies to the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, part of an expansion of Russia's influence in Africa. Cross-referencing testimony from intelligence and military sources active in the region with satellite imagery, CNN has uncovered evidence that Wagner arms crossed through Chad within the last two weeks to get to an RSF military base in Sudan. If you look closely, you can see over a hundred vehicles including scores of trucks at the base, proof the supplies provided by Russia, Wagner continue.

Twitter had a subscription service before. People didn't pay.
