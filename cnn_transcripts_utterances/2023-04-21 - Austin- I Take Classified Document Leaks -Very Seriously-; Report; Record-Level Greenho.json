Now, the main way that women and pregnancies these days in the early stages is through medication abortion, as opposed to surgical abortions.So, if increased restrictions are put on this drug, or, you know, down the road after the merits of the controversy are heard even more restrictions are put on the drug than what's on the table right now, it would really undercut what the Supreme Court said that it -- this will be a state-to-state matter. So that's what we're looking at here. And just so people know, the Biden administration has asked that -- again, that all it needs to do is suspend the effect of the lower court orders so the case could play out on its merits. And we'll see whether they just give us a yes or no to that, or if they themselves, try to actually address the individual regulations, which, frankly, the Biden administration says would just create massive chaos in the country, Sara.",

This morning, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is trying to reassure allies after several U.S. classified documents were leaked online, many of which reveal details about military operations in Ukraine. Austin met with his counterparts from around the world at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to coordinate sending more aid to Ukraine. In his opening remarks, he acknowledged the severity of the document leak.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLYOD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: I take this issue very seriously. And we will continue to work closely and respectfully with our deeply valued allies and partners. As I've discussed this issue with our allies and partners, I've been struck by your solidarity and your commitment to reject efforts to divide us and we will not let anything fracture our unity. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: So, there's also new information this morning on the U.S. training of Ukrainians to use Abrams tanks. CNN's Oren Liebermann joins us from the Pentagon. What is this reporting? How far along are they in the training, Oren? OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This entire process moving much faster than was originally anticipated back when the U.S. announced it would send Abrams tanks to Ukraine. The expectation then was that this could play out over months or years because the U.S. needed to acquire these tanks, upgrade them to the more advanced M1A2, get the training done, and then send them in. That was a process that would have taken a very long time. But then the U.S. made a decision to accelerate that whole process, sending a slightly older version of the tank, the M1A1 with some less sophisticated equipment. But the goal of that was to get the tanks in faster and now we're seeing just how quickly training on 31 M1 Abrams tanks set to begin in Germany next month for 250 Ukrainian soldiers. That's troops that training will still take 10 weeks, so it'll still take some time. But we're talking about a period of weeks or a few months instead of months or longer than a year, so you see how fast this is moving. The Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Mark Milley said these aren't a silver bullet. One set of tanks enough for a platoon won't simply change everything for the Ukrainians. But it is part of a broader effort we're seeing from the U.S. and its allies to get in more advanced and more powerful equipment. German Leopard Two tanks, UK Challenger tanks, a refit and repair station will be set up for those Leopard Two in Poland. So, you see this broad effort to try to get these systems in so they can make a difference on the battlefield, John.",
