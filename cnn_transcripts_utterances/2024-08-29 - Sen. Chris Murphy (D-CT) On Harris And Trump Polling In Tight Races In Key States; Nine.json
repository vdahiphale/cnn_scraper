With us now is Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. Senator Murphy, how do you explain now in these key states -- we're talking about Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina -- see a sitting vice president as the change candidate? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Well, first, because she's a transformational candidate. This would be the first woman president at a time when women's health care is under assault all over this country. One of the changes that people want is a reversal of Donald Trump's ability for states to ban access to reproductive freedom. Second, people see Donald Trump as an agent of the billionaire and corporate class. They know what he did when he was in power -- four years and the only major domestic achievement was a giant tax cut for his Mar-a-Lago friends. People see that Joe Biden has started to take power away from corporations, to break up the big monopolies, to support unions and workers' right to bargain, and they want more of that. They want workers to have more power. They want corporations to have less power. And they see Kamala Harris not only as a transformational candidate on issues like reproductive freedom but also willing to continue to carry out a lot of the policies that are going to put money and power back into the hands of regular people. They think Donald Trump is just going to be more of the same. More help for people who don't need any more help.",

What I see is the Harris-Walz campaign out there every single day hustling -- showing America that it wants to lead. That it wants to continue to transfer power from the elites back to regular people. That it wants to give regular folks a chance -- an opportunity in this country. And Donald Trump just sitting back on his smartphone tweeting super dangerous and super misogynist content while he does nothing to show that he wants this job.

And check out the massive lines to get in to secure that bobblehead. All the fans trying to make sure they were one of the first 40,000 into those gates at Dodger Stadium. Now, come gametime it was Decoy's turn to shine. He brought the ball from the mound to Ohtani behind the plate for the first pitch, and then he gave him a high five. That's just one good dog right there. Then Ohtani -- he put on a show. He hit his 42nd home run of the season in the first inning, then he would steal two bases to get him to 42 steals for the season. Ohtani is looking to become the first player ever to hit 50 homers and steal 50 bases in a season. The Dodgers beat the Orioles in that one 6-4. And in Chicago, meanwhile, we may have had the catch of the year. The White Sox were down one, two on, bottom of the ninth. Andrew Vaughn gets ahold of this one, but the Rangers' Travis Jankowski, who just came on as a defensive replacement, skies over the wall to rob the walk-off home run. And just take another. Jankowski reaching well into that White Sox bullpen to grab that one. And the brutal season for the White Sox just continues. They lose their 113rd game. Four-3 the final there. And elsewhere, another night, another record for Caitlin Clark. Indiana's star rookie draining a step-back three early in the first. That was her 86th this season, the most by a rookie in WNBA history. Clark ended up having a rough shooting night though, making just three of her 12 three-point attempts, but she got this clutch bucket with a minute-27 to go to put the Fever up for good. They beat the Sun 84-80. And check this out. After the game, Clark getting a pic with Simone Biles and Gabby Thomas who were at the game. Lots of greatness in that pic. Biles is gearing up for her Gold Over America tour, which starts in about two weeks. The Paralympics, meanwhile, kicking off in Paris yesterday with the opening ceremonies. An exciting day for the roughly 4,400 athletes from around the world that will be competing. John, Team USA has 225 athletes at the Games there in Paris.

But that's not the end of the story.Now the parties have to tell the judge -- well, how do we go through the new indictment and figure out what's an official act and therefore immune and out of the case, and what's an official act and therefore in the case? Trump's going to say the whole thing is an official act. You should throw out the whole indictment. And Jack Smith is going to say all that's left in the indictment, that's all fair game.

And that would be a fairly bland process. There wouldn't be anything sensational happening, but judges tend to do things that way. Option B that Judge Chutkan has is she could hold a hearing. It could be a sort of mini trial. She could say OK, prosecution, we want to have a fight about Mike Pence's testimony. Let's hear from Mike Pence as to what he would testify to. That, of course, would be a very big deal, especially if it happened before the election. As to the other part of the question, will Judge Chutkan have the final say? No, she will not because the Supreme Court, in its immunity decision, said whatever Judge Chutkan decides about what's in and out, Trump gets to appeal that before trial, meaning it will go to the D.C.

The restrictions that prevent him from selling or borrowing against his stakes in Truth Social owner Trump Media are set to expire, but they aren't the only thing that could keep him from selling shares.

Look, I've been covering this Trump Media story for years and it has been so fascinating on so many different levels.One of the big ironies here is that Trump has been sitting on this Truth Social multibillion-dollar fortune that could help him meet some of his cash requirements. But he hasn't been able to touch it, right, because like deals -- other deals like this there are all these lockup restrictions, right, that prevent insiders from selling right away. Now, those restrictions are set to lift in the next few weeks. If the stock price stays above $12.00, it will lift as soon as September 20. If not, it will still lift by September 25. And at that point, Trump can really do whatever he wants in theory, right? He could sell this to pay legal bills. He could fund his presidential campaign. He could, I don't know, buy a sports team -- whatever he wants. Of course, practically, as you know, Rahel, it's always hard for major, major shareholders to quickly dump their stock, and it's even harder in this case, right? I mean, how would that look?
