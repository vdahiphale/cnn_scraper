I feel like he will do a lot for the poor and he will do a lot for the low-income families, which might even encourage more women to be able to keep their babies because they're getting more help from the government. And I've been disappointed that the Republicans, who are pro-life, don't want to -- don't want to help that.

I guess if we go back to the very basic comparison between the two character -- between the two candidates, to me, the contrast is significant and easy to see. One, Warnock -- Sen. Warnock seems to me to be a very good individual -- honest. Christian, as somebody mentioned earlier. And I have some serious concerns with Herschel Walker's character -- like, his honesty. His approach to family life. So, clearly, from my perspective, I view Walker as a flawed candidate. And unfortunately, the Republican Party has done a disservice to the people of Georgia by putting forth that kind of a candidate. I voted for Kemp. I was more than willing to listen and see if they had put forth a viable, credible candidate on the -- for senator -- but they did not. So, ultimately, for me, the decision was easy.

I know that he lived there prior to living in Georgia. But I believe that Herschel Walker meets the qualifications to run here. But I'm definitely voting for Walker because unlike Sen. Warnock, Walker has been very clear on his positions regarding the issues. If you watched the debate between Walker and Warnock, Warnock would not answer any questions directly. He just kind of danced around them like a typical politician. And for him to only be in the Senate for one year that's pretty remarkable that he's able to do that.
