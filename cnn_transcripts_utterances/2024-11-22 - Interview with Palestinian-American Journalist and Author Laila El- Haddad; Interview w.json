And President Biden calls the ICC's arrest warrant for Netanyahu outrageous. We hear from Palestinian American author Laila El-Haddad, who has family living in Gaza. Then, from a touring van to the Broadway stage, the Avett Brothers and actor John Gallagher, Jr. join me on their hit musical, \"Slept Away.\" Plus, the Trump tariffs economist, Oren Cass, lays out his case for conservative policies with Walter Isaacson. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in Washington, D.C., sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, Russia unleashes on Ukraine, striking the country with a new medium- range ballistic missile. President Zelenskyy called it a severe escalation, while the Kremlin says it's a response to the, quote, \"reckless decisions\" by western countries supplying weapons to Kyiv. Ukraine closed its parliament today for the first time since the war started. Lawmakers saying they're fearful of more Russian strikes. Meanwhile, top Ukrainian defense officials admit the situation on the frontlines is difficult. Putin's assault on Ukraine now appears to be getting a boost from Kim Jong Un. North Korean fighters are showing up alongside Russian forces, and the Kremlin is using North Korean-made missiles. But as Nick Paton Walsh reports, they're reliant on American components. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The scramble for the dead or the living. Horrifically commonplace in Ukraine. Yet, this series of homes in Kyiv turned to rubble by something other, not Russian, but a North Korean supplied ballistic missile. And made able to fly here to cause this barbarism, killing a man and his four-year- old son by circuitry from the United States. Ukrainian officials told CNN ballistic missile attacks by Russia were rising fast, 194 so far this year, and about a third of them, at least 60, were using North Korean KN-23s. But these crude missiles, part of growing aid as North Korean troops also come to Russia, rely on a sophistication smuggled into the hermit kingdom. One on display by Ukrainian investigators at this Kyiv warehouse of missile fragments. It is a house of horrors, drones that haunt the night skies, rockets that tear down lives. They pick through the dust to learn how the killing machines work. Here, rebuilding a Shahed Iranian drone's circuits.",

And now, the ICC decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli PrimeMinister Netanyahu and his former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, is still making waves in Israel, Gaza and beyond. U.S. President Joe Biden called it weighing -- weighed in, calling it outrageous, saying there is no equivalence, none, between Israel and Hamas. The Palestinian Authority, though, welcomed them, saying the court's decision, quote, \"restores hope and confidence in international law and its institutions.\" The action by the International Criminal Court comes as the death toll from Israel's campaign in Gaza passes 44,000 people, according to local health authorities. After the news broke, I spoke with Israeli journalist Amir Tibon, who, along with his family, barely survived the October 7th attack, having been rescued from their kibbutz by his father.

Before we get to the news yesterday about the arrest warrants issued by, from the ICC. I know you have family there in Gaza right now. Tell us about your family and how they are doing. LAILA EL-HADDAD, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR:  Thank you so much for having me. That's right. About half of my family is in the north of Gaza, specifically in Gaza City, where almost no aid has entered for about two months now. So, they, as well as my family, my uncles and my cousins in central Gaza, are struggling to survive. There's no other way to put it, and I feel like we've been saying this over and over again, but they've been surviving solely on whatever canned foods they can get their hands on. They haven't tasted any sorts of fresh produce or fresh protein for months upon months. And it's heartbreaking and we do our best to try to amplify -- you know, they don't complain, but we do our best to try to amplify their situation and their voices and to advocate on their behalf when they feel like the world has abandoned them.",

Tell us about -- I mean, the fact that -- as you said, they're not complaining. It's just -- it's quite shocking actually how people can acclimate to war in such dire conditions. What are they telling you over a year into this war now? EL-HADDAD:  Well, they're telling me, first and foremost, that it's not a war, it's a genocide. And that has become abundantly clear. And that they wish that the world would have caught on to this much sooner because they certainly understood it as that very early on when it was clear to them that what was being targeted had nothing to do with any kind of, you know, sort of military infrastructure, but was civilian in nature, whether it was hospitals or their schools and their universities. You know, my -- both of my uncle's houses were completely leveled, destroyed to the ground for no reason whatsoever. And so, really, what they are telling me is they want people to keep speaking up, whether it's individuals or courts, they want people to pursue every avenue at their disposal to put an end, you know, today, before tomorrow to this genocide so they can begin to try to rebuild on return to some semblance of normalcy.",

I do want to get your reaction and then your family's reaction. EL-HADDAD:  Well, there is plausible -- right. They found that there are plausible acts of genocide, and I think that's really significant to note. It's not a wholesale thing per se, you know, it's either or. So, certainly, acts of genocide have been found to have been occurring.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's what I was going to ask you and follow up on because as we noted, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas both welcomed thedecision by the ICC. The Palestinian ambassador to the U.K. said yesterday, the ICC arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant is not only a step towards accountability and justice in Palestine, but also a step to restore the credibility of the rules based international order and its judicial system. That doesn't mean that we're going to see Prime Minister Netanyahu or Yoav Gallant behind bars any time soon. There have been several European nations who are signatories to the ICC who said that if they do travel to their countries, they would be forced to oblige. But of course, Israel and the United States are not signatories. So, in the immediacy, what do you think the impact for your family, for those in Gaza right now is of this decision? What does this mean for them today, tomorrow, in the weeks to come? EL-HADDAD:  I think, first and foremost, it is a validation of what they have experienced of their suffering at the hands of the Israeli military. And it gives them hope. And hope is so crucial at a time when we are facing the fastest pace, deliberate destruction of a society and starvation of a people in recent memory. And even though this has been the most well documented genocide, it is equally the most denied. And so, to be able to have the ICC come out and issue these arrest warrants and to be able to give them this glimmer of hope, not just hope in the international order, which, of course, Gaza has exposed so well, the hypocrisy in that and double standards, but hope, again, for Palestinians and for my family in Gaza, that the world has not forgotten about them, that there are people working to ensure that their suffering comes to an end immediately. And that is so, so important, as I said, when it feels like the world is colluding to ensure their destruction and their erasure.",

We heard from President Biden in his statement -- let's play sound from a spokesperson, Karine Jean-Pierre. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We fundamentally reject the court's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior Israel officials. We remain deeply concerned by the prosecutor's rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision.

That there will always somehow be an excuse, a justification for Israel. And that is, again, at the heart of the problem. And I think increasingly, not just Israel, but the United States will find themselves isolated and pariahs when you are going to continue to defend a plausible genocide and the slaughter and extermination of the people, at what point will you finally draw a red line and say, we're going to apply international law equally, or is it that Palestinians are simply the unhumans to which the laws of the world and of war do not apply?",

They either come across as terrorists and be killed, or if they don't abide by the leaflets that are dropped, then they have to leave. And in your view, and from what you hear from your family, why does it have to be one or the other? They don't want to leave their homes. EL-HADDAD:  Yes. I mean, and I -- another way to put this is, of course, what's been called the Smotrich plan, right? Which is that essentially Palestinians have been left with a false choice. You either accept a status quo as unequals or you leave voluntarily or forcibly expelled, as my cousins were from the north, or you stay where you are and you're killed. And so, it's not necessarily a choice that they have, right? As I said, it's a false choice, but they choose to remain -- to exist nonetheless. And in that existence -- in that defiance, they feel is a sort of rejection of what's been called the finality of genocide.",

Being surrounded by people that care for each other and love each other the skill and the talent and the success and the ambition, all that will take care of itself as long as we cultivate that other. To your point, John, that's -- I think that is happening with this group. That happened with the way the \"No Hard Feelings\" was written. Eight years, that's -- I think that's about how long it takes to write a good song, or for you to be written into a good song. And a show, 10 years in the making, that sounds about right.

GALLAGHER JR.:  You know, it's -- it was an interesting process because when I first read the script, my first thought was, I can't do this.

But you know, people don't just consume stuff, they -- it's very important. Their identities as workers. It's very important that we have an economy that still make stuff, that we don't just become dependent on other countries. And I think, you know, really, over the last decade and since 2012, we saw the cost of not caring about those things.

Even Ronald Reagan, when it when he came to Japan, especially, he was so protectionist that the libertarian Cato Institute called him the most protectionist president since Herbert Hoover. And so, it's really a post- Cold War phenomenon that you had a number of folks on the right of center really, who I would say, are libertarian and kind of market fundamentalists, more so than conservatives, who joined with a lot of folks on the left of center.

I think the right way to think about it is with reference to the past, to think about where we were in the year 2000 when people were saying we should get rid of our tariffs, we should do free trade with China, that will make people better off. And we have to ask ourselves, did it make people better off? Yes, it made some things cheaper, but I think the overwhelming majority of Americans recognized that it was a bad tradeoff. And so, what we're talking about now is making the other tradeoff instead, accepting that the cheapest thing sometimes made with slave labor subsidized by a communist party isn't actually necessarily. It's certainly not free market to be buying that, and it doesn't actually serve families well in the long run. It doesn't serve communities well. And so, nothing is free there. There are tradeoffs in all of our policy decisions, but if we believe we made the tradeoff wrong when we leaned all in on free trade, then we should actually have a lot of confidence that will be getting the tradeoff right when we go the other way instead.",

In fact,American workers are among the most productive in the world. It's because foreign countries weren't playing by the rules. China was aggressively subsidizing, you know, paying for the cost of most of went into making things there. Helping companies exploit workers there. You know, another good example, even in very high technology products, think semiconductors. We invented semiconductors. We were the world leader in semiconductors. Why does Taiwan now make the world's most advanced semiconductors? Not because there's anything special about that particular rocky outcropping off the coast of China, it's because Taiwan's government plowed all of the money into saying, come build the semiconductors here. And so, the model did not work because economists didn't really think very hard about how the people -- how the countries were behaving. And so, I think if we can get back to a situation where there actually is a level playing field, we can get back to the kind of free market that certainly I want to have. And that does typically work for people, which is one where, yes, it would be great if we're buying things from other countries, but they also need to be buying things from us, and that's what's going to create better jobs and stronger communities in the United States, and it's just going to create, frankly, more resilience.

Oh, no, that's semiconductors. It's actually much more consistent with a free market to say, look, making things in America matters. So, we're going to put a thumb on the scale for making more things in America. But in terms of what gets made in America, who makes the investments, where the stuff gets built, I would much rather leave that up to the market. And then to your point about, you know, semiconductors, if there are particular things you really care about making here, for defense and so forth, then you can have a special program to support that. And that's what we have, the CHIPS Act, which is now supporting all of these semiconductor plants in the United States, is a very focused support because I think rightly people recognize that chips are special.

Vance as his vice president, now, Marco Rubio is his secretary of state, I think we are clearly heading in a direction for a much healthier and more genuinely conservative Republican Party that is going to be serving the interests of workers and their families.

And what we find whenever we do research on what Americans actually want is they're very frustrated with government that doesn't work well, that doesn't work efficiently, but there's almost nothing that they want government to do less of. When you actually go through the major things that government does, the kinds of support that government provides, even when you're just asking conservative Republicans, even when you're talking about things like helping people afford health insurance, there's an overwhelming preference for saying the government should either still doing the same or, in fact, doing more. Now, obviously, that has to be balanced against what we can afford. And there are situations, if we're going to get our budget back in control, we are going to have to find some ways to reduce spending. But the idea that there are huge areas of the government that people are just hoping we can get rid of, that is a very narrow unpopular approach. And I think, unfortunately, we have a lot of leaders, some political, but especially from the business community who don't necessarily understand that. And so, I think there's tremendous opportunity for government deficiency, that would be a wonderful thing to pursue.
