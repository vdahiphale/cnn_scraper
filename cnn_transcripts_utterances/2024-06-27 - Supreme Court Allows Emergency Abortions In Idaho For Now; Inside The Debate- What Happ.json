      "sentences": "Exactly. It's a technical win for the Biden administration. But the bigger question that had been presented to the high court,what do you do when you have very restrictive state law when it comes to abortion and a more permissive federal law, which is the governing law? That remains unanswered, right? In Idaho, they have their answer for now. But that's why Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, she said, look, this is not a victory for abortion rights. Right now, doctors, she said, are in the dark about what the law requires of them. So even though this is a technical win for the Biden administration now, it's widely expected that this question, likely in another forum, possibly from another or one of the states that has one of these restrictive laws, will likely go before the justices again. And it's one of a series of technical wins that we've seen for the Biden administration. Yesterday, they had another real technical win where they will be able to continue to flag misinformation or disinformation to social media companies. It -- ahead of the election, that is a significant power. But the court sidestep the larger First Amendment issue and instead kicked out that case on standing. They did the same with another big abortion-related case on Mifepristone, the drug used in medication abortion. That was expected to be a big decision this term. And instead, the justices sort of sidestepped that larger question, kicking, again, the case out on standing. So even though the Biden administration prevailed in a lot of these cases, this win is temporary. I want to flag something else that we saw today. And that is sort of losses for the Biden administration because the court sort of making moves to limit federal power today, both at the SEC and the EPA. And the reason that's significant is because one of the six major outstanding cases that we're still waiting for has to do with the power of federal agencies. Look, it's not the sexiest case, not a lot of folks talking about it. But the court what is widely expected to overturn decades of precedent and take decisions, technical decisions that are usually made by federal agencies and return them to the courts. And that is something that would really change the entire way the government works. So that's a big case in the courts. And this doesn't give clues about which way they might go. Now we expect to get more opinions tomorrow, on Monday, maybe even on Tuesday. Like I said, they still have six opinions outstanding.",

But in recent history, we have not seen two candidates with such different visions for Americas place in the world. And President Biden's close advisors believe emphasizing that starkcontrast between Biden and Trump on foreign from policy could make a big difference. One Biden campaign official telling CNN, quote, \"President Biden stands up to dictators. Trump is too dangerous and reckless to ever be anywhere close to the oval office again.\" But Trump's advocates say, under Biden, the Middle East is now on fire. And Trump has boasted that he will end the war and Ukraine in 24 hours if he's reelected. Let's talk now, more about this topic of foreign policy with CNN global affairs analyst and former defense secretary under President Trump, Mark Esper. We do note that he serves on the board or is a strategic advisor for some aerospace and defense-related companies. I just wonder what you think when you look get these two candidates where they stand on Western alliances, where they stand on defending the role of democracy in the world, where they stand on America being a military and economic leader across the globe? There is so many -- there are so many differences. How much contrast do you expect it will be displayed on this stage tonight?",

I believe he's correct when we look across the globe at Beijing and Moscow and what they're trying to do.And the question will be is, how does -- how does Trump respond to that? How does he respond to allowing a democracy like Ukraine or one across the world in Taiwan to be bullied by a bigger neighbor? And what will his response be to that? I think you'll see pundits on both sides argue that this is really a contest -- a political contest between the Isolationists and the Internationalists in both camps, camps represented by Trump and Biden respectively. But that'll be a big issue. And if -- my sense is President Trump will draw to the fact that we have -- our debt, national debt is exploding. It's well over $32 trillion. So how can we afford to do all that? I think we need to, of course, because Americas leadership in the world matters.

We cannot ignore that, despite the fact that, traditionally, Republicans are more fiscally conservative or at least purport to be.Just really quickly, I wonder if you can speak to whether you think we'll hear something about the role of the military? Because it was so different under the Trump administration. The way he made decisions when it came to, you know, Syria, for instance, or using the military on the border, or for domestic matters. And obviously, there was continuation on the Afghan exit between these two administrations as well. How do you think we're going to see that?",

I suspect that the moderators tonight will both want to really draw major differences between the two candidates.You know, on that one, maybe there's less so. You know, at times, both candidates have politicized the military. Trump more so, I think, than Biden. Both have deployed the military to the border. And I think the bigger issue on the border will be the number of crossings, the -- the escalation of eight to 10 million over the past four years, and immigration policy, writ large. Although, we know President Biden is trying to tack back to a more moderate position on that. And then certainly I think, at some point, the -- President Trump is going to cite the fact that the withdrawal from Afghanistan was abysmal. If I were Biden, I would argue that you wanted to get out quickly as well, Mr. President. So we'll see how that plays out, but that'll be an interesting dynamic with regard to the employment of the military. But the larger issue is what is Americas role in the world and will we defend democracy and will we help out smaller democracies who are trying to beat back this growing block of autocracies that are trying to impose their will and values around the world.",

And I think both of these candidates really have their strengths and their weaknesses.On the strengths part, it was jobs. Both of them historically low unemployment. Very low under Trump. And under Biden, 4 percent unemployment right now. We just wrapped up the longest stretch of sub- 4 percent unemployment since the 1960s. Of course, the problem under Biden has been inflation. The cost of living, the cost to borrow, it's way too high. And that has made it so that people don't really like this economy that much. Now, under Trump, listen, inflation was very, very low. And people were feeling better about the economy before Covid. And then, of course, Covid came, unemployment skyrocketed, markets were in free fall. And listen, I mean, that was, of course, because of this once-in-a- century health crisis. But critics of Trump would argue that he mismanaged it and that made the economic damage even worse. One other point is how they differ on the market. Remember, Trump was a major cheerleader of the stock market. He used to tweet out market milestones and record highs. What's interesting is that when you look at the annualized returns, they're very strong under both President Biden and former President Trump.
