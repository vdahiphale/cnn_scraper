Moments ago, we learned that the first federal hearing in the classified documents case against him has been pushed back by a few days. It will now be held Tuesday, just one step in the really broader fight that the former president's legal team is waging to get the trial pushed back all of the way until after the 2024 election. Joining us now for more on this is David Weinstein. He's a former state and federal prosecutor, and also the former assistant U.S. attorney for the southern district of Florida. David, thank you for coming in. I wanted to read for you want Donald Trump's legal team -- DAVID WEINSTEIN, FORMER STATE AND FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, AND PARTNER, JONES WALKER LLP:  You're welcome, Kate.",

They write this, proceeding to trial during dependency of a presidential cycle wherein opposing candidates are effectively, if not literally, directly adverse to one another in this action will create extraordinary challenges in the jury selection process and limit the defendant's ability to secure a fair and impartial adjudication.David, what do you think of this request from Donald Trump's legal team and also the legal arguments that they're making here?",

And keep in mind, as we sit here in July of 2023, Mr. Trump is not a candidate that has been selected by the Republican Party. He's trying to become that candidate, but he is not the candidate. And the issues that he talks about, well, those issues are going to be present whether this trial takes place today, in December, in March, or in August of next year. It is going to be difficult to get a panel of jurors who do not have an opinion about both Mr. Trump and about the government's prosecution.So, those are really issues that are already present and don't, in any way, mitigate towards extending this trial until beyond the election.",

They think this is very straightforward in what they have and what -- and the charges that they've filed. We know that Trump's legal team is trying to make it a more complicated case. They want to look at the Presidential Records Act, and they want to bring that in to the legal argument.Do you think December, six months after an indictment with the fact that you've got classified documents that are a part of this. You've got nine months of security camera footage that need to be gone through. And you've got, you know, tons of paperwork that needs to be looked through. Do you think December is still a reasonable date?",

I mean, quite frankly, cases in this district are set to go to trial within three to four months of indictment in cases that are even far more complicated than this. It is a case which at its core is not that complicated.Did the documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago end up there at the hands of the two people who are charged? Were they declassified or are they classified documents? And during the course of the government trying to get them back, did the people make false misrepresentations about where the documents were and if anymore existed? It is not that complicated a case. There are a large number of documents involved and potentially a lot of witnesses, but six months, if everybody works towards getting through everything is not an unreasonable amount of time to get ready to go to trial. And certainly, not only in this district but other districts, where the docket moves quickly, that's a lot of time.",

And if it's something that will help them achieve their goals, they see it as worthy.Where the tour has found difficulty is spent multi-millions fighting (ph) a lawsuit with them, they've lost a lot of name players to LIV, PIF. Guys who are, you know, got huge upfront bonus money, got some big names in the game. Brooks Koepka who just won the PGA championship was one. Phil Mickelson, obviously, iconic figure. Dustin Johnson who won the Masters a few years ago. Cam Smith just who the Open last summer at St. Andrews, and he is a part of LIV Golf. These guys got paid a lot of money to go. And it hurts the PGA Tour to not have them competing in their events, and certainly LIV was going to probably be recruiting more of them as time went on. So, there was the monetary challenge that they faced. They've tried to up some of their purse to keep guys from going. They might have overextended themselves to some degree. And so, here we are, after a year plus of, sort of, criticizing them, they've decided to try to work with them.",
