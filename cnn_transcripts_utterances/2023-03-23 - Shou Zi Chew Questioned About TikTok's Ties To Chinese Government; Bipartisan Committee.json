They're not going to give it up easily, right? But their solutions that have been put forward by TikTok aren't going to come in Washington. So you've got a couple of choices. The U.S. has the authority to force divestiture right under the servitor's rules. So they could tell that they could tell ByteDance, the owner, you know, a few years ago, we said this, it was OK for you to acquire TikTok. And we've changed our mind sell it. They could do that. It'd be hard because it's such a big company and so expensive. The other thing they could do is you can't ban speech. So TikTok will continue to be accessible. But you can ban financial transaction. So that means no ad revenue, no sales on App Stores, no nothing. And that would really hurt the company. Those are the avenues that the administration has been exploring. They've been very thoughtful in constructing this. So it will withstand challenge in court. TikTok said, look, we're going to take you to court no matter why you do. The administration feels that the package it's putting together especially with such strong congressional support will be enough to overcome any resistance and enough to force ByteDance to ultimately either sell or agree to some external oversight.",

I think that's a very interesting point to rise. But more concerning is the fact that it names this Chairwoman by name. Your own community guidelines state that you have a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote violent extremist organizations, individuals or acts. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off platform violence. We ban the account. This video has been up for 41 days, it is a direct threat to the Chairwoman of this Committee, the people in this room, and yet it still remains on the platform. And you expect us to believe that you are capable of maintaining the data security, privacy and security of 150 million Americans where you can't even protect the people in this room? I think that is a blatant display of how vulnerable people who use TikTok are? You couldn't take action after 41 days, when a clear threat, a very violent threat to the Chairwoman of this Committee and the members of this committee was posted on your platform. You damn well know that you cannot protect the data and security of this committee or the 150 million users of your app, because it is an extension of the CCP. And with that I yield back.",

Thanks for holding this hearing. Mr. Chew, your algorithms have prioritized providing harmful content directly to children like self-harm challenges, and even suicide. Just three days ago. Italy open investigation into the TikTok over user safety concerns after the so called French scar challenge went viral on your platform. I know you know about the blackout challenge, which others may know as the choking challenge that encourages children to bring them to the point of unconsciousness, or in some cases tragically, death. If that is not enough, I wanted to share the story of Chase Nasca (ph) a 16-year-old boy from New York who tragically ended his life a year ago by stepping in front of a train. I want to thank his parents. Again, they are here. I want to thank his parents for being here today and allowing us to show this. Mr. Chew, your company destroyed their lives. Your company destroyed their lives. I admire their courage to be here, and share Chases' story in the hopes that it will prevent this from happening to other families. The content in Chases' for you page was not a window to discovery, as you boldly claimed, in your testimony. It wasn't content from a creator, which you invited to roam the hill today, or Stem education content that children and China see. Instead, his for you page was sadly a window to discover suicide. It is unacceptable, sir, that even after knowing all these dangers, you still claim TikTok is something grand to behold. I want you to see what Chase would see.

While Ivan has been in the east and now the central south of the country, we were in the Kherson region in the last couple of days and saw a very similar pattern from Russian forces. That city has been largely depopulated. It's right on the front line of the Dnipro River. Russian forces entrenched on the other side, and they are loving artillery and rocket strikes into civilian areas on a regular basis. And it all forms a pattern, as Ivan said and potentially evidence of alleged war crimes that seem to be ongoing on a daily basis in this country. As you say, that President Zelenskyy has been on a frontline tour. He was in the east of the country near Bakhmut. He was also in the Northeast, and now here to the south of where I'm standing, rallying troops, looking and inspecting on rebuilding efforts in areas that were previously occupied by Russian forces, Eleni. And you all feel that it's a deep breath by this country waiting to see whether there will be a counter offensive of some kind. That is where everyone is looking to see when that might happen, where it will happen. A senior official of Ukrainian military saying in around Bakhmut, they are making some ground according to him and depleting forces saying it might be ready for this counter offensive soon.
