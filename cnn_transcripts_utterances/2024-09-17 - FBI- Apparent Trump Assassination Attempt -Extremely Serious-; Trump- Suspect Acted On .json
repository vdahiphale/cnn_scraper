You can see him with his hands up as officers quickly cuff him. He appeared in court, Monday, was charged with two federal gun related crimes. Officials say additional charges are possible. The Secret Service says the suspect did not have a line of sight on Trump. And the Palm Beach County Sheriff says the suspect, quote, didn't even get close to getting a round off. Trump is praising the Secret Service and other law enforcement for their actions, and is publicly recounting what appears to be a second attempt on his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was playing golf with some of my friends who was on a Sunday morning and very peaceful, very beautiful weather, everything was beautiful, it's a nice place to be. And all of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets. But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He, you know, as we have heard, he was there for almost 12 hours.So he probably went in there, you know, because he knew on Sunday mornings, early, as soon as it's light out, people are walking their dogs, they're jogging, that, whatever. So he went in there while it was still dark in the middle of the night, parked his car a little down the road, and then got himself inside those thick, heavy bushes so no one could see him in there. He bought food with him. He bought everything he needed to carry out this attack. So, I mean, I think that the security at the golf course was probably not an issue, because, you know, golf courses are huge. I live on a golf course here in California. I mean, you couldn't possibly encapsulate it. You know, they had a fence up. He -- he was outside that fence, pointing the rifle through the fence.

As the group nears an endorsement decision, the vice president telling Teamsters she's going to continue fighting for union workers like them every day and touted being part of the most pro-union administration in history. She accused former President Donald Trump of appointing union busters to the National Labor Relations Board making it harder for workers to organize.

This all started when last year Rupert Murdoch tried to change the terms of his irrevocable family trust. Originally, this trust after Rupert Murdoch passed away, it would've placed equal voting shares into the hands of his four eldest children. And that would essentially give them all equal voting shares and control of the Murdoch media empire. That includes outlets like Fox News and \"The Wall Street Journal\". But last year, Rupert Murdoch tried to change that trust and put all of those votes into the hands of his eldest son and chosen successor, Lachlan. Part of that reason he says is a business decision. He said that Lachlan will help preserve the value of the company because Lachlan is seen, first of all, as being more politically-aligned with his father. Keep in mind his other son, James, for example, recently publicly endorsed VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS for president and Rupert Murdoch is concerned that his other three children, if given control of these companies might try to moderate a place like Fox News. And Rupert Murdoch says, that could hurt the network's value. Rupert Murdoch is also concerned about leadership battles between the four eldest children. And so he's just trying to give all that control to Lachlan. But the other three children do not agree with this, and that is why they are in court battling this out. Now, this is all actually happening in secret behind closed doors. Nevada is famously one of the top states when it comes to trying to keep places like this behind closed doors. It's essentially become the best-known state for this type of -- for this type of family trust and for these types of court battles. A coalition of media organizations among them CNN, as well as \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post and others did try to petition the court to unseal this case. They were unsuccessful. They weren't successful in getting some things, at least out to the open, for example, the list of attorneys. Because up until that point, you didn't even know who was representing who. Then the court did end up putting some sort of webpage up and saying that this case is happening. But even then, it's still just marked as what's called a Doe (Ph) One trust case. And unless you know what you're looking at, it's hard to know that this is actually the Murdoch family case. But we did see Rupert Murdoch and his four eldest children and their spouses all walking into court today. This case is expected to take -- the evidentiary hearing process that they are now is expected to take a few days into next week. But what's interesting is even when or if a decision is reached, it will all be sealed because this entire case is sealed. So it's possible we won't even know essentially the outcome of this and it can be appealed unless the family themselves come out and say something about this. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

First, does this law violate the First Amendment? And then if it does, is there sufficient justification in terms of these national security concerns to crack down on speech in this way? TikTok, of course, is arguing that the law is an illegal and unjustified violation of the First Amendment rights of the app and its U.S. users. And in this hearing, TikTok's attorney really hammered on that point. He argued that for the government to restrict the speech of a specific entity in this way, it would need to face strict scrutiny and have sufficient justification. And given that -- given all that we've seen publicly from the government at this point is essentially hypothetical concerns that the Chinese government could potentially seek to access U.S. user data from TikTok, he said that bar has not been met. But the judges did push back pretty hard in questioning here, asking if the law would really violate the First Amendment when it still does leave room for TikTok to operate in the U.S., just not under Chinese control. Now, it's not clear how the judges will rule based on today's hearing, but we're expecting to get a decision in the coming weeks and for the losing side to appeal so that this can go to the Supreme Court before that January 19th which is the deadline for a TikTok sale or a ban.
