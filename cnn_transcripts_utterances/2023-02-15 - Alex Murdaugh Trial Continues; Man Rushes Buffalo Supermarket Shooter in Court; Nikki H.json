At this hour, students and staff along with an FBI escort are able to return to the site of the rampage to gather their belongings, this as the heartbroken campus prepares to hold a vigil for three fallen Spartans, a fraternity president, an aspiring doctor, an all-state athlete. Twenty-year-old Brian Fraser is being remembered for his great leadership and humor. Arielle Anderson was just 19 years old, already a junior, her family says she was known for her straight A's and her pure heart. And people who knew 20-year-old Alexandria Verner say her kindness was on display every single second you were around her. Five other students are recovering in the hospital. CNN's Adrienne Broaddus at -- is in East Lansing. And, Adrienne, we're now learning a little bit more about one of the survivors.",

The school has said it will not identify, out of respect for the families, the five who were physically injured. I want to share with our viewers what we have learned about Guadalupe while we share these beautiful photos her family shared. She is a hospitality business junior here at MSU. Her family calls her a leader in the community and beyond. They say she's hardworking, focused and ambitious. One thing they wanted folks to know is that she selected a career path no one else in her family explored. While they are happy Guadalupe survived, the family members posting on a GoFundMe account said they are devastated and they also said there is a long road of recovery ahead for her. Meanwhile, in under six hours, people will hold vigil here outside of the Spartan statue which is known in this community and beyond as a symbol of strain, not only honoring the three whose lives ended on Monday night, but recognizing the victims who were physically injured, as well as thousands of others who are dealing with emotional grief and trauma after surviving this mass shooting -- Kasie.",

She said there were challenges with that. But she extrapolated on the fact that she is a woman of color. And she said very clearly that she believes America is not racist, sort of leaning into some of those culture wars that we have seen the Republican Party latch on to. She said that way of thinking is more dangerous than a virus like the pandemic. She was very clearly giving something there to the base, to the Republican base. And she spoke about, generally speaking, leadership failing the American people and laid out her vision for what America should look like, an America where children are no longer prohibited from going to school by politicians. She talked about being strong, not being weak and woke,securing America's borders, making sure that policing is up. And those are all things that she's clearly making the case to try and appeal to a broad spectrum of Republicans, because she noted, as she did in a video out yesterday, that Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven out of the eight last presidential races. And she says that's because they have failed to capture the majority of Republican support. She says that is all about to change -- Kasie.",

Cupp. I can't think of two better people to have this conversation with. And, Congressman, let me start with you. Nikki Haley, as a candidate, she is running against Donald Trump. She has all of these sort of subtle digs at him. You have been very outspoken in how you feel and what you believe about him as a danger to the party.

If Trump fades away, she can claim that she was the first one with the courage to take him on. The truth is, though, I think a lot of people understand that she's trying to run for a vice presidential slot. It doesn't mean she don't want to be president. But I think, in her mind, it's vice president that she's going for. Personally now, I have a complete lack of respect, really, for anybody that is unwilling to tell the truth to the American people and to their party. But, from a tactical perspective, she's doing the right thing, because, if you tell the truth like I did, you're probably not going to win the nominations here. (LAUGHTER)",

So it's kind of like either mutual assured destruction or just we don't need to touch it, because so many people, with the exception of Trump himself, and maybe to an extent DeSantis, so many people have tried to walk a line and kind of see where the wind is blowing. After January 6, they were all against it. And then, when they saw maybe the wind is with Donald Trump, then we're all for him again, until we're against him. I mean, there is some peace, trust me, in being consistent in what you believe and just telling that. I don't think Nikki Haley can explain that away. I think what she can do is try to bring kind of new ideas. As S.E. was saying, you didn't hear a lot in this speech. But she does have kind of a traditional foreign policy view for Republicans 2015 and prior. She can start to implement that into the conversation. And I think she can actually play a decent role in discussion when it comes to this primary. But, man, I got to tell you, I have a really hard time seeing how she -- how she justifies being for and against Trump based on where the wind is blowing.",

Where do you think that issue sits right now with the Republican base? And how does that sort of develop over the course of the primary, where you have these more traditional conservatives who say, absolutely, we are going to Ukraine to defend freedom, and then some of these -- quote, unquote -- \"MAGA Republicans\" who say that it's a waste of money?",

Is she going to play to that crowd, that sort of fringy, extremist element?Or is she going to stand her ground and sound like the neocon that she probably is, and talk about doing the right things in Ukraine and not parroting Putin? But this is the existential question for her campaign. She has the opportunity to run a really serious, formidable, tight campaign with real surrogates, real endorsements, real donors. She could do that. And to do that, she'd have to exclude some folks. Or she could sort of open the floodgates and let any of the remora, the conspiracy theory wing of the party, the white nationalist wing of the party, let them all in, like Trump did, because he believed he needed their votes. If she decides to let all those parasites in and attach to her campaign, I think it'll tank pretty quickly, because Trump is really the only one that can succeed doing that. I think, if she keeps her campaign clean, tight, serious, sticks to the things she knows, believes in and has experience with, I think she could run a pretty serious campaign.",
