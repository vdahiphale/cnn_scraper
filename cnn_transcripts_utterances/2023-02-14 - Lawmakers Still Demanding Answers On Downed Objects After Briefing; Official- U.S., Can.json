A U.S. fighter jet, of course, shot it down on February 4th.We're also learning that the U.S. and Canada may not be able to recover debris from the three other airborne objects that were shot down by the U.S. military over the weekend. That's according to a senior Biden administration official. A short time ago, Senators got a classified briefing on those identified objects -- unidentified objects, I should say. And afterward, some said that they still need more answers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The briefing was helpful today. Again, I'm not unnerved by anything. I'm confident this wasn't an attack on the country. I think it probably served the country well to have the president explain what's going on. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I am not in any way afraid that we are under a threat of attack or physical harm to our homeland. That's my personal feeling. But the American people need to be reassured with more facts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I think everyone wants more information about these objects, including the Biden administration, right? Even they don't seem to know what these things actually are.Look, John Kirby, who is the spokesperson for the National Security Council, he did give us new information this morning, telling reporters that the intelligence community is considering as a leading explanation that these could just be balloons tied to some commercial or benign purpose. That is the furthest that the administration has gone in recent days in saying that these objects may not be tied to a nation state, and they might just be commercial. Now, obviously, that is -- it still remains unclear why these objects were shot down. If they're just commercial, if they're considered benign. The official explanation has been that they posed a potential risk to civilian aircraft because of the altitude each one of them were traveling at. As far as whether or not these objects had surveillance capabilities, for example, all signs right now are pointing to no, according to U.S. officials. Now, some of those objects, including the one that was shot down over northern Canada, did have some kind of payload, you know, which would be the equipment essentially that's kind of underneath that main structure. But it is very unclear at this point whether the administration is even going to be able to recover the debris in order to properly analyze it. So the biggest question they have also been getting is, are we going to just be shooting these kinds of things out of the sky as a policy moving forward? The administration has said they're going to consider that on a case- by-case basis but that they will move to protect, obviously, U.S. air space when they have to -- Kasie?",

But you know, I think that the big picture here is that, number one, this doesn't pose -- these don't pose a military threat. Number two, weather balloons, other kinds of balloons by the Weather Service and other research agencies, tens of thousands of these go up into the air every year. They have payloads. This could be that. And I just think we need to be methodical. And I welcome the Biden administration's setting up some new bodies to look a little more deeply into this. We already have a military intel organization looking at these as we speak.",

The balloon that -- or the airborne object that was shot down over the Yukon -- so that's in Canada -- is being described as a small metallic balloon with a tethered payload below it. Small metallic balloon. Does that mean anything to you as someone who has seen intelligence on reports on these kinds of things?",

All of these balloons have payloads like that, that are tethered payloads because they're collecting data.And again, like a lot of this is about wind speed and atmosphere conditions and the environment and all different things. So, yes, it could be something, as John Kirby said, completely benign. I hope we can get these. But you know, there's more up there to look at. The recent report by the intelligence community released in January on unidentified aerial phenomena indicated that, you know, half of about 250 things sighted by U.S. pilots over the last 18 months or so are still unknown. Half of them were balloon or balloon-like objects. This is something we need to start digging into a lot more.",

But some prices are still red hot. CNN business and politics correspondent, Vanessa Yurkevich, joins us now. Vanessa, walk us through the numbers. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Let's start with some of the good news, as you mentioned, Kasie. The good news is that inflation is at about 6.4 percent. That's good news because that's the seventh straight month that year-over-year inflation has fallen. But that number still too hot. But let's also look at month-over-month inflation. Inflation in January up .5 percent. That is significant. And that is where the concern is coming from. We heard President Biden today saying that, overall, the report is good news because of the year-over-year inflation. But the concern, and he said there is still work to do, is because of this month-over- month inflation. Let's break it down. Where did the increases come? Food up 10 percent year-over-year. Energy, a big, big driver. Gasoline up 1.5 percent from last year. And shelter, 7.9 percent. This is a record. And that is because, as Americans, we spend the most on shelter when it comes to our everyday budget. Americans really feel this day-to-day probably, Kasie, most when they go to fill up their tank for their cars but also at the grocery store. Look at this, eggs still skyrocketing to 70 percent from last year. Butter up 26.3 percent. Lettuce up 17.2 percent from last year. And what does that mean for our wallets? Well, according to Moody's Analytics, an average family is spending about $400 more per month on the same goods and services this year than they did last year. Kasie, what this all really means is that the Federal Reserve has more work to do. We can expect more interest rate hikes to try to get inflation under control for American families -- Kasie?",
