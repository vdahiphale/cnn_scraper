It is right now 10:00 and it's in disarray because the prior British Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned just 44 days after taking office. We begin, really, at the end. The end of the shortest term ever served by a British prime minister. Liz Truss, out of the job after just 44 days, leaving the UK's leadership in a store state of chaos. In a statement, which was also noted for its brevity, Ms. Truss said, she was resigning because she could not deliver the mandate on which she was elected. Now, the race is now on to find a replacement to the conservative party, and we could see a new leader as early as possibly next Friday. Possible contenders include former transfer, you've got on your screen there, Rishi Sunak, the leader of the commons, Penny Mordaunt, or even this man, you may know him, Boris Johnson. Remember him? Well, sources say he's mulling over what would be a truly jaw-dropping political comeback, having only himself resigned in this summer. While the opposition is calling for immediate general election, but the conservative party is under no obligation to call one, despite Ms. Truss's resignation. Bianca Nobilo has more on where the government stands now and what could come next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Devastating resignation, and fierce criticism.

There needs to be stability first, because the credibility will only come back with time. Certainly in terms of the market, the stability of policy, it sounds sort of tedious to put it this way, but the overturning of competent policy in the last few weeks has been so enormous that we are having to really talk in terms that we never dropped we would have to. The hyperbole of what we've all been saying on air. We just never dreamt of it, so stability first, get in place somebody who knows what they are doing, and can bring at least the majority together.

Why did you decide to evacuate, the reporter asked. I've a small child to take care of, you see, the woman answers. Russia says it's ferrying these people to safety.

You really don't hear that very often coming from American officials, coming from the administration, when it comes to domestic plants put up by some other foreign leaders. And, certainly, White House officials have been watching over the last several weeks with a sort of dumbfounded-ness, watching Liz Truss sort of lay out these plans to not be able to pass them. Certainly, they were not necessarily surprised when she resigned this morning. The writing had really been on the wall. President Biden really only got to meet her one- time face to face. That was on the sidelines of the United Nations last month. At the time, White House officials told me that it was a candid meeting. They did not seem to have any outward animosity. The big topic that they discussed at the time was this question over Brexit and the question over the Northern Ireland particle. Of course, President Biden as taken a deep personal interest in that matter. He was very staunchly opposed to the way that Liz Truss was proposing handling it. Of course, that issue had become totally obscured over the last few months by her own tax plan and economic plan. Now looking forward, what White House officials say is that they really want some stability in Downing Street, particularly when it comes to the issue of Russia holding Russia accountable, supporting Ukraine, and you heard the public statements on the president today that he had worked with Liz Truss on that issue, and that he hopes to work well with the next prime minister. There is concern, of course, that the western alliance remains united on this issue, particularly within the G7. Of course, you have a prime minister coming into office in Italy who is more to the right. The White House really wants to maintain that united lock, as they try to isolate Vladimir Putin. Certainly, there is probably no question that the next prime minister will maintain some of the. But in order to do that, some stability would be required, and that is what White House officials are looking for now.",

It were people who were from her wing of the party, libertarian right-wing party who believed her when she said she was going to do things differently, challenge the orthodoxy, willing to be a popular, and then she did not actually deliver on any things that she had promised in her campaign. Confidence was falling away, and then you have senior resignations, -- you move off all lead seeds for the house of commons, where you had a vote which is a confidence vote for the prime minister.

It seems that he does understand the process and what needs happen. But the issue for him is that he is not universally popular. The people who supported Boris Johnson blamed him and his, in their view, disloyalty, for dethroning of Johnson. So, he will still be a divisive figure. I think the real impetus in the party though is for mps to decide themselves without having to go back to membership. Members were the ones who chose Liz Truss, often members not in the same space as MPs. That could complicate the issue and it could make it take longer as well.

He was the mayor in London, which is a labor city. But there was a scandal towards the end of his time as prime minister, 50 plus ministers resigned because they cannot work with him anymore, or they wanted him to go, and he lost two big bi-elections for the conservative party. He is also facing an investigation by parliamentary -- that he willingly misled parliament or not. So, I think there is a lot of baggage that comes abortions in. Whilst it may be easy to go back and think of all the positives and say, well, he can win my seat again, which is what you do as an MP, you do need to think about how the public will perceive the and all the negatives as well.
