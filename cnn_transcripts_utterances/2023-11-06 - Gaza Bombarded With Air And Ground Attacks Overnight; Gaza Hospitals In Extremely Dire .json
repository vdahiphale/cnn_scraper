U.S. Central Command posted this photoof a guided missile submarine apparently heading through the Suez Canal. That sub contains up to 154 extremely powerful Tomahawk cruise missiles on board. It is very rare for the Pentagon to reveal anything about the locations of its missile subs. Telling the world that this sub is now in the region is a clear message to Iran and its proxies to leave Israel alone. So, let's bring in CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Lieberman with more on this. So, despite being forthcoming about these additional reinforcements, Oren, we continue to see an increase in the number of attacks against U.S. forces in the region. Most believe that they are at the hands of Iranian proxies. So, what does that say about the type of deterrence the U.S. is using right now?",

First, there is the issue of the submarine -- aguided missile submarine, an Ohio class heading to the Suez Canal there, and that joins a list of U.S. forces, certainly naval forces, already in the region. Two carrier strike groups, an amphibious ready group, that's more than 10,000 sailors right there alone, as well as that submarine. The Navy and the Pentagon are normally very secretive about submarine operations, So, when you see them surface, it is very much a statement, as it is the case here. The Ohio class sub transiting through what appears to be the Suez Canal there, a message very much to Iran and its proxies but they have not been silent either. The U.S. has attributed many of the attacks, and we've seen 38 since October 17th against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. Many of those attributed to or blamed on Iran and its proxies in the region. Most of those have been carried out by suicide drones, one-way attack drones, or rocket attacks. There have been about 20 minor injuries to U.S. forces. The vast majority of those attacks were intercepted by essentially defensive measures at the U.S. facilities and U.S. positions in Iraq and Syria, but the barrage has kept up at a fairly steady pace. These are not large barrages. These are almost sort of ones and twos when it comes to rockets and drones, but they are still significant because that message of deterrence, clearly not getting through to the extent that it's supposed to, or at least to the extent that the Pentagon wants it to. So, this is something the U.S. is keeping a very close eye on. Do these militias in Iraq and Syria try to get more involved? Do they up the pressure and up the attacks on U.S. forces? That is something the Pentagon is watching very closely, Bianna.",

This is not some command and control which controls silos and armies across the globe. So, the idea, but what it does do is it shows that Palestinians have been so dehumanized by the Israelis, that their only value to the Palestinians' lives comes if they have no security needs pertaining to the Israelis. Palestinians who deserve to live are those who are deemed security neutral by the Israelis.

I actually think that Donald Trump's legal team essentially conceded defeat in this case many, many months ago when he took the fifth -- the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution many times in a civil deposition in this case. So, this was always, I thought, essentially damage control from the perspective Trump's legal team.
