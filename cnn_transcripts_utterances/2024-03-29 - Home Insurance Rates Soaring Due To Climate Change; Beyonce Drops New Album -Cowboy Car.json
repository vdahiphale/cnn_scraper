      "sentences": "Now homeowners are sounding the alarm about the skyrocketing costs of home insurance. It's especially true for the millions of Americans living in areas that are at higher risk for extreme weather.The U.S. saw a record 28 weather and climate disasters last year alone. I compare that to natural disasters from 1980 to 2023, when the typical annual average for these events was just 8.5. And we're talking everything from beach erosion so severe that homes collapsed into the sea -- collapsed into the sea on the east coast, to hurricanes in Florida to wildfires and flash floods in California. The costs of the 2023 natural disasters smashed all previous records with each disaster totaling over $1 billion. An expert in the insurance industry says Americans saw a roughly 10 percent to 12 percent increase in their homeowner's insurance rates. Joining me now to discuss is Josh Flagg, the star of \"Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles.\" Josh, thank you so much for being with us. And I'd like to start by just getting your take on which states you think are being hit the hardest right now. And just how high these rates are rising. JOSH FLAGG, STAR, \"MILLION DOLLAR LISTING LOS ANGELES\": We'll, I can -- I can't speak to all of the states, but I can unequivocally say the state of California has suffered tremendously. I mean, most of the insurance companies have backed out actually and canceled policies for tons of my clients. Clients that live north of Sunset especially in Los Angeles, in the Baylor area in Beverly Hills and the hillside areas, it's become quite a big problem. And this kind of started with fires a couple of years ago. And it just got worse. And is it something you -- just some people have to self- insure? You can't even get insurance. it's just a -- it's insane. FISHER: That's crazy. So I mean, walk us through exactly how these high premiums are affecting your clients' ability to just buy and sell their homes.",

Like, you know, if you're south of Sunset, for example -- I bring up Sunset Boulevard because that's where the hillside area starts.If you're in the flats or an area like that, insurance really is not much higher than it used to be. It's actually quite easy to obtain. But for clients that want to be in the areas that are in the hills, it's -- sometimes I'll have conversations with them, like, OK, well, we don't want to go into the hills because it has just gotten so exorbitantly expensive. I mean, insurance that would have, years ago, a couple of years, would have been made $20,000 a year, could be $80,000 to $100,000, $80,000, 100,000, $120,000. Yes. I mean, it's as much as people are paying in property taxes.",

People self-insure it. There's different ways. I mean, there are insurance carriers out there. It's just made it ten times more difficult to do it. And it's just it's really become a disaster. It's somewhat affected the values of homes north of Sunset and in the hillside areas. Not tremendously, but it has -- maybe I shouldn't say affected the values. It's made it a lot harder and takes a lot longer to sell the property.",

People are still buying houses. I mean, nothing is going to ever kill a market. It just makes it a lot more difficult. And it just adds another wrench. And between the ULA tax and now we have a wildlife ordinance, interest rates that are higher, it's -- just overall, it makes things more difficult and it makes things take longer to sell. But luckily, at least in California, there's a strong market here and we're not having anything that happened like in 2008 when the market crashed.",

But when I initially heard \"Texas Hold Them\" and \"16 Carriages\" -- they came out around the time of the Super Bowl -- I expected like a contemporary country album. And within those walls, this is not that. It is folk and pop and R&amp;B and Hip Hop. There's -- there's opera on this album. It's really moving between the lines of genres. And she also elevates black country artists, pairs up with some artists who move between genres, like Post Malone on \"Levi's Jeans.\" And this is Beyonce with Miley Cyrus on one of my favorites on this album, \"Two Most Wanted.\" Listen.
