And, you know, as we were waiting for that press conference, we've been reading the tea leaves here, all characteristics that we know had indicated just that. We know for example that the shooter had fired from a distance of about 20 feet away using a suppressor on that weapon in a crowded area, if you have that type of device on a firearm. That could then, obviously, you know, muzzle the sound of the gunfire itself, allowing that person to then make their escape. And that distance also, you know, rules out any type of robbery here to shoot someone and then flee. There are a lot of things that are going on behind the scenes right now. Investigators are doing what's called a video canvas. New York City is blanketed with closed caption television. Cameras both owned by the city as well as by private companies. So police are going to try to get that footage in order to look at the incident itself to try to determine where the person came from, to track them, and obviously to try to then move beyond that. And to see where exactly they went. And then there's a question about whether this individual had any type of threats against him prior to the shooting, the victim. So that is what law enforcement will be looking for. They would also be working to interview anyone in the shooter's orbit, friends, family, co-workers, again, to try to determine was there anyone with a grievance that they knew about who may have conducted this brazen style attack.",

And so what authorities can do, particularly with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms here in the U.S., is they specialize in tracing weapons. They can actually look at those shell casings. Each particular gun, just like a fingerprint, leaves a unique signature on a round of ammunition. And so they would look at that to try to determine, is this a gun that we know in our database has been used in past crimes as well? And then they would take the task and this is grim, my apologies, but also trying to recover the bullets themselves, the ammunition, whether that's from, you know, the walls of nearby businesses or oftentimes from the victim himself, trying to remove those fragments in order to assess them again to determine whether this was something that they've seen before, whether it's actually tracked to a specific individual which would help potentially in the identification.",

So like you said, the quicker we get him, because he had a plan to get away. Now we may have had a plan to leave the state, leave the country. You know, he obviously had a plan leading up to the attack, which means to me he had a plan to get out of the police kind of barrier, perimeters that they set up. So you're right. You're exactly right. And that's the most important part to make is that he probably had a plan just as much as he pre-planned. He post-planned his escape and where he's going to go. He probably had a place where he's going to go, how he's going to travel, train, car, plane, whatever. And so they really have to get on the quick because, you know, when you see something so meticulously planned, everybody kind of leads up to the attack. But you got to remember if you plan that carefully leading up to the attack, he probably planned his escape just as carefully. So they've -- he's now in that, you know, planning phase, or the part of his plan where he actually plans to escape. And so, you know, he's carrying that out right now.

That's when they actually caught him on video right now, five minutes before.

He tried to push it through using a controversial clause that allowed him to bypass a parliamentary vote. CNN's senior international correspondent Jim Bittermann is joining us live now from Paris with the very latest. So, Jim, I mean, this is -- this is really consequential because if this measure passes, this would be the first time that a government has been ousted through a no-confidence vote in France since 1962.

EmmanuelMacron was looking very desperately to find somebody that could bring all the sides together here after he had called the snap election in the parliament. The parliamentary election, which was earlier in the summer, basically Macron thought he was going to get a parliament that would be more on his side. In fact, the plan didn't work. He came up with a parliament that was almost evenly divided, one-third, one-third, and one-third. And as a consequence, appointing a prime minister became a difficulty. It took him months to come up with Emmanuel Macron, rather with Michel Barnier. And Michel Barnier was only named in September. He's had three months to get through what is his most important job, which is to get a budget together for next year. And he hasn't been able to do that very well. We're going to see the end result of that tonight when the parliament votes on this. This lack of confidence measure that's coming up. During these months of negotiating with the various parties here, it led to all sorts of accusations from one to the other. Marine Le Pen, who was just in front of the National Assembly speaking, she said that Michel Barnier had not paid attention to the will of the people. Meanwhile, Barnier, on a television address last night, basically said that Marine Le Pen, the extreme right leader, was subjecting him to political blackmail. Here's the way he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHEL BARNIER, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): She tried to get into a kind of one-upmanship, telling me it's either the non-indexation of pensions or its medicines. I came to an agreement with the teams to assess medicines. And when I told her that, she said, well, pensions too. I don't want to get into blackmail. That's not my state of mind. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The progressives are -- he is a conservative. The progressives in South Korea have sort of really stymied his government. They've investigated his wife that apparently has hurt him quite badly.

I do not think that the military is now a threat to South Korean democracy. Although we'll have to find out just how complicit the military was in this. If it really was, and we don't know, and that is a genuine sign of political instability.

One of those key people that he's going to meet with is Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa. She sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. She's a sexual assault survivor. She also is someone who has been very vocal about her belief that women should be allowed to serve in combat, something that Pete Hegseth, in the past, has made comments, disparaging. So that is going to be one of the key things that perhaps they talk about today in her meeting with Pete Hegseth. I just caught up with her a few minutes ago and she said she was looking forward to this meeting. She also made clear this is going to be a thorough discussion and that may contrast with the kinds of meetings that Pete Hegseth had had on Monday and Tuesday with some folks who are much closer to Donald Trump, who are much closer to MAGA World, who I think were having a much more social conversation with Pete Hegseth than maybe some of the meetings he's going to experience today on Capitol Hill this morning. He also met with the incoming Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker. Right now, he is meeting with the incoming Republican leader John Thune, another critical meeting and someone who knows very well up here on Capitol Hill how to count votes, what the reality is of these confirmation battles because I think that's another thing to keep in mind. We are still weeks, if not months, from this process being completely done playing out and that means that this drip, drip, drip of additional information that has been problematic for some Republican senators could continue to be an issue for Pete Hegseth. I would also note that I talked this morning with Senator Kevin Cramer, someone who's going to have the last meeting of the day today with Pete Hegseth. And he said that he wants to hear from him in his one-on-one meeting that Pete Hegseth is done with drinking. He said that that is something that's really important to him. He said he has firsthand knowledge of what it is like to struggle with alcohol given the past of one of his sons.

So to what extent he has unilateral power over that building, it remains to be seen. As far as launching the investigations that he's been talking about really for years now, I think that's more of something that the Americans should be concerned about. As FBI director, he would have jurisdiction to sort of gather the discovery and evidence that was later than be pushed on to possibly Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch these investigations into members of the so-called deep state. And for those who want a little bit more of an extended list, specific names, they can turn to appendix B of his book, Government Gangsters, where he makes quite claim just who he would be looking to target in a position of power.",

Some within Trump's own circle in his first administration from Bill Barr, who's his attorney general, who said, over my dead body, well, this guy, be my deputy.

I think it's instructive to compare him to someone like Stephen Miller, who is very clear what policy he wants to advance when it comes to immigration. You're not so much thinking about Stephen Miller, the person as much of his specific agenda. With Kash Patel, this is not at all the case. He's not somebody who would be traditionally understood in the past as a movement conservative or even really partisan more broadly. Of course, he worked under the Obama administration as a prosecutor at DOJ. And so really, his ideology, such as it is, has become entirely tethered to Donald Trump. Donald Trump has been the fuel to his route rise through national government. And my understanding, through my reporting, based on countless conversations, is that he will do whatever it takes to remain in Trump's good standing because he otherwise has no real grounding in a traditional policy sense.",

So this really is, you know, quite a message from Trump, quite a statement about his confidence about what he can get senators to go along with in the end. But I think this conversation will be a lot more prolonged than it is with current -- other current nominees because we have to remember that there is currently a director of the FBI, Christopher Wray, who does have years left in his term.
