I talk solutions with the Egyptian foreign minister. Then, as Hamas releases its first hostage video, a conversation with Sharone Lifschitz, whose parents were kidnapped when their kibbutz was stormed. And later in the program, a big win for Poland's opposition as they defeat the country's populist government. What this also means for Ukraine's support with Polish Member of Parliament Radek Sikorski. Also, ahead, Israeli human rights lawyer, Sari Bashi, joins Hari Sreenivasan. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The American president, Joe Biden, is heading to Israel tonight in a show of solidarity since 1,400 was slaughtered there and ahead of a major Israeli offensive into Gaza. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was there today. Leaders will also insist that international law is observed and innocent Palestinian life is protected. At least 3,000 have been killed in Gaza since airstrikes began, and immediate concerns center on trying to get life's basic necessities to the people who are currently under an Israeli siege. The only way in right now is through Rafah, which is at the border between Gaza and Egypt, but it remains closed. With Egypt, the focus, I spoke to the Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, about how long this can continue. Sameh Shoukry, welcome to the program. Can I start by asking you, what is the problem at the Rafah Crossing? Why is aid not coming into Gaza for people?",

The Rafah Crossing over the last days has been bombed four times. Among them once when we were trying to repair some of the damage, four Egyptian workers were injured. The crossing has sustained damage, the roads -- access roads between the Egyptian and the Gaza side have severe damage and need repair. And thereby, we do not have as well any authorization and clear secure routes for those convoys to be able to enter safely and without any possibility of their being targeted. That is the current status and situation. And we are working diligently, hoping that there is an opening and an ability to repair the crossing so that the convoys can go in. There is a great need on the part of those that have been displaced from the north of Gaza who are now on conditions of lack of food, water, shelter. And they are suffering immensely. But until now, there is no safe passage that's been granted and the -- no ability to repair the damage that has been inflicted on the crossing.",

We have constantly been trying to manage the Palestinian issue, and we have certainly failed. And I don't think that if the International Community is -- has the resolve and the commitment to the two-state solution as the internationally recognized way to end this conflict and the suffering of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people, then we do have to regain the political horizon of the end of the conflict on the basis of the two-state solution.

And Friday, the Israeli army ordered a million people, nearly half of whom are children, to leave Northern Gaza, that's half the population, and evacuate to the south. But there's no safe place to go to because they continued bombing the south, and there's no safe way to get there because they continued bombing, even the evacuation routes that they designated. So, under those circumstances, it's not effective warning. It's not protecting civilians and it runs the risk of becoming forcible transfer, in particular, because the Israeli military also encouraged Palestinians to flee to Egypt. 70 percent of the people living in Gaza are refugees from what is now Israel. So, some of the older people who were fleeing their homes on Friday remembered 75 years ago, fleeing homes in Southern Israel as the Israeli army that approached.

They're also providing Israel with political cover and a diplomatic cover. The United States has an opportunity to be very specific. In telling Israel that it needs to protect civilians in Gaza. And those specifics would, first of all, be to cancel the evacuation order and to protect civilians, irrespective of where they are. Many people in Northern Gaza did not leave either because they couldn't, there are older people, there are people with disabilities, there are hospital patients, because the main hospital in Gaza is in the evacuation zone, or they chose not to because they were facing impossible choices, and the conditions in the south are not good, to say the least. Those people retain their civilian protections. So, if the Israeli military does launch a ground invasion, it may not target or indiscriminately attack them. The second thing the United States government needs to ask the Israeli government tell the Israeli government to do immediately is to restore fuel, electricity, water, and food supplies to Gaza. Those have been cut since October 7th. Collective punishment, which is what denying the supplies are, and forcible transfer are war crimes. And I want to be very clear, what Hamas led fighters did on October 7th, it was an unspeakable war crime, they massacred Israeli civilians. They took hostage children, people with disabilities, babies, older people. It was unspeakable. But the fact that the other side is committing war crimes doesn't mean that you get to commit war crimes.
