The first of six days of tributes and observances is underway right now as the nation and the world honor the life and legacy of America's 39th president who passed away Sunday at the age of 100. An emotional moment this morning when former and current Secret Service agents who protected Carter during his lifetime carried his casket right there to the hearse. And then there was this ceremony at the National Park Service in Plains, Georgia, where the two longest- serving staffers rang the farm bell 39 times.

And in a few hours, it will stop off at the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta, where Carter served one term as governor and as state senator. After a moment of silence honoring his service, the motorcade will then head to the Carter Center in Atlanta, where a service will be held later on today.We have a team of correspondents covering today's ceremonies. Jeff Zeleny is at the Carter Center. Let's begin with Eva McKend in Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia, where the motorcade made its way to a host of small towns, places where Jimmy Carter and family have made history and made special moments for so many regular residents there. EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Fred, when the motorcade came through, it was solemn, it was emotional, it was quite quick. And you saw people waving American flags, saluting the former president. In many ways, it would have been just what President Jimmy Carter would have wanted his hometown of Plains to be in the spotlight. And all this week, we've been speaking with residents here, and it seems like just about everyone has a Jimmy Carter story about the way that he impacted their lives on a personal level, whether it was visiting a sick family member and praying over them or being involved in food distribution at food pantries before he fell ill. They were someone that -- he was someone that they could really rely on. He was their neighbor, he was their friend. But he also touched many lives through Sunday school lessons at the Maranatha Baptist Church that he taught for many decades. That is how he interacted with many people across the country, and those are some of the people that traveled here to Plains today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

Of course, that's where Jimmy Carter first served elective office at the state level as a state senator.He ran for governor. The first time he lost and then he won and he served one term as governor. And then, of course, that vaulted him to the presidency. So it will -- his motorcade will pass the Capitol here in Atlanta before making its way to the Carter Center. But this is the site really where the former president did much of his life's work, really over nearly four decades, more than four decades actually, through a democracy, humanitarian effort. So there will be a service inside, a private service inside the Carter Center and then his body will lie in repose for a couple days here in Georgia. And that is where people can come and pay their respects. We're already seeing, really for the last several days, people have been leaving flowers, leaving notes, leaving remembrances to the former president. And that is something that we certainly are expecting to see more of in the days ahead. But it is the Carter Center here that really is the testimony and the tapestry to what he did for more than four decades. Again, through working with his predecessor in office, Gerald Ford, they came together to try and work on Middle East peace. He worked on arms control. He worked on humanitarian efforts, so many things, eradicating the guinea worm in Africa. This was really the life's blood of his post-presidency, his unfinished work, he called it. So this is going to be the site of the next chapter in this state funeral before, of course, he goes to Washington later this week, Fredricka.",

Amber, so great to see you. Thank you so much for being with us. In your book, you write that the 1976 presidential election that Carter won was a transformational moment in U.S. history in so many ways. I mean, you say that Carter's campaign ushered in a change in how candidates run for public office and how the news media covers the campaigns. Explain more about why this was so unique in his 1976 presidential race. AMBER ROESSNER, AUTHOR, \"JIMMY CARTER AND THE BIRTH OF THE MARATHON MEDIA CAMPAIGN\": Thank you so much for having me. It's an honor to share a little bit of perspective about the legacy of former President Jimmy Carter. Certainly, his run for office in 1976 was a transformative moment. He engaged in what some historians call the politics of authenticity. And so, and then -- and of course, the news media engaged in saturation news coverage.

The royal source has told CNN that King Charles is deeply saddened after learning what happened. Regarding the investigation, CNN has learned that a security firm warned five years ago that the Bourbon Street area was especially vulnerable to a vehicular ramming attack. Both the FBI and ATF say the killer set fire to the short-term rental location where he stayed to destroy evidence, including precursors for bomb-making material.

The decision made indelible impacts on hundreds of American athletes, many of whom had reached their performance peaks for the Moscow Games, only to never be able to recover or qualify for the next games in four years.

It took my main competitor John Akii-Bua out. I was looking forward to running against him in the 400 hurdles. Then in '80 we boycotted. 1984 there was another boycott with the Eastern bloc countries that did not come. So politics and sports go together.Spike Lee said it in the film. You can't separate sports from politics. And it was during the Cold War, United States versus USSR versus the ESPOC (ph) countries. It was a virtual. We were like warriors who were competing behind the Iron Curtain. And we didn't get to go in '80. Looking back on it did change things for sports in general. Sports became professional, more or less professional. In 1981, 1984, the Olympic Games changed the whole outlook of marketing, the way marketing is done in sports today.",

Sources tell CNN that Trump argued Republicans needed unity and that voters would not tolerate the dysfunction that would ensue if they couldn't rally together.With several members of the GOP expected to join Trump's administration, the House majority is set to drop to 215. That means House Republicans cannot afford even one defection if legislation passes along party lines. President-elect Donald Trump is reacting to the decision of a New York judge allowing his hush money conviction to stand. Donald Trump took to Truth Social this morning, saying Judge Juan Merchan, I'm quoting now, may be the most conflicted judge in New York state history, end quote. And of course, Trump went on to say, I'm quoting now, the judge should be disbarred, end quote. Merchan indicated in his opinion that the case is essentially over now that Trump has been reelected and he will face no legal penalties. Still, this means he will be the first convicted felon sworn in as U.S. President. CNN's Paula Reid has more.",

      "sentences": "Well, President- elect Trump is still a convicted felon after this opinion, but there is some good news because the judge is revealing that he will not face any penalties at his January 10th sentencing. Now, the judge did have the option to impose a jail sentence here. He says he will not do that. And in a rare move, he -- he previews how he's thinking about this sentencing, saying quote, while this court, as a matter of law, must not make any determination on sentencing prior to giving the parties and defendant an opportunity to be heard, it seems proper at this juncture to make known the court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration. A sentence of an unconditional discharge appears to be the most viable solution.So to translate that, this January 10th sentencing will largely just be performative. Now, it's also notable the judge is making a big concession about Trump's role as President-elect, something that his lawyers have repeatedly argued should be factored in here. Here, the judge says, to assuage the defendant's concerns regarding the mental and physical demands during the transition period, this court will permit the defendant to exercise his right to appear virtually for this proceeding if he so choose -- chooses. So they're essentially saying, we agree with your defense attorneys that you have a lot going on as President-elect during the transition, so you should not be burdened having to travel all the way up to New York. So that is a significant shift from Judge Juan Merchan, who has not been as receptive to similar arguments over the course of this case. Now here, the Trump team was pushing to get the entire conviction, the entire case tossed out. They were not successful there. So they can continue to appeal the conviction even though there'll be no penalties. But it appears the Trump team is not fully satisfied with this opinion today. In a statement, Trump communications Director Steven Cheung said, there should be no sentencing and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they're all dead.
