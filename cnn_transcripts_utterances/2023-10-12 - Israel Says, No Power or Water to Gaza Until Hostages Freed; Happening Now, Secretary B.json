      "sentences": "All right. So, this has been a hospital that's been very busy since the beginning, Phil and Poppy, of the attacks on Saturday. You mentioned 650 people came here to this hospital in Ashkelon. We're very near the Gaza border, obviously just about seven or eight miles from the Gaza border here, 650 of them originally. We still know at least 30 of them are still here being treated. And then there's the ongoing strikes.Yesterday, when we came under that heavy assault of dozens and dozens, 60, 70 rockets above us, above Ashkelon, some of those inevitably do come through the dome, either a full rocket or pieces of a rocket. And we have seen places where they have impacted. A rocket did hit this hospital here yesterday, part of it. But in addition, about 70 people who were injured yesterday in those strikes from Hamas, here in Ashkelon, came here to this hospital. And we understand some of them are still here being treated for that trauma. So, this is very much in the center of this. It's both a target and a place that people come for relief and for treatment after these strikes in terms of what Israel is dealing with right now. Also I will say, Poppy and Phil, over the past hour-and-a-half, as we have been here, a lot of thuds coming from Gaza. Over the past half hour, we've heard less of that happen that, but a lot of thuds coming from Gaza, as I said, just a few miles away, where we know that the IDF has been conducting major airstrikes, they say, on terror targets throughout Gaza, throughout this morning. And as I said, when we came here, those were steady sort of, let's say, every minute, every 30 seconds, we would hear those very loud thuds, and we haven't heard that here in about the past half hour. Although I do know that just south of here and then we just heard one right now, actually. So-- but just south of here, there have been a lot of incoming rockets over Sderot where-- I know we're going to be talking to Nic Robertson in just a few minutes. And, Nic, I know you have been seeing a lot of that rocket onslaught so far this morning, dozens and dozens of them, I understand. What have you actually experienced there?",

So, Nic, again, this question, and we can hear obviously that volley of fire where you're standing right now, just a few miles from that border, how would you characterize-- and over the past couple of days here, Nic, as we've been along this border, we've all seen an increase in both the presence, the readiness, the perception of readiness, and what you're hearing right now, the tempo of the back and forth. What do you feel is happening today? Is it even accelerating even more today as we try to understand when the actual assault itself could begin?",

But I don't think we have a good assessment yet of how imminent that assault might be.I mean, the guns that we're looking at here that you can see on your screens now are heavy howitzers. We saw them coming in on flatbed trucks just a couple of days ago. We saw them at this location digging in late yesterday. Now, we're seeing them today dug in, in action, firing long sustained salvos of this targeted artillery fire at Hamas positions. And you can see the flashes from the guns here. You can see the dust rising up from where they're dug in the field. You can hear the boom of the outgoing shell. What we can't hear from here is the impacts in Gaza itself. But I think when we try to judge how close any ground invasion incursion might be, my sense is there's definitely-- there are far more troops in position, but it's still a build potentially towards that. I don't think the forces are in place for that, but definitely postured and ready, readying for when it might happen.",

You also hear from where we are, thuds in Gaza, as those airstrikes from Israel continue. It is just a way to remember that all of these locations are just miles from each other, right, that you're talking about a very small distance, that when we're talking about this fire and you're talking about what we're hearing, and it is just something to keep in mind, right, that you are talking about extremely small distances.",

      "sentences": "And 25 Americans killed. There were 17 still accounted for as of this morning, Poppy. So, that number could continue to rise, but it is a somber reality that the death toll of known deaths is still going up. And interesting what you heard there, obviously no daylight between them.One thing I know we all heard there echoed, Phil and Poppy, was when they described the actual attack itself, they both talked about young people being burned alive. They used those words. They talked about parents being executed in front of their children and children in front of their parents. And it was very clear that those words were -- they had agreed to that. That was very clear and there was no daylight between them. I will say one thing, Poppy, in that vein, Secretary Blinken could not have been more clear, the United States has Israel's back, then going through the aircraft carrier, the world's largest being deployed to the Eastern Mediterranean, increase in air force, supplies for the Iron Dome, any military need Israel needs. However, it was interesting, I thought, that he said one thing, how Israel does this matters and striving. for a different standard and that there is value in human life and dignity. It seemed to be as sort of horrific as this is. The value of civilian life is so crucial. And then he went on to draw the distinction between Hamas as a brutal and repressive terrorist organization and the actual needs and desires and ambitions of the Palestinian people, a distinction that he was very clear to draw, as you all saw, of course, Prime Minister Netanyahu himself still reflecting the shock and rage that so many here feel, using the word evil and talking about spitting out Hamas as the world spit out ISIS. You could feel that rage coming off of him. But I think some important words from Blinken of caution about civilian life as well in this speech. Phil and Poppy?",

It has been as robust as we've ever seen from any administration, this administration included.I want to bring in Nic Robertson, because when you talk about that balance that Erin is mentioning, you heard it from President Biden, you heard it again from the secretary of state of the need for moral clarity, the need for recognizing the Palestinian people as a separate entity from Hamas, and then you listen to Prime Minister Netanyahu who talk about the comparative, the analog to ISIS, which U.S. officials have made as well, in eliminating Hamas as ISIS was eliminated in his words. How does that work given the area for which they will be operating in when an incursion begins?",
