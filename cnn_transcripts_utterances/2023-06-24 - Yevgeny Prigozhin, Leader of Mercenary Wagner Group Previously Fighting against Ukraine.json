We're following breaking news right now out of Russia, major historic breaking news. President Vladimir Putin facing the greatest threat to his authority since he first rose to power some 23 years ago. Putin is accusing his one-time ally, Yevgeny Prigozhin of an armed rebellion, his words, armed rebellion. Prigozhin says his forces have taken control of key military facilities in the city of Voronezh and the region of Rostov-on-Don. He threatens to move on to Moscow, which is not too far away, if Russia's top general and defense minister don't meet with him. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF THE WAGNER GROUP (through translator): Again, we came here, we want to receive the chief of general staff Shoigu, and so they are here, and so they are here, we will be located here, blockading the city of Rostov, and we will go to Moscow.

Now, they believe that tensions would mount, and we're seeing that play out now. But the fact that they have been gathering intention and assessing this power struggle indicates just how important it was for the White House to understand this, especially its ramifications, or ramifications it could have in the war in Ukraine. Now, of course, part of that statement, I mentioned, includes discussions with allies and partners. Only moments ago, we heard from State Department, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has had a call with G-7 allies and E.U. counterparts, and in that call the secretary making clear that the support for Ukraine is unchanged and will remain moving forward. But clearly, those conversations are happening behind the scenes as U.S. officials try to gather exactly what is unfolding here and what may proceed. Now, we are waiting for any more comment from the White House, but as I mentioned, when that comes, it is still unclear, because they are, too, being cautious as they move forward.",

Kim, let me start with you. At least one Russian general has called this a coup, a coup. Prigozhin says it's not a coup but a march for justice. His words.

You mentioned just a couple of moments ago about this severe embarrassment Putin is facing. He could control the message that is seen by his own people, and Russians have been watching Prigozhin, the Wagner chief, decompensate for months, having all sorts of outbursts online.But now, this direct challenge is something that is being seen in Delhi, in Beijing, Latin America, Africa, places that Putin needed for diplomatic, military, and economic support, so he needs to show that his house, that he can get his house back in order. I think that any challenge that might have come, the kind of coup that the west had been hoping for, inhouse rivals taking Putin out, is less likely because for them, Prigozhin is a wild card, someone they can't work with, someone who is a folk hero who could challenge them. That doesn't change the fact that they could use Prigozhin as some sort of fall guy. Again, we're in wildcard territory.",

And as this began, as Prigozhin targeting only defense ministry leadership, given that the Russian president has now publicly called this an act of treason, Prigozhin, whether he wanted to or not, is in direct confrontation with the Russian president, and apparently sending his forces towards Moscow. Let me give you a sense of what the western intention view is of it atthis moment. And they will acknowledge that they have limited understanding of everything, but they are -- British intelligence is calling this an outright military confrontation in Russia. In addition to that, what they're watching closely for now is the reaction of regular Russian military units to Prigozhin. Wagner operates somewhat independently. This is a private militia, in effect. But there's been evidence, some evidence, at least, that as his forces have moved through Russia, that there's been at least a passive response from some regular Russian military units. So the test going forward will be, is that widespread or isolated, with particular attention, I'm told, towards how Russia's National Guard reacts to those forces as they attempt to move north. The other point I would make, Wolf, is that Rostov-on-Don, which Prigozhin's forces already appear to have taken over, is the key logistical hub and planning hub for Russian military operations inside Ukraine. So the effects on Russia's campaign in Ukraine are very real going forward. It's a supply issue. It's a command issue. And so the repercussions here, certainly inside Russia, but also inside Russia's campaign in Ukraine.",

And you have the prospect here, right, of Putin then having to unleash his military forces still loyal to him against targets inside Russia, right? Because you have, in effect, an armored column heading up the highway toward the Russian capital here. So in addition to road blocks and so on, whatever he can throw up, and I know there's been some evidence of that in and around the Russian capital, but also on the highway heading north towards Moscow, you have the prospect of Russia firing on Russia here, which is just remarkable.

[10But I think in the next 24 to 36 hours, to Jim's point, Putin cannot allow him to remain in power because of the other elements of Russian power that could move against Putin in the interim and take advantage of this. So I think after dark, you're going to see possibly some sort of targeted special operations raid to specifically take Prigozhin out. Prigozhin hasn't been very careful about his communications. And the problem is, the longer they let this go on, the more they allow some of these military forces to hear of this and possibly back Prigozhin up. Then his 25,000 force might swell to something that is more of a challenge. The moment he tries to march directly -- he's still, what, 500, 600 miles away from Moscow -- the moment he tries to march up that road, I think they're really going to -- you're going to see Russian on Russian force power.",

In his speech, he harkened back to World War I, and the horrific nature of the civil war that erupted in 1917 and how many lives that took, and what that meant for the Russian nation. And so Putin is very, very worried about restarting that. But as Kim says, he cannot allow this to continue, and Prigozhin is calling his bluff. The Chechens are on the outskirts of Rostov-on-Don.

But it was really hard to tell whether that tension was actually going to result in something like this. As Beth Sanners said earlier this hour, it is really difficult for U.S. intelligence officials to predict that kind of tipping point.And so when all of this happened last night, it really did catch U.S. and western and European and other officials off guard because of the speed with which it unfolded. We are told that U.S. officials did convene emergency meetings across the administration last night to figure out exactly what was going on, and how to respond. But we're also told that they have been very careful here not to weigh in publicly because they simply do not want to give Russian President Vladimir Putin any fodder to be able to say that the U.S. and the west is interfering in any way, or, of course, that they are actually fanning the flames of what they are calling an armed rebellion by Prigozhin and the Wagner group. Now, it is unclear to U.S. and European officials just how far in advance Prigozhin had been planning this attack. Again, they did not see any overt signs that Prigozhin was planning to storm Rostov, for example, and take his forces even further north and towards Moscow. One source familiar with the intelligence did say it appears it probably took at least several days of planning, but another source noted to us, Wolf, that Rostov is very close to the front lines where Wagner was operating inside Ukraine. So it may not have required much forethought. So these are the kinds of things that the U.S. and the west right now are trying to figure out and gather more intelligence on, Wolf.",

He is confronting him face on, so now he needs to make sure that the others, strong military leaders around him, Ramzan Kadyrov being the principal one, the Chechen leader, that he has his loyalty, and he got that very quickly, Kadyrov coming in and following behind Putin, calling what Prigozhin was doing treason.He has called, Putin has also spoken with the leaders that have been put in place in the breakaway regions inside Ukraine, they of course have folded in behind Putin. Interestingly, one of them, though, in the Donetsk region, the Russian-backed leader there, has said this is a difficult situation because Prigozhin and in his fights there had actually done actually the impossible. That's high praise. Yet he also came out and said he supports Putin. Putin has called neighboring countries as well. I think if you look historically, when the Soviet Union was going down, those neighboring states said that they were behind the Soviet leadership, but when the reality push came to shove and the Soviet Union collapsed, of course they weren't. They were ready to break away. So I think that we can't take everything that we hear at face value. But Prigozhin is tactically smart. He has a narrative that resonates with the troops, that resonates with some of the population. He appears to be holed up. He has sent a small mobile force north toward Moscow. And it will be a win for him, if Russian forces go out and kill other Russians in the full sight of the media in Russia. That's Prigozhin's strength, to play up his hand as much as he can while he can in media, on social media channels while Putin controls the main narrative on the main principle Russian state channels.",

Prigozhin, a former prisoner himself and self-styled hard man from Saint Petersburg, used Wagner to operate around the world. CNN has tracked Wagner mercenaries to the Central African Republic, Sudan, Libya, Mozambique, Ukraine, and to Syria. Along the way, Prigozhin enriched himself. Rights groups have accused Wagner of horrific violence, like this, Wagner fighters allegedly smashing the feet and hands of a Syrian prisoner with a sledgehammer in 2017. The man reportedly died after his ordeal. The images are incredibly disturbing, like so many others attributed to his group.For many years, Prigozhin denied the existence of Wagner, its work best done in secret. A master of mythmaking, it was Prigozhin and Wagner who set up the notorious Russian troll farm used to spread disinformation around the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

So we've got to be very alert to that.",

Now hour by hour, in an extraordinary day, where they began, remarkably, seizing the key southern town of Rostov-on-Don, we've seen their progress up the main highway, the M-4, through Voronezh, about halfway up there. The governor now saying that there have been combat measures taken by the Russian military. You're seeing there explosions from what looked like to be helicopter-based clashes over that particular city. A projectile landed there. State media, quoting to a local man talking about how the glass was blown out. State media also saying an MI-8 attack helicopter made a hard landing in that particular area.Then we have the next region, Lipetsk, the governor there saying that Wagner vehicles are moving through the region, saying that police and law enforcement are doing what they can to protect the local population. But now Kaluga, the next one, saying in fact that they're limiting traffic on the roads. Perhaps that's a sign of continued progress, Wolf.",
