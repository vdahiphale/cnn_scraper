CNN has learned Biden will announce a sweeping executive action that would shield some undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens from deportation, allowing them to work legally in the country as they seek citizenship. Now, the policy would apply to people who have been living in the United States for ten years, and would utilize an existing legal authority known as, quote, parole in place. Altogether, the moves could affect hundreds of thousands of people. And this would be the federal government's biggest relief program for immigration since the Obama era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or known as DACA. But perhaps not so coincidentally, Obama announced DACA in mid June of 2012, less than five months before his reelection as president and this is the second executive action Biden will make on immigration just in the last couple of weeks. Earlier this month, he made the decision to deny a silent and most of migrants entering the U.S. illegally and offered a preview of what were likely to see today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
