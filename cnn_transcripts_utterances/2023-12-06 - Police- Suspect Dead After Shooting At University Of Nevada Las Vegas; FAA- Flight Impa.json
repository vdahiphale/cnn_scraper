That part we do know.However, we do know this started around noon local time, just about an hour ago when we saw the campus impacted by this near Beam Hall. And also, there is some reports around student union as well but those are very close to each other, so not clear yet if those are two separate incidents.

There were even some tweets coming out from the campus where they are telling people to run, hide, fight if they needed to in this situation. We're seeing that the perimeter of what they had been locking off around UNLV has expanded some. But still, at this point, it looks like there is no further threat. But still unclear how many people may be injured, how many people may have lost their lives, Jake, and also noting that the LVMPD also did tweet that there seemed to be multiple people who were impacted by this.

As John was stating, universities are like many towns, many cities. They have their own protocols for communication. It appears they did this very quickly for the students with the police and the universities both doing alerts.It's the best that you can do for the communities, just basically tell them what's going on and what they need to do. In this case, run, hide, or fight. In this instance, it looks like there's a lot of hiding in the sense of locking the door, those are the kinds of protocols that happened at colleges and universities all the time. The second, of course, is it's Las Vegas, high tourism area, high tourism time. I was there a couple weeks ago, they had the Las Vegas Grand Prix. They have the Super Bowl coming up in January and that means that there are a lot of people a familiar with the area who might not have access to communications. But what that also means is that this is a very professional group of people. I know both the police and emergency management very well. They've learned a lot since October 1st, 2017. That was a terror attack from the MGM Studio, that -- at the Country Music Festival that killed so many. They are very focused on family unification, because that had been a big challenge in 2017. This is a -- these are younger people, they are adults, they are in college, but they have parents that are still very involved with their lives. There's a lot of communication and family communication going on as well. So, those are sort of the top line issues that are under consideration until we find out the magnitude of this, and now that the suspect is killed.",

This is a really large and swath -- live swath of ground stop here that impacts flights pretty much everywhere on the western U.S. We are talking about 1,200 flights so far delayed according to theFAA. They could be delayed an hour. They could be delayed even longer. The FAA says this is specifically for security incidents and that there is a chance that this could get extended. But this is impacting flights not only from places like San Francisco and Oakland, but all the way to Denver. A really big airport that is right there on the strip and a big hot spot for travelers. We know that this will have an impact and oftentimes when these do go in place, there is a ripple effect on travel elsewhere.

I think you will probably take the shape of here is where the incident started, this is how we responded, this is where we encounter the gunman.It appears, and all of this is subject to change because you understand, having done way too many of these, the fluidity and preliminary nature of this information. But it appears that the suspect was encountered by police. I don't know if that is the Las Vegas University Police, the University of Las Vegas has its own police department. But that was the responding Clark County Police. That is how the suspect came to be deceased. We have heard numerous reports of a possible second suspect. Now, let me go full stop here. That is almost 100 percent common in these incidents. And most often, there is no suspect, no additional suspect other than the original shooter. But the way that occurs is people see plainclothes police arriving or running away from more towards where they are supposed to deploy, not in uniform with a weapon out, and those calls turn into possible second shooter. We will have to sort through whether this gunman was alone, which is the indicator we are getting from the police tweet. But they have -- they have to go through these reports and look for those people. So that's where we are right now. The number of casualties is still uncertain. Obviously the shooter is the -- at least one dead. There may be an additional. And what I'm given to understand, there is a handful of people either shot or injured, perhaps half a dozen. But that is all still developing as they continue to use entry tools and key cards, where they have them, to get in those rooms to see if anyone else was injured or worse, is hiding somewhere that hasn't been located yet.",

But they would not be having this press conference if they were still counting bodies. So, that's -- I hate to sound so crude about, it what we just basically know how these work. There is no way they will go out there and not at least have some semblance of what the numbers are.Look, this is a -- this is a 330-acre area with 30,000 students. So, this is a big area. They have communication systems that will tell them what areas were secure and not secure, and also where the gunman may have been by the stage and where he may have traversed to. So, we will hopefully hear about what the numbers are, how many were shot, what the injuries are. Here is something that comes up in these active shooter cases. This happened with Michigan State University just earlier this year. We have these active shooter cases, someone dies, maybe two, lots of people injured and they are not considered mass shootings because in our definition, we only count the dead. And I think that's just -- I mean, I honestly think that's just ridiculous. A lot of people were shot at, that is a mass shooting. But in the way we define it by the FBI standards, and most journalism standards, it is four dead not including the assailant.

It sounds silly but it's not because how are we going to get an inventory of what is actually happening in this country if we define mass shootings as just the person got lucky and wasn't killed? But they were shot at.And so, this is the challenge right now is if we actually want an accounting of what is actually happening in this country, it would take into account that a lot of these lone gunman, we don't know what kind of gun it was. We don't know what his motivation is. I'm not even pretending that I do at this stage, but that these incidents at these public facilities, lots more people are shot than are killed and in some of these incidences we should consider those mass shootings. We'll find out what is happening on the ground but it's, you know, it's worth raising in this instance because the last major -- or one of the last major university college shootings in Michigan, Michigan state, you know, the guy happened to not kill as many people as he really, really hurt and that is therefore sometimes not considered a mass shooting.",

I think we have passed 37 for the period that we're looking at, into 38. This might be 39 today, depending on the numbers. I think they defined a mass shooting as a shooting incident where four or more people are shot. So that's a -- that's a problem. There is also the question of, as Juliette was talking about, what about the motive here? Is this a student? Is this somebody from off campus? Is this related to events going on overseas, as the FBI director was concerned about yesterday. And I say that in the context of this is, Las Vegas Metro last Friday, just a few days ago, arrested a 16-year-old suspect who was gathering bomb components and posting on an online message board about following ISIS propaganda and launching an attack in Las Vegas that would lead the Zionist know, you know, that I'm here.

Our update right now is that we do have a reunification center that has opened up at the convention center. That's at the North Hall. It will take time to transport students over to that area.But if you can't get a hold of your loved ones right now, your kids, or somebody that you are concerned with, that now would be the place to go and try to go ahead and do that reunification. We will have people there to assist you. We also have a phone number. It is being staffed. It is 702455-AIDE. And there will be a website opening up. It is facofsouthernnevada.com, okay? And so, that is our current information that we have for victims services and that will change also as -- or be updated as necessary but we will have those resources there. Understand when you call that number or you check the website, the information right now will still be limited and there won't be any specific information as far as individuals that have been injured or deceased.",

They are also working on a reunification center for students and others on campus.

They know what the count is.I think it's better for, you know, even if they are not -- even if it's a floor, to give a number of how many people have been transported. If it's a low number of people, we feel calmer. If it's a high number, we know what kind of incident we are facing. The family unification center is one of these lessons learned after the terror attack in Las Vegas. It's at the convention center. It sort of pops up, they sort of know how to do this at this stage. And they are trying to get students with family members if they haven't been able to connect particular parents that can't get their kids on the phone or find out whether their kids are okay. So they know how to run this. They have separate -- what's called assistant facilities, it's a euphemism for, you know, a place in which family members who may have children or friends who've been shot or are taken separately, then there is a unification center. So, we didn't hear much about that so that might give us a hint about what the numbers might be. But some number of people have been shot. We just don't know how bad and -- nor do we know anything more about the background, the age, the gender of the shooter. So, hopefully, we'll hear more. Those are all known -- those are all known facts right now. And I'm -- as you know I've been a big proponent of getting that stuff out there quickly. So you can calm communities that are rightfully concerned. Nevada is an open carry state. And it is familiar with guns in the sense that this is -- we should not be surprised that this is a community where lots of people have guns and so this is a community that also you don't want them taking stuff into their own hands. You want to calm people and public safety needs to be able to do that even if they don't know every single detail.",

So, Brett, I understand you're still on campus, tell us what's happening where you are, what you're seeing. FORREST: Yeah, Jake. So, we toned in to the press conference here. We heard that there is no threat but we are still sheltering in place. We are in one of the buildings on campus. We've been here for several hours now. You know, I was here for an assignment interviewing students here at UNLV, just about the work they're on, and that was when they started running in around 11:45 saying a shooter, and we have been sheltering in place inside since then. We are told that they're coming building by building, slowly letting out each building, making sure there are no additional victims or anyone else inside. So, they might take a while to get to us, so we are all inside here, just prepared to wait another hour or two. But we do feel safe in here, thankfully. The students -- I'm with dozens of students and faculty and staff, they have been checking their phones, messaging loved ones, getting whatever news they could from the Internet. But for now, we do feel safe where we are at least and we're going to have to stay here for the time being until we get the all clear.",

They know exactly what the community went through in 2017.And so, it is -- it is a scary and unfortunate situation, I'm sure a lot of them are worried, maybe their classmates or friends amongst the possible victims. It's just hard to say there are so many rumors swirling right now and the students are getting whatever update they can.
