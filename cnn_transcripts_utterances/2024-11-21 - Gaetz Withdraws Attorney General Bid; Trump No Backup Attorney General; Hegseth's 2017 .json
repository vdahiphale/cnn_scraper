Israel rejecting the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of war crimes in Gaza. Tempering tariffs. China's plan to help exporters facing potential higher U.S. costs. And under the hammer. We find out what's hot and what's not in the global art world with the CEO of world's largest online marketplace, Artsy. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, we begin with the first post-election setback for U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump, the decision by Matt Gaetz to withdraw his embattled bid for attorney general. Gaetz saying in a post on X that momentum for his nomination was, quote, \"strong,\" but that he was unfairly becoming a distraction from the critical work of the Trump fans team. All this as new details about his alleged sexual misconduct began surfacing, Gaetz denying he did anything wrong, and but one Republican on Capitol Hill says Gaetz did the right thing by dropping out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND):  It was made clear that there's not a path, and if there's not a path, you're going to spend a lot of political capital for losing cause. And it wouldn't have been worth it. I know enough people that were a hell no in the conference to know that -- the path would have been very, very difficult if possible. And I doubt it was.

He could hardly have chosen a more controversial figure than Matt Gaetz and won, who incidentally is deeply disliked even among Republicans on Capitol Hill for this job of attorney general, but he turned it into a show of strength, believing that he could force Gaetz through and get him confirmed soon after he was inaugurated president next year. A sign of hubris, I think, by the president. I don't think we should go too far, however, in describing this as a defeat, I think we're going to see an avalanche of controversies and chaos and outrage in the next two months before Trump is inaugurated, and this will be a very disruptive and turbulent presidency. I don't think, in the long-term, this really affects Trump's strength in the Republican Party. Gaetz was quite a unique nominee. And in some ways, having stood up to this nomination, I think some Republican senators might now be more willing to vote to confirm some of those other deeply provocative picks for his cabinet that Trump has already made.",

You know, in any other administration, thesepeople would never have been picked, but Trump is looking for people that are completely loyal to him. He wants people who will shake up these government departments who he believes are deeply biased against him. In the case of Hegseth, he wants him to go after generals who Trump believes were an impediment to his attempts to wield unchecked power during his first term. I would also look for the nominee of the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, who traveled to meet President Assad of Syria, who appears to have sometimes amplified Russian propaganda. Her nomination has been overshadowed, I think, a lot by the Gaetz and Hegseth stuff. That is going to get more scrutiny now as well. There are a bunch of Republicans, especially sort of foreign policy hawks who have great reservations about her. But I think history tells us and Trump's strength in the GOP tells us that, you know, Republican senators tend to genuflect towards Trump when they face great pressure. So, this, I think, is, as I said, a unique case and perhaps will not set a pattern going forward.",

So, this really could have an impact on travel. Let's look for a second at Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, who also faces similar charges from the ICC. He decided not to go to South Africa for a summit there, where he would normally have gone, because of the potential that he could have been arrested and sent to the ICC. There -- so, there are going to be real world effects for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Of course, a couple of his favorite allies like the United States and India are not signatories to the Rome Statute. He'll have no problems traveling there. But yes, this is going to circumscribe what he can do and how effective he can be a leader on the internet on the international stage, places he used to go to without thinking one second about it.

If you go to a website that isn't Google, but there are ads on it, guess what, a lot of those ads are served by Google too. Google's constantly getting paid. And of course, they have a lot of control on all of this because you're going through the Google Chrome browser, or you're on your Android phone and you're using Chrome or you're using your iPhone and you're in Safari and Google pays $20 billion a year to Apple so it can be the default search engine in that.

They didn't pay people at that point to start using it, they just did things better and people sort of marched on over to them. And if you take away the Chrome browser, if you separate it from Google, you're going to -- you know, there's going to be some other company that has different interests that is going to start to program it in a certain way that is going to basically break that marriage, right? And what's going to happen is consumers going to be left as sort of the children of divorce. I don't think that we're going to be happy with that. And in fact, when I was just doing these brief surveys, anecdotal surveys on social media, people are like, I don't want this, you know. So, you know, look, I'm not going to say that Google's blameless. I'm not going to say that something needs to be done here, but I think there are other remedies that we can pursue that really focus on, you know, their control of the ad market, which I do think is problematic and the control of how we use the web, because search engine optimization, you know, every website you go to is built to serve Google because everyone knows Google's the number one search engine.",

Artsy, the world's largest online art marketplace, connects users to thousands of galleries and more than a million artworks and new artists too, allowing its clients and customers to keep up with the latest moves and shakers in the art sector.

And I'm notsuggesting we want to replace the human art adviser, but what we provide are things like editorial insights, personal recommendations, pricing, transparency and transact ability for works of art. And so, for example, just the other week we wrote an article about what determines the price of an artwork. And so, if you're new to the art market and you're not really sure what you should be looking for, we provide a lot of informational content, educational content for you to start learning about the market. And then, as you interact with the site and start liking, following, saving works of art. We start to bring more and more of that art that you are expressing an interest in right to you so that it becomes easier and easier for you to discover it and then, ultimately, fall in love with the right work of art and take it home with you.",

And I think the level of money that was anticipated to be raised was somewhere between $1.2 and $1.6 billion dollars. And yet, as with every article it reads like, oh, this didn't sell or this didn't sell. And there's sort of an air of doom, I think, across the market that it's not as good as last year. Jeffrey, what do your numbers tell us about what's going on in the art market?

I think anytime a work of art is selling for more than$100 million dollars in an auction, that is a really strong signal of what is happening at the upper end of the market. What I think is equally interesting is what is happening for, you know, those of us who are not in the market for $100 million works or even $5 million works. But if you're looking for, you know, the $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 work, there's a robust market that is still happening. What we're seeing on Artsy, for example, our e-commerce transaction activity is actually up 38 percent year over year. And we're particularly seeing a lot of strength in prints and additions, which are up 60 percent on a year over year basis. So, yes, the upper end of the market is showing a little bit of softness, maybe compared to a couple years ago, but certainly, not a bad week for the top auction houses. And what I'm seeing in the rest of the market is a continued resilience. The collector continues to fall in love with works of art, discover new artists, want to collect those paintings or prints and additions and bring them home with them. And so, that activity is still occurring.",

But in all seriousness, you know, that as a conceptual workof art is on everyone's lips, and it is a provocative work of art. It is challenging us to think about what is art. What is the value of art? But I think there are really two key takeaways from the sale of that work. The first is those conceptual works are creating some buzz and engaging new audiences. And that I think is really important for the art market. The second is, you know, the buyer is somebody who generated a lot of wealth from digital currency. And so, what I think you're seeing is a real evolution of the art market. It's bringing in new types of collectors, new vectors of wealth and purchasing activity.

His batting average was 310, 130 RBIs this season as well. If he gets it, it would be his third MVP award. He won it twice in the American League in 2021 and 2023. So, if he gets it now in the National League, he would be only the second player ever to do it in both leagues. And he would also make history by becoming the first designated hitter ever to win it.
