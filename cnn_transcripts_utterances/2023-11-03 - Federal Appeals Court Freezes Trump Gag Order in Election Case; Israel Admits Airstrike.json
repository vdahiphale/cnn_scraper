      "sentences": "Wolf, here, the federal appeals court has temporarily frozen a gag order imposed on former President Trump here in Washington and they have fast-tracked an oral argument about whether this is constitutional and they'll hear those arguments on November 20th.Now, this gag order was imposed by Judge Tanya Chutkan. She's the federal judge overseeing the election subversion case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith here in the district. And she imposed this gag order barring Trump from targeting witnesses in the case, members of the court staff and even the special counsel itself, the prosecutors working on this case. And she imposed that gag order at the request of prosecutors but she did not limit his ability to talk about Washington D.C., the potential jury pool or the Justice Department, which prosecutors had also sought protections for those two groups. But here, she has argued, she has said, look, I understand he has a First Amendment right but that must yield to the orderly administration of justice. And she said that she has to put on a trial she needs to protect members of her staff, people involved in this case just trying to do their jobs, and that is why she has imposed this gag order and she also declined to freeze it herself while these appeals play out. The former president's lawyers, though, have argued that this is a violation of his First Amendment. They point to the fact that he is once again running for the White House and that what they describe as, quote, political speech deserves the highest protection. But a three-judge panel will hear arguments on this issue in just a few weeks. This is a pretty fast track here, pretty quick move from this decision to freeze two oral arguments. Wolf, it appears that the court of appeals is mindful of the need to decide this issue quickly to keep this case moving along.",

I think, though, and Elie was hinting at this, it would be really foolhardy, I think, of Trump to violate the gag order that isn't currently in place, but to violate the terms of it now.

You are not supposed to intimidate witnesses, right? And it's unheard of to attack prosecutors or attack the judge, so an extraordinary circumstance here. His team, though, at least wanted to be heard by the appellate court, and potentially they could try to appeal this all the way to the Supreme Court, depending how this goes, on this issue of political speech and the potential infringement on his First Amendment.

The Red Cross weren't actually involved with the convoy but they were aware that it was being established and it was leaving the hospital. And what the IDF say is, look, we had intelligence that there were IDF -- rather Hamas operatives and Hamas weapons being smuggled out on those ambulances. And they say that's why they targeted that particular convoy. So, it was, again, intelligence leading to a specific targeted strike. But once again, as we've seen, civilian casualties as a result, the total now in Gaza, according to the Hamas- led Ministry of Health officials, there is more than 9,000 civilian deaths and more than 22,000 civilian casualties.

But he did not order his forces into the breach, as it were, to open up a second front here.That had been the fear. There had been a great deal of anticipation here in the north. I know that U.S. and Israeli military officials were watching his words very closely. And as you mentioned, Northern Israel was on a heightened state of alert in advance of his speech because they feared that's exactly what the Hezbollah leader was going to do, announce he was ordering his forces in. But he didn't do that. He said it was possible, but not doing it today. In fact, he seemed to make a case for the status quo, saying that Hezbollah's threats and presence on the southern border of Lebanon, not far from where we are right here, was enough to already occupy Israel's attention. And it is true that some 70,000 forces have been deployed to the north, but he seemed to say that is enough for now. We should also note that he seemed to make a deliberate effort to put some space between Hezbollah and Hamas for those October 7th attacks, praising them, praising those depraved terror attacks on October 7th, but saying in his words, it was a 100 percent Palestinian operation, that is to say, Hezbollah was not involved. He even said that Hezbollah was not bothered that it had not been given advance notice of those attacks. So, it seemed an effort there by the Hezbollah leader to put some space between himself and Hamas to say that he reserves the right to attack in numbers from the north, but, Wolf, to this point, has not yet given those orders. And I'll tell you the anticipation, the nervousness was high given that last night we saw some of the largest barrage of Hezbollah rockets into Northern Israel.

We are hearing a number of Democrats now joining in that call as well, including in a new letter.

The Pentagon had acknowledged it would help Israel with special operations forces designed to gather intelligence and planning for a hostage rescue effort. But, of course, key to that is knowing where the hostages are.So, take a look at these flight tracks that show you where the drones have been flying, focusing their efforts on Southern Gaza there. It's unclear what or how much they've learned or been able to pass to the Israelis, but you can see there the focus, the effort and the help the U.S. has been providing to Israel in this case and the hostage rescue effort, obviously, a key focus of both countries. In terms of what the drones are doing, take a look at this. These are unarmed surveillance drones. They are not armed with any sorts of missiles. They're seeking intelligence on the hostages to share with Israel. And, importantly, the U.S. is not using these for targeting or for intel gathering to pass on to the Israelis for targeting. So, the U.S. very clear there, as the Pentagon acknowledged earlier today, that these drones have been operating over Gaza since October 7th. In terms of what else the U.S. military is doing in the region, we now have two carrier strike groups in the Middle East, the Ford and the Eisenhower, operating and exercising together. You can see the two carriers there at the bottom of that picture. This has been going on for three days. These exercises there, the U.S. with a massive show of force in the region to deter Iran and its proxies from trying to take advantage of the situation and get involved. The Pentagon announced about a week-and-a-half ago that one of those carriers, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, would soon be transiting through the Suez Canal and head into the Middle East, putting significant forces, Wolf, on both Israel's western border and its southern border.",

And we've got to establish a safe corridor where the Palestinians can go and get out of harm's way.I thought it was announced this morning and yesterday that Gaza City is now encircled. That to me is significantly important because where we know that a new Israeli number of the Hamas leaders and others and their weapons, maybe a lot of it was concentrated in Gaza City, then maybe you can start securing an area and making sure that none of the Hamas soldiers or terrorists, they're not really soldiers, they're terrorists, none of them escapes into the safe zone, which causes Israel having to chase them in the safe zones. And so -- and I think it's significantly and important also that the hostages are returned. So, I think that there's dialogue and conversation and negotiations that are taking place. And I hope that in that we can develop these safe zones so that the Palestinians have a place to go because they should not be harmed because of the terrorist attacks that took place by Hamas and/or utilized and harmed because Hamas is utilizing them as cover.
