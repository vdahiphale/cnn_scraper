Police staged early morning raids across the country detaining more than two dozen people suspected of conspiring to attack the parliament. Another two dozen people are being investigated, prosecutors, say members of the far right group but called right Citizens Movement, followed conspiracy myths and QAnon ideology. Germany has been struggling to get a grip on far right extremism in recent years. I want to bring in CNN's Nic Robertson for more on this developing story. He joins us now from London. Good to have you with us Nic! So a significant number of arrests right across Germany in about a dozen states plus two other countries. What can you tell us about those arrested?",

There are pictures of his arrest the man in a tweed jacket, an elderly looking gentleman and a tweed jacket. We also know that there was a former member of parliament arrested as well; a member of the fairly right wing party, the AFD was arrested as well. The conspiracy, though, and the plotting and planning that the police believe was underway was of a violent nature that it was going to target the Bundestag, the parliament, literally, and tried to try to disrupt it tried to stop it working and then impose their own parallel government that they had appointed ministers, and that they were ready to essentially get rid of the federal government and put in a new one. And this is because the theory the conspiracy theory that they subscribe to, believes that the current German state is illegitimate. And I think this gets to what we heard from the Interior Minister earlier, who said that they believe in violent fantasies and conspiracy ideologies. So it does seem that the authorities have headed off what would have been a very dangerous and potentially deadly plot and plan.",

Their notion thatthe German state is illegitimate is based on a theory that says that post World War II, the new German State that came out of World War II was established and run and controlled by the allies who fought against Nazi Germany. Of course, that's ridiculous. But like the QAnon conspiracy theorists, they take conspiracy theories that one about the pizza parlor that became so well-known and had people showing up there et cetera that do not stand the test of scrutiny. They stick to them, and it clearly in the case of this Former MP, have involved politicians, you know, previously, potentially good standing and the country enough to be in Bundestag. But the conspiracy itself seems to have been shared and believed at a hardcore level by the 52 people that the police were going after today. We know they got 25. They know there are 27 members still out there. So these conspiracy theories have fed out, as we saw with QAnon fed into the broader population bought supporters within and members from within the broader population and in this case, again, as was seen in Washington, D.C., where members of QAnon turned up using violent means to gain access to the seat of power. And that was exactly the similar type of plan that this group was planning in Germany, and in this case, they were planning to use weapons it appears from what we've heard from the German Attorney General.",

So a 50/50 Senate split means that the Democrats have had an evenly split power sharing agreement with the Republicans. A 51/49 Democratic majority, that means that the Democrats will be able to process legislation and nominations even faster. So let me give you an example. You've got the Senate Judiciary Committee; among many other things it approves judicial nominations before it goes to the full Senate. That Committee has 22 members in that power sharing agreement 11 Democrats 11 Republicans with this majority now there'll be 12 Democrats and 10 Republicans. So essentially, what Warnock's win does is it removes this procedural hurdle that could slow down a judicial nomination process. Look, this was an historic night. This is the first time that we saw two black candidates compete for the U.S. Senate here in Georgia, Senator Raphael Warnock he won by 95,000 points, which means he extended his lead from the 37,000 points that he had in November.

And so we are seeing a number of Republicans pointing fingers saying that Donald Trump is to blame for plucking Herschel Walker out of obscurity and putting him into the Senate race. And it's clear that Trump's ability to pick winners has been very much cast into doubt by the results of this election, not only losing a Senate seat in Georgia, but also losing in places like Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Nevada places where Republicans thought they had a good shot.

But it does appear that now that Democrats have a clear majority in the Senate that things like judicial picks will be able to move through more quickly. And there won't be as much bickering over sort of what parts of Biden's agenda gets to move forward. When he wants to put in people into cabinet positions, he now will have a faster track to try to get that through and when it comes to bipartisan legislation, to the extent that Republicans in the House will be willing to deal on some bipartisan legislation. Biden has a clear path in the Senate to be able to get some support for the things that he wants to get done now. It's a very narrow path because Democrats only have a two seat majority in the Senate and they don't have the House majority.

And so it's clear that the party is starting to make do a little bit of soul searching and trying to decide whether it wants to move away from Trumpism. But it's not yet clear that the voters are ready to move away from Trumpism.

And why is it so important? Because look at some of the changes, for example, the government says that no longer will people need to be required to get negative PCR tests to go into public places like shopping malls, for example? Previously, a lot of cities required people to line up and get tests every 48 hours just to do things like travel on public transport or to go to public places, asymptomatic COVID cases people with mild symptoms and close contacts of COVID cases are no longer going to be bundled off to government quarantine, where there have been reports of kind of poor accommodations, poor food poor sanitary conditions, they can now do home quarantine. And another big change is the lifting of restrictions on travel between regions and provinces. So I spoke with a friend in Shanghai and told her about this for the first time and she said this is wonderful. I can go travel to see my parents who I haven't seen in another province in months now. There is a flip side to some of this excitement, and that is that the Chinese government has been warning about the fears the dangers of COVID for years now. And now suddenly, the narrative is changing. And it's saying hey, this new variant is milder, you can live with it. There are still prominent fears in the population. There is a run on over the counter medicines for fever and respiratory illnesses, for example, at pharmacies, but there are some real threats as well. Epidemiologists are warning that there are large numbers of Chinese that are very vulnerable to COVID. For example, 23 percent of citizens over 80 are completely unvaccinated. That's like 8.4 million people now at risk. China is trying to rush out vaccines to these vulnerable parts of the population right now. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong.",
