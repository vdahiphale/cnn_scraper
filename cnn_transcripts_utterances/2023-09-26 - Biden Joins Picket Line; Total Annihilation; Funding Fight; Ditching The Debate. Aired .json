      "sentences": "Well, John, this is the latest and potentially the most high profile lawsuit that Hunter Biden has filed in recent weeks. He's been suing essentially over invasions of his privacy. In this case, he's suing Rudy Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani's companies and a lawyer who works with Rudy Giuliani or who had represented him until this summer, a man named Robert Costello.And assuming all of those entities and those two men for invading his data, essentially what Hunter Biden lays out here is that, he says, Rudy Giuliani and Robert Costello got access to a hard drive or data taken from a laptop that Hunter Biden says he won't admit that that's his laptop. But at least some of the data that they got, he says, is his or was his. And then, Rudy Giuliani and Robert Costello, he says, then proceeded to get into that hack -- into that laptop in a way that he alleges is against the law, at least for the purposes of this lawsuit. He says some of the reasons he has of knowing this is because Robert Costello, at one point in the New York magazine story, was logging into a laptop that he was saying was Hunter Biden's. Also Giuliani was talking about Hunter Biden's laptop and saying he had it on his podcast multiple times. And so, they're suing so that they can stop, that Hunter Biden is now trying to stop the continued access that he fears of his data. One of the things he writes in this lawsuit his lawyers, right, is that there's no dispute that defendants have, at least to some extent, access, tampered with, manipulated, altered, copied and damaged plaintiffs data. So they're going to court against Rudy Giuliani, a man facing multiple lawsuits on many different fronts really buried under legal fees right now. And it does come at the same time, of course, John, that Hunter Biden is facing his own criminal investigation, including some charges in Delaware and some ongoing Republican investigations on Capitol Hill.",

And the White House says that this visit is an opportunity for President Biden to show his solidarity with those UAW workers, and certainly an opportunity for the President to display his pro-union bonafides, and to put those on display.But there's also no question that this is an opportunity for President Biden to draw contrast with the man who is most likely at this point to become the Republican nominee in 2024. And that is Donald Trump. The former president is expected to head to Michigan tomorrow to deliver his own speech seizing on this UAW strike. But President Biden -- White House officials say that his visit has nothing to do with that one. Nonetheless, they are taking this opportunity to dry contrast with the former president saying that the former president \"talked big and delivered little,\" according to a White House factsheet released this morning, contrasting the policies of this president with the policies of the former president arguing that President Biden's policies have far more -- done far more to benefit unions and met domestic manufacturing. Now, there is also this broader question of the President in stepping into this picket line, is he indeed endorsing all of the union's perspectives and all of their bargaining positions in these negotiations. The White House press secretary yesterday declining to get into that question, saying simply that this is an opportunity for President Biden to show that he stands with these union workers.

That is where negotiators from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's office in Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office are working frantically. They worked late into the night to try to find a path forward on a short term spending bill that could get out of the Senate quickly gets sent to the house. And then the big question, of course becomes will House Speaker Kevin McCarthy put it on the floor.Now, that is assuming that the Senate can pass something. What they're looking at right now is a 45 day bill that would keep the government open for just a couple of weeks, and then give them additional time to have further negotiations on the full year spending package. Of course, there's a question, would that be enough time. These negotiations are very fluid and the timeline, of course for this could shift. But another thing to keep in mind here is that Ukraine funding, including the $24 billion in supplemental that the White House has requested could complicate the Senate's effort to move this forward quickly, which is why they may not include the full amount, they may not include all of Ukraine funding, if any, given the fact that Senator Rand Paul, a conservative, has already threatened to slow walk this process in the Senate if Ukraine funding is a piece of it. Now, Democrats and Republicans who support Ukraine funding view it as essential. There's a support for it but there may not be the time to move this through the Senate. So all of this is very much in flux, these negotiations are still happening, they're still ongoing. Things can always change. But watch for whether or not that Ukraine funding piece is attached to this short term spending bill, as negotiators in the Senate are hoping to get something over to the house very quickly. Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, still no agreement from Republicans on a short term solution, which means McCarthy could be in a position where he's jammed by the Senate. He gets this bill and then he has to decide is he going to put it on the floor and potentially risk ending his speakership, or does he hold back and love the government shutdown. So that is really the prospect that we're facing right now. The shutdown could start midnight on Saturday. Kate?",
