      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf, we have this very notable new statement, not just from the mediators, but from the leaders of these three countries, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt, that they put out just last night, really highlighting the urgency that they feel a cease-fire needs to be reached.There is a little bit of exasperation, if you read behind the lines. They're essentially saying that, after 10 months of this horrific war, that the suffering needs to end. I want to read you a part of this statement from these three heads of state. They say: \"The three of us and our teams have worked tirelessly over many months to forge a framework, and that is now on the table with only the details of implementation left to conclude. There is no further time to waste, nor excuses from any party for further delay. It is time to release the hostages, begin the cease-fire, and implement this agreement.\" They go on to talk about a possible bridging proposal, as they call it, that they could put forward. And, in that, you get a sense that they are tiring, perhaps of the proposals and counterproposals that have gone back and forth between Israel and Hamas. They are proposing a new date for this meeting. That is next Thursday, August 15. If this meeting goes ahead -- and Israel has said they will send a delegation, Hamas has not yet responded -- it would be attended by the main mediators. And in that case, as you see there on the screen, from here in the U.S., it would be the CIA director, Bill Burns. We have heard in the past few weeks that U.S. officials believe that a deal is close. But the death of the head of the Hamas political wing, Ismail Haniyeh, in Iran last week, believed to have been at the hands of Israel, that dealt a major blow to these negotiations. So this is certainly a step forward, an indication that these talks may be back on track. But make no mistake, Wolf, there are still major gaps that remain, a senior administration official saying just yesterday that they will be working feverishly in the next week leading up to this potential meeting to try to bridge those gaps, the urgency only heightened by the potential for those Hezbollah and Iran strikes on Israel that could be expected in the coming days -- Wolf.",

They have created -- Iranian operatives have created these two fake Web sites, both designed to look like news resources. One of them targeting a more left-leaning audience called former President Trump a -- quote -- \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a -- quote -- \"raving-mad litigiosaur.\" Another fake Iranian-backed outlet targeting more conservative audiences represented itself as a trusted news source for conservatives in Savannah, Georgia, titling itself -- quote -- \"Trusted Source For Conservative News,\" and really emphasized LGBTQ issues, as well as gender reassignment. Wolf, the Microsoft report also revealing an effort by Iranian operatives to try to hack the e-mail of a senior campaign official for a presidential campaign without detailing publicly which campaign that was. So, Wolf, what you're seeing here, a really broad-based effort by the Iranian government to try to join other nations like Russia and China who the intelligence community has said publicly are attempting to influence the outcome of the 2024 election.",

And with the new 200-meter champ, Gabby Thomas, on the squad as well, the Americans, Wolf, are heavy favorites to take gold.

Nobody before had ever won back-to-back Olympic golds in this event. She turned 25 this week in Paris, Wolf. She's broken the world record a mind-boggling six times now.
