It is small movements, not terribly significant. Down a bit, up a bit. I think it could be like this in the absence of any news. I think we could have a few days like this in the absence of any direction. The markets are quiet for summer. People are on holiday. Events of the day still remain. Europe's economy returns to growth after a rough couple of quarters. It's grown, but how fast? The UK has announced new plans to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea, square that with climate change commitments. And New York expands its rollout of e-scooters while Paris bans them. Tonight, the Lime chief executive joins me. We will discuss the best ways for cities to regulate popular scooters and e-bikes. It is Monday. We are live in New York, July the 31st, as I said, right in the heart of the summer. I am Richard Quest, and yes, in the summertime, I mean business. Good evening. The quiet day that we are seeing should not fool you into what's been otherwise a good strong month for the markets. All three major US averages have made significant gains in July. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P are both on track for their fifth straight winning month. The Dow closed lower only four times since the end of June. Now the reasons are well known: Falling US inflation has given the market and investors a sense of optimism and a growing belief the Fed will engineer a soft landing. The European economy is also showing some signs of promise, with the zone returning to growth in Q2. Even it was bad growth 0.3 percent, flat in Q1, headline inflation thereto is also low. Although arguably, not enough for the ECB to hold off increasing rates any further to make sure down to policy. CNN's Clare Sebastian is in London and takes us through the latest numbers.

      "sentences": "On the surface, this looks like a sign of resilience in the Euro area, a modest growth rate of 0.3 percentcompared to the previous three months after flatlining in the first quarter of the year, and shrinking in the one before that. Overall inflation also fell to 5.3 percent in July, which is exactly half its peak rate last October, when of course the war in Ukraine had caused energy prices to skyrocket. That shock, now clearly receding. A dig into the details, and there are still worrying signs. GDP growth seems to have been driven by just a few countries. Ireland grew by more than three percent, France by half a percent. But on the flip side, Germany, Europe's biggest economy was flat, and Italy actually contracted. And as for inflation, that top line number, also not the whole story. Core inflation when you strip out food and energy didn't change at all in July compared to June, and it is still more than twice the European Central Bank's medium term target. But for economists, all this just really adds to mounting concerns as data in recent weeks has shown business activity dropping, business loans falling to a record low as banks tighten credit standards, and an ongoing decline in economic sentiment. All of that economists say it means recession is still a risk and this would definitely raise the stakes for the European Central Bank as it tries to balance that risk with persistent inflation.

      "sentences": "Well, Richard, to be honest, most journalists are more pessimistic, and I think that's the world we'velived in, actually, from, oftentimes over the recent over many years, actually, but particularly in the recent past. We have been on the more optimistic side for a while. A year ago, nobody thought a soft landing was even possible, we were either going to be in spiraling inflation, or we were going to be in unemployment, and I'm speaking US here, you know, well, above five percent, some were arguing. And I think we've felt that consumers recognized this inflation was different than the systematic problems of the 1970s. It's hard to break an inflation regime of 40 years that we've lived in, and that the Fed would act and maybe it acted a bit slower than we all expected a year-and-a-half ago to get started on these rate increases, but when it acted, it acted decisively and I think it is now signaling that it thinks it can start to plateau, hopefully, where we are, some would argue maybe we'll have one more. And I think there is a very good chance for a soft landing here. There was enormous negativity around emerging markets, they're actually navigating better than people expected. Europe just had a quarter of growth. I agree with you, China is soft. That's certainly true, but it would be hard not to feel like we've made enormous progress from where -- what people were predicting a year ago, when there were so many negative headlines.",

In fact, inflation is often a salve to be able to raise prices, and use that to drive profitable growth. It's often an asset, particularly when the government is putting dollars in so many pockets as it was during COVID. So I think for many of our clients, this is a trickier period to navigate us, as consumers' tolerance for price increases have come down, you've got to get profitability in other ways. We're still in an uncertain environment, I think that plays through to help companies view their investment expectations. So I would say most of our clients are not finding this a down period, but they are finding it a period of high uncertainty, mixed views on the economic outlook, obviously, navigating a world of higher interest rates that haven't been seen for many, many years, and so I would say they would say it's not so easy right now.",

Lael Brainard, who is now at the National Economic Council, when she was on the Fed in 2019, so this was during the last administration -- talked about needing to think about inflation, not as a 2.00 target, but two percent over the long term, and I think she used a phrase called average inflation targeting to represent that there'd be periods, when you may not be at exactly two, just like we were under two for a long stretch in the prior decade, and a little over two is okay. So I don't think the Fed can or should relax the two percent target, but I think it can be more tolerant of a world where the inflation number starts with the two, but we're on a glide path to 2.0, but we don't necessarily get there fast. And I think particularly in a world where there's a de-risking in global supply chains, and where we're seeing actually wage growth at the bottom of the wage curve, which is what theoretically we want to close inequality gaps, I think that'd be a very strong logic to not go for 2.0.

Some generals were surprised that he declared himself as president, which is why they consider this a domestic dispute between the head of the presidential guard, General Tiani and President Bazoum and there could still be a path to restore Niger to a democracy.

In response to a freedom of information requests submitted by CNN, U.K. Border Force said revealing the text capability might aid the criminals facilitating the crossings and increased risk to life at sea. The Coast Guard declined to comment citing an ongoing investigation into the incident and a court case underway to prosecute the alleged driver of the boat. A new record was set for June with nearly 4000 people detected arriving to the U.K. But for those that do make it, they face an increasingly hostile welcome. Katie Polglase, CNN London.

And the number one source of carbon pollution in Europe, in the United States is from transportation. The vast majority of that coming from our personal use our cars.

But I would actually challenge, Richard, the notion that we are the ones littering the streets. You mentioned London. London has over a million cars. If you add up all the e-bikes, e-scooters, including the doc bike system, it's a -- it's less than one percent of all the bikes, all the cars that are in the streets of London. We're simply not used to it, we're blinded to all the cars we see. And it's parked on every street, in every corner. I think one of the challenges we have to do is to change our perception that bikes and scooters are have a right to our streets. We need to build more bike lanes, build more parking, so that we can resolve some of this nuisance around parking.",
