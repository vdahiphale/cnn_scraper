Tonight, we are following two major stories for you this hour.Israel says it has carried out raids into Gaza as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns a ground offensive is coming. And a manhunt is underway in the U.S. state of Maine right now for a suspected gunman after a shooting rampage left at least 18 people dead. We'll have a live report, of course, from Maine just ahead in the show. But we begin today in Gaza where Israel says it conducted a targeted raid in the north of Gaza before withdrawing. The Israeli Defense Forces say this video, I want to show you here shows their tanks inside Gaza opening fire. The IDF say the raid was a clear and sweep operation, that basically is to prepare for a ground offensive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that ground invasion of Gaza will happen. Israeli forces in Gaza have killed more than 6,000 people, that is according to health authorities in the Hamas-controlled enclave. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is live for us in Sderot, Israel. And Nic, tell us more then, about these targeted raids overnight. How far? How deep did the IDF actually go? And what is it trying to achieve here?",

They didn't say. But when that operation was underway, we didn't know it was underway at the time, but we could see tank fire from here going across where exactly where they were. So, we now know, now the IDF has in the morning, they said that this raid went ahead, we can now piece that together with what we were watching and hearing last night. So, you can see the tanks firing, tank shells, red light, sort of tracers on them flying low across the horizon that we hadn't really seen there much before. We could hear the heavy machine gun fire, but also there were detonations with that operation last night unlike others that we've heard. This evening, it's again been artillery as there have been airstrikes and very heavy booms. But these were quite different, and now we have the explanation from the IDF, we understand that they were part of the operation. It doesn't seem to us that, that operation went deep into Gaza, but the IDF isn't making that clear, they said. They all came out, but they are saying that this is a preparation for operations to come, and you would expect the military, if they went in to clear out a Hamas cell that was planning to target Israel, and whatever they did as part of that operation, if they left it through or if they leave it for a few days without following on, Hamas will merely fall back in, and --",

But you can sort of feel that people here are on edge, and they don't want to leave their homes, because they're afraid that, you know, for what they're being told by police is that there is an armed man on the loose, in their neighborhood, and so they're being told to stay home.

So that tells me that communication is difficult, that tells me that electricity is clearly running out. A third of the hospitals have run out of electricity.

Let me address all those who have, in these past few days, explained why one should not call for a cease-fire. How can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that 1,000 Israelis were killed and not feel the same outrage when 1,000 Palestinians are now killed every day? GILAD ERDAN, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  The brutal ISIS-like monsters abducted over 220 hostages from Israel and dozens of other countries, including babies. Babies, children, persons with disabilities, the elderly and Holocaust survivors, we saw Hamas' brutality in Israel.

Officials say he is armed and dangerous and they are asking people throughout the area to shelter in place. The gunman opened fire at a restaurant and a bowling alley on Wednesday night in the city of Lewiston, killing 18 people. Authorities haven't established any motive. We have learned the suspect is a heavily trained army reservist. CNN's chief law enforcement intelligence analyst John Miller joins us now. John, I know you've been working your sources and there seems to be one theory regarding motive. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a working theory but what investigators are looking at right now isthat Robert Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend. And this is one of several stressors in his life, including a mental health episode he had in the Army, that landed him in the hospital for a couple of weeks; some challenges finding work and then breaking up with a girlfriend. But when police were asked why did he pick these two places, why these people, why these victims, they said, well, that goes to motive. I think the tell there was, these are places he used to frequent with the woman he had been dating, his ex girlfriend. And we are told by one of our law enforcement sources that she was supposed to meet other friends and play in a tournament at the bar. So the idea of the working theory, being he went to the bowling alley where they used to go, didn't find her there but opened fire on the place. Then he went to the bar where she was supposed to be. And we don't know if he found her there or not and opened fire there. Really from an offender characteristic standpoint, a behavioral science profiler at the FBI would say, it leads you to think he went to the places that she would rather be with -- the places and people she would rather be with that night than him and tried to exact his revenge and show his anger.",

For international viewers here, John, explain what youlearned about who the suspect is, because this is not some ordinary civilian who grabbed a gun. This is a man with some 20 years or so, right, of military training. Our colleagues were saying still marksman, an outdoorsman, according to former colleague in his Army reserve unit. Does that change the way that law enforcement tries to apprehend him, tries to catch him here?",
