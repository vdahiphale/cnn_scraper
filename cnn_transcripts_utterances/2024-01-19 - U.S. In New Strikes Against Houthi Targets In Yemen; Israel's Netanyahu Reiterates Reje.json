And it's going to be one that changes quickly, especially if the Iranians are successful, in resupplying them with missile parts, with actual missiles and with the warheads that they need in order to accomplish this mission. And then the other thing, of course, to keep in mind is that they have certain capabilities on the intelligence side that the Iranians have given that there was an Iranian ship that is in the vicinity of the Gulf of Aden, and that is providing a intelligence support to the Houthis at this time.",

So that's what we know from the, you know, the reporting -- the public reporting, that's either a huge blow or barely scratches the surface without an accurate assessment of the weapons stockpile.

Gravestones destroyed, soil upturned, tread marks leaving little left for the living to honor their dead.This is that same graveyard before the war. One month later, a series of tread marks can be seen on the northwestern edge. It is no exception. A CNN analysis of videos and satellite imagery found that 16 cemeteries have been damaged or destroyed by the Israeli military since it launched its ground offensive. As Israeli forces pushed deeper into Gaza, they crushed the graves of thousands of Palestinians between November and January. Janina Dill co-director of Oxford University's Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict says destroying graveyards violates international law set under very limited circumstances. JANINA DILL, CO-DIRECTOR, OXFORD UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE FOR ETHICS, LAW AND ARMED CONFLICT: Cemeteries are not military objectives. They are in fact, what international law would consider an object that is normally dedicated to civilian purposes like places of worship generally. So this is protected from intentional attack. It can only be intentionally attacked or destroyed if it becomes a military objective.",

CNN witnessed firsthand the results of Israel bulldozing of graveyards while embedded with Israeli forces last week. The armored personnel carrier CNN was traveling in, drove right through this cemetery in Al- Bureij on a freshly bulldozed dirt road. And then there's this, tombs opened at a cemetery in Khan Yunis this week, bodies removed from their graves. In a statement, the Israeli military acknowledged exhuming bodies from the cemetery as part of its search for the bodies of Israeli hostages. An IDF spokesman could not account for the damage to the 16 cemeteries identified by CNN, but said that in some cases there is no other choice providing this photo of what it says is a Hamas rocket launcher at a cemetery in Gaza. CNN could not independently verify where it was taken. The spokesman could not account for the military posts over graveyards, but said, \"We have a serious obligation to the respect of the dead and there is no policy to create military posts out of graveyards\".

But also think about the fact that if you're a repair shop and you're repairing a gasoline-powered car or a hybrid, you replaced the components as we've always done that, we know it's expensive. We try to replace them with factory parts.We're talking about a batter used to replace the whole battery cell assembly and a lot of times in this would make the situation even worse. If one battery cell overheats and potentially get -- catches fire, there'll be a chemical reaction that will take the whole vehicle out. It'll be a total loss. So car manufacturers are aware of this, but the insurance manufacturer very concerned and so are the reinsurance companies. They ensure the insurance companies. They know it's going to be higher, so they're charging higher rates for the possibility of a total. VAUSE: Wow. Ok. And some of the reasons for the increase in accidents and the increasing claims include acceleration. The Tesla model 3, for example, the long-range one, it goes zero to 60 in full -- in 4.1 seconds, just over 4 seconds. That compares to a BMW 330-I, zero to six feet in 5.6 seconds. There's also the fact the EVs don't have the sound of a combustion engine which you, for many drivers were used to that as an indicator of speed. So are these issues similar what Toyota experienced with Prius, you know, adding an engine noise because of a jump in the number of pedestrians being hit. Or are there bigger issues at stake here.",

When you drive a car, if you've been trained to drive any vehicle, you're used to using your vision, you're feeling the sound, but there's no sound.When there's no sound, you don't have an expectation of acceleration. It's sort of like using a video game. People don't have that engagement. And so when that's missing, you have no crescendo of noise; or the noise gets louder. And so I think the consumers missed that, especially if you're used to driving a gasoline powered vehicle. And that is quick acceleration. I mean, unless you've got a lot of experience, I know these car is a little different. I'm used to that, but someone who's not used to that quick acceleration could find themselves in an accident very easily in a traffic light. And now you don't realize it until they've already hit something. So these are all factors to be considered. I mean, I think just overall it's a matter of learning these cars and that would be something that you could overcome over time and if you're just paying attention.",

Go out there and get used to it, get comfortable with this. You understand the acceleration and the braking. You should be doing that anyhow. And that's just a matter of learning like anything else and for new drivers, have them take the time to learn it because that can be real expensive on your insurance if a young driver's had an accident, it's definitely going to elevate the price of your insurance on a monthly basis.",

Now, she's forced to stay out of the public eye for up to three months until doctors give her the all clear. Last seen over Christmas with her family at Sandringham, the Princess of Wales lives an active lifestyle, by having a regular royal schedule of engagements, some 120 last year and by being a hands-on mum, looking after her three children. She still finds time to enjoy the outdoors and keeping up her favorite hobbies like skiing and working out. All to keep the princess fit and healthy. Her relatability to the public has made her a role model amongst adoring fans who might try to catch a glimpse of her at Wimbledon where she's regularly seen every summer watching the games. A patron of the All-England Lawn Tennis Club, the princess' interest in the sport extends beyond the annual championships. Known to enjoy cooking for the Prince of Wales and her children, Catherine has even been spotted stocking up at a British supermarket, showing that she doesn't like to rely on staff for shopping and trying to maintain a normal lifestyle. But now all the appearances slowed down as Catherine recovers and with Prince William juggling child care at home, the couple have canceled all travel plans for the foreseeable future. With King Charles and two other senior royals taking a backseat, heads turn to Queen Camilla and other members of the family to step up as the public faces of the royal household to reassure Britons that all is fine and it is business as usual.
