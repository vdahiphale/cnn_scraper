Plus, the alleged bomb maker that took down Pan Am Flight 103 is now in U.S. custody 34 years later. A widow of one of the Americans killed joins us live. And an embattled L.A. City Councilman gets into a shoving match with a protester. This is just some of the video that's been released. How things so quickly escalated and what it means now? This is what we're watching AT THIS HOUR.Thank you so much for being everybody. I'm Kate Bolduan. Let's start with that winter weather that is hitting millions of Americans today. A major winter storm just lying in too much of the United States more than 10 million people in more than a dozen states are under winter, are under winter weather alerts. The storm system already dumping heavy snow on western states, Northern California seeing as much as five feet of snow at certain elevations. Blizzard warnings are now in effect for multiple states in the plains. And it's all moving east later this week posing a new threat of severe weather. CNN meteorologist, Chad Myers, he's tracking it all for us AT THIS HOUR. Chad, which areas are at most risk right now?",

That's where the heavy snow is happening right now. But this has so many facets, Kate. Let me get through what we see here. The clouds are all the way from Des Moines back to Reno. This is a large storm system. You would never see a storm this wide across, like, even a hurricane wouldn't be this large to cover up half of the country.So this is where the snow is right now. The snow will eventually turn into snow with wind and blizzards across parts of the Dakotas into parts of Colorado even into parts of Nebraska, slowing down or even closing possibly I-70, I-76, I-80, and all the way up even toward the Dakotas. We are going to see winds 40 to 50 miles per hour and visibility's near zero that will shut down roadways. That will happen tonight and into tomorrow. Now let's work your way now into let's say 6 o'clock tonight, the storms here that will fire haven't done it just yet. But later on tonight, especially after dark, dangerous, possibly overnight tornadoes will occur across parts of the southern plains, and then moving on off toward the east and making that weather even as far east as Florida by Friday. In the meantime, it has been snowing up here to the north where some spots will be picking up another foot or two. And you may not even see it because it'll be in the ditches and the roads will just be just as polished with all of this drifting snow across the north.",

And the Germans say that it is proven that Vadim Krasikov acted on orders of the Russian government and was also a Russian spy, as well.Now, of course, it makes it very difficult for Vadim Krasikov to be part of any sort of swap because he is in German custody and not in American custody.

Dana, I want to talk first about what's happening on the Hill this week, because it is almost easy to make light of how ridiculous this annual exercises of a threatened shut down, as they talk about spending. But it is entirely serious and has the potential of hitting every aspect of Americans lives if this really doesn't get worked out. What's notable about the debate this time to you? DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENTAnd there are different sort of points of view, for example, there are some Republicans you talk to who will quietly privately say they just want the Democrats who are still in charge across Capitol Hill to get a long term spending bill done so that they -- the Republicans can blame Democrats for high spending, but not have to actually deal with it for a little bit while -- for a little while. And on the other hand, you have the Democrats who are saying that they do have sort of a last chance to fund as much as they can have what they haven't been able to fund. So that's why they are holding out. And that's one of the reasons there is no big, big deal. But Kate, I think you and I probably have this conversation, like once a December, which is important to underscore that this is not the way it is supposed to work in Washington. The way it is supposed to work is that the so called Appropriations Committee has -- is supposed to pass 12, 13 bills individually. And that is supposed to be done by September 30th. None of that gets done almost annually. And so they shove it together in a big bill called an omnibus, and it makes it very difficult to get negotiations done and it bumps up against a government shutdown deadline. It happens every year. And it is not the way it is opposed to work.",

KARA WEIPZ, BROTHER KILLED IN PAN AM FLIGHT 103 BOMBING: It has been one of our -- it has been the top priority to find the truth and to hold these people accountable. And the fact that this is now going to happen in the U.S., it's monumental. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Libyan Abu Agila Mohammad Masud Kheir Al- Marimi was arrested for his alleged role in blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, 38 minutes after it took off for the U.S. from London, killing everyone on board and 11 people on the ground. The U.S. first charged Al-Marimi for his involvement in the attack two years ago, while he was already in custody in Libya for unrelated crimes. MICHAEL SHERWIN, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY: It is alleged in the criminal complaint the indictment that at that time all co- conspirators work together to arm the explosive device in the suitcase. [11:20:07] ROBERTSON (voice-over): For years, the only person convicted in the Lockerbie bombing case was Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi. Al- Megrahi, a former Libyan intelligence official was accused along with another Libyan man who was acquitted for planting the explosive inside a portable cassette player in a suitcase on the plane. Al-Megrahi was sentenced to life in prison. But eight years after his conviction in 2008, he was released from a Scottish prison with terminal prostate cancer. Arriving home in Libya, he received a hero's welcome. In 2011, following the revolution that toppled Libya's dictator Muammar Gaddafi, I visited al-Megrahi at his home in Tripoli. He was near death, his family as he always had protesting his innocence. (on camera): Has he been able to see a doctor?

What does this moment, what does today, what does this news mean to you and your family?VICTORIA CUMMOCK, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, LOCKERBIE LEGACY FOUNDATION: Well, the U.S. apprehension and arrest of Libyan terrorists suspect Abu Agila Masud is the first tangible step made by the U.S. Department of Justice in 34 years to hold any suspect accountable in U.S. courts. You know that U.S. federal courts have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes on board U.S. flagged aircrafts, regardless of the location. So aside from issuing the 1991 criminal indictments against two Libyans, al-Megrahi and Fhimah, and then the 2020 criminal charges against Masud, U.S. authorities have never arrested or prosecuted any suspects in 34 years. And to the American victims' families, this really has felt like a betrayal by U.S. authorities to the thousands that regularly pledge allegiance to America and its flag. Today's arraignment of Masud in a Washington courthouse is a significant step, first step to address this three decades long miscarriage of justice. It's the victims' families fervent wish that the U.S. criminal trial proceedings could begin immediately since justice delayed is justice denied. The victims' families are keenly aware that after 34 years, informants and witnesses die, memories fade, and evidence can deteriorate or disappear. So really, on behalf of my family and the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie family members, I want to express the gratitude -- my gratitude, our gratitude to President Biden, who he himself is a Syracuse University alumnus and there were 35 Syracuse University victims on the flight. We also want to express our gratitude to the U.S. authorities for today, putting actions behind their 34 years of pledges. The type of justice like for us is now.",

And then four days before Christmas, John, among 259 passengers and crew boarded Pan Am 103 which was a U.S. flag Boeing 747 flying from London to New York.And like you said, 38 minutes into the flight at 31,000 feet, the terrorist bomb exploded, scattering the 259 souls, the airplane content and debris over 845 square mile area on the serene countryside and town of Lockerbie, Scotland.
