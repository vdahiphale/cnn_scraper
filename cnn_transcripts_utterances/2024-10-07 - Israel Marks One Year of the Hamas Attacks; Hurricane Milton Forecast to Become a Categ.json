Well, just hours ago, Israelis gathered outside the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, carrying flags and images of hostages taken by Hamas. Ahead of the anniversary, images of the hostages were projected onto the walls of Jerusalem's old city. As of today, the Israeli Prime Minister's office says, there are a total of 101 hostages in Gaza, including 35 believed to have been killed. The mother of one victim had this heartbreaking message.

I'm being asked how it feels a year after, but I'm still stuck on October 7th. The world keeps going, but to me time has stopped. Still waiting to see you on the list of survivors. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say that they have been carrying out attacks throughout Gaza, saying that they are targeting Hamas launchers and also Hamas targets, saying that they believe that they were preparing to fire projectiles into Israel.Now, we have seen over the past day or so that the Israeli military saying that they're going to be carrying out a ground operation in Jabalia. This is actually an area in northern Gaza which was one of the first areas that was targeted by the IDF following that October 7th attack. It's home to Gaza's biggest refugee camp. It is a very densely populated area and it's an area where there has been a huge amount of military activity. Israel claims Hamas is embedding itself in the civilian population and using them as human shields. It's something that Hamas denies doing at this point but we do know that this particular area Israel had said in the past it was free of Hamas. They had done their operations there and moved on to another area but they believe that Hamas is now regrouping, rebuilding in this particular area. Now, Sunday was a deadly day in Gaza as most days have been since October 7th of last year. We know that at least 25 were killed in Deir Al-Balah. This is when a mosque was targeted, Israel saying that Hamas was using it as a command and control center. And we also know that there was a school hit nearby as well. So we really are seeing intense bombardments of certain areas of Gaza. Certainly a couple of weeks ago, once the Israeli military said that the focus was turning to the northern border, to Lebanon, Palestinians in Gaza would have been forgiven to have believed that the situation would ease somewhat in the enclave, but it simply hasn't happened.

Two friends of ours, Omri Miran and Itzhaki Edan, both of them are fathers of young children, who were taken by the terrorists in front of the eyes of their children on that day.And until they come back alive and all the other hostages that we have, they're alive or released in some kind of a deal, the date on the calendar remains October 7 for us and we're still living it.",

We have partners in the region that we can work with to create a better reality in Gaza and to build something new. That will actually function out of this destruction.

They had no real reason to do it and no country in the world would just accept that kind of scenario, not retaliate.Of course, there is an ongoing dialogue within the corridors of power in Israel and with our allies in the world about the magnitudes and the nature of this Israeli response. What will we strike? Will it be economic targets, you know, the oil industry? Will it be military targets? Will it be perhaps the nuclear program, which I think is more difficult to attack, but it depends also how much ammunition you want to use, how many planes. But the real question here again, let's say we strike back. They then retaliate again. And are we entering a new phase of the war in which Israel and Iran strike each other all the time, while we're still fighting Hezbollah in the north, and we still have the hostages. We have to bring back home. This is a very, very difficult question and my fear is that again, we are forgetting our people over there in the tunnels of Gaza because we are being drawn to this larger regional confrontation.",
