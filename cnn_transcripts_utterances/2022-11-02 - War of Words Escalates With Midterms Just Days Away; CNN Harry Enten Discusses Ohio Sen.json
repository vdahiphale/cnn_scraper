Vance with a slight advantage over Tim Ryan, 47% to 45%, but that's well within the margin of error.That being said, I'm a little skeptical that this race will end up as close as this. Why? Well, wwo reasons. First off, let's look at past polling errors in Ohio. How much better did the GOP do better than the final Ohio polls indicated? In 2020 president, the GOP candidate did seven points better. In 2018 gubernatorial race, the GOP did six points better. The same thing in 2016 president. And in 2014 governor's race, look at that, the GOP candidate did 10 points better that year. But that's not the only reason why. Take a look at the Ohio presidential results over the last few cycles since 2008. What do we see? We see a clear trend towards the Republican candidates. So back in 2008, in 2012, Barack Obama won. But look at Donald Trump. These eight-point wins in both 2016 and 2020. But here is the key nugget to keep in mind: If, in fact, J.D. Vance wins this Ohio Senate race, which is what I expect, the chance that Democrats win Senate control still 37%. But if Tim Ryan pulls the upset, look at this, the Democrats' chance of winning the United States Senate overall jumps all the way to 85%. So, we will just have to wait and see.

It goes back to a court that's really not giving the voters real power on this, because the way that those maps are drawn, particularly in Ohio, means that they do not have a real say in how abortion plays out in that state. That's what Ryan is trying to hit at. The problem for Democrats right now is I do think he's probably the best candidate they can have. J.D.

Vance is a guy who wrote a very successful book, a venture capitalist, coming in a little bit from out of state compared to Tim Ryan's appeal.
