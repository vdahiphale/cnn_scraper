Prigozhin has no official position. He controls no large bureaucracy within the government. His power derives directly from his relationship with President Putin. And this means that he is very similar, say, if we go back to medieval times in the court or the Russian czar to a courtier who is dependent on his ability to do things for the czar, for his ability to stay in the court. Now, ironically, with Prigozhin in Putin's court, this began with his catering service, and that is how he got the nickname as Putin Chef now. But Prigozhin really became valuable to Putin in 2014 when he created the mercenary group Wagner, which turned out to be a very valuable vehicle for Putin for financial gain via resource extraction in Syria and in Africa, as much as it was as a covert or then covert tool of statecraft for the Russian Federation. Now with what's going on in Ukraine is we have Prigozhin competing with the Russian military to show Putin that he can get things done where others can't.",

But what he does is he balances against the various different competing factions within the Kremlin. This provides him the power because he's the final arbiter of their disputes. It also protects him from keeping different factions from joining together against him.So in this case, Prigozhin is just one of the many factions. Sometimes he's up, sometimes he's down. He has been very vocal in his criticism of the Russian leadership, including specific Russian generals.

President Trump never denied that he wanted to take these documents. In fact, he claimed that he made some sort of Vulcan mind exercise and made them all unclassified without telling anyone. So there was no even pretense at inadvertent. I should say he hasn't made that argument in court. His lawyers haven't. So this is quite a different situation.

And that demand for exports may weaken in the months ahead because of this general global economic uncertainty. But it is hoped, Michael, that the opening of borders certainly will help people move to and from distant family members help with tourism. They also had a big business impact in the sense that business people especially from the west have not been able to meet their counterpart in China, will be able to have face to face meetings and kind of reestablish some of those business relationships that were tarnished during the pandemic because people simply cannot have in-person conversation. So, there are many components to this whole economic malaise that we are seeing right now.",

Indeed, Navalny is serving under very harsh conditions in Russian prison which are specifically engineered, by the prison authorities and the instructions for that come from the top of Russian power. He has been ill recently and he is in a solitary confinement in penalty ward and he's not receiving medical care which prevented him from participating in some court proceedings.

And what makes 2022 special is that we were in a La Nina year. That typically cools the planet. And this La Nina year is the warmest La Nina we've ever seen. What LaNina does is it basically cools the waters in the eastern equatorial pacific and in turn that normally cools much of the planet but as you can see, aside from that one area across the eastern equatorial Pacific, we are seeing warmer than normal temperatures across much of the globe. In fact, we had some pretty significant rain event. We know that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture in turn will produce a rainier storm. We had 1,000-year rainfall events this summer all across the U.S. Several of those. We also had significant heat waves across, not only the U.S., but Europe as well as Asia. We are getting ever so close to that 1.5 degrees Celsius number. And we also had extreme flooding in Pakistan. You can see this from August 28th, the before and after. There is the before from 2021 and 2022 is right there. So, you remember this flooding. It was significant across Pakistan.
