The calendar says 2024. House Republicans face the exact same problems as 2023. They have a minuscule majority. They have a rebellious right flank. There are looming threats of a government shutdown. Funding battles over wars in Israel and Ukraine and border security. And plenty of in fighting.Here's what one swing district Republican told CNN about the GOP conference working against itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): We're in a divided government. Anybody who thinks that we're going to get more out of this deal is lying. And they're kidding themselves. The speaker did the best he could under the circumstances. And, frankly, you know, our hand was weakened by the eight nitwits who removed Speaker McCarthy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The hardliners making clear they are ready to stand up and create headaches for him. One of those conservatives, Congressman Warren Davidson of Ohio, left the GOP conference meeting yesterday early, visibly angry, telling reporters, quote, \"currently the speaker has no plans to do anything except surrender.\"Congressman Davidson joins us now. He is a member of the House Freedom Caucus from the great state of Ohio - great state of Ohio, I would note. Congressman, do you feel like it was a mistake to elect Mike Johnson the speaker of the House? REP. WARREN DAVIDSON (R-OH): Well, I think the mistake was in removing Kevin McCarthy. We didn't have a good plan. And ultimately, we did agree that Mike Johnson was the best alternative after that. But what we didn't do is work on the plan. I had an op-ed that Fox News ran at the time that said we're focused on the wrong question, who will be the next speaker? The real question is, what's the plan that unites the conference? And we kind of united around a person instead of the plan. And so we're -- really haven't set the conference up or the speaker up for success because finding the kind of cohesiveness that brings the whole conference together really hasn't been done robustly enough to really give our leadership the tools they need to fight and win.",

He was asked a question about, what does that mean? What will you settle for? He said, our position is HR-2, and we're going to defend it because it fully solves the problem. Anything less doesn't fully solve the problem. That's how you go into a negotiation.And we didn't need another trip to the border. We know the border's broken. The question is, are we going to do anything about it? And the answer is, well, before we could even get back in session, the speaker had basically agreed to surrender our negotiating leverage to Senator Schumer. So, how do we move the ball forward? And his answer fundamentally is, well, we'll get something out of the supplemental fight. And I find that morally offensive. I don't even want to fund my government if the administration won't secure the border, let alone fund Ukraine's government in exchange for defending America.

And the reality is, what we're left with, we didn't even fight over the funding. The whole point of the CR that was in the Fiscal Responsibility Act was to have leverage of a CR in the negotiation.So, at this point, that CR only kicks in if we get a longer term CR.

Now, remember, this is something that the law enforcement around here has been prepared for, continues to be prepared for, because this is nothing new. We know all those gag orders that were put in place in this trial because the former president would go on Truth Social and spoke ill, not only about the judge in this case, but also the attorney general, and also the judge's clerk. We know that those -- the judge and his clerk presiding next to him really in this case, or who sits next to him rather in this case, has received a number of threats, both online, in emails, phone calls. And so security has always been high alert around the players in this trial. I mean, if you just look around me, you can see, there's actually a number of law enforcement that sort of encircle this entire courthouse.

You think about prosecutors, the D.A. in Fulton County, Fani Willis, she and her staff have been threatened. Jack Smith and his staff have been threatened.
