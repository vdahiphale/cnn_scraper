Here's what's coming up.After President Biden warns Israel, don't let the red mist blind you, I asked the former IDF counterterror expert, Miri Eisen, will Israel listen? Then, in 2009, a phone call shocked Israel to its core. A doctor in Gaza suffers unbearable loss, a journalist in Israel broadcasts his grief to the nation. Now, we hear from them again. Plus, as President Biden reckons with disastrous mistakes in Afghanistan and Iraq, international correspondent Anna Coren documents the tragic impact on women and girls. Also, ahead, with temperatures rising on U.S. college campuses, Hari Sreenivasan speaks with investigative reporter Jack Stripling. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. U.S. President Joe Biden is back in Washington today, preparing a prime- time address to push funding for Israel and Ukraine. In his visit to Israel yesterday, President Biden tried to walk a fine line, offering support for an ally traumatized by Hamas terrorist attacks while cautioning Israel not to be consumed by rage. As he says, America was consumed after 9/11, which led to disastrous mistakes. It's a similar message that I heard a week earlier from the former Israeli prime minister and arms forces chief Ehud Barak. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we have just heard from the Israeli defense minister himself issuing a press statement saying to those troops gathered with their armor outside Gaza, you will soon see Gaza from the inside. He said the command will come. Miri Eisen was a senior intelligence officer in the Israeli Defense Forces. She's now director of the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel's Reichman University, and she's joining me from Tel Aviv. Miri Eisen, welcome to the program. So, first, your reaction to the statement from the defense minister. I mean, it's clearly preparing what everybody thinks is going to happen. MIRI EISEN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (RET.) AND DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM, REICHMAN UNIVERSITY:  We've been preparing this for over a week. We've been trying to get as many civilians from the Northern Gaza Strip to leave that area for over a week. The troops have been in preparation for quite a long time. At this stage, it's a question of, when are they going to give the actual order to go in? But the preparations are full-scale ahead. I can't say if it'll be today. It may be in a few days, but it will happen, I think.",

The world is in this right now. It's not just President Biden arriving here. And today, we had the visit from the British prime minister and before that the German consular that the world is on board and the fact that you cannot allow a Hamas terror organization, not about the Palestinian people, Hamas to do what they did, and then to continue exist behind those human shields. And when it comes to Hezbollah, you know, there is at the end with the U.S. force that's out there. And I do think that this is something that is not just about Israel, it's way broader than, two hybrid horrific terror organizations, and both of them need to be very clearly sidelined by the world. And that means, at the end, that we're going to have to do something with them physically. They call not just for our destruction. They have immense power. And we need to be sure that we do something. My heart goes out to the Lebanese people, to the Palestinian people where these different terror organizations.

Miri Eisen, thank you very much, indeed, for being with us.Now, the rage and the loss filling Gaza and the Arab street is also spilling over as Israeli airstrikes on parts of Khan Yunis, parts of southern Gaza have been continuing despite urging Palestinians to escape there. Back in the war of 2009, which was dubbed Operation Cast Lead, there was a tragic and famous case of a mass civilian casualty disaster. As his home was struck by Israeli forces, a Palestinian doctor managed to call a friend, an Israeli journalist, live on TV begging for help. Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish crying that his wife and daughter had been killed -- daughters. Shlomi Eldar listening and letting the world know. That call helped end Operation Cast Lead. And shortly afterwards, I went back to that destroyed home in Gaza. Here's an excerpt of that report from 2009. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voiceover):  On December 27, 2008, Israel launched an offensive. A war provoked by both sides. Militant groups in Gaza had fired thousands of rockets and mortars into Israel. Israel went to war. At the height of the war, Israeli reporter Shlomi Eldar got a panicked and desperate phone call from his Palestinian friend, Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish. DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH, PALESTINIAN DOCTOR AND AUTHOR, \"I SHALL NOT HATE: A GAZA'S JOURNEY ON THE ROAD TO PEACE AND HUMAN DIGNITY\" (through translator):  No one can get to us, oh, Shlomi, oh, God. Oh, God. SHLOMI ELDAR, ISRAELI JOURNALIST AND DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER AND AUTHOR, \"GETTING TO KNOW HAMAS\" (through translator):  They killed his family. Over the past few days, I think I'm a bit overwhelmed too. AMANPOUR (voiceover):  It was a cruel irony. For 12 years, Dr. Abuelaish had worked side by side with Israeli doctors in Israeli hospitals, devoting his life to medicine and to making peace between ordinary people on both sides. Now, paramedics race to save his surviving daughter Shada and his niece Aida after the Israeli shelling that killed three of his eight children. The wounded were rushed across the border to Sheba Medical Center in Israel, where Dr. Abuelaish's distraught colleagues tried to comfort him and to save the girls. We travel with him back to Gaza.",

And even when my daughters were killed the 16th of January 2009, I said it afterwards, if I could know that my daughters were the last sacrifice on the way to freedom and peace, then I will accept it.

And I think things really ratcheted up when Larry Summers, who's a former president of Harvard and also a former secretary of treasury, went on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and really condemned Harvard for its slow response to the Israeli Palestinian conflict. By that point, a lot of universities had already put out public statements and specifically condemning these student groups. And so, that generate a lot of interest in them. And then, in the ensuing days, as you note, I think there have been numerous efforts to identify who these students are.

And so, they've tried to erect policies around this, but it is a phenomenon within higher education.

The president and all of the academic leadership of Harvard put out a statement that was long, but also not forceful enough in the view of many professors on the campus. The professors responded with an open letter saying, this is a milquetoast response and, you know, doesn't adequately condemn the actions of Hamas. The president of Harvard then issues another statement that is more forceful it's getting hard to keep track of these. I think she also put out a video statement point being that the Wexler Foundation that has given a lot of money to Harvard over the years has said they're going to cut ties with Harvard over its response to this, and it probably points to the fact that, you know, no matter how people approach this, it can be difficult to satisfy all the different constituencies on this subject.",

But I think we underestimate the vast amount of pressure on these institutions to say something. And then when they say something, it's never enough. And an interesting phenomenon that's occurred in this circumstance is that we're now even seeing college presidents going after each other about whether their statements were good enough. Ben Sasse, who's the president of the University of Florida and a former United States senator from Nebraska, issued his own statement saying, these weak-kneed equivocation from my colleagues in higher education, you know, is not good enough.

And you will often hear them say that, you know, I'm concerned that anything I say could be used against me. And, you know, all you can say is that we have the First Amendment in this country. We -- the colleges need to have policies to deal with these situations as a general rule. First Amendment experts will tell you that, you know, things you say on Twitter and social media are generally considered protected speech. Classroom behavior is sort of a different phenomenon that you cannot target a student based on race, ethnicity or religion within a public university classroom.

And so, there was a vigil at the University of Florida not long after the conflict broke out. And a strange misunderstanding where somebody got ill and fainted and there was a call for 911 prompted a huge stampede at this vigil. People ran, running. I'm told that somebody dropped a water bottle and people thought it might have been a gunshot. Several students were injured and taken to the hospital because of this. It's lucky it wasn't worse. This was a big space where people could get out and I think exit fairly well, even though they were running. But you can imagine this could have been a profound tragedy.
