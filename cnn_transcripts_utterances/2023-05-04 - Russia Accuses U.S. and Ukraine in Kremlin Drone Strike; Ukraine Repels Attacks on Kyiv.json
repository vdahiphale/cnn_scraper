Such attempts to disown this both in Kyiv and in Washington are absolutely ridiculous,\" he says. Peskov did not offer any evidence to back up those accusations. CNN analysis and videos showing the incident supports Russia's claim that two drones flew above the Kremlin earlier Wednesday but did not show evidence of Ukrainian involvement. Both Ukraine and the United States are strongly denying any involvement. A spokesperson for the White House refuted Peskov's claims on CNN a little earlier today. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  I will just tell, you Mr. Peskov is. Lying obviously it's a ludicrous claim. The United States have nothing to do with this. We don't even know exactly what happened here. But I can assure you, the United States had no role in it whatsoever. And again, just to be, clear and I think you covered this at the beginning, we neither encouraged nor did we enable Ukraine to strike outside Ukraine's borders. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Russia but it is really Russia fighting against a broad Western alliance led by the United States that is bent on the destruction of Russia.

Look, it's not the first time that U.S. officials have heard the Russians accuse the U.S. of being kind of the puppet master behind Kyiv's behavior and the things that the military there are doing, especially when it comes to cross border attacks and strikes inside Russia. But the bottom line here is that the U.S. still doesn't actually know what happened. According to our sources here, the U.S. intel community is poring over intelligence, including intercepting communications, satellite imagery, to try to figure out whether there were any signs that this was going to happen or any indications that they perhaps missed the night before. These drones hit the Kremlin but so far there is nothing. The U.S. officials have told us but they did not see any evidence that there was an attack being planned by either Russian or Ukrainian government officials. And yesterday, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee came out after being briefed by the CIA director and said that while there is still a lot to be learned about this incident, there is currently no evidence at all linking Ukraine to this alleged attack. And so right now, U.S. officials are really operating in the dark. They are trying to figure what happened. They have spoken. We are told to their Ukrainian counterparts. Ukraine is denying privately, as well to the White House, that they were behind this. But ultimately, this is a playbook that U.S. officials have seen many times before. It is something that John Kirby emphasized this morning, saying that this is a lie and that it is likely a pretext for the Kremlin to try to convey to the world that the U.S. is actually in a proxy war with Russia itself and that Ukraine is kind of a puppet in all of. This Of course, the U.S. has emphasized that they have told Ukraine many times not to conduct these kinds of cross border attacks inside Russia, not to strike inside Russian territory. And that's exactly why the U.S. has refused to give Ukraine these very long range missiles, because they say they don't want to encourage or facilitate Ukrainians attacking targets inside Russia. So all of this combined is really just creating this -- what the Kremlin likes to, do which is confusion, muddy the waters. U.S. officials say they're still trying to figure out what happened here. But they categorically denied that they're behind any of this.",

To those few days mark the worst in terms of intensity and frequency since the beginning of the year. Last night, though, significant numbers, nearly all, frankly, as far as we, know were repelled leaving the capital mostly untouched. Odessa, the large city in the south, that also was attacked. But only three of about 18 drones fired there managed to eventually get through. So increasing success from air defense systems when it comes to these Shahed suicide drone, attacks which have been frequent over the past three or four days. Is that related to Russian anticipation that the counteroffensive may get underway or may indeed be underway? It's possible; there've been some public statements Russian officials or Russian occupation officials have made, suggesting that early May is where it's all about to begin. But Kherson an utterly awful moment of indiscriminate barbarity yesterday, before even any statements had been made by the Kremlin about their alleged drone attack on the Kremlin itself. A market, a railway station, hit with repeated shelling; 24 dead. This is an area only recently liberated from Russian occupation. And it fits into a pattern that we've been seeing across the country over the last week or so. Russia, at this stage, possibly able to be accurate in some rare instances. We don't always know from Ukraine what military targets have been hit but for the most part it seems lashing out, hitting civilian targets somewhat indiscriminately. We went to one family's home, where the first missile landed in their front yard and it enabled them to get the kids into shelter. And in one, house jump into the bath and in the second one, it left an enormous crater in their back garden. No military target anywhere near there at all. A 7- and 9-year old child in the crosshairs. So startling how random the violence inflicted by Russia is.
