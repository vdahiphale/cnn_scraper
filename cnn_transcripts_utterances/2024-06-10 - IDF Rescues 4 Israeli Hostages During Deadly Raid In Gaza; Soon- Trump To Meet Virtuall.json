All right, 6 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at the White House on this bright, nearly summer morning here in Washington. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. We'll begin with that stunning hostage rescue operation in Gaza and the deadly consequences. The Israeli military freeing four captives from the grip of Hamas on Saturday. Watch this video that the Israeli military just released. This video is edited and it appears to show Israeli forces escorting rescued hostages toward military helicopters on Saturday. Those four Israelis now reunited with their families and beginning the recovery from months of captivity. Among those freed, 26-year-old Noa Argamani. Her abduction during the October 7th attack was captured on tape. You may remember seeing it at the time. Noa screamed for help as she was forced by Hamas members onto the back of a motorcycle and driven into Gaza. She would spend the next eight months there. The rescue operation marks the deadliest day of the war in six months. At least 274 people killed, hundreds more injured, according to Gazan health officials. The Israeli military is disputing those numbers. They claim the casualty count was, quote, \"under 100.\" CNN can't independently verify the death toll and we don't know how many of those were civilians. We do know that the hostages were being held in residential homes in a densely populated area. CNN also learning this morning that some IDF soldiers disguised themselves as Hamas fighters and displaced Palestinians to conduct the raid. Let's bring in our panel. Elaina Plott Calabro, she's staff writer for \"The Atlantic.\" Jonah Goldberg, co-founder and editor-in-chief of \"The Dispatch,\" and \"New York Times\" journalist Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Good morning to all of you. Thank you so much for being here. Jonah, let me start with you on this, because this raid presaged some turmoil, political turmoil in Israel that also played out over the weekend with Benny Gantz resigning. Clearly, it also highlighted this raid, some of the tactics that Hamas has been using in the course of the conduct of this war. JONAH GOLDBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DISPATCH: Yeah, I mean, when you say tactics, they've been highlighting. The reason why the casualties are as high, I don't believe the Hamas health ministry and U.N. keeps revising down their numbers and you should never trust them immediately after any operation. But at the same time, a lot of innocent people died. And the reason a lot of innocent people died is because they hid these hostages in the middle of concentrated civilian centers. And when Israel tried to rescue them, they got involved in a 360-degree firefight. And the weird reaction from a lot of the international community and the media is similar to that, sort of how dare Israel try to save hostages that were stolen from it. And I don't have a lot of patience for.",

It is one of the best trained. And if the United States military, for example, did a raid to rescue hostages and had this high casualty count, there wouldn't simply be applause, there'd also be congressional hearings. [06:05:07] And, you know, I think a lot of people are concerned, and rightly so, for the high casualty count. I mean, it is important and everyone celebrates the fact that these hostages were rescued. But at the same time, Palestinian life is equally as valuable. And so people are upset about it.",

I mean, this is a two-way street. Bibi Netanyahu has also shown himself to be less willing to engage in some of the -- some of the planning for this ceasefire. And we now see that Benny Gantz has resigned simply because he has no more patience with the leadership of Bibi Netanyahu. We've also seen the Israeli public have very little patience with the leadership of Bibi Netanyahu. And on your show, we even heard hostage family members say that they want this ceasefire to go forward, and they feel like the Israeli right and the hard right, which is part of the Bibi Netanyahu government, isn't actually playing ball with this. So I think it actually makes a ceasefire less likely that Benny Gantz has pulled out than more likely, because now Bibi Netanyahu is beholden to the very right flank of his own government.",

Our official, you know, CNN parlance is that this is too close. It doesn't, you know, show anything one way or the other.

And this is one more example of it that is problematic for people.If the election's a referendum on Donald Trump, the polling suggests Joe Biden wins. If the election's a referendum on Joe Biden, the polling suggests Donald Trump wins. It's very hard for things not to seem like a referendum on Donald Trump when he's meeting with his probation officer. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, I think this is a sign, though, of how weak President Biden is, that with all of the problems that we're seeing with Donald Trump -- I mean, he is a convicted felon. I mean, there was just a hush money trial about porn stars and all these things. Every time he speaks, you're just hearing over and over again these same talking points and this destructive language, and yet the polls are so close. And so I think that really does speak to President Biden's weakness. And I think what we're seeing is that people are not adverse to the message of the Democrats. They don't like the messenger, and that's President Biden. HUNT: Yeah, I'm impressed.

I don't know if you all remember, but when he was down there, he was trying to appeal to the Culinary Union to say, you know, once I'm president, I will get rid of taxes on tips and whatnot.And the Culinary Union immediately fires back with a statement, this is a -- like, you know, we take real candidates seriously, not false promises. But just even trying to kind of put forth and advertise a policy proposal feels so out of place now with the Trump who you see on stage 97% of the time. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We should also say the Culinary Union is a hugely democratic organization that campaigns for Democrats in the state. But Nevada is so interesting because, of course, it's because it's got Latinos. You know, he's trying to appeal to that demographic. We've seen a swing towards Trump from Latinos, especially working-class Latinos. And so, you know, the message, I know it sounds, frankly, a little ridiculous coming from him because he doesn't deal in policy, he deals in emotions.
