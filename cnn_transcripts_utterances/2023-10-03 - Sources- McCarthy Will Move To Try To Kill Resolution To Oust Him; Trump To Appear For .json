And Donald Trump is, as people have routinely said, his worst enemy. But also, at the same time, we hope and believe that a jurist -- the court is not going to say you know what?

I don't think it's going to be that exciting. We've already learned from his attorney some of the issues that he's going to raise, and I think some of them are very fair. There's questions about whether some of the prior agreement is still in place. There's questions about who gets charged with this crime from five years ago. And the statute is actually challenged constitutionally. So this is not all going to play out now. It's going to be fairly mundane and I'll use the term again, boring.
