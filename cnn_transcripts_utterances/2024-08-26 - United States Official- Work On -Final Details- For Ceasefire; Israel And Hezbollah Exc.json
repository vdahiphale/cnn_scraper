Back from the brink, leaders of Israel and Hezbollah signaling that the worst is over, at least for now, after intense cross border attacks this weekend. We are live in Beirut for you. Plus, Russia is going after Ukraine's energy infrastructure, targeting 15 regions overnight with a barrage of missile and drone attacks. And in the United States. Kamala Harris has raised more than half a billion dollars since launching her campaign for president. Today, Trump's team is kicking off a new campaign blitz to try to retake the momentum. Well, we start with this hour with a tense calm hanging over the Israel- Lebanon border, after the IDF and Hezbollah launched weekend cross border attacks. Israel's military calling the attacks preemptive. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the IDF destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rockets. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah describes his group's rocket attacks on Israel as a meticulous success. Both leaders are indicating more attacks could come. Meantime, a U.S. official tells CNN, negotiators are discussing, \"final details\" of an elusive ceasefire and hostage release deal for Gaza, as talks do continue in Cairo. That official saying it involves a huge surge of humanitarian aid, as well as a commitment to remove rubble and begin reconstruction. Nada. Bashir back with us this hour from Cairo, along with Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut. Nada, let me just start with you. Attacks this weekend underscores, underscoring just how critical a ceasefire in Gaza is. Because, of course, this cross border -- these cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah have Gaza at the heart of the current conflict. U.S. negotiators again claiming progress in these talks, but we know that there are sticking points, and those are more than that, which I just described. What's the reality from your vantage point there in Cairo as to the progress or not being made at this point?",

That, frankly, hasn't been reflected by Hamas officials in their statements following the depart of a Hamas delegation on Sunday evening, following those talks here in Cairo. In fact, Hamas' position, according to this latest statement from the organization, is, frankly, not too dissimilar from what we've been hearing from the organization for weeks now. That they want to see a deal which reflects the proposal put forward by U.S. President Joe Biden in late May. It appears as though the sticking points that have been the focus of these talks for weeks now continue to persist. Chief among, of course, questions around the long-term permanency of a ceasefire. We know that, of course, in the first phase of agreement, there would be a six week pause in fighting. That is what is being proposed at this stage, with the hope that in the second phase, we will see a transition to a permanent ceasefire. That is something that Hamas wants to see guaranteed, as far as indications suggest that hasn't yet been endorsed or guaranteed by the Israeli delegation. Hamas has said that they will reject the proposal unless that is guaranteed and on the table. And of course, one of the other key areas of disagreement is the presence of Israeli troops within the Gaza Strip, namely on strategic corridors, including the border between Gaza and Egypt. That remains a key sticking point. Israeli forces have proposed a reduced number of troops on that border. Hamas sticking to its position, saying it wants to see a full withdrawal of Israeli troops in any sort of post war agreement.",

He said that they did not target civilian or civilians or civilian infrastructure. Of course, the Israelis say that nothing was hit in this strike, nothing was damaged.

What we understand at this point is that, again, he is facing these charges that we don't know thatmuch about, but related to the spread of illicit, potentially illegal material spreading on Telegram. The thing about Telegram is that it's this encrypted messaging app, which means there's privacy baked into the platform, law enforcement, the platform itself doesn't have a lot of oversight or control into the kinds of conversations that are happening on this platform. And that has meant that it's become a tool for people in countries like Iran, where free speech is restricted. It's become a really important tool, as you said before the break there in Ukraine, where citizens are using it to warn each other about air raids, but that privacy means it's also been used by drug traffickers, by money launderers, by terrorists, and people spreading child sexual abuse material. And that's not limited just to Russia. These are concerns that have spread, you know, and grown as this app has grown to more than 900 million users around the world. Telegram says that it does have some control over what's happening on the platform, and we have seen this platform shut down, for example, channels that were related to Hamas or channels used by the organizers of the recent U.K. riots. Telegram says that it is in compliance with E.U. law, including the new E.U. Digital Services Act, which is forcing lots of big platforms to crack down even more on harmful content. So, I think we'll be waiting to hear more from these French prosecutors about what these charges are and potentially what information they are seeking from this platform.

But to see the CEO of a platform face an arrest over something like this is really unprecedented. And it does get at the heart of this conversation that's happening about a lot of online platforms is, how do you balance the need for safety while still maintaining the ability for people to speak freely? I think one of the things that's different about telegram from some of the other messaging apps and online platforms, it is -- it allows these massive groups, groups up to 200,000 users, to have these pretty private conversations. Other encrypted platforms, like Meta's WhatsApp, have limited the size of groups to stop the spread of disinformation. And other major platforms also do, I think, a bit more to prevent the spread of truly illegal content. Things like drug trafficking or child sexual abuse material. And so, I think it is this question of, where do you draw the line between allowing free speech, but also keeping your users safe?

With just 71 days until November's presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris says -- campaign says it has raised $540 million since she launched her presidential bid in July. The campaign received a surge of grassroots donations during the Democratic National Convention last week, raking in a total of $82 million. Her campaign hopes to build on this momentum as she faces off against Republican Donald Trump in the final weeks leading up to that election.

      "sentences": "It's very significant, because it, at least for the campaign, signals enthusiasm among voters, particularly thosefirst time contributors. In fact, of last week's fundraising, a third of those came from those first time donors. Now, of course, there's no doubt that fundraising has been a bright spot for the Harris campaign since she launched her presidential bid on the heels of President Biden stepping aside from the race. They have seen big numbers, 540 million within the last month, and some of that they're starting to set aside already, at least 370 million of that will be set aside for T.V. and digital advertising in the time between Labor Day and early September and Election Day. So, what that tells us is that they really want to flood the airwaves and take up as much space as they possibly can in the weeks ahead of Election Day. But what I'm also told by sources is that there's certainly a lot of discussions underway in terms of how they keep this momentum going, because grassroots donations as exciting as they may be for the campaign, can be hard to predict. They often happen after key moments. For example, the vice president's remarks last week to close the Democratic National Convention marked the best fundraising hour since launch day. So, how they continue to find those moments is part of the discussion, and whether they also do some splashy fund raising events, which we've seen in the past, also rakes in a lot of cash because, of course, Becky, it is expensive to run a campaign. And so, while they have these coffers that they're excited about, they know that it's going to be a lot of hard work ahead of Election Day that also includes with their travel, the vice president is headed to Georgia this week with her vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz. The reason Georgia is so important is because it's a state that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes in 2020, so it is one of those battleground states that this campaign, as well as the Trump campaign, are looking at very closely and trying to use this momentum to get voters enthusiastic in those states. I was in Georgia not long ago when President Biden was the candidate, and what I was hearing from strategists is that there just wasn't renewed excitement among voters, particularly those who are on the fence about whether or not they're going to show up to the polls. So, that is what the Harris campaign is going to have to work on now is trying to get those voters who perhaps were apprehensive or not so interested in going to vote on Election Day, and making sure they do show up knowing that it's going to be such a tight race in a state like that.",

I also think the specter of a return to office of Donald Trump and everything that might entail really does concentrate the minds of Democrats who see that they have a chance here where they thought that they didn't have just five weeks ago. But it's true that the vice president hasn't laid out an awful lot of policy. She has taken a populist turn on the economy, saying she'd do more to cut grocery prices, help people buy homes for the first time. But on foreign policy, for instance, which may not be a huge issue in the campaign, will be a huge issue in her presidency. We don't know really how she would differ from President Joe Biden on all sorts of other policy, like climate, environment, other issues. This -- there hasn't been a policy layout, so I think there will be some pressure on her to put more meat on the bones, but she is presenting herself as a candidate of change, even though she's a member of this administration, and she's trying to act as the avatar for people who want something other than Trump. She's saying, you don't have to go through that nightmare again. You can choose me. So, I don't think we're ever going to see pages and pages of policy, especially due to the fact we've got a truncated campaign.

Started straight out of university effectively, and when I started, it was lots ofpeople just in their houses trying to make something happen on next to no money, effectively, no performance systems, no anything, just people playing games. And we stand here 10 years later with entire performance, losses and systems, bespoke facilities, players earning tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars. It really is on a global scale now and equivalent to any sport out there.",

Let's talk about the numbers involved, because they are huge tournament. 1,500 players competing for their share of the $16 million in prize money. And the viewership, that's even more impressive, according to the Esports World Cup Foundation, a total of 500 million viewers across the full eight week tournament, able to watch more than 250 million hours of content over that period. That is huge. It frankly means there's something in it for everybody, right? I mean, you -- did you expect it to be this big 10 years ago? You were in the -- you're in the city, right, you're in London doing finance at one point before you decided to throw yourself and your weight behind this?",

And I've seen Esportshappen, and I just -- I don't know, it's hard to explain how I just -- I knew it was my calling. I just wanted to jump into and give it a go on the belief that this is what it could become. In a sense, that was a gamble. But fortunately, it's very much been the case that the gaming world as we know it has always had lots of people involved, and it was only a matter of time, in my opinion, that Esports became something of this sort of scalable level, and those numbers represent just where we're at. I'll admit, I don't think anyone expected the World Cup that they've made to be this successful in terms of our scene and people following it, but it was just testament to the event that they put on to make this the premier event of Esports now.",

What does that mean to you, truly and to those in attendance? And does this put Esports into a -- into a new sort of arena, do you think?

I hear that a lot, but I think it really does add to the legitimacy of what we're doing.For me personally, it was just surreal to be holding a trophy in front of those kind of people, but the fact that they're even there and present and involved shows how much Esports has reached that world stage. It's comparable to traditional sports out there now in terms of viewership, in terms of people following the event. So, yes, surreal for myself, but it's nice to see that legitimacy starting to come through, and it's been around a while, I think now, and will continue to go for strength. This Esports, for me, will become a major, major sports player on the global stage, and is very much catching up already.",

The test pilots for Boeing's Starliner effectively now stranded on the International Space Station since June, finally learning that there is a plan to bring them back home. That plan does not involve a return flight on the Starliner, which suffered a series of setbacks on the way there, but a SpaceX mission set for earlier - - for early next year. CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristen Fisher following all of this very, very closely. Kristen, just what is it about this plan to bring them home, why it's taken so long, and ultimately, why NASA have had to rely on Elon Musk set up to get him out of there?",

They're also testing out those right there, these brand new spacesuits. I mean, keep in mind, NASA has been using the same spacesuits for 40 years. So, they're going to be testing out these new spacesuits. They're also going to be going into a really dangerous part of space called the radiation belt. So, so many firsts here and it launches, hopefully early tomorrow morning, Becky.",
