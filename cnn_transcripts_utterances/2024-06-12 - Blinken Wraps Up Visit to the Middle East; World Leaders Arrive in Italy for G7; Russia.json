Then Russian warships including a nuclear-powered submarine arrive in Cuba in a brand new show of force. We are live in Havana to explain the significance of that. Plus, as world leaders set to meet in Italy for the G7, CNN is learning the U.S. and Ukraine will sign a long-term security agreement on the meetings sidelines. That and much more ahead. All right, some of the changes are workable and some are not. That's how U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken characterizes the Hamas response to a U.N. -- U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza. Blinken wrapped up days of talks with key regional players today, ending his trip in Qatar. He says Hamas has requested numerous changes to the ceasefire plan while Israel has accepted what is on the table -- we have not heard that though, it's important to note from the Israeli government itself. But Blinken says Hamas alone is to blame. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We have seen an escalation in the volatility, the hostility of attacks across the northern border betweenIsrael and Hezbollah over the course of the past couple of weeks. For example, about a week or so, there were fires raging in northern Israel because of extended Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel. And that dangerous trajectory has continued to this point. Israel carried out a strike last night in Lebanon, in southern Lebanon, I should say that killed a Hezbollah commander, Talib Sami Abdallah, as well as several other   Hezbollah militants. In response, we have seen Hezbollah launch some 200 rockets or so at northern Israel, sparking a number of other fires, which I believe at this point, are under control, but they forced more evacuations on top of tens of thousands of Israelis that have already evacuated from northern Israel. Now, from one side, that essentially volatility and the fighting across the northern border does not affect the ceasefire negotiations. In other words, those can move forward if there is a possible path for them to do so. On the other side, war across the northern border, the closer that gets, the more dangerous the situation becomes, and effectively one or two miscalculations by either Israel or Hezbollah can send that over the tipping point even if we're not there yet. And that is the grave concern that the hostilities there open up another front in this war, and that's what everybody is trying to avoid here, especially the diplomatic effort to get to some sort of off ramp that was unsuccessful, leaving the situation much like it is. So, a very dangerous situation there, and one we'll be watching very closely, one Secretary of State Antony Blinken is fully aware, could end very quickly if there is a ceasefire agreement in the fighting in Gaza.",

Zain, you did a phenomenal job of summarizing the report as we got into this discussion here on October 7th, that focuses on the targeting of civilians' acts of murder and torture carried out by Hamas and other militant groups as well as sexual violence, the kidnapping including of children, of entire families and others. We have not yet seen a response from either Hamas or other militant groups there. In terms of Israel, it focuses on what they call a systemic and widespread targeting of civilians attacks  hat have maimed and killed tens of thousands of children there, starvation as a weapon of war, also acts of sexual violence accused by the U.N. against Israeli forces there. Israel was not part of this investigation, and the U.N. says Israel tried to obstruct the carrying out of this investigation.

The two major stories involving tensions between Moscow and Washington, the first in Cuba, where Russian warshipsincluding a nuclear-powered submarine have reached the port of Havana. This is the biggest visit of its kind in years, and a Russian show of force to the United States. American officials tell CNN that U.S. warships and planes have been tracking the vessels. Meantime, the U.S. is now giving additional aid to Ukraine's fight against Russia. The U.S. has now lifted a ban on sending military aid to the Azov Brigade. The group has been praised for its critical fight against Russia and the occupation of Mariupol. But when it started out as a militia several years ago, the unit was associated with white supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology and symbols. Russia has actively tried to play up those connections to justify its invasion. And the Kremlin compares the U.S.' decision to flirting with Neo- Nazis. The Azov Brigade has repeatedly denied allegations of fascism, Nazism and racism, but it welcomed the U.S. decision, calling it, quote, \"a new page in the history of our unit\". Those are their words. Joining us live now with -- from Washington with more is Natasha Bertrand. So, the U.S. is essentially saying that military aid can now go to the Azov Brigade despite its controversial past --obviously allegations, as I mentioned there of racism, ties with white supremacists, ties with right- wing nationalist group as well. But the U.S. is also saying that a vetting process found that there were no human rights violations too. What more can you tell us about that?",

What more can you tell us about Vladimir Putin's response to that? Obviously, we saw his immediate response in terms of saying that Russia will now back American enemies or Russia will now provide weapons to American enemies as well in response to that.

The Pentagon actually made a direct link between President Biden's decision to, you know, allow Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike into Russia, and the timing of these Russian exercises in the Caribbean clearly meant to flex Russia's military muscles and show that it has the ability to exert this kind of power in this region so close to the United States. And so, while it comes as not necessarily a surprise to the U.S. that the Russians would try to do this, they have been tracking their every movement really since they have been moving across the Atlantic and down into the Caribbean. They do understand that it is also a lot of posturing by the Russians, particularly as the U.S. has really ramped up its support for the Ukrainians. So, as of right now, they don't expect any massive kind of retaliation from the Russians against, for example, western interests or against NATO for allowing, you know, that policy shift, allowing the use of U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia. But still, obviously, tensions are a lot higher and the risk of any kind of miscalculation, particularly in this region as that Russian Flotilla is in the Caribbean, is something that they're watching very closely.",

He did say that he was acutely aware of the fact that high inflation in America is a burden. It's a huge burden to lower income Americans. He's aware that that is an economic problem for them. I want to bring in Matt Egan, who has also been listening to Jerome Powell speak. And, Matt, he's right. I mean, you think about the fact that lower- and middle-income Americans are the ones who really suffer the most, not just because you have inflation. And that means that everyday goods are much more expensive. But you also, on top of that, have high interest rates, and that affects personal credit card debt as well.

You have the high prices, the high borrowing costs, and we did get some relieftoday on the price front, but no relief on the borrowing cost front, not yet, at least. The Fed keeping interest rates on hold for the seventh meeting in a row. That was widely expected. The big suspense was going to be over what the Fed was projecting going forward. And from the perspective of borrowers, I mean, the good news is the Fed is still penciling in one interest rate cut this year. But that's down, right, from three rate cuts. That was the projection a few months ago. And remember, going into this year, a lot of people on Wall Street were expecting six interest rate cuts. So, we've come a long way from there, in large part, because inflation has been so stubborn. And so, as Jerome Powell opened his prepared remarks, he said inflation is \"still too high.\" And he said, officials need to get greater confidence that it's going back to that 2 percent goal. And there was a notable change in the statement from Fed officials that they put out. They did say that there has been \"modest further progress\" towards that 2 percent goal. That is a change from their prior language where they said there had been a lack of further progress. But again, they need to see more on that front. And so, really, there's only four meetings left for the Fed this year. Markets don't think that there's going to be a rate cut at the next meeting in July. But I was just looking, there's about a two and three chance priced in for a rate cut in September. And that is the final meeting before the presidential election. And we know that these issues of high cost of living and high borrowing costs, these are big, big things and could end up being a deciding factor for a lot of voters in the upcoming election. Zain.",

Many schools have also closed. Thursday is, get this, expected to be even hotter than that. All right. The effects of climate change are clearly being felt across the world. Villagers in Nepal who earn money from the daring tradition of honey-hunting are worried about the number of bees and beehives this season. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa reports on the challenges threatening this long-standing tradition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  In a remote, hillside village in Nepal, villagers prepare for honey-hunting season, a tradition passed down for generations. But over the years, villagers say the number of bees and hives has been declining. Chandra Singh Gurung is a former honey hunter in the village building ropes and ladders in preparation for the season. CHANDRA SINGH GURUNG, FORMER HONEY HUNTER (through translator):  Honey- hunting begins mid-May every year. And we were happy that we would get some income. But we are all worried now because there are not many beehives this time. RAFFA (voice-over):  The honey produced is sometimes called mad honey, a bittersweet, dark red honey made when these giant bees feed on rhododendron nectar. In small doses, it is known for giving people a sense of calmness, euphoria and in some cases, hallucinations. To get the precious liquid, the hunters use smoke to make the bees flee the hives. They climb cliffs with ladders and use the poles to knock down the hives. Down below, they filter out the honey. It's a dangerous job but a way to make some money. AITA PRASAD GURUNG, HONEY HUNTER (through translator):  I have to climb down the rope ladder and it is fraught with danger of falling. One must extract honey and remain safe at the same time. We get some income after selling it. RAFFA (voice-over):  One bee expert says climate change is affecting the production of this honey in multiple ways.",
