I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, alongside my colleague, Jim Sciutto, who is in Tel Aviv.And we begin in the Middle East where fears of a wider war are growing. Israel and Hezbollah again trading fire across the Lebanon border today. And there's this, Israel also attacking targets in Houthi controlled parts of Yemen. The IDF saying it attacked a power station and a seaport. We learned just moments ago, President Biden will be speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Let's send it over now to Jim, who's in Tel Aviv. And, Jim, I know you've been monitoring all of these developments. What are your takeaways?",

Of course, the most extensive attacks are by Israeli forces on targets inside Lebanon. And now you have Israel hitting targets in Yemen as well.Let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's in Haifa in the north of Israel. Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. Ben, can you give us a sense of the targets, the range of targets of these Israeli airstrikes inside Lebanon, both in the south and in and around Beirut in the last 24 hours?",

When you speak to Israeli officials, are they expecting such a retaliation or is it their assessment as well that Hezbollah may not be capable of a significant retaliation at this point. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Israeli officials that I've spoken with, Jim, tell me that they don't anticipate that kind of large-scale retaliation in the immediate future because they believe that Hezbollah's operational capabilities have been significantly damaged by the Israeli military strikes over the course of the last couple of weeks. And they also believe that the organization is in disarray following the killing of multiple senior commanders, including of course Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah. Hezbollah today fired just over 100 rockets into northern Israel, according to the Israeli military. And that's less, you know, about half of the amount that they were firing over the course of the last few days, last week. And so it just gives you a sense of the fact that their capabilities clearly have been damaged, that they clearly are in organizational disarray, and not able to deal the kind of blow that they might want to in this moment. At the same time, the Israeli military is certainly taking advantage of that organizational chaos within Hezbollah and they are continuing to strike targets as Ben was just saying in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as some strikes around the southern suburbs of Beirut. This is an opportunity for the Israeli military to deal as significant of a blow to Hezbollah as they possibly can at this moment. And at the same time Israeli political and military leaders are making very clear that this is not the end, that they're going to continue to carry out airstrikes against Hezbollah. And also of course that there is this possibility of a ground incursion. We have seen the Israeli military begin to move significant troops and military resources up to that northern border. And Israeli generals have said that they are preparing for the possibility of a ground incursion. That order, though, has not yet come from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who we expect to be speaking with President Biden very soon. Biden has made very clear that he does not want to see that kind of a ground incursion, that he is pushing instead for a ceasefire at this time. That doesn't appear to be where the Israeli military and the Israeli government currently stands, so that will be very interesting to see in the days ahead. Whether or not the United States and the Biden administration is at all capable of reining Israel in at this very critical moment, at a moment when Israel is feeling emboldened, and where they see an opportunity to dismantle Hezbollah as much as possible in the coming days.",

But we do still have some areas of shower chances possible for Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, and even into Ohio.Now the heaviest rain as we go through the next couple of days is really going to be focused over Virginia and West Virginia. Those areas could end up picking up upwards of two inches of rain total. Everywhere else you're looking at about a half an inch up to one inch. And while that may not sound like much, again, a lot of these communities don't need any, even if it is on the low end. The best chance for flooding also exists in the same area where we saw those upwards of two inches of rain. So that's going to be focused across the Virginias. But we do also have the potential at least a marginal risk for flooding across portions of Florida. This is not what folks down there want to hear, especially as they continue with the cleanup and the recovery process there. The good news is that, too, will also be very light rain, likely going to pick up maybe about an inch at most in the next 48 hours. We're also keeping an eye on the tropics because it is very active. Five separate systems that we are keeping a close eye on. But the one of particular interest is this one, kind of near that same development region of where Helene formed last week. Now right now, not a high chance, but we're going to keep a close eye on this over the coming days, especially because it's going to be moving into very warm waters. You're looking at mid to even some spots upper 80s, which would be fuel for a system like this as it tries to develop in the coming days.",

But, Jessica, also interesting, the former president talked about how next week he will return here to Pennsylvania, Butler, specifically, of course, on July 13th. That was the site of the assassination attempt made against him. Of course, you'll remember he said at the Republican Convention right after that in Milwaukee that he had plans to never discuss this again. Well, he talked about that assassination attempt a lot here, even making light of it. At one point saying he plans to begin his speech by saying, as I was saying that day.

So all of those three will be folded into the vice president's remarks at her rally here today.But as you were mentioning there with that poll, the vice president is also trying to shore up support with Latino voters because when you break down those polling numbers, she does hold an advantage, especially among Hispanic women, but not so much with Hispanic men. This is an area that we have been seeing waning support for Democrats. And it's also an area that the Harris campaign is trying to target, to try to gain more ground with those voters. And this Harris campaign official also telling me that here in Nevada, they have been working on their ground game, essentially building out their campaign infrastructure to, again, try to have an advantage over Republicans and the vice president's Republican rival, Donald Trump. Now, it remains to be seen whether that plays out the way they want it to. That'll wait until Election Day. But certainly, this is an opportunity for the vice president to come to talk about those issues that are resonating with voters, but also to capitalize on what they have argued is a better ground game than Republicans. Now, of course, this is going to conclude her West Coast swing. She started it in Arizona with a speech on immigration and border security. It was her going a step further than President Joe Biden on the issue. We'll be watching to see whether she lays into that more today. And then two fundraisers in California. One, she'll be attending shortly, another happening yesterday in San Francisco. Now, this week is going to look like more time on the trail for the vice president, but going to that critical battleground of Pennsylvania, as well as those blue wall states.

And at that point, in the question, I was on the plane, the Pope raised his hand to his face in distress and this is what he had to say in response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POPE FRANCIS, HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SOVEREIGN OF THE VATICAN CITY STATE (through translator): I don't know the details of what has happened, but the defense must always be proportional to that attack. If it's disproportionate, you see a tendency to dominate that goes beyond morality. A country that does these things with force, I am talking about whatever country that does these things in such an exaggerated way, these are immoral actions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Pope has been a consistent advocate for peace in the Middle East calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict. He said on the plane he speaks to the parish, Catholic parish in Gaza virtually every day. And he said he hears firsthand about what's going on.Now people might ask what difference can the Pope make? Of course, the Pope is a moral leader on the world stage. He has relationships with political leaders across the globe. And I imagine that in the coming days, he will be doing what he can to try and push for peace. And I imagine he will also be addressing what is happening in Lebanon in the coming days in public too.
