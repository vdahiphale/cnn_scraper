But first new indications that Israel's response to an Iranian missile attack will happen sooner rather than later. Sources are telling CNN, American officials expect that retaliation to happen before the U.S. election, that's less than three weeks away. We're also hearing from a source that Israeli officials have their plan of attack ready, although Israel has not confirmed that. Meanwhile, Israel's military has resumed attacks on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, after a multi-day pause, one of those strikes killing the Mayor of a Southern Lebanese city. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following all this for us from Jerusalem. So, Jeremy, can you just bring us up to date with these new strikes on Beirut and Southern Lebanon? What do we know?",

We are seeing a cost for civilians and one strike in particular today happened in the Southern Lebanese town of Nabatieh. Six people were killed. 43 others at least have been injured so far in this strike, which actually hit a municipality building and the building housing government administration, according to the Lebanese civil defense. One of the six people who were killed was actually this city's mayor. The Israeli military, for its part, says that it was targeting Hezbollah targets in the city to dismantle what they claimed was underground infrastructure used by Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force. They also are accusing Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields by having that underground facility beneath homes and civilian buildings in the City of Nabatieh. But the results are clear, and that is that Civil Defense workers are still very much picking through the rubble to determine exactly how many people have been killed, but clearly civilians are among the casualties in the strike.",

They don't have the appropriate treatment. These are just medical conditions. I'm not even talking about the trauma. We have patients coming in who've been untreated for diabetes, which is a very easily treatable disease, who haven't been treated for an entire year because they haven't had access to medications, to hygiene, to the actual medical care, because it's all been destroyed. And in the last 48 hours, I've seen so many patients with wound infections on their feet that have gotten so bad, necrotic, gangrenous, that they've had to have limb amputations. I've done more leg amputations for diabetes than for trauma in the last 48 hours. And so, all these things are starting to catch up, and just at an exponential pace, everything is going downhill.

And thefunction of this victory plan is, as Zelenskyy says, to push Russia to the negotiating table and to strengthen Ukraine's hand once it gets there. So, as you say, they want an invitation to join NATO. They asked for that before. Allies have so far stopped short of that in terms of bolstering Ukraine's defense. These are many of the asks that we've already heard. Namely, of course, permission to use Western long-range missiles on Russian soil. Zelenskyy also said that he wants Ukraine's neighbors to be able to help shoot down drones and missiles over Ukraine if they fall within the range of these countries air defenses. This is something that Poland has signaled it is open to in the past, and they intended to hang on to some territory inside of Russia as a buffer zone. In addition to that, interestingly, there was a request for a deterrent, a comprehensive non-nuclear strategic deterrent, as the plan put it. We don't know what that is, but something to deter future Russian aggression that would be stationed on Ukrainian soil. And interestingly, because of course, this does come in a climate, particularly in the U.S., where Zelenskyy and Ukraine have faced criticism for being essentially a drain on Western taxpayers. It does contain sweeteners for Western allies. It contains a proposal whereby Western countries could share in the profits from Ukraine's raw materials in exchange for protecting them, and it contains a post war proposal that Ukrainian troops could replace some U.S. troops stationed in Europe as part of NATO's defense. Because, of course, of their battlefield experience, all of these needs buy in from Western allies. And Zelenskyy was pretty open about the challenges of getting there. Take a listen.

We're also seeing them active in other areas. Just this week, Russia claimed to have taken a small village in the Eastern Zaporizhzhia region, which is an area they haven't been moving much in a long time. Ukraine has had to evacuate upper near Kupiansk in the Northeastern Kharkiv region as well. And Russia is counter attacking now pretty actively in Kursk as well. So, there is an awful lot going on the aerial wall. So continues unabated. Ukraine, just overnight into this morning, had to deal with an attack involving 136 drones. So, they are under a lot of pressure. And I think that adds to the sort of backdrop of this speech.

So, this fuel tanker veered off the road, possibly to try and avoid hitting another tanker. And it rolled several times before falling into a ditch, and then fuel started spilling out of the tanker. And residents rushed to the scene to try and siphon fuel. Part of the reason could be that fuel has become quite expensive in Nigeria after the removal of fuel subsidies, and so free fuel is something that's welcome to a lot of people. Unfortunately, this scene then caught on fire, and it burned quite rapidly. Some video social media showing at the area engulfed in flames, police saying at least 94 people died there, and as you mentioned, that number could increase because at least 50 people are in serious condition in nearby hospitals. So, when the full account is done, some of them might not make it sadly. This is not the first time that such an incident has happened in Nigeria. Fuel tankers explored on roads. Fuel tanker accidents and truck accidents happen quite frequently. Just another accident happened last month after a collision, 48 people died there. And according to recent statistics, in 2020 there were more than 1500 truck accidents across Nigeria. Part of the reason is poor roads. Another reason is sometimes these accidents are blamed on reckless driving or poorly maintained cars. So, they're not in great condition to be on the roads to start with.

Kamala Harris hit back against Trump's declaration that he's the father of IVF, saying, if he wins, IVF and other reproductive treatments would be in jeopardy.

EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: So, Omar, she's clearly trying to reach conservatives and listen, there is disagreement among Democrats about if this is the best strategy. There are competing visions for how resources should be used, how the vice president's precious time should be used in these closing weeks. But the campaign clearly believes that she has an opening here, that she can go after these Nikki Haley voters. That's why we are going to see her lean into this country over party message today, she's going to be joined by Republicans on the campaign trail.

This week, the cash strapped company said it would borrow $10 billion from several banks and try to bring in an additional 25 billion by selling off stock and debt. It also plans to cut its global headcount by 10 percent and that could have a ripple effect in the United States and beyond. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich has more.

But sort of the good news for American consumers first here is that Boeing's financial trouble and the strike that they're facing right now, which is now into its second month, won't impact everyday people like you and I just yet, because the factory has been closed in Seattle for over a month now, but that shouldn't necessarily affect what you and I are paying for our plane tickets every single day. Sure, maybe because there are some delayed orders, you could see prices of seats go up just a little bit, but right now, there's not a ton of demand, which actually means that airline prices are falling, so that's good news for the American consumer right now. However, Omar, for the broader economy, this is significant. Boeing is the number one exporter here in the United States. They supply all major airlines with planes. And right now, with this strike, they are seeing an economic impact of $5 billion in just the first month, to the company, to workers, to suppliers. And that is significant, because every day that this goes on, this strike goes on, that's a larger financial impact to the company. As I just mentioned, they've had to borrow money. They also announced just last week that they're laying off 10 percent of their workforce, that's 17,000 employees that are going to be losing their jobs in just the next several months. And Boeing itself, just as a company, is a huge economic driver. They say that they generate $79 billion into the U.S. economy. They employ, and as a ripple effect, they employ about 1.6 million jobs, so people who are the suppliers, customers in the area. So, the fact that they're sort of in troubled waters is important to note. However, Omar, this is kind of a too big to fail situation. They're one of only two, two makers of passenger airlines -- passenger airplanes in the entire world. This is not a company that is going to go under the U.S., and the world needs this company. It's just they are digging out of a really big financial hole right now. And this ongoing strike really is just putting a lot of pressure on the company to reach a deal and get back on track, Omar.",
