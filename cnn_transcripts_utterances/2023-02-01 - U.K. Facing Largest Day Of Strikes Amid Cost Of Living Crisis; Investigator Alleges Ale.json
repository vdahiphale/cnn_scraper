But also, of course, to combat the cost of living crisis, which is only deepening.Now, today, of course, we are seeing teachers going on strike, transport workers, and civil servants, and this is set to cause widespread disruption across the country. But this is all part of a long-running standoff between the trade unions and the government. They say over the last few weeks negotiations have stalled and the government isn't budging on calls for that pay rise. We are expecting to hear from the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak later today. He will address Parliament as part of prime minister's questions and he will certainly be facing questions on these strikes and on the industrial action that is being called for over the next few weeks. But the message we're hearing from the unions is that these strikes will not end until the government is able to come to the negotiating table and to reach a suitable and appropriate resolution with the unions that meets their demands. And, of course, this is just the beginning. We are expecting further strikes next week which will impact the national health service with nurses, ambulance workers, and even some NHS consultants threatening to go on strike. And that could have a severe impact on, of course, emergency care. But there are set to be further strikes across the next month and even into the summer if the government doesn't budge on their refusal to increase those pay rises for public service workers.",
