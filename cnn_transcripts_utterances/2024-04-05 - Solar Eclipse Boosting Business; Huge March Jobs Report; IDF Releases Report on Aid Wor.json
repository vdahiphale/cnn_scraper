We heard from New York City officials in the last hour really emphasizing that, thus far, they have received no reports of any sort of structural damage in and around New York City, certainly no injuries as well, though they are still conducting their assessments. Of course, the infrastructure, it's always a key question here, the bridges, the tunnels. Well, officials are sharing today that, in fact, the tunnels are meant to sort of move with the earth during seismic events. And the roughly seven bridges in and out of New York City that are operated by the Mass Transit Authority, they're actually built to withstand a seismic event even greater than what we experienced earlier this morning. So, really sort of a reassuring tone from officials here in New York, encouraging people to go about their day, but also to remain vigilant. We also heard from Zach Iscol, one of the emergency officials here in New York, saying that the risk of any aftershocks, that is low, though encouraging people to remain vigilant and also, should that take place, to take those precautions to take care of themselves and their families. But, again, that is really the key line right now, no major impacts, and, as officials described, no major safety events to report after this truly historic and highly unusual event. The people on the streets of New York, Brianna and Boris, it depends on who you ask. Some people certainly felt it. If you're like myself, you didn't feel it on your way in this morning.",

The IDF says soldiers involved in the drone strike misidentified a shoulder bag that one of the passengers was holding as a weapon. The IDF says the surveillance drones did not capture the large World Central Kitchen decals on the vehicles because it was nighttime. Israel released the report just hours after President Biden held a tense phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and public warnings from multiple administration officials that U.S. policy toward Israel's Gaza war will change if Israel doesn't take significant steps to protect civilians and particularly aid workers in Gaza.

The Israeli military says that they -- their forces identified a gunman aboard an aid truck at the beginning of this journey after receiving the aid that was loaded onto these trucks, and they subsequently -- the military commander subsequently made a very deadly and very incorrect assumption that Hamas militants were inside these three vehicles once they left this warehouse where these aid workers were unloading pallets of aid. They also misidentified what was likely a bag slung over the shoulders of one of these workers as a weapon. And, as you also noted, they -- the Israeli military says that they were not able to see the logo on the World Central Kitchen vehicles because it was nighttime. Now, as a result of this, the Israeli military has dismissed two of the officers involved in this strike, Colonel Nochi Mendel, the brigade chief of staff involved in this, as well as an unidentified major who was serving as the brigade's fire support officer. The Israeli military's chief of staff also reprimanding three other senior officers, including the head of Israel's Southern Command. There are still questions, of course, about exactly what kinds of changes the Israeli military will institute following this review. They say that they will take the lessons learned from this report and apply them going forward, but it's not clear exactly what specific policy changes this will result in.",

I do appreciate you being with us this afternoon. I was distracted for a moment because we just heard from President Biden. Reporters were able to shout questions as he was departing the White House. He's on the way to Baltimore to speak to folks there about the bridge collapse last week. He was asked if he was happy with the response from Israel thus far, with the U.S. asking them to do more to get aid into Gaza and to protect the lives of civilians and aid workers. The president said -- and I quote -- \"I asked them to do what they are doing.\" Would you agree with that assessment from President Biden? REP. MADELEINE DEAN (D-PA):  Well, Boris, it's good to be with you. And you're right. I'm from suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and I can report we felt the earthquake here too. I'm proud of the president. I know we are less than 24 hours since his, I believe, very direct, stern call with Prime Minister Netanyahu, where he told the prime minister that he must not stand in the way of humanitarian aid, that he was outraged. I can presume he said he was outraged by the death of the seven World Kitchen Central workers, who were so precisely taken out in their aid vehicles. It's a horror. But he also said, as the readout shows us, that Mr. Netanyahu must allow and empower his negotiators to get the hostages out. In addition, more aid must come in, opening of other passageways, whether Jordan border or not. So I'm not sure what the president meant, but, certainly, we are seeing some evidence that Mr. Netanyahu and his coalition are taking this seriously. But I have to tell you, we are 32,000 civilians dead in Gaza, in addition to those seven angels, as the chef called them, that were killed in a very targeted, accidental, I hope, but very targeted strike on their vehicles; 200 other aid workers are dead. I had the chance when I was in Israel, twice now since the beginning of this war, to meet with UNRWA officials, in fact, UNRWA officials in the ground -- on the ground in Israel, but also the director in Rafah. They have lost 200 of their aid workers. And he says, somehow, the remaining ones come in faithfully day after day to do the impossible. So, I praise the president, and I lay all of this at the feet of Prime Minister Netanyahu.",

You said, \"Accidental, I hope.\"There has been a lot of speculation that perhaps, because this happened in a deconflicted zone, that it wasn't a mixup. I have not seen any evidence that has given credence to that theory, but I do want to ask you about the investigation itself. We know that U.S. officials received the initial results of an investigation by the Israelis. Do you believe that is going to be transparent and thorough enough to give you peace of mind that whatever steps Israel takes toward accountability actually meet the moment?",

So I do hope it is accidental, but, man, oh, man, these accidents with a military that boasts -- and the prime minister literally, in my meeting with him on November the 11th, boasted of their superior intelligence and their superior ability to pinpoint and target. [13:15:02] Well, it looks here like terrible intelligence and the ability to pinpoint and target. We need a full investigation. We need full transparency.

Mr. Netanyahu, after all, let's think about this. He was not honest about how he was going to prosecute this war. He told us they could be more targeted and strategic. Instead, he's dropped 2,000-pound dumb bombs and taken out whole villages, whole buildings and neighborhoods. Mr. Netanyahu does not want a two-state solution. Neither does Mr. Trump. We are better off, the world is better off, and the Palestinian people, the Israeli people will be better off if Mr. Netanyahu is ultimately decided in a new vote whether or not he should continue. But Mr. Trump would be a useful idiot to Mr. Netanyahu's, I think, failed ways, the failure of the prosecution of this war. Israel had the right, has the right and obligation to defend itself, its security, its borders. Jews around the world have the right to this homeland. But, at the same time, we have to lift up the homeland of the Palestinian people. Mr. Trump would not be anywhere near that, just as Mr. Netanyahu isn't.
