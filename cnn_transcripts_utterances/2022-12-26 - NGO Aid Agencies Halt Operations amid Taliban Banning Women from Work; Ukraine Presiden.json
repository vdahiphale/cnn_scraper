Four major international aid agencies have announced their temporarily suspending operations in the country. They say they cannot effectively reach children and other women in desperate need in Afghanistan without their female staff.Meanwhile, the Red Cross and the European Union said the move will severely restrict the delivery of aid and the E.U. is urging the Taliban to reverse this decision. Qatar also expressed deep concern over the ban. However, in a tweet, a Taliban spokesperson lashed out at a U.S. official asking her not to interfere in Afghanistan's internal issues. Joining me now is Jan Egeland, he is the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the eight organizations that has temporarily suspended its operations in Afghanistan. This organization employs more than 400 Afghan women that he says are crucial to humanitarian efforts across the nation. Mr. Egeland, the situation as you know better than anyone else in Afghanistan is already very grim. What damage is inflicted by this ban and what are the effects that you are now seeing?",

That's why we are there to help them with female and male employees.So, when they tell us to take away one-third of our able, committed humanitarian workers, we cannot operate. It means that millions with the combined total of the aid organization will not get aid next week. And they are totally dependent on this. But we cannot continue with male staff only. It will be totally wrong, in contradiction with all of principles, but it also would be technically impossible. We cannot have males giving assistance to women or to mothers directly.

The Kremlin is also urgently launching new atomic ice breakers to ensure it retains influence over a shorter trade route from the pacific to Europe, opened up by climate change, reducing the Arctic ice cover.But the war in Ukraine has led to major changes on both sides. Russia sends 75 percent of its Arctic land forces to Ukraine, a senior western intelligence official has told me. But its Navy is almost untouched, semi-detached from the war, they added also. After strikes on air fields deep inside Russian, jets are being dispersed around its territory, some to the north, boosting effectively their presence in the Arctic. NATO is also sending its messages. What you're seeing here looks like a normal air drop of a supply palette, but it is an unprecedented exercise over Norway by U.S. Special Forces this year, dropping off a cruise missile on a parachute. Here, it ignites. The U.S. military keen to show it can fire such arms from a cargo plane, greatly increasing its range near Russian. Shaken by a recent sabotage of Baltic Sea pipelines, NATO is now focused on protecting Norway's energy infrastructure.
