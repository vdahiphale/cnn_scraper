And that's been really important to help give families some breathing room. But as you say, and as the president says, whenever he talks about it, prices are still too high. So, we have to continue to reduce junk fees wherever they see them while maintaining the very tight job market. You will remember that economists assured us that we'd be in a recession by now. In fact, the economy is growing with some real strength. Real wages are up. That helps families buying power. So, we just have more work to do to build on the progress we've made.

They are looking into these comments that were allegedly made by Roger Stone in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election, but are only surfacing now after Mediaite published that audio recording you just played in.Look, as you know, USCP, FBI take threats against lawmakers incredibly seriously. And based on the content of this recording, it certainly seems to fit in that bucket. Now, Roger Stone is basically denying that he ever said this and that that's him even on the audio recording. He's calling it total nonsense. He accuses it of being A.I. manipulation and he calls the whole thing absurd. But, look, this is not the first time that Roger Stone's comments and his actions related to the election have been under scrutiny. He obviously was a close ally of former President Donald Trump. He was actively involved in various efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to evidence the House January 6th committee put forward. And he was at Trump's Stop the Steal rally on January 6th. And, of course, he was also convicted as the result of Robert Mueller's probe way back when his prison sentence was ultimately commuted by Trump before he ever had to go to jail. But, you know, Roger Stone, a very familiar name popping up in a very familiar context.",

This threat and other threats of violence by Trump and his supporters must be taken seriously by not only law enforcement but also by my colleagues.And, Phil, as you know too, look, threats against lawmakers have been up in the time since January 6th, 2021, and USCP and the FBI seem very intent on looking into these comments by Roger Stone.",
