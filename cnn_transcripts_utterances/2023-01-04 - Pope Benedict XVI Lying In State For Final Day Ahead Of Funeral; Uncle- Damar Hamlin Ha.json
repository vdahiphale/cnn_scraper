In this case, about 10 years.Essentially, what the Vatican is saying is that the ceremony is going to be exactly as though Pope Benedict was still in office. But there might be some differences consider -- especially in language, considering that he wasn't actually in the office anymore -- that he wasn't the actual pope anymore. The big difference, of course, is going to be is that the sitting pope, Pope Francis, is going to be presiding over all the things that are going to be going on. That, of course, in itself, is something that's extremely remarkable. The first time that has happened in the modern era. So, essentially, what's going to happen is right now, the pope's body is still lying in state. You can see behind me a lot of people still going to pay their final respects. Later today, the coffin is going to be sealed. That also has a special procedure. Pope Francis is going to oversee that as well. And then tomorrow, as you mentioned, is going to be the big day when that funeral is going to take place. A lot of heads of state and a lot of heads of government are going to come here to Rome. That whole ceremony is also going to be overseen by Pope Francis as well. Of course, that, in itself, is a big deal. And then, Pope Benedict is going to be placed into the papal tombs underneath the Vatican. They are, by the way, taking the place that beforehand, John Paul II had -- who, of course, now is inside the Vatican -- inside St. Peter's Basilica -- because he was declared a saint a couple of years ago, Christine. ROMANS:  OK, interesting. All right. Thanks so much, Fred Pleitgen. We know you'll cover it for us today. Thank you. Quick hits around the globe right now.

You can see the family gathering together -- gathering on the rooftop of the house to say goodbye to a friend, to a brother, to a son, to a father. POZZEBON (voice-over):  Relatives and friends gathered on the terrace. Pele's own sister bidding him farewell. After a final prayer, the greatest football player of all time was finally laid to rest in a private ceremony only for the family and far away from the cameras. From now on, Pele will always be at a short distance from the football ground he graced with his magic. The banners with his name already taken from the stands.
