Tonight, all eyes are trained on the UnitedNations Security Council as members wrangle over the wording in a resolution, calling for a halt to the fighting in Gaza. That vote, expected in the coming hours. We have the very latest for you. And then, extraordinary scenes, as you're seeing there in Iceland as volcano in the country's southwest violently erupts after weeks of activity. Plus, search and rescue teams in northwestern China are battling sub-zero temperatures as they hunt for survivors from a deadly earthquake. But first this evening, the U.N. Security Council is considering another resolution on the war in Gaza. Right now, expected, in fact, in the next hour or so as the Red Cross -- as the Red Cross chief accuses the world of a moral failure for allowing the bloodshed and humanitarian catastrophe to continue. The new draft resolution calls for the suspension of hostilities, not a cessation or a ceasefire in an attempt to avoid another veto by the United States. Today's -- Israel's President, Isaac Herzog said his country is ready for a humanitarian pause in its war on Hamas to enable the release of more hostages and delivery of more humanitarian aid. But he says Hamas is standing in the way. For the people of Gaza, a new truce, well, can't come soon enough. This is the aftermath of a strike on Rafah near the Egyptian border. Witnesses say children are among the dead. According to U.N., Rafah has become the most densely-populated area in Gaza after Israel urged civilians, of course, to flee there. Let's get the very latest from our Jeremy Diamond who joins us this hour from Tel Aviv. So Jeremy, let's start first of all with the U.N. Security Council vote that is expected in the next hour or so. What are you hearing about the wording here around the vote and how the U.S. may vote depending on the language, critically?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there have been very intensive negotiations over the wording of this resolution that was drafted by theUnited Arab Emirates, and is set to come up at the U.N. Security Council at some point later today, perhaps as early as 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. And the focus is on the language around a pause in hostilities. The initial draft of this resolution apparently called for a cessation of hostilities, but there were negotiations involving the United States to try and shift the wording to a suspension of hostilities which could potentially gain, if not the full support of the United States than at least avoid another veto by the United States and allow this resolution to pass. Earlier this month, the United States vetoed another resolution that came before the Security Council, which called for an all-out ceasefire to the hostilities. The United States at the time said it voted against the resolution in part because it did not include a reference to Hamas' October 7th terrorist attack. But this resolution, if indeed, it passes, would certainly send a very strong message to Israel about the growing international outcry over the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The need to allow more aid to enter the Gaza Strip, and also to provide a respite to Palestinian civilians who have suffered enormously from the bombing campaign that has continued inside of Gaza. Now, it's unclear whether or not the United States will ultimately support this resolution, but of course, it comes in the context of the United States trying to get this message across to Israel that it needs to shift its fighting in Gaza to a much slower tempo, much less intense tempo, to allow for more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, and of course, to provide a respite for those civilians.",

The bursts of lava lighting up the sky, look, really striking, but this isn't a surprise. There's been ramped-up Seismic activity, as you know, for weeks that a nearby town was evacuated last month. It's still distressing for people who had to flee, but authorities say there's no immediate threat and air traffic is operating normally. They also say there are toxic gases and people need to stay away. They've warned weather patterns could move gas pollution towards the capital, Reykjavik in the coming days.

Over 100 attacks in the last four weeks alone on roughly a dozen different commercial vessels there. The U.S. hoping that this show of force is going to deter the Houthis from attacking the ships. We have not seen that work in the past. We should note the U.S. has shut down a number of missiles and drones launched by the Houthis in Yemen and they've only continued to launch their attacks.

The U.K. and U.S. have already imposed travelrestrictions on, quote, \"extremist settlers,\" and the E.U. is considering sanctions. This comes as the U.N. says 477 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem this year alone. More than half were killed since October the 7th. That makes it the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2005. Our chief international investigative correspondent, Nima Elbagir, visited Hebron to see what life is like for Palestinians living there. And a warning: her report contains some disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): We stop at a service station in the occupied Palestinian West Bank. A man in military fatigues demands to check our IDs. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (from captions): He said I have the right to secure this area. ELBAGIR (voice-over): But he has no identifying insignia, won't tell us who he is but he's got a gun. So we oblige. We're confused. And we're not the only ones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELBAGIR (voice-over): CNN obtained this video from inside Hebron, a divided city, filmed a few days after the Hamas October 7th attack. The Palestinian man won't comply. He says he recognizes the man with the gun as a settler, not a soldier. In this tense climate, if a soldier issues an order, you comply. But is everyone with a gun and fatigues a soldier? The West Bank is under Israeli military operation. It's also believed to be home to almost 0.75 million settlers, Israeli civilians living in the Occupied Territories. Settlers consider this part of their Biblical homeland and are expanding into Palestinian Territories. Even though the U.N. Security Council considers their presence illegal. Yet settlers are integral to Israel's security plan in the Occupied Territories as Israel Defense Force reservists and settlement security squads. Responding, the IDF says,  security threats in settlements, towns and villages. Palestinians told CNN they consider armed settlers a greater threat than ever before. Their remit from the IDF is blurring the lines as settlers encroach on Palestinian land, like, here in the Palestinian village of Suwannee (ph), where there is a settlement at the top of the hill. In this video, you see men in military fatigues. The IDF equips both civilian settler security squads and soldiers in the region, as you can see here. It is almost impossible to differentiate. They point their rifles at residents and then they shoot, according to eyewitnesses. CNN shared the images we gathered in the West Bank with a senior IDF official, who was unable to tell us who here is in the IDF and who is not. We asked, how, then, are Palestinians expected to differentiate? The official told CNN there have been cases of reservists who did not act in accordance with army standards, adding, \"There is no place in the IDF for such behavior. Every case that breaches army standards will be investigated.\" Palestinians, the official said, should contact their local brigade. But Palestinian rights activists and local resident Basel Adra says settlers in military fatigues are forcing Palestinians off their land.",
