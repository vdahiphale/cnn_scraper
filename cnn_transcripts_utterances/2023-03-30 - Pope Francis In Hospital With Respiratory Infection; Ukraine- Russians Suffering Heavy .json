Now, we saw Pope Francis on Wednesday morning at his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. He seemed to be speaking and breathing just fine. But of course, he is 86 years old, and when he was a younger man, he had part of his right lung removed due to respiratory illness. This begins an important Easter week, one of the busiest weeks in the Vatican. On Sunday for the Pope, he has scheduled masses and other events, but for the moment, we will be monitoring his progress in the hospital. Delia Gallagher, CNN, Rome.",

Still, the U.S. Joint chiefs of staff chairman says it's the Russians who are paying the highest price. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: These forces are very undertrained. They're essentially doing frontal assaults into machine gun positions, et cetera, and they're getting slaughtered. The Russian troops are. Ukrainians are doing a very effective area defense that is proven to be very costly to the Russians. For about the last 2021 days, the Russians have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut. So it's a slaughter fest for the Russians. They're getting hammered in the vicinity of Bakhmut and the Ukrainians have fought very, very well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Ukraine's government says some members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church are still loyal to Moscow, but that church says it cut its ties with the Russian Orthodox Church last year and calls the order to leave legally baseless.A Russian man whose daughter drew an antiwar picture at school has now been found and detained in Belarus after failing to show up for a hearing. The man had been charged with discrediting the Russian military over his own antiwar posts and was sentenced to two years in prison. He fled while under house arrest. His lawyer has now released a letter from the man's 13 year old daughter, Masha, who was sent to an orphanage after her father was put on house arrest. In her letter to him, she said, quote, \"Know that we will win. No matter what happens we are together.\" Last April, Masha drew a picture during an art class of Russian missiles being fired at a Ukrainian family with the words \"no to war\", and \"glory to Ukraine\". Her school later called police. A human rights group says more than 400 Russians have been prosecuted for anti war activities since the invasion of Ukraine began. But one 20-year-old student says she was singled out and faced severe charges after criticizing the war on social media. Now she managed to flee Russia and has no intention of staying silent as our Melissa Bell reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
