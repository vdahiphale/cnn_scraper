Both groups are demanding higher pay and more revenue-sharing from T.V. and film studios in the face of streaming services and artificial intelligence. And some of the best paid actors in the business are supporting rank and file members, some of whom are struggling to make ends meet. Because of the strike, all movie publicity is suspended.

The military guys were obsessed with secrecy and compartmentalization and need to know, as they should be. This was -- we're talking about the potential to destroy humanity and at the same time the scientists were of the mind that we needed to share all the information we could so that we could get to the truth, because that's what scientists do. They build on each other's work. And so there was this natural tension in the relationship. But on top of that, Groves was a brusque, you know, no B.S. military man.

So, it's always a reminder to like, keep kicking ass.(END VIDEO CLIP)",
