Air travelers were among the first to feel the impact as Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv temporarily halted flights, departures and arrivals. Flights have now resumed. Today's strike comes as anger builds over the killing of six hostages in Gaza. Protesters are turning out again in cities across Israel, one day after tens of thousands filled the streets to demand a deal to bring the hostages home. One man who came out to protest explained why so many people feel frustrated and angry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The stated goal of today from these labor unions is to halt Israel's economy, to force Prime Minister Netanyahu's hand by essentially stopping all economic activity or as much as they possibly can today. It is very telling for these protesters, these demonstrators.It is the details that are motivating this anger and drive on the streets. You mentioned the six hostages, of course, killed, but it's the details of that. Three of those hostages were set to be released, potentially in any ceasefire deal. One of them, this Israeli American, Hersch Goldberg-Polin, who was killed. He was really in many ways the face of this movement. His parents were very outspoken. They were at the DNC just a couple of weeks ago saying, bring them home. So there is a real sense that Prime Minister Netanyahu has failed to secure a deal to bring those hostages home and that he is prioritizing the demands of his own cabinet over the tens of thousands of people you see on the streets.",

And her sister-in-law, Yarden Roman, was also taken hostage and she was returned. She was brought back home on the 54th day of the war, thanks to a ceasefire that was signed between Israel and Hamas. And we really hoped that a very similar ceasefire would be signed between the two sides. But we found out that it was very, very hard to bring the two sides to sign the deal. Hamas is a terror organization. I have no expectations from this horrible figure, Yahya Sinwar, to sign the deal that will actually bring my cousin home. But we know that Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point. And Israel was the one putting on more and more terms and actually postponing the deal. And right now, we know the decisions that our prime minister, Netanyahu, has made, made it impossible for Carmel and other hostages to return and put their lives in great danger.

This is very moving.And I know that Carmel can't see this, but I know that's exactly what she would have wanted, for people to come out and to demand the release of the other hostages. It's too late for her, but it's not too late for them. And I hope that they're not, that the government is not just going to look away and to choose death over life, because this is not what we believe here in Israel. That's not what we believe this war is about. You know, you're giving a lot of airtime to this war because of things that are going on, on both sides of the border. People think it's Israel versus Palestine or Jews versus Muslims. This is and has always been a fight between people who believe in life and who choose life and who choose a ceasefire that will bring the hostages home over the people who believe in death and choose death. And I know that the organization that kidnapped Carmel and that murdered her mother chose death. They believe that death is sacred. But I can't believe, I still can't believe that my government chose death. And I urge you, Benjamin Netanyahu, choose life.

And the fact that she was able to be a beacon of light in captivity, to shed light on the other hostages, in the darkest places, in the darkest times, it's heartwarming for me to know. And I think for all the family, she actually had yoga sessions done with them in order to keep them safe and meditation sessions in order to keep their spirits up. And one of the hostages who were with her posted yesterday a very, very, very short post saying, thank you and you're the reason I'm here today. And I believe, I don't know what she saw from there. I know that now it's too late to tell her that, but I really hope that she knows that she saved these wonderful people's lives and that she was a beacon of light to them and that she was an inspiration to so many people here in Israel to support the cause and the life of the hostages and to support life and what she believed in in her life.

And it seems Kamala Harris is not enjoying the post-convention bounce she might've expected.A new national poll from ABC News and Ipsos shows the vice president holding a narrow lead over Donald Trump. Harris is at 50 percent and Trump is at 46 percent among registered voters. That's nearly identical to the poll results from early August before the Democratic National Convention. Well, President Joe Biden will join Harris on the campaign trail as voting kicks off in some states this week. He's set to appear at a Labor Day event in Pittsburgh on Monday after Harris makes a stop in Detroit. It's part of the campaign's push to appeal to working class voters across battleground states. On Tuesday, Harris's campaign will launch a new bus tour to advocate for women's reproductive rights. It will start in Trump's hometown of Palm Beach, Florida. And U.S. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff is speaking out after Kamala Harris seemingly changed her position on fracking. He told CNN in an exclusive interview last week that she won't ban fracking, even though in the past she said she would. Schiff defended her comments despite his support for banning fracking. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I do think that when you are representing the whole country, you have a different perspective. As the vice president pointed out, her values, though, have remained consistent, and that is she is a champion of moving ourselves in the renewable energy direction. But look, let's compare a situation where someone changed their position four years ago to Donald Trump, who's changed his position four times on abortion in the last 48 hours. That, to me, is, you know, a much more significant question, particularly as, when you're talking about abortion and you're talking about a right and freedom of the American people, to be so pandering, wishy-washy, flip-flopping, you know, so disrespectful of the rights and freedoms of millions of American women.
