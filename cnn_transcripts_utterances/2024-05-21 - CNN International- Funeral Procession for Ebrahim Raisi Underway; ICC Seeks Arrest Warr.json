That's 11.30 in Tabriz, Iran, where a funeral procession for President Ebrahim Raisi is now underway.Large crowds have turned out to pay their respects to Raisi, the country's foreign minister, and seven others who were killed in a helicopter crash over the weekend. The northwest city of Tabriz is the first stop for the funeral procession, followed by ceremonies held in other cities in the days ahead. The country is observing five days of national mourning. A video released earlier by Iran's state media shows the caskets carrying the late president and the country's foreign minister. Raisi's helicopter crashed in a remote mountainous area of Iran's East Azerbaijan province. The country's military chief has now appointed a commission to investigate what caused the deadly crash. The United States is rejecting claims by Iran's foreign -- or former foreign minister that its sanctions kept Iran from accessing parts of aviation, well, aviation parts that they required. Former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif told state media that the U.S. is partially guilty for the helicopter crash that killed Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday. Washington is denouncing those allegations, calling them baseless. U.S. national security spokesman saying Iran's aviation safety is Iran's responsibility alone. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: The United States had no part to play in that crash. And so that's a fact plain as something.

What state media is going to be broadcasting is three days, really, of this funeral procession. It will hit a number of cities.These nine bodies will be transported to different cities. At the moment, they are in Tabriz. This is the city in northwestern Iran that was closest to the location of where the helicopter went down. Now, we know there was a procession that started in Martyrs Square recently this morning, and it was going to end up in prayers at the Tabriz prayer hall. But then these bodies will be transported to the holy Shiite city of Qom. We know also that they will be going to Tehran, the capital. And this is where on Wednesday you will see probably some of the biggest crowds when it comes to showing respects to the late President Raisi. There will be in the Grand Mosalla Mosque, there will be prayers for these nine individuals who were on board that helicopter that went down on Sunday. And then the body of the late President Raisi will be going to Birjand, where he was the special representative for the Ayatollah, and then on to Mashhad, which is where the Imam Reza Shrine is. [04:05:00] That is where we will see the Ayatollah, the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. He will be leading the prayers for Raisi there, and then there will be the burial later in the day. So this is three days that we will see of the funeral procession and ceremonies across the country. There have been five days of mourning that have been called for from the Ayatollah. We know for seven days there will be no arts or cultural events. Wednesday is a national holiday to make sure that the whole county can be part of these processions. Now, of course, we know that the whole country will not be part of the processions because there is a significant amount of the population that does not support Raisi. In fact, a large number of them despise Raisi. They have been on the wrong side of his highly conservative and controversial policies in the past. But what the state will be keen to show the world at this point, and their own people, is a president who is being mourned. We will see hundreds, thousands of people in the streets of these different cities showing their respects. And this is really the public message that Tehran is trying to give through its officials at this point as well, that at the same time as they are mourning these leaders who were killed in that helicopter crash, they have all been at pains to say that there will be no disruption when it comes to the running of the country. We have heard this from the top. We've heard this from the Supreme Leader. We've heard it from the acting president as well, saying that there will be no disruption. And just the very fact that within hours of the bodies being found at that helicopter crash site, there was already an acting president and an acting foreign minister put into place. So there really is this keen desire, it appears, in Tehran at this point to show stability within the country -- Max.",

Iran's current Supreme Leader is Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and this individual has been the Middle East's longest serving autocrat and he's an octogenarian.In fact, last month he turned 85 years old. It was long rumored and in fact assessed by lots of outside experts that President Raisi was pushed into the position of president in 2021 so that that could become a stepping stone for him to become supreme leader. But historically, the position of president is not at all a stepping stone into bigger or greater things. Many of Iran's presidents have been censored or moved into political obscurity. But I can tell you one thing right now, that if you did believe that Raisi was on the short list to become Iran's next supreme leader, that short list just got a lot shorter.",

A key defense witness managed to antagonize the judge. However, lawyers for Donald Trump also, or may also, have scored a major win by getting star witness Michael Cohen to admit to stealing tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization.CNN's Kara Scannell has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After four weeks of testimony, prosecutors rested their case in former President Donald Trump's criminal trial. Just after their star witness, Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen concluded more than 17 hours of dramatic testimony over four days. Trump's attorney Todd Blanche intensely attacked Cohen's credibility over multiple days, trying to paint him as a liar who's motivated by money. MICHAEL COHEN, TRUMP'S FORMER FIXER AND ATTORNEY: I just want to get through this so that I can start my own life again. SCANNELL (voice-over): Blanche got Cohen to admit that he stole from the Trump organization. Cohen confirmed he paid a tech company $20,000 instead of the $50,000 that was owed by Trump. But Cohen asked Trump to be repaid the full amount, which was doubled to cover taxes. Ultimately, Cohen admitted he kept around $60,000 for himself. Blanche asked: So you stole from the Trump organization? Yes, sir, Cohen replied. Cohen said he was angry about getting a low annual bonus. Earlier in the trial, Cohen told prosecutors he requested the full reimbursement because that's what was owed and I didn't feel Mr. Trump deserved the benefit of the difference. On Monday, Cohen admitted it was wrong to have taken the money. Cohen defended his character during testimony to Congress in 2019.",

DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is why I'm here, because we called in a legal expense payment to a lawyer. SCANNELL (voice-over): Cohen testified that despite the 11 checks referring to a retainer agreement, he said no agreement existed because there was no legal work that I was to be paid for.

COHEN - DAVIDSON RECORDING: And I can't even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, I hate the fact that we did it. And my comment to him was, but every person that you've spoken to told you it was the right move. SCANNELL (voice-over): After the prosecution rested, the defense started calling witnesses, including Robert Costello, who once served as a legal advisor to Cohen. Costello was visibly frustrated as the judge sustained several objections from the prosecution, audibly saying, geez, and rolling his eyes. Judge Merchan became so angry, he briefly cleared the courtroom and addressed Costello. Cara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: Costello may be back in the stand later today.
