Last night four bodies were pulled from a river in a town about 35 miles south of Tulsa. And this comes after four men, all close friends, went missing in that town Sunday evening after reportedly going for a bike ride. Police are not saying whether the bodies pulled from the river last night are these missing men. CNN's Camila Bernal joining me right now. Camila?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Fred. So we are waiting for the medical examiner's office to identify the bodies. This is the medical examiner's office in Tulsa. And we are told by authorities it that is a difficult process because these bodies were in the water for a long period of time.Now we know the autopsies began at around 8:30 in the morning, but it is unclear if they are going to get to all of these four bodies by end of day because of how difficult this process is going to be. Now, we do know that someone was near the river, saw something suspicious, and called police. When police officers went out there, they were able to find and recover these bodies. They're treating it as two different investigations. They say one is the investigation of the bodies that were recovered. And according to the police chief, he believes there is foul play involved in that case. The case of the missing men is also being handled separately, and it's unclear what happened here. But as mentioned, we know that there were four friends. They're all between the ages of 29 and 32. They were hanging out on Sunday night. And it's unclear what happened or where they went or what they did. But there is cellphone data, because at least two of them had their phones with them. And so police followed the cellphone data. It took them to two different junkyards. And when they searched those areas, they were not able to find either the men or the bodies. The river, though, is about five miles from the closest junkyard. And so this was not an area that police offices were planning on searching when it came to the case of these four missing men. Of course, whether it's one case or two cases, there are still so many questions as to what happened here. Where did these men go? What happened to them? Why were they in the river, if it is them? Was it one person, multiple people who were also involved in all of this? So many questions. But of course, the first one being, is this all connected? And we are waiting for police to connect the dots, Fred.",

She was even in Boston in 2013 running that marathon when the Boston Marathon bombing happened. She survived that and continued to run. She leaves behind now three small boys. We also have another victim. We've heard from her sister, Mary Marshal. We were told back in 2014 she graduated from culinary arts degree and she was one of a few students who was able to study abroad in a specialized program in France to really protect her craft. Her sister tells us that she was supposed to get married this coming week. And her sister is demanding action now from lawmakers because of all of the mass shootings we've had over and over and over again. As we turn now to talk about the suspect in this case, we know that the suspect is a minor who is yet to be charged. And I want you to hear a 911 call from someone who believes they saw the suspect on the day of the shooting. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what you have is polling showing that Brian Kemp, the incumbent governor, is doing very well in that race, that he has a much wider margin over his opponent Stacey Abrams than does Warnock or Walker who are essentially tied. And that means that there are Kemp/Warnock voters. There are people who are voting for the Republican for governor and the Democrat for Senator. And the question is the result in the Senate race really will come down to, how many voters are there like that? If in the end Herschel Walker manages to secure all of the Republicans and all the Republican-leaning independents, then it's done and he'll probably win simply by virtue of the fact that so many people are coming out to vote for Brian Kemp, which gives us a good sign where people are intending to cast their votes.",

This happens. Always in every election, the top of the ticket is the person that attracts the most attention. But that's, I think, what the Walker camp is concerned about.

This is a much tighter than expected race as she is competing against the Republican Christine Drazan, and then also Democrat turned independent Betsy Johnson. Democrats are concerned that Johnson might siphon off some votes from Kotek heading into those elections just three days away. This is a state that President Biden won by 16 points, and he is hoping that his presence will help energize and motivate voters, essentially with that October 18th registration deadline quickly approaching. Notably, while the president has been out west, he has skipped two states with hotly contested Senate races, that is in both Nevada and in Arizona. The White House has been very careful and aware of trying to not nationalize some of those races and the president's approval rating sits at around 44 percent, and some of his policies remain popular, but the president may not necessarily be popular with all voters.
