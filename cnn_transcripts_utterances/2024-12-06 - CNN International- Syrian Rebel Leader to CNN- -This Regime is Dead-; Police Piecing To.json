New clues emerge in the ongoing Manhattan manhunt after the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO in broad daylight. And anti-government protests in Georgia now adding into their second week as the government cracks down on -- the stock market here in New York set to open just about 30 minutes from now, indices edging up a bit there, slightly after some positive numbers from the November jobs report. We'll get into those just ahead. Clipping a close watch though, on rebel forces at this hour, who now have their sight set on Syria's third largest city, Homs appears to be the next target on the main road to Damascus in what has been a lightning-fast southbound offensive against the Syrian government. A U.K. based monitoring group says thousands of people are now fleeing that city. Nearly 300,000 Syrians have been displaced since the fighting resumed last week, and the U.N. says it believes that number could quickly grow to 1.5 million. This kind of upheaval, of course, is not new to the Syrian people. The country has been mired in civil war since the Arab spring of 2011 but the war had largely been dormant until recently. The militant leader behind this offensive has largely lived in the shadows. His group was formed out of an Al Qaeda affiliate in 2018, the U.S. put a ten million bounty on his head. But Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani agreed to speak with CNN's Jomana Karadsheh. And in this exclusive interview, he made it clear, the primary goal is to oust Bashar Al Assad from power. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This discipline allowed them, with God's guidance, to engage in a battle in an organized manner.

Now we're talking about a larger project. We're talking about building Syria. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is merely one detail of this dialog, and it may dissolve at any time. It's not an end in itself, but a means to perform a task confronting this regime. Once that task is complete, it will transition to a state of governance, institutions and so on.

I believe the reality speaks for itself. These classifications are primarily political and at the same time wrong. I define a terrorist as someone who intentionally kills civilians, harms innocents, or displaces people.

Now, what we're seeing now is that there are signs of unrest in Daraa Province, which is in the south, where we see that the rebels in that area seem to have taken over the Nasib crossing to Jordan border crossing to Jordan, where there's now a new group that's announced its existence, the southern operations room. And they say that their goal is to reach Damascus, keeping in mind, of course, it was in that southern province where the Syrian uprising began back in 2011. Now we're also hearing from what's known as the military operations command, which is the coalition of rebel groups that started in Idlib and is the one that has taken Aleppo Hama's 9 is now on the outskirts of Homs. They have called on the Syrian army to pull out of Homs, out of Damascus and out of Syria altogether, according to the spokesman for the group. Now we are seeing that the Syrian air force continues to launch air strikes on not only rebel positions, but civilian facilities as well, in those areas where the government has lost control. But in terms of actual fighting on the ground, they're pulling up relatively little resistance. And of course, yesterday, we heard the Russians via spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, saying, basically, we're going to be watching the situation in Syria to decide how we're going to assist Syria.

We don't know where this personis, but authorities seem to be trying to focus in on a backpack that was seen worn by the shooter at the time of the shooting, then seen when he -- when this suspect was seen on camera, fleeing the scene on a bike towards Central Park and the city. And then, in new video, leaving Central Park, the person that authorities believe is the gunman is seen without a backpack. And so, there were searches throughout the park trying to figure out where this bag is, but also what might have been inside of it. And then, of course, as you were just showing, we learned new information about the circumstances leading up to the shooting that as they understand the gunman arrived to the city days before the shooting, and then at the hostel where they believe the suspect was staying. They released this photo of who they are calling a person of interest, wanted for questioning, unmasked. Well, we understand from law enforcement source telling our John Miller, that the circumstances around this, based on law enforcement interviews, was that this person was checking in. As we understand, he used a fake New Jersey ID to check in, was talking with the clerk there, and in a bit of a flirty moment, sort of pulled down his mask probably saying, hey, like, this is what I actually look like. And this could end up being one of the most significant clues, if it ends up lining up to be the actual suspect that police are looking for here. And then when you sort of retrace what actually happened on, when the shooting actually happened, right after that, it was when authorities saw the gunman fleeing north towards Central Park. And video and new video that we had seen in recent hours, really at this point, once he gets into the park about 25 blocks north of that, he's seen exiting the park on the west side of the park, and again, without that backpack. And so, the question is, where did this person go from there? If law enforcement knows doesn't appear that it's public in any sort of way, but then also at the scene itself, a water bottle was left behind that contained a fingerprint, though law enforcement tells CNN that that fingerprint was smudged, which might make things a little bit less conclusive, but also that a water bottle was found as well. So those are the clues that law enforcement is sort of working with right now. They have put out pictures of a person of interest, hoping for public help. They have put out pictures of what the gunman was wearing, seen on camera at a coffee shop leading up to the shooting, hoping for the public's help.

The Democratic Party, for decades, has been seen as somebody that was connected to the working class. Somehow, some way, during the Trump campaign, the Republicans stole that from them. And what happens is that you know too much hypocrisy is going on to, you know, too much leaning towards the extreme left. America, as I think, is the case, where most of the world are predominantly centrist. Your centrist, your center-left or your center-right, which means that you might have your proclivities, you might have your tendencies, you might have your preferences. But ultimately, you want everybody to get along, and you want to be able to talk with one another, communicate with one another, conduct business with one another, engage in compromising, et cetera. And unfortunately, we didn't see that from the Democratic Party. They complained about it from the right. Then when they got hold of power, they lean to the extreme left, started engaging in a bunch of nonsense where you're operating on the fringes. The mega right did it extremely with the right. The left did it extremely with the left, and you forgot about the center. And what happened was, is that it wasn't real, just like in 2020, it wasn't a vote for Biden, it was a vote against Trump. In 2024, it wasn't a vote for Trump, it was a vote against vote culture. And that's what happened, and they got exposed for it, and now they've got to go back to the drawing board, because the Republicans have control of the White House, the House and the Senate and the Supreme Court. And as far as I'm concerned, with Musk and Ramaswamy in there. Wall Street as well. So, I'm looking at all of those different things, and I'm saying you really, really, really messed up if you're the Democratic Party, because you took for granted the voters who have supported you all of these years. You forgot about them, lean into the extreme left, and you got your come up and you got what you deserve.",

They were in field goal range on fourth, and one could have just kicked the field goal and would have given the Packers a minute left to try to go win the game. Dan Campbell said, no, we're taking care of this ourselves. They, of course, get the first down. So, he's a hero right now, and I guess the players, they love his confidence in them right to get the first down. But you know, could have been a lot of second guessing today if they didn't.
