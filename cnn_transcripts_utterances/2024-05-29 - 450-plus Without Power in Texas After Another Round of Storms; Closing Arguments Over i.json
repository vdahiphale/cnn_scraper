That's what we were talking about with Robert De Niro and Officers Fanone and Dunn, who defended our democracy at the Capitol on January 6th.So we're of course going to take advantage of the media circus there. We're going to use every tool at our disposal to communicate directly with the voters and breakthrough this fragmented media environment and make sure that people understand the stakes.

I am outside the Manhattan criminal court. This is CNN's special live coverage of the case against Donald Trump. And today is the day the jury gets the case. In the next few hours, they will begin deliberating the 34 counts. Donald Trump is charged with falsifying documents to cover up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, all to influence the 2016 election. The prosecution calls this an election fraud case. The closing arguments are done. The lawyers are done. They have spoken before the jury for the very last time. Today, it is the judge and the judge alone who will address them before they go behind closed doors to determine the fate of the former president. And by the end of today, Donald Trump could be the first former president convicted of a felony or, likewise, the first former president acquitted of criminal charges. Either way, what were about to see here is simply unprecedented. With me this morning, CNN's Brynn Gingras who has been covering the trial all 44 days since it began back on April 15. What will we see today?",

Now, remember, this is the roadmap that the judge is giving these jurors to interpret the law and apply it to all this evidence that they have heard over these last several weeks. And they were debated last week by the -- by the both sides, right? They had markers, yellow and, I forgot the other color. But they were basically wiping out what they wanted in those jury instructions and what they didn't. Nobody has seen these your instructions. Nobody has heard them. This is going to be the first time that we actually hear the judge talk about them when he gives them to those jurors. And then we are going to have the deliberations. This is the big moment when those 12 jurors go behind closed doors and deliberate the fate of the former president. During that time, Trump and his defense team, they have to stay inside the courthouse. There will be other press up there waiting to see if there are any notes, and then of course waiting for the verdict. If there are notes, they are not allowed to come during the lunch hour. That is the latest guidance that we are getting. So that's about an hour break during the day that they're going to ask any questions about anything with this case. But they have a lot of evidence to file through. They have recordings, they have text messages, they have documents, they have the testimony. So there's a lot that's going to happen within today, possibly into tomorrow.",

So the financial records crime is fairly simple, falsification of financial records. But then of course we have this enhancement where if in the course of that you were concealing or committing a second crime, it becomes a felony. So how is the judge going to describe that?And then how is he going to describe the third piece, which is what crime was it that was being concealed are committed? Because that's where we get into the federal election law, for example. So that's the main thing I'm focusing on. We don't know what that's going to look like and it's kind of confusing.

Ultimately, there's a verdict form that says guilty or not guilty, but it's going to go into a little bit more detail because it's going to have to ask them whether they find that the business records were falsified. And then again, whether they find this enhancement, there was another crime that was being concealed or committed there. And so they have to think about it in that way. And if they don't understand what crime is being discussed, then they're not going to be able to deliberate properly and they'll have appeal problems.So it's really, really important, and it's interesting that at this point we don't know but what it will be, but I guess we'll find out in the next hour.",

And the key is, do they -- will they be able to really understand the instructions. What we typically do is we will talk about specific instructions that and we'll explain what the instructions mean in lay terms, because often they're written more in the legalese. So often jurors are talking amongst themselves of what does this actually mean? So their job is to take those instructions and tie them into the evidence itself and figure out if the burden has been match. So it's a big task, and I think they're ready for it.",

We also extended voting hours by two hours, so instead of the polls closing at seven, they close at 9:00 PM. So hopefully that helped.
