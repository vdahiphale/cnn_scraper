We see that women come out and vote in numbers that outnumber any other - you know, outnumber men significantly. We see that women overwhelmingly prefer democratic candidates. We now have a women on the ticket. But it's also true that white women, who make up the largest demographic voting bloc in the United States, typically trend towards Republicans. Part of what we're seeing though is we've never seen an election on the other side of Roe v. Wade being overturned. And we've seen for several - since at least 2022 now that white women in particular have responded in very specific ways to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the Dobbs decision. That may be coming into play. But to the other panelist's points, this is a snapshot poll. So, it is quite literally a snapshot of a small microcosm of the voters (ph).

And the messaging that we're hearing from Donald Trump, laying the groundwork to stir fears and stoke fears of voter fraud even before votes are being counted, what kind of impact do you think that kind of messaging is having in your state? GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): Well, it is concerning that Donald Trump lies so easily. That should be concerning for a presidential candidate. That should be disqualifying for someone to ever become president. Voting is the bedrock of our democracy. It's what's made the United States the greatest country in the history of planet earth. And to have a presidential candidate that is willing to attack our system, that's willing to do anything to win, to put himself above the country and democracy, that ought to be enough for all of us to see. Now, for the sake of the United States, for the sake of our future elections, we've got to defeat Donald Trump this last time. We've got to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and then move past this division, this misinformation and disinformation, and move to that better place where we remember we are Americans first and everything else second, third, or fourth.",

And the parable of the good Samaritan says everyone is my neighbor. And that can be found in all major religions. I want a presidential candidate that will live that out. And here we've got Donald Trump encouraging one neighbor to hate another neighbor, calling half of America the enemy from within. And then you've got Kamala Harris, who is out there with a message that even if you don't vote for her, you will have a seat at the table and she will govern for you. Now, part of what you see in Kentucky and so many other states is the fact that all the attention now goes to the swing states. And so we haven't had investment or visits from candidates. Not just in this election, but in a lot of elections. And I understand that the vice president and Tim Walz need to be out there doing what they need to do to - to win. And - and - and you see it on the other side as well. But I hope as we move into the future, that we can have more battleground states, or ultimately find a way to where pushing out the vote in every state matters. The candidates need to come to every part of the country, that they hear all of our concerns. I think that's how we get to a place of - of common ground and hopefully 0 approaches to it.",

If Donald Trump won the popular vote but not the Electoral College, Mitch McConnell would be out the next day calling for a change and - and a reform. For me, I'm not coming at it from - from a point of ideology, I just want us all to count. You know, I want to see presidential candidates in Kentucky. I want them to hear about our specific issues. I think there are states in the west with water issues, for instance, that - that could feel the - the - the same way. So, my hope, regardless of how we get there, is in the future we don't have presidential elections decided in seven states. And I think when that happens, again, we can - we can come together, find more common ground and use common sense approaches. But with that said, I believe Kamala Harris is the candidate for common ground. She's talking about it right now. She's pledging to find it.
