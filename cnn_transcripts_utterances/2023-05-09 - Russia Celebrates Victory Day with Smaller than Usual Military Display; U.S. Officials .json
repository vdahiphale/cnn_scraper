But this year there was only one tank, and it was from World War II, and there were no flyovers of fighter jets, bombers, or any other aircraft. In his speech, Putin accused the west of unleashing war against the Russian motherland. Security was tight. The military parade comes just days after a mysterious drone attack on the Kremlin. Hours before Putin's speech, Russia launched cruise missiles at Ukraine's capital of Kyiv.So let's bring in CNN's senior international correspondent Matthew Chance to start us out. As someone who has covered all things Putin and Moscow so closely, what was your take?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think you're right, Poppy, definitely much smaller than we have seen in years past. There were, I think, 8,000 troops this year, there were 12,000 last year, for instance. There was no military flyover. Usually that's a spectacular highlight of this kind of annual Victory Day parade. There was an intercontinental ballistic missile as the centerpiece of the parade. That's certainly true. Russia underlining that it is still very much a nuclear power as it does every year by sort of parading these highly destructive weapons through over the cobbles of Red Square.As you mentioned, there was just one tank, and that was a T-34 which is a tank from the 1940s that fought in the Second World War. So none of the most sophisticated weaponry that Russia is meant to have. There is a couple reasons for that. First of all, very real security concerns. This parade taking place just days after the Kremlin -- and this is the in the shadow of the Kremlin, remember, the Kremlin says drones attacked the domes of the center of the Kremlin in what they say was a Ukrainian assassination attempt on President Putin. Of course, the Ukrainians have denied that. There's also been an upsurge in attacks around the country on various Russian installations. And in some places, in some Russian cities these Victory Day parades have been canceled all together. The one in Moscow went ahead, a few other ones went ahead as well. But in some places close to the Ukrainian border they did not go ahead at all because of security concerns. The other issue it raises, the smaller nature of this parade, does Russia have the weapons? Does it have the tanks to put on display given that it is, it's military is very closely engaged in Ukraine now and preparing for a big Ukrainian counteroffensive.",

And one thing was we put law enforcement in all of our public schools.I have a bill right now that I would hope everybody, Republicans, Democrats would support nationally, and it's called the school Guardian Act. It would basically say, we're going to put a trained law enforcement officer in every school, public and private in the country. We have the funding at the federal level. We don't need the 87,000 IRS agents. I think every mom and dad would say, I'd rather have a law enforcement officer to be turned in to my school rather than another IRS agent.
