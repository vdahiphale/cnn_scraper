Israel can't accept a ceasefire. Ceasefire means Hamas wins. Ceasefire would be like, after Pearl Harbor, America saying, \"OK, we're going to have a ceasefire because the Japanese have a lot of prisoners,\" or after 9/11, and on 12th of September saying, \"We're going to have a ceasefire. We're going to somehow negotiate.\" It's impossible. A, with a ceasefire, if Hamas wins? That means Hamas gets away with murdering, butchering 1,400 of our citizens. Security is not returned to this country. We have next to no deterrence power. We have a very, very tough neighborhood. Who's going to be afraid of us?",

That's a bowling alley. Those are the first two locations that authorities have been investigating shootings at. And we just learned, from the Sun Journal newspaper, in Maine, that a third location that Walmart distribution center may also be the site of another shooting. You see there the suspect, who is still at large. The Sheriff's department, Androscoggin County Sheriff's Department is calling on people to -- and the State Police, are calling on people, to shelter-in-place, both in Lewiston and in the nearby town of Auburn. That's a town about two miles away. You can see that, the stretch of area, there in Maine. These are relatively small towns. But there's still a lot more information we need to gather, on this unfolding situation. What we do know though, is that authorities, in Maine, are investigating at least two, possibly three, different locations, for shooting events. And they're looking for this man, as you can see there, holding a long gun, looks like a powerful weapon. Multiple people down. We don't yet know an exact number. But of course, Kaitlan, we do know that gun violence is a common problem, in America.

The other is a Bar &amp; Grille. And then, the third, a Walmart distribution center. They are not -- they're not right around the corner from each other. They appear to be near each other.

And that is why authorities, both Androscoggin County Sheriff's Office, and Maine State Police, telling residents in these two towns, Lewiston and Auburn, to shelter-in-place. We also heard that the schools are on lockdown. We understand there are events happening, at area schools, tonight, as well. And we know that the Governor of Maine, Janet Mills, has put out a statement, saying that she's monitoring this situation. So, still unfolding.

Obviously, we're learning more details. But they do say that they're coordinating, with other hospitals, in the area, to take in patients. It seems to suggest that there would be a large number of people that they're taking in.

They froze it, to the best image they could get, of the individual's face, looking over the gun. They put it out to us and other media immediately.This is something that agencies have struggled with. But going to the crowdsource, which is everybody watching, who may have seen this individual, today, may spot him, tonight, on the road, or at a gas station, or on the street, or may know him, may know him personally, or from social media? That is the crowdsourcing that they are doing, to try and get the public, to contact them, either directly or over social media, to say, \"This is who this individual is.\" Because that would allow them A, to go look for him, where they think he might be. B, alert people that who he is, and C, trace him to a vehicle, which if he's acting alone, he had to travel by car, between these three locations, to make up the time, between the incidents, if he's acting with someone else, that car could be highly relevant. So, this is a very dynamic incident. As far as the injuries, that Medical Center, of course, is not built for that number of casualties, to come in, in a trauma situation. They've been landing helicopters, at various locations, from the scene, medevac helicopters, and taking after triaging victims, taking them to medical centers, that are further out. So, they're really using the maximum of the medical resources, available, in the State of Maine, and New England, by adding in the medevac factor.

And so, when the first 9-1-1 call comes in, it may take a small department, the amount of time, to actually get there. And so, I think that's why we see these at least two confirmed locations.People wondering, \"Well, why weren't officers able to stop this person?\" Sometimes, that takes time. There's this mantra in law enforcement that action beats reaction. The suspect makes the first move, and then Police are playing catch-up, trying to locate this person. As you look at the distance, between those two confirmed locations that we know, it's about a little over four miles. And so, that was a distance that this person had to travel. We see that photo, obviously, that they're pushing out there, to the public. If they -- two things. If there's someone who knows, who this individual is, they certainly want to hear from you. But also, to members of the public, if you see this person, someone matching this description, they want you to pick up the phone immediately and call 9-1-1. I want to focus on, as we zoom in on that photo, this weaponry that we're seeing. In so many of these mass shooting incidents, we see the same kind of high-powered assault style rifle that's used. And particularly, as you look at the number of victims, that we've been reporting, much of this comes down to what is near the front, of that weapon. That's the magazine that contains the ammunition that goes in to that high-powered assault-style rifle. If it's a large capacity magazine, we're talking about upwards of 30 rounds. There are additional magazines that you can buy aftermarket that have much more firepower than that. The reason why that's important is because a suspect, with that type of weaponry, can fire multiple rounds, in a short amount of time. They also don't have to reload as much as someone who might have a pistol. And so, this is, again, very morbid to talk about. But you look at the victims here, the numbers that we're seeing. A lot of that comes down to how much firepower someone can expend, in a short amount of time, and then flee to the second location. Now, one thing that we do know is that everyone, who was at the scene, of both of those two confirmed incidents are now potential witnesses. Obviously, we know that the medical center, as you were reporting, Kaitlan, has issued this mass casualty notice. They're taking in victims. They're coordinating with other hospitals, in the area. But individuals, who were there, at these scenes, who are not injured, are key witnesses, for Police. They want to know, what did they see? Did anyone recognize this individual? After these incidents, and sadly, this has become rote by now with mass shooting after mass shooting, in the United States?",

This obviously, the evening time, you have a bar, you have a bowling alley, both places, where you would have a large population potentially.And so, again, if the motivation is just to cause indiscriminate large mass of -- loss of life, that's where you would want to go. And so, Police obviously sending out this shelter-in-place, to other locations, to lock those places down, so this individual doesn't come in. And they certainly want people off the streets, as they go grid -- in this gridded search, to try to find this person, Kaitlan.",

It appears that he's looking over the top of it. But that tells you someone, who had a type of weapon system there that had these additional accoutrements, that essentially improve the accuracy, of that shot, which is obviously very troubling, in the hands of someone, who is trying to kill people. One other aspect of that firearm? That obviously you have this manhunt that's underway. But the firearm itself is a key piece of intelligence here, because every shot that's fired, you have the bullet that comes out the front end, of that rifle. But the shell casing that's left behind gets ejected out of the weapon. The reason why that is so important is because we know agencies, for example, like the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, they have a Special Intelligence Center that looks at those shell casings. Every firing pen that hits shell casing, it's like a fingerprint. They're unique. And so, they can run this through their database, of known identifiers, to try to figure out if they can identify, where this weapon came from, who was the owner of this weapon. And so, that is certainly something that would be happening, behind-the-scenes. And we've seen that in many cases actually prove to be a key piece of intelligence, for authorities, in trying to identify the shooter. I would say also, we're showing the image, right now. Obviously, we're often very hesitant, to give publicity, to a mass shooter. This is the incident, where Police want us to do exactly what we're doing, and get that image out there. And we've seen that beneficial at times. I could tell you, I was in Highland Park, just about two years ago, near Chicago, where there was this parade mass shooting.",

They got the image of the vehicle. And a concerned citizen, who saw that on the media, saw this suspect, called Police. And they -- I was actually there, when the arrest went down. The SWAT team descended on that person, they were able to take him into custody. And so, if you're wondering why we're showing this image, it's not just to show someone, who's there, holding a weapon. This is the image that Police want people, in that area, and indeed around the country, who may know this individual.

It became a symbol. And a lot of people decided to buy it, for home protection, buy it, for hunting, buy it, for target practice. But it's not built for that. It's built for maximum lethality. As Josh Campbell pointed out a few minutes ago, you've got that tactical sling that he has, which you can see coming down, from the bottom of the gun. He's got his scope on top. He's got his 30-round magazines, where you can fire numerous rounds, before changing magazines. It is a weapon of war. And it has become all too common, in these incidents.",

We've seen these incidents get resolved, in a number of different ways. Sometimes, the shooter ends up taking their own life. Sometimes, they engage with law enforcement, and there's a shootout. And sometimes, they surrender. Of course, we just don't know exactly how this is going to come to resolution, right now.

We've seen that, sadly, in so many instances, innocent people, who are now victimized and traumatized. But the first thing that authorities want to ascertain is, is this friend, or is this foe? And so, they have to methodically go through this area, and try to determine, if the person is still there. And if the -- if these people there are not injured, they're now witnesses. Authorities are going to want to ask them, \"What did you see? What did you hear? Did you recognize this individual? Where did this person go? What was the last known location? To what direction did he flee?\" All of that critical information that then gets broadcast out, to other officers, as they try to hone in, on where this person is. There, a new image that was just released. We're now getting a profile image of this person. No new information there, from a weaponry standpoint, other than the fact that authorities want the public, to have various different angles, of this person. If you see someone that you know, has this type of clothing, that resembles this person, with those characteristics, that looks, you know, someone down the -- you know, someone who parts the hair on the right, that has all these characteristics. Anyone watching who might say, \"You know what? I know who this person is,\" authorities want you to call them, right now. Because again, they're trying to backtrack here, to try to figure out, who this individual was. And then, at each individual scene, the two confirmed scenes that we know, as the manhunt happens, there's also a robust Police effort, at each of those scenes. I've been part of these, in law enforcement, after these shooting incidents, where you're literally going door to door. At this hour, very difficult, because of the cover of darkness. If it's a business? Then they might not be open. But if it's a residence, A, you're trying to make sure that there's not a threat in those areas if the person has segregated (ph) him, in an area, around that building. But you're also wanting to pull a CCTV footage, any security footage, any Ring doorbell camera footage. And these, what they call, Intel teams, will gather all that information, to try to find, \"Here's where we saw that person go. Here was a particular vehicle that was in both locations,\" better still, if we're able to get a shot of a license plate, on a vehicle that was in both locations. All that is very time- and resource-intensive work. But it's happening behind-the-scenes. And that's why, again, John was mentioning, just a flooding of law enforcement, going into this area, it's not as simple as just, patrolling the streets, and looking for this person.
