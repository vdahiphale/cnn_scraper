Brynn, this year, there's a special focus on survivors who are still suffering from illnesses associated with 9/11, illnesses that in many cases have cost lives. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. People are continuing to lose loved ones from this tragedy. If you think about it, Brianna, 22 years ago it happened. And this ceremony here just wrapped up. The reading of more than 2,000, almost nearly 3,000 people who were killed here on 9/11, the names were read. And a special focus was on children, incorporating children into the reading of those names. As organizers tell me, this was important because they wanted to signify that children, the next generation, they need to know what happened, and continue talking about the stories of those lives lost as we move forward. I want to watch a moment of that during the ceremony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She is a survivor. She was raped in 1998 and has since begun an advocacy group to help other victims. \"USA Today\" says that Tracy reported the call to the university's Title IX office. And she told the newspaper, quote, \"The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me. It's hard for me to even wrap my mind around it. It's like he sought me out just to betray me.\" CNN has not independently verified the details of the \"USA Today\" report. Tucker, in his fourth year at Michigan State's head coach and is among the highest paid coaches in college football. He told Title IX investigators, quote, \"Ms. Tracy's distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me.\" He went on, \"I'm not proud of my judgment and I'm having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into the situation. But I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.\" Michigan State's interim president says an investigative report was submitted in July. And the full hearing will take place early October. Secondary coach, Harlon Barnett, will take Tucker's place on an interim basis. CNN has reached out to Tracy and her attorney. We did that on Sunday, but we've not yet heard back.
