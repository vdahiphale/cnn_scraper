I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to our top story this hour, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz making a major play for for Georgia. The Democratic ticket just picked off a bus tour of the critically important state specifically focusing on rural voters. For more on that, I want to bring in our Priscilla Alvarez, who is in Savannah, Georgia. So, Priscilla, Harris and Walz just wrapped up their first stop on this campaign bus tour.",

But all that practice makes for beautiful music. And that is a metaphor. That is symbolic for everything that you all do in your lives, which is you're going to show what a winning team looks like.

But what's actually significant about this trip is exactly where they're visiting. They are in South Georgia, a region that typically leans Republican. But Democrats see an opportunity here. They're trying to use a playbook from Senator Warnock in December of 2022 during his runoff where he peeled off voters from Republicans.And the person at the center of that strategy is also now at the center of the Harris campaign strategy, Quentin Fulks, the deputy campaign manager telling me that he sees the same opportunity here, essentially trying to close margins with Republicans in South Georgia, and the bottom line here being lose by less. Win big in Metro Atlanta and, again, peel off those voters. With that, he thinks there's a pathway to victory in this critical battleground state that President Biden one by less than 12,000 votes back in 2020. Now, of course, strategists are also pointing to the Tim Walz factor. He has roots in rural America. He is a football coach and he has a military background. All of that put together could certainly help in resonating with voters in that part of the state. And with all of this, the swing coincides ads, the Harris campaign flooding the airwaves here in the Savannah area. Media market putting in $1.7 million just in the last three weeks alone, more expected on that hitting on the economy and also trying to draw a stark contrast with former President Donald Trump and his -- or the blueprint Project 2025, they're trying to tie to him. But at the end of the day here, Alex, it is certainly the where here that matters, that south part of Georgia that the Harris campaign is trying to hit, they're being aggressive, hoping that they can pull off what Democrats did in 2022 by closing those margins with Republicans.",

Democrats, of course, won Georgia in 2020. Biden took the state. Democratic senators were elected in 2022. [18:05:00] But we have a recent poll of the key Sun Belt states. And in Georgia, Trump was leading Harris by seven points. That is the largest margin among these four battleground states. And, really, it's the only one outside of the margin of error.

I think she's probably behind in Georgia, but more in the area of a couple of points, and it's within reach, and it's within reach for a few reasons. One is, you know, there was a lot of energy on the ticket in 2020 with Raphael Warnock on the ticket that energized African-American voters in a state where there's a significant African-American population. She has the ability to do the same. Biden wasn't getting the benefit of that in this election against Trump. There are also -- there's a significant Hispanic and Asian population that's growing that is, you know, not talked about much, but is a factor here.And, you know, I do think that she's got Donald Trump on the other side, who has split his time between running against Kamala Harris in the last few weeks and running against the most popular governor in the state, Governor Kemp. So, there are a lot of reasons to think that she can make this a competitive race and she's smart to try and open up some other avenues to that 270 electoral votes, and Georgia should be on the list.",

But I think if I were a campaign strategist for either, I would just consider it to be tied. And you're right, if she takes it away or keeps it, I guess, in this case, it would be very difficult for Trump. Because I assume what's happening in Georgia could also be happening in North Carolina. So, it's that Sun Belt avenue that we had previously thought was closed off to Biden, and I think it was, that now the Democrats are trying to reopen.So, yes, look I think this map has gotten back to where we thought it was going to be. There's a couple of Sun Belt states, and then there's the northern blue wall. And for both campaigns, you know, they're not all must-wins but some of them are. For Harris, taking this one away is huge. And on the other side of it, for Trump, taking Pennsylvania away would be huge. And so you're going to see them both playing on each other's side of the field and see if they can steal a few electoral votes.",

If you go back to 2018, Stacey Abrams was the first Democratic candidate that went to every single county in the state of Georgia to begin to engage with folks.And when we talk about rural voters, we often think immediately white rural voters. Well, Georgia is somewhat different. Rural voters that are black, that are Latino, that are Asian. And so I think going into these rural communities, shrinking the gap of how many votes that Donald Trump could get is really smart. And it's a tactic that each year has proven to be more effective. I also think going to a high school was brilliant. Those kids are going to go home and talk about what today was like to their parents. So, then when the parents turn on a television screen, maybe they can't build a large rally, maybe they could build a rally in that area, but go into a contained environment where you can speak to the future, some of them may be able to vote this election, but they definitely can go talk to their parents about the experience, about the interaction they had with both of those candidates. And then just to Axe's point, when we talk about the coalition, getting those rural voters to be a part of that demographic is exactly what we did in 2020. The Asian population in Georgia really showed up in ways that were determinative in the state of Georgia. And if we can do that again, we can tap into that 175 percent increase of young black women who have just registered to vote across the country and really run up our numbers in Atlanta. This state is in play like it might have even been in a better way than it was in 2020. And we know what happened there. Joe Biden won that.",

And if you look at where we were two months ago, you know, Trump versus Biden, these were states that were likely falling off the board, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada. You know, still Trump largely has a lead in private polling I've seen in most of these states, including Georgia, including North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona.And so, you know, I'd expect that. So, as long as he can continue to do what he's doing in these states, you know, fortunately, he's made amends with Brian Kemp at this point, he's talking to Governor Kemp's team actually today, his turnout operation is truly being put in play to support Donald Trump and the rest of the Republican ticket. It's not just some talking point. And so as long as that's there and Donald Trump focuses on some of the key issues to kind of, you know, improve his margins in Metro Atlanta, Buckhead, a lot of those areas outside of there, there's a lot of places in North Carolina and Arizona that are very similar. These are largely, you know, higher income, higher educated communities. You know, he's got to talk about keeping communities safe. He's got to talk about funding the police. He's got to talk about inflation. He does that. He's going to be just fine in all four of those states.",

The question is, what will Trump do? And, you know, he keeps getting into his own way going to Georgia and attacking Governor Kemp, a few weeks ago was one of them. Frankly the flap at Arlington is another. Georgia is a state with a lot of veterans, which is one of the reasons why, you know, Walz is along with her.

I also think continuing to do a round robin on all these swing states, not taking one vote for granted, going to going into areas that, you know, maybe normally Democrats don't go, like in Southern Georgia, so I think full court press all the way, and then also deploying their surrogates.

And if you break down the rifle, fold the stock, put it in the backpack, it fits in there. So, basically, he was just a guy walking around with a backpack.So, what we learned today was also about the explosives found in the car. These were remote-controlled devices and we had reported that before, but we learned that his online research into explosives went back to 2019, which gives us a new window into how long he's been thinking about doing something. And, Alex, since they said they have an idea about his mindset, but not his motive for the Trump shooting, it appears he may have been thinking about attacking something long before he decided what, or who, or even why.",

But we're also seeing airstrikes that have resulted in several deaths already.This is, of course, not happening in a vacuum. We've seen since October 7th, the Israeli military has been carrying out in your daily raids their airstrikes, which were once rare in the West Bank have now become commonplace. But this appears to be larger scale than what we've typically seen in the West Bank. And we've also seen Israeli troops apparently surrounding and blocking several hospitals. According to the Palestinian officials. But the Israeli military says they're doing that to prevent Palestinian militants from going into those hospitals and using them.
