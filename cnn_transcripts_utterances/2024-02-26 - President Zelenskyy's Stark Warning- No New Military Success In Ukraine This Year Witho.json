I'm Kaitlan Collins, coming to you live, from London, tonight, after an extraordinary 48-hour journey, in and out of Ukraine, for a one-on-one interview, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.On the second anniversary of Putin's invasion, of his country, it was a conversation that frankly surprised me several times, including Zelenskyy's candor, about the fight over U.S. aid. It's a situation that is so dire. As Zelenskyy told me, Ukraine will make no new gains, on the battlefield, this year, unless they have U.S. help. He also warned that millions of people could die. It loomed almost over every conversation that was had with Ukrainians, on the ground, this question of whether or not American support is going to be part of their future. Tomorrow could be a moment of truth there, because in Washington, President Biden is set to meet with the leaders of the House and the Senate. Really, inside that room, when they talk about aid to Ukraine, which we are told will be part of that conversation, it's going to be four against one, inside the Oval Office. Because President Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Mitch McConnell, all on the same page, when it comes to aid in Ukraine, versus Mike Johnson, who has continued to hold the line against providing more aid, following in the lead of former President Donald Trump. President Zelenskyy, in our one-on-one sit down had a lot to say, about Speaker Johnson, the former President, and also the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. But we begin with how that stalemate, in Washington, is being felt in the frontlines, half a world away. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So, what it shows is, Vladimir Putin has no appreciation for his -- the lives of the humans, in his country. And he will keep throwing meat at this -- at this meat grinder, until he wins. And listening to people, particularly in my part -- in the Republican Party saying that our strategy is failing? I heard that today. I'm sitting here, like, wait, what? There have been minimal territorial gains, 300,000 -- approaching 400,000 dead Russian soldiers, most of which -- most of their tanks and armored vehicles are gone, a significant amount of their air force. They cannot operate anymore in the Black Sea, which was once unthinkable, and basically have not been able to have air superiority over Ukraine. To sit here, and say our strategy is failing?

GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Well, absolutely. Leadership at that level is a very grinding experience. I think it's particularly so, in the case of Ukraine, and particularly at this juncture. They still are very determined. I was at the Munich Security Conference. And we heard from him. I talked to his National Security Adviser, a number of other individuals that were there. The determination is still absolutely clear. But as I'm sure you felt, in Kyiv, very different from last year. There's a weariness that has set in. And there's also a degree of worry. So, on top of all the other challenges that leaders had, I never had to question whether or not the Pentagon was going to come through, for me. In this case, his biggest worry is, in fact, whether the U.S. is going to provide the additional resources that have been approved, by the Senate, but are hung up in the House. And that is a very, very big factor. I just had an essay, in foreignpolicy.com that talked about the future of the war in Ukraine. And it was titled \"It Depends,\" because it does depend. It depends, first and foremost, on continued U.S. support. Noting that, as you know, Europe has actually come through. So, Munich was very different. Normally, it's a situation, where the U.S. is trying to say, hey, Europeans, you got to get your act together. This year, it's the Europeans saying we just passed 50 billion at the EU level. Every country is doing an individual agreement with Ukraine. And what are you up to? When are you going to come through for Ukraine, noting that this is in our national security interest.

These are not strategically important gains. But they are on the -- they have the initiative. They're the ones pressing the fight. And the concern, of course, for the Ukrainians is that they're having to ration essentially artillery ammunition. They're worried about running out of the all-important air and ballistic missile defense interceptors. Kyiv is a city that has a normal feel to it, despite the air raid sirens going off every night. And most people now don't even go to the air raid shelters, because they have confidence in this. Imagine if all of a sudden they start to run out of the interceptors and systems that we have provided for air and ballistic missile defense. So again, there's a lot to be concerned about here.

Donald Trump got to make a lot of rants about, and this was a political witch-hunt. Don Jr. basically put on a timeshare presentation about how great all the properties were. And he let -- even though a lot of that was irrelevant, he let that in so that they couldn't have an argument on appeal that they were stymied in what they wanted to say. Similarly, he wrote a really detailed opinion, with detailed fact-finding, credibility findings. And that's the kind of thing that appellate courts don't really overturn on appeal.
