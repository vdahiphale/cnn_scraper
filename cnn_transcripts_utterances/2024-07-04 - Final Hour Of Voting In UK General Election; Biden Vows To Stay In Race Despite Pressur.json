The European market though, finished broadlyhigher in a week marked by not one, but two elections, perhaps in both France and the UK, some election a relief to come. Those are the markets and these are the main events: Just one hour to go before the polls close in the UK. US President Biden tells Democratic governors he needs more sleep and will stop scheduling events after 8:00 PM. Argentina set for a Copa America quarterfinal. Now it's unclear yet whether Lionel Messi will be fit enough to play. Live from New York, it is Thursday, July Fourth. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening, in one hour's time, polls closed in the UK General Election. The exit polls will be released shortly after and that will give us a snapshot of what to expect nationally. Now the actual vote count gets underway overnight. Earlier today, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife voted in his Yorkshire constituency that's in the north of England. Labour leader Keir Starmer and his wife cast their ballots in London. Richard Quest joins me now from London. Richard, we have a UK election on the US Independence Day. I think that's unprecedented. But you'll correct me if it is not, and of course always have a concern in Britain, the weather, did it cooperate? RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\":\tWell, to use that -- well, first of all, it is unprecedented and eyebrows were raised. I'll caveat whatever I'm going to say next the reporting restrictions, at least for another hour, I mean, I'm very limited in what I can tell you. So I shall use the time honored phrase, voting has been described as brisk ahead of the election. We have seen dogs, horses, cats, even a snake I believe at one polling booth, and the weather has cooperated. It has been a spectacularly lovely day throughout for voting. Now, where are we going to go -- there you are, you all see, voting is brisk. Brisk right the way through. In one hour's time, in fact, by now we will have the exit poll, which will tell us exactly how the tens of millions of people in the UK and this is where you're going to see it all in our election. It is quiet at the moment, but do not be fooled. In the next hour, Isa Soares will join me. We will have Anna Stewart, who will be at the wall and this wall will fill in as the constituencies are reported, and this other wall will absolutely give you -- this gives you the global picture in a sense of where we are, the seats that have been won and the seats that have been lost throughout the course of the night. Paula, the night will be long, I promise you that. We will expect, I would say the first results about an hour-and-a-half after 10 o'clock and then, it is Helter Skelter right the way through tonight, until maybe, I don't know, until maybe four or five in the morning.",

Now moving on to politics here: President Biden apparently told Democratic governors that he needs more sleep and needs to work less at night. We're told he made those comments while trying to reassure them about his struggling campaign. The White House now says Biden went to see a doctor after last week's debate just to check on his cold. Now, earlier this week, we were told Biden's last medical exam took place in February. The president is facing growing questions about his age and health. In a radio interview this morning, Biden said he'll keep moving forward. Priscilla Alvarez has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, a White House on cleanup duty, as President Joe Biden struggles to convince Democrats that he's staying in the race. REP. JARED HUFFMAN (D-CA): We've got to be honest about that. So we need a reset. We need a course correction. We've got to acknowledge that this was not just one bad night. ALVAREZ (voice over): Biden even telling Democratic governors gathered at the White House Wednesday, his plan is to stop scheduling events after 8:00 PM, so he can get more sleep. That comment according to sources, leaving some governors privately frustrated despite public support. GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD): The president is our nominee. The president is our party leader, and the president has told us, I mean, he was very clear back there that he is in this to win this. ALVAREZ (voice over): The White House's evolving reasons for Biden's bad debate is also raising eyebrows. Officials now contradicting the White House press secretary saying Biden was seen by his doctor days after the debate. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He did not get checked out by the doctor. It's a cold, guys. It's a cold and I know that it affects everybody differently. We've all had colds, and so, though he was not checked by the doctor. ALVAREZ (voice over): A White House official tells CNN, Biden had a \"brief check, not a physical\" after the debate. In private, Biden has acknowledged that the next few days are critical, packed with a high profile interview and two stops in battleground states, now, appealing directly to Black voters in a pair of new interviews.",

So today, we will see him of course for the July 4th celebrations over the course of the afternoon and evening before he jets off to battleground Wisconsin tomorrow, that primetime interview to follow and then to a trip to Pennsylvania. Now, over the course of all of this, the vice president has stayed close to him, as she has shown support for him and vice versa. Sources tell me that the mandate in her camp has been to stay the course, to dispel any type of replacement theories and to make it clear that it is the Biden-Harris ticket. And so they are still trying to project confidence even as they field multiple questions from even their closest allies about what it's like -- what it's going to look like moving forward and what it all means for the trajectory of the race.",

      "sentences": "Yes, first of all, the Trump comments remind me of \"Game of Thrones,\" chaos is a ladder, and in thiscase, it certainly is. It certainly is for -- it certainly is for him. Look, I mean, those comments are indicative of the problem Democrats face given the determination, at least at this point of Biden and his team to go forward. The debate mattered so much because he fell into really the most difficult trap in politics here, or probably in any democracy, which is to confirm a preexisting concern of the voters. You know, it wasn't like the first time voters were concerned about Joe Biden's age was at the debate. This is something that has been brewing for many months, the White House has been kind of pooh-poohing the findings in polls, but after those 90 minutes, he really underscored that. And now, you're looking at polls, like in the New York Times-Siena poll this week, 74 percent of voters saying that he's too old to do the job, that rises to 84 percent among people under 50 and 84 -- roughly the same number among people now voting for third parties. So once that perception is so solidified, anything -- you know, almost anything can reconfirm it, it can harden it further. And for Joe Biden to say to governors, well, you know, I really shouldn't be doing much after 8:00 PM, you remember in 2008, Hillary Clinton ran an ad? Who do you want answering the phone at 3:00 AM as president? And so, it just to me, it's just like the first example of many of how things that can happen between now and the election have the potential to feed into and compound the judgment, the negative judgment that Biden is facing about his capacity.",

Look, once voters have seen this performance, I don't think they can unsee it. I don't think you can ever -- you know, as I said, there was the concern going into the debate that he was too old, the debate gave a lot of evidence to the people who worried about that, but they were right to worry about that. And even if he has good days going forward, it I don't think it can erase what they saw, which leaves many people, you know, worried or confident that there are going to be bad days going forward as well. And so look, I don't think you can erase this. I mean, you might be able to ameliorate it a little bit. But I think, you know, you never get a second chance to make a first impression and I think he has created an indelible concern among voters that even if every day isn't like what they saw at the debate, there are going to be days that are like it, and many Americans are just not willing to take that risk for a president.",

I do think Messi will play. I do think Messi will start I think sitting out the group stage. The finale was just a chance for him to rest that hamstring and be ready for the knockouts. And I think especially with the United States national team out of the Copa America now, Lionel Messi takes an even bigger role for this tournament in terms of marketing and growing the game within this country. People tune in to watch Messi play all around the world. Certainly that's the case here in the United States as well. So right now, Messi is the biggest draw in this tournament. He will continue to be so. And if he is in Argentina or out of the tournament, I think some of the challenges of marketing these games, pushing these games ahead of the World Cup in two years becomes a little bit more challenging for sure.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, I'm not too concerned about the crowd sizes in the Copa America as it compares to the World Cup. For one, there'll be acompletely different marketing arm around that tournament in two years' time. People will run the marketing. It is the biggest tournament in the world. Millions of people will apply for tickets from all around the world to come to the United States to watch the games be played here. And so I think we're going to see absolutely filled stadiums around the country for the World Cup. That being said, certainly we see the challenges of an organization like CONMEBOL, which is based in South America, coming to the U.S. and trying to put on a tournament here. To some degree with some stars and some teams, you don't have to do much in the form of advertising to bring those fans into the stadium. As I mentioned before, I think anytime Argentina plays, you're going to have a sold-out crowd. The United States had some decent crowds. But when you see the ticket pricing, the lack of dynamic pricing, I'm trying to kind of push really, really high ticket prices to put revenue in front of everything else. When you see, for example, a non-sold out stadium here in Houston for a Mexico national team match, that's a rarity. Usually anytime Mexico plays it's a sold-out crowd. Now their national team is on a downturn and like I said those prices were very high. But I think it's indicative of the fact that there are still some savvy soccer fans out here who want to make sure that they're getting the product that they're paying for and hopefully there are some lessons learned by FIFA, by other organizers about how to market prices and what is the best way to try to increase the popularity of the sport by opening it up to more people and making tickets more accessible.",

You know, there's talk about how it's all going to be organized in terms of who gets the tickets when.

I don't think that will be the case from the World Cup. There are some of these stadiums who are retrofitting their stadiums to be able to play those wider fields. There's a minimum size required for the World Cup. But we see some of the challenges that exist with putting on a tournament here in the United States, when you play it at stadiums like in Las Vegas or in Los Angeles, where for some the reason they made those stadiums not be able to fit soccer fields. So that for me is the bigger concern. The temporary grass, certainly some lessons learned there. I think ahead of the World Cup, you'll see teams putting those grass fields down on top of turf much earlier in the process.",
