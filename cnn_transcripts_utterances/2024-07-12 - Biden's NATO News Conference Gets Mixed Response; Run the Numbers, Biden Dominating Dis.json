And he said, yes, he'd entertain it, but that he would only entertain it if his team also told him that polls showed that he couldn't win and then he whispered into the microphone and no poll is saying that. So, clearly, the president believes at this point that the data are on his side.And the White House and the campaign, for their part, when I was in touch with officials in the last 12 hours or so, it's clear they're pleased. They're relieved. They feel like the president hit some of the marks that they had set out for him where he exhibited some personality. He went into substance on foreign policy. And he also hit back at his opponent, Donald Trump, in moments that he failed to highlight on the debate stage two weeks ago. But they acknowledged that it is not going to end the questions or the conjecture or even some defections from some frontline candidates in the Democratic Party, and they expect that those will continue little by little over the coming days. But President Biden himself also acknowledged that there remain real questions, legitimate questions about his health, raised by members of his party and members of the public.

CNN spoke to more than a dozen members of Congress and people in touch with Obama and Pelosi. Many of them said the end of Biden's candidacy now feels clear to them. Democrats had wanted the election to be a referendum on Trump. But over the past few weeks, it's been about Biden's political survival. But what did the polls say? Let's bring in CNN senior data reporter Harry entered. I mean, Harry, you know, we just sort of tick through all of the -- going on inside the Democratic Party right now.

That's not 10 points. It's not 20 points. It's 3 points, but it's still something to be noted, right? He's still up by three percentage points at this particular time. And I think there are a lot of Democrats, Jim, a lot of Democrats are saying, can we do something better if we pick Kamala Harris, right? Can we do something better?

We're talking Michigan, which the Biden campaign acknowledges is really their only real path at this particular point.And we know pre-debate, we know pre-debate that those states were leaning a little bit more Republican than the nation as a whole. Now that we've had some post-debate data that has shown that we've seen slight movement towards Trump nationally, does that funnel down to the swing states? If it does, don't be surprised if we see some of those key battleground state polls actually showing Trump up four or five in states that Joe Biden needs to win.

Congresswoman, I mean, the White House, the Biden campaign, they like what they saw last night. Obviously, they feel like the president may have righted the ship a little bit, but we do have 17 congressional Democrats coming out calling for him to step aside. The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, has come out and said that the president should step aside. Your thoughts on the president's performance last night. What do you think? Do you think he has managed to live to fight another day? REP. STACEY PLASKETT (D-VI):  Well, I think what we saw last night was the Joe Biden that many of us see, which is an individual who can answer complex questions. You showed the gaffes but there were real substantive questions that the president answered in a manner that Trump could never answer. He could never speak with that complexity, and he could never speak with that truthfulness. And while you are showing the defections that are occurring within the Democratic Party, remember, there are over 200 Democrats in Congress. And people are asking what's happening with the Congressional Black Caucus. Why does the Congressional Black Caucus support the president? And I can tell you why they've been supporting the president, and why we continue to support President Biden. It's because he has delivered on the promises that he said he was going to do. He is the person who has done for our communities, for communities that have been forgotten, the things that he said he was going to do, whether it's reducing the wealth gap in black communities, giving $16 billion to HBCUs, increasing health care to black Americans in ways that Trump has not.

Trump's Project 2025 is a detriment to all Americans, whether it's women related to their bodies, whether it's African-Americans related to history, repealing of healthcare, all of the things that are within Trump's Project 2025, the fact that the president, in his four years in office, lied 30, 000 times. And we see that that's accelerating. The first year he had six lies a day. His last year in office, it was 30 lies a day. And then at the debate, it was 30 lies (INAUDIBLE).So, we believe that Americans, when they see the issues, they see what's at hand, they're going to vote for the Democratic candidate.

And the truth was, I lost some of my fastball and one day I got called in the office and released and because I ran out of talent. I think yesterday's performance was much better than the debate, but still fell way short of what America's expectations are, what a president should do and say, and how they should be able to be physically and mentally capable.
