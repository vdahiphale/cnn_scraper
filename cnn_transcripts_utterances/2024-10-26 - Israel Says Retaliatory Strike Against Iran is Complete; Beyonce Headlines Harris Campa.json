You are looking at live pictures of Tehran, where it is now 9Just a few hours ago, Israel carried out a long-expected series of strikes against Iran. Israel says those strikes are now over. And Iran says the attacks were intercepted, causing only limited damage. This is what the skies over Tehran look like just a short time ago. You can see what appeared to be anti-aircraft fire. Now, there's no word yet on possible damage or casualties. But Israel says it struck military targets, including missile manufacturing facilities and surface-to-air missile arrays. Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A senior U.S. official says Biden asked Israel to design a response that would, in fact, deter further attacks against Israel and reduce the risk of escalation. The Israeli military -- yeah, the Israeli military, if Iran does not respond, says, though, it will be ready. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When the Shabbat will be over, you will hear from them, condemnation for the limited operation in Iran and calling for continuous war in Gaza and in Lebanon.

Now, if you're wondering why Paris is in Texas when Texas is not a battleground state, you're probably thinking what most people in the United States are thinking. Why? Well, as Kamala Harris continues to create a contrast between what an America under a Harris administration would look like and an America under a Trump administration would look like when it comes to abortion rights, Texas is center stage. Texas is the biggest stage because Texas is one of the states with the strictest abortion bans. There is -- there are no exceptions for rape or incest in this state, and there's a very narrow exception for life of the mother. Now it's not just the star power that Harris has brought to Texas, it's also the stories of real women who have been impacted by the lack of abortion care in several states in the United States. Take a listen. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The reality is, for every story we hear about, about the suffering because of a Trump abortion ban, there are so many stories we've never heard an untold number of women and the people who love them, who are silently suffering, women who are being made to feel as though they did something wrong, as though they are criminals, as though they are alone.

It has made an endorsement in every election since the 1980s.A person with knowledge of the matter told CNN the \"Post\" editorial page staffers had already drafted an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. But the \"Post\" said owner Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, made the decision not to endorse. Robert Kagan, an opinion editor at large at the newspaper, says he resigned over the move. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT KAGAN, FORMER WASHINGTON POST EDITOR-AT-LARGE: It was a pretty easy decision. This is obviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in anticipation of his possible victory. Trump has threatened to go after Bezos' business. Bezos runs one of the largest companies in America. They have tremendously intricate relations with the federal government. They depend on the federal government. And Trump has made it clear that he will attack media organizations that are critical of him. The \"Post\" has had no trouble endorsing presidential candidates up until now. And by the way, this argument that they're making that somehow they want to become above it all on this thing, they've endorsed all kinds of candidates in this election season. They endorsed a Democratic nominee in Maryland. They've endorsed other Democratic nominees.

He's talked about sending the National Guard into blue cities to just patrol for crime to round up the homeless, to participate in his mass deportation plan and of course most recently to target in some vague way the enemy from within. It's really important to understand this is not just offensive rhetoric or kind of rhetorical excesses, this is Trump talking about, you know, using the military in a way that we have not seen through American history. And of course, maybe the most famous example I left out was in the meeting when they were -- when they were meeting in the White House before January 6th and one of the White House counsels said, won't there be massive protests in the cities if Mike Pence overturns the election result. And one of the Trump, the other Trump advisors said, that's what the insurrection act is for, which of course allows the president to use the military domestically.

These kind of operations could be scaled up and undetected or undefeated over time. But more importantly, I think it was designed to send a deterrent message, perhaps to defang or handicap some of the regime's long-range strike capabilities, but not going against everything, be it against everything military or everything political.

The regime is, again, absorbing this based on semi-official and official media trying to downplay and downsize the Israeli attack, saying that the regime's limited but nonetheless layered air and missile defenses were, quote-unquote, \"exceptionally effective\" against, you know, defeating and pushing back and against the Israeli strike, saying that the damage is exceptionally minimal.This could be designed to allow the regime to play a face internally, particularly in the face of a population which has been protesting against it for well over a decade now. But perhaps more importantly, to try to be able to weaponize that non-response as part of a larger kind of Iranian tango, if you will, against Washington to make sure that ultimately Washington is putting the restraining handcuffs on Israel rather than on its adversary, the Islamic Republic of Iran. And I would be remiss to note that if this wouldn't factor into the regime's nuclear calculations as well, throughout this entire month, we've had multiple hardline pro-Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps media outlets in Iran as well as lawmakers call for revising the country's nuclear doctrine, and this is an area we should keep our eyes on regardless of the Iranian response, but particularly as we move into the lame-duck period with the current U.S. administration.",

As we, you know, think about that, there's certainly been a lot of talk of the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu would like to take Iran and its nuclear program on. Do you believe that he's just in a holding pattern right now, that is, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, until the world learns who the next U.S. president will be?",

Can they bring any more influence to bear now on Iran, on Israel, on Hamas even?",

      "sentences": "Well, actually, in the run-up to the Israeli strike, you saw quite a bit of a lightning round, you could say, of direct Iranian bilateral diplomacy by a whole series of visits by the Foreign Minister, Mr. Araghchi, to a whole host of countries, not just in the GCC, not just in the Gulf Cooperation Council, but regionally as well.You also have the aftermath of the BRICS summit with the Iranian president meeting the Russian president at that summit in Tehran. The goal is to make the Islamic Republic look like it's on the diplomatic offensive here. But if I think we really had to distill each and every one of those bilateral meetings, the goal was to have Tehran threaten one of these partners of the U.S., to be able to spook those partners into amplifying that same desire for de-escalation over deterrence. So I think there's limited room for many of the Arab states and even limited room for the pro-American order in the region to do anything right now other than be something of a mediator or something of really an intermediary for messages sent between two countries that don't have diplomatic relations, and that, of course, is the U.S. and Iran.",

The hospital's director describes the situation as, quote, \"truly terrifying.\" The sources say the facility is in desperate need of aid.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUSSAM ABU SAFIYA, DIRECTOR, KAMAL ADWAN HOSPITAL (through translator): We will be facing a humanitarian catastrophe if there is no solution to the situation in the next few coming hours.

That is the lowest that I could find on record this entire century. I think there's some folks who wonder how could there still be folks who are undecided? But that's actually an extremely low number.It's half the level that we had at this point in the 2020 campaign. It's a third of the level that we had at this point in the 2016 campaign. But the truth is, Erin, this race is so tight at this particular point that if those 3% go to one candidate or the other, it could change the entire electoral map. So let's just say they go to Kamala Harris, right? She wins in Pennsylvania. She wins in Michigan. She wins in Wisconsin. She wins in Nevada. She wins in Arizona. She wins in North Carolina. And she wins in Georgia. As we go cruising the USA, she would get, get this, 319 electoral votes. But of course, Erin, there's no guarantee that they will all go to her. Let's just say that in fact, they go in the other direction. They go in Trump's direction. I'm going to do a neat little trick here. Boom! I changed all these states to red. And what does that get? If Donald Trump wins up in the Great Lakes, the Southwest and the Southeast, that gets Donald Trump up to 312 electoral votes. So there's still the possibility of a blowout if all the undecideds move in one direction. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
