I'm Manu Raju. Just 16 days to go, and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and their surrogates have been barnstorming the key battlegrounds and delivering starkly different closing arguments. As Harris ramps up her attacks, Trump at a rally last night outside Pittsburgh veered into uncharted waters, spending the first 12 minutes and 23 seconds of a profanity laced speech talking not about politics, but the late golfing legend Arnold Palmer, who hailed from the area and then referred to his genitals.

There was that long anecdote about Arnold Palmer, then at times it was vulgar, specifically when describing Vice President Harris's time in the Biden ministration ends, including a profane calling response of sorts with the crowd.Now, the former president did talk about things like inflation, immigration, and bringing jobs back to America. But as you noted in this lead at Manu, the focus still was incredibly scattered and the challenge at the challenging part about that for the campaign is that a senior Trump adviser tells us that this Pennsylvania swing really is supposed to mark the beginning of closing arguments. So we'll see if the former president can stay on topic, stay on some of the issues that his campaign wants to be talking about in these next coming days, certainly weeks before election day. Now, what were expecting to see today, Manu is the foreign president, is going to, in his words, work the French fry, essentially work the fry or to McDonald's back here in the commonwealth.

This is what David Urban, who's a CNN contributor, wrote to Trump, also a Trump adviser, told Michael Bender of \"The New York Times\" is, I don't think anyone is really changing their mind at this point, but when he distracts from his biggest broadest message, it is counterproductive because the Harris campaign uses it to turn out there for voters.",

I think folks are emotionally prepared themselves for any outcome, whether it's a Harris or Trump blowout, the Harris-Trump close win.That's how kind of thinly balance this all is. But, but the Harris campaign has, I think a slightly more expected or easier task on this and they know that the kind of anti-Trump coalition comes out. They've seen it happened in state elections. They've seen it happen in the midterms, the kind of core base of who their messages tailored to the anti-Trump coalition, the Democratic base, the independent who have maybe soured over him over the last couple of years. They are betting that that type of person is in the habit of voting and elections. Donald Trump is trying to turn more of those marginal, low-propensity voters into voters. He's trying to bring out a group of people if we -- even if we think about younger men, folks who haven't always consistently participated. So the task ahead of him as a little more difficult and I think that is what relates to this kind of age stability question for me. If this was the Donald Trump before eight years ago, I think we're talking about a candidate who could seize on the desire for change in the air a little better than we've seen this candidate able to do. His rallies are increasing only meandering, they're increasingly weird. I mean, they're increasingly just not I think the level of consistency in terms of message that, not only is advisors want to -- and not only I think -- even his own advisers want to see, right? And so, I think that is what is causing kind of a meta slightly answer your question with Harris to be honest with you, because I think the task ahead of the Trump campaign is one that requires a kind of movement and a candidate that can seize on it. Trump hasn't always been that consistently. What I would say though, is the desire for change in the electorate is such that people have been projecting that feeling onto Trump, even if he hasn't making that argument himself.",

But its not as if even the, quote/unquote, ground operation is really where Trump is making his, kind of, I think biggest pitch because there's so much money in the air because his name recognition is so high I don't think there's going to be won or lost on the doors. Like did spend last weekend with kind of Trump campaign volunteers in Georgia and they were making a place specifically for those lower propensity voters. They were targeting folks who had not come out four years ago and they thought would be more open to Trump and its given them more confidence in states that I think have a big pocket of those folks and I will the question I was asking is, why is someone more likely to vote for him now than they were in 2020, and the part -- and it goes back to what Alayna was saying earlier. They can see the idea that folks don't like him as a person.

And I can tell you that Donald Trump also thinks that having someone like Elon Musk, who started SpaceX, who now runs X, or formerly Twitter, has Tesla -- like he thinks that that is one of the biggest compliments.

And since Trump was saying that the United States president and the prime minister told me is not listening to the U.S. president. I asked Netanyahu's office for their version of this call. They didn't dispute what Trumps said, but instead, in a statement an Israeli spokesperson said in his conversation with former U.S. President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated what he has also said publicly that Israel takes into account the issues the U.S. administration raises. But in the end will make its decisions based on its national interests. It seems to essentially confirm what Donald Trump was saying at that rally last night that Bibi told him. But the reason that this is so notable here, Manu is because we are in the middle of waiting to see how Israel is going to respond to that attack by Iran on Israel from October 1st, something that could happen any day now And we know that president Biden has urged Israel to act with restraint, not to go after Iran's nuclear facilities, not to hit its oil facilities for fear that that could escalate this situation, this war, even further than what will were already this thing, right now.
