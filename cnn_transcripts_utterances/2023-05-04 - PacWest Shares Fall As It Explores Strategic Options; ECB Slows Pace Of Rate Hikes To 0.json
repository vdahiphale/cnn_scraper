The Dow Jones Industrialaverage as you can see, down almost one percent, that's a loss of 310 points. Well, those other markets and these are the main events. The US banking sector has a new problem child, shares in PacWest plunge. The European Central Bank chief warns of more ground to cover with interest rate hikes. And the Prince and Princess of Wales head to the pub as London prepares for the coronation. Live from Dubai. It is Thursday, May the Fourth. I am Eleni Giokos, I am in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. Great of you to join us, and tonight, a regional lender says it is exploring all options adding to concern over the health of the banking sector. PacWest is down more than 40 percent. It said, it is considering strategic options to maximize its value and that it is in discussion with potential partners, as well as investors. It is down 43 percent, as you can see. Look, that sent shares in other regional lenders down as well. Zions, Comerica, and KeyCorp are all lower as investors wonder who is next. These losses are astronomical on share prices across the board. It has led to a new target for regulators in the game of whack-a-mole. First Republic seem to be the last loose end after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank started the crisis. Now with PacWest struggling, it is clearly not over despite what Jamie Dimon and Jerome Powell said earlier this week. Listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's possible that Jerome Powell, JamieDimon and others underestimated just how much confidence has been shaken, shaken by the earthquake that was Silicon Valley Bank, right? I mean, that bank's sudden implosion, it obviously freaked out depositors who pulled their uninsured deposits from a whole range of banks. It also really freaked out investors who are on this hunt to try to find what other banks could have problems lurking on their balance sheet that are being exposed by the Fed spike in interest rates. And so we see PacWest down by 43 percent today alone. That is a dramatic loss. And it is actually -- it was even worse earlier today, I think was around fifty-one, fifty-two percent at one point. This is after PacWest says that they are searching for alternatives. I mean, it is Wall Street lingo for they're looking for some help. PacWest says that they're not experiencing any \"out of the ordinary deposit flows,\" but clearly, they are under a lot of pressure. Right now, you can see sharp losses really across the board here. And you know, it really feels like we do need something to break this cycle. Because as you noted at the top, there's been this game of whack-a-mole from Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, Credit Suisse, a lot of people thought that maybe this cycle could be broken with JPMorgan coming into rescue First Republic. Clearly, Eleni, that is not the case. It feels as though officials in Washington, lawmakers, they are going to have to come up with a more comprehensive solution because the banking crisis continues.",

We can onlysee the minute by minute swings in the stock price. And so, it is important to separate that out. Officials and the banks, they say that deposits have stabilized. They are not seeing these bank runs, like they saw in March, and PacWest. I mean, they talked about how their uninsured deposits have come down as an overall percentage, and that they're not experiencing, you know, a run on deposits right now. And yet, investors are still deeply concerned about what the future looks like for really this entire sector. There's just a lot of worry about how these banks are going to really make money right now. Their cost of deposits have gone up, because the Federal Reserve is spiking interest rates, because people are pulling their money, and they are also lending less because they're in the middle of this banking crisis. So, it's going to be difficult for them to make money. At the same time, the fact that shareholders had been wiped out in these other failed banks is making it harder for the existing banks to raise extra capital. So they are in a very difficult spot, and clearly, markets are worried about how they're going to make money in the future, but also what all of this does to the broader economy. And Eleni, I do think that that risk of a credit crunch that ends up really slowing the economy continues to be a major concern here.",

I think it's pretty well understood now that the ECB has been a little bit behind the Fed, which itself was behind the curve. So we are expecting a couple of more rate hikes for the ECB.

But we know from the past couple of years that that balance sheet reduction may not always go smoothly. So, I think that's probably a yellow light to go slowly with that. We don't know where any hiccups might pop up in the financial sector. But I think in terms of kind of a consistent message saying they've got more work to do in there and they are working on both channels, which is the balance sheet channel and the rate channel, I think that is probably their correct path, we would say.",

The Fed may not have to go as high because even if the Fed stays on hold, we're going to probably see tighter lending standards and soft equity prices. So I think we get to the same place in terms of financial conditions, but maybe not with as high a Fed funds rate. But, you know, obviously, they're going to have to watch this. We saw the hiccup with SVB in March, and a lot of the sort of financial stress measures have reverted to February level since then. And we know we've had a big rise of rates and stuff can pop up in different sectors of the economy. So, I think vigilance is the word.

She chaired this meeting with the CEOs of these various companies involved at the forefront of these AI technologies. And one thing that is really notable about this statement is look, this is the beginning of the early stages, at least of a process to try and establish some rules of the road for this emerging technology, and to also look at potential regulations. But in the meantime, while that effort is still ongoing, one thing that Vice President Kamala Harris clearly sought to impress on these CEOs is the need for these private companies in the absence of new regulations to act ethically, morally, and legally in a responsible fashion. She says, \"to ensure the safety and security of their products,\" and also noting that they should comply with existing laws. And so I think that's an important message here that the White House is sending to these leaders, which is to say that look, regulation is clearly still catching up with these new technologies. There are some regulations already on the books that would still apply to these companies, but in the meantime, before those new regulations come into force, until Washington actually gets together and puts those regulations on the table, that there is a responsibility on these companies' part. Now today, what we also saw alongside this meeting, was announcements of some new announcements from the White House, including the fact that the Office of Management and Budget is going to be releasing draft policy guidelines this summer, on the use of AI systems by the US government that could potentially emerge as a template for how other companies in the private sector would treat AI. And what we also saw was new investments to power research into AI, and its responsible use, $140 million from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new national AI research institutes. And more broadly, the White House is also calling for more public assessments of the existing AI technologies. And that is by having thousands of technologists and hackers et cetera go through and test these products, not the companies, not the government, but independent actors being able to work through these systems to see how they can be used. So again, this is early stages in terms of the government getting involved in this, but this technology, as we know, is taking off like a rocket ship. And President Biden himself, I'm told, has been briefed extensively on this, he popped by this meeting. And he also used ChatGPT, at least once.",

But as we know, Washington tends to move a lot slower than the pace of technology. I mean, when you think about it, the government is still working through how and should we regulate these social media companies? Right. So obviously, they are too if not five, or 10 steps behind already, but certainly there is momentum to actually establish some rules of the road here. We will see whether or not that results in regulations and legislation. But that is certainly something that the White House is opening the door to today.",
