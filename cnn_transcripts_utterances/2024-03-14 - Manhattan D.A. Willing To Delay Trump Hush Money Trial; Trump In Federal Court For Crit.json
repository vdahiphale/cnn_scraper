Moments ago, the prosecutor in the New York hush money case said he'd be okay with a 30-day delay. This as the former president spent the day in the Florida courtroom, his lawyers arguing broad leeway under the Presidential Records Act as a reason to throw out the case. The judge in that case expressing skepticism. We'll explain all of it to you coming up. And Rodgers response. NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers with a new post on Twitter today, kind of alluding to the exclusive reporting we broke here on THE LEAD yesterday, that he had privately shared with the least two people we know of deranged conspiracy theories about the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting not being real. Plus, space success with a major mishap.

I'm Jake Tapper.We got a lot of legal news as for you relating to Donald Trump and -- we'll explain it to you as clearly as possible because I know it's tough to keep all of these cases apart. We'll start with breaking news in our lawn justice lead. The Manhattan district attorney just said he's not opposed to a delay of up to 30 days. This is in Trump's hush money file. This is according to a new court filing, breaking this afternoon. Now, this is the case that involves Trump's alleged payment to adult film star and director Stormy Daniels in an attempt to keep her quiet about their alleged affair. This is right before the 2016 election. Now, this trial was supposed to start in less than two weeks, on March 25th. So it looks like it will start later than that. That's number one. Number two, we are also following a major hearing in Trump's Mar-a- Lago classified documents case. Again, I know it's tough to keep all these straight, but remember, this is the case where Donald Trump stands accused of taking highly sensitive classified documents to Mar- a-Lago after leaving the White House, after which the National Archives repeatedly asked Trump to return the documents, requests he ignored, and Trump continued to distort the documents in unsecured locations throughout the Mar-a-Lago property, including these famous photos you've seen of the box is being stored rather insecurely in bathrooms and ballrooms and more. Today's big development, Trump's attorneys asked the judge to delay that case or even throw it out altogether. Trump's team arguing two things. One, that the presidential records act was not clear enough so Trump did not know he was breaking the law when he brought the documents to Mar-a-Lago. Two, arguing that these were his personal records. He had a right to keep. Special counsel Jack Smith's team fighting back, saying, come on, clearly knew the importance of some of the classified documents he had, pointing to a meeting Trump had at his Bedminster, New Jersey club in 2021. There's a recording of this meeting in it. He describes certain documents as classified and he did not seem to think that they were personal. Now, that's one and two. Now, we turn to three. We are also awaiting a major ruling that could come at any moment in Fulton County, Georgia, this has to do with the case against Donald Trump for trying to steal the Georgia electoral votes. Judge Scott McAfee is any minutes had to decide whether District Attorney Fani Willis, who is prosecuting Trump should be removed from overseeing Trump's Georgia elections case. This is over claims from the Trump team that Fani Willis financially benefited from a relationship she had with one of her top prosecutors. All right. Got it all? Let's start with CNN's Katelyn Polantz outside the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida. That's where the classified document case is. Kaitlan, Judge Cannon seem pretty skeptical of the Trump team's arguments today.",

They're either trying to get the case dismissed or to make things take a really long time until everyone's set to go to trial.Today, they spent five hours in the courtroom in arguments before Judge Cannon, where she didn't rule, but she did express some skepticism to these arguments Trump is making to have his case dismissed on the grounds that these were his personal papers that he wanted to take out of the White House and that the law around national defense secrets is a little too big for him to have known. He shouldn't have taken them out of the White House and to Mar-a-Lago, Judge Cannon said it would be an extraordinary step for her to dismiss the case on these grounds, and it would be difficult to see her doing that at this juncture. But he's asked by my count nine different ways to have this case dismissed. This was arguments for just two of those nine topics or approaches his team has made. So we now wait for Judge Cannon to rule. She is very likely to write something potentially lengthy about the Presidential Records Act, about the law in this case, and how it's charged against Donald Trump. She says, it'll be coming promptly, but we still don't even have a trial date the last time we were here two weeks ago. That was what they were talking about then and still nothing on the books.",

He had reactions to some of the arguments that people were making, you know, little facial expressions, things like that. One thing in this case that is really interesting to watch is what people refer to Trump in the courtroom. There's not any interaction with him directly in a day like this where it's about legal arguments.

Remember, he's had this evolving explanation for how you should be allowed to have these classified documents. He had a standing order. He declassified them with his mind. He's also on tape, a central piece of evidence in this case, acknowledging that he couldn't declassify them when he's no longer president and he shouldn't have that. He knew he had secrets.But even though he's unlikely to win on the merits, the fact that she allowed arguments here took a whole day to hear this out, which he could have just dispense with this on paper. That is significant because every day, every filing, every motion helps delay this and we know that is the crux and we said it 100 times of the Trump defense strategy.

TOM DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, G.W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION:  In my opinion, no, Jake. Look, the fact is, is that this law and the other law, the Espionage Act and its charged under have been on the books for a long time. And although it's not impossible for a federal judge to basically invalidate a statute on the theory that it is too vague to be enforced, that happens very, very rarely. I cannot imagine her doing that here, particularly because the president -- I mean, look, he's not a lawyer, but he's a sophisticated person. He worked in the White House. Obviously, he's well aware of the ways the federal government, and I just don't think it's going to be plausible to the judge for him to say I had no idea that what I was doing could possibly be deemed illegal.",

Do you agree with NASA administrator Nelson, who says today's test is clearly a success? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST:  Well, steady progress, right, Jake? You know, you test, you might fail a little, but every time you fail, you learn a lot. So that idea, that term failure is not an option -- is not act here. The approach that SpaceX has taken over the years and this today after you, it's 22nd anniversary, is test a lot, fail a lot, learn a lot, and that's what were seeing here. And it got to orbital speeds. It didn't quite meet the full mission profile. They would have liked to have seen it splashdown in the ocean intact. But there were a lot of things that they learned and presumably that next slide and they got four more of these waiting to fly already. That next one we might get a little further.",

As an aircraft comes in, it compresses molecules and it turns those molecules, they compress them so much that the electrons become breed, which is essentially electricity. So those are electrified molecules that you are seeing there.

The idea is to land at the astronauts on a modified version of Starship. And you've got to have powered descent all the way down. And that's an important thing to learn.
