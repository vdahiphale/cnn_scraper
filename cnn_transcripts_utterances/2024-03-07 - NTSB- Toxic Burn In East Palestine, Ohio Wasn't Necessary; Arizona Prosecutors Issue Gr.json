That's like the low-level people who were putting themselves forward as electors for Trump falsely. But then, in this investigation and in Georgia, there appears to be a broader sense of what the prosecutors are looking at. In these subpoenas, they are asking for things not just about the fake electors' plot but also about attorneys around Donald Trump and people working and affiliated with the national campaign level of Donald Trump and his operation. Who they could be looking at charging, that's still a question that prosecutors will have to decide and reveal. But it could be people like John Eastman, who is getting -- there are a lot of questions about John Eastman.

He said, in part, they haven't studied these medication for cosmetic weight loss. They've only studied it in people with obesity and with type II diabetes. He also noted insurance coverage is really poor for people with obesity. Half of people who could qualify for these medicines don't have coverage for them. And, of course, the shortage issues. He pointed out this is a week around advocacy for obesity around World Obesity Day. Here is what he told us about the timing of this ad campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All of this very clearly dimming the hopes from the Middle East to the United States that a deal is within grasp right now. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following all of this. There's been some new -- there's been, at least, new statements coming out this morning not giving a lot of people hope that it's going to be happening anytime soon, Paula. What's happened?",

And now we are hearing from U.S. officials, quote, \"Hope is fading.\"The fact that the Hamas delegation has left Cairo shows that there was no breakthrough. Shows that the talks are going nowhere at this point. Then the fact that there wasn't even an Israeli delegation in Cairo also shows that hope is fading. Now, we have heard from Hamas. They said they were being flexible. They said they had pulled back their demands. But we've heard from Israel that one of those key demands -- the fact that they want this list of hostages -- they want to know which ones are alive and which ones are not -- is just not possible from Hamas. Hamas saying they need the ceasefire in able -- in order to be able to try and get that list together, which as you just said, an Israeli official said they do not believe, saying it is a game at this point. So this would be extremely disappointing news to many in the region -- to the hostage families and to many of the Palestinian prisoners that would have been released in return as well. And not least for the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza. The U.N. warning that a quarter of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of famine. In northern Gaza, child malnutrition is horrific. So what we are seeing is -- certainly from humanitarian aid groups as well -- devastation that there won't be this ceasefire. That they won't be able to flood the Gaza Strip with aid anytime soon -- Kate.",
