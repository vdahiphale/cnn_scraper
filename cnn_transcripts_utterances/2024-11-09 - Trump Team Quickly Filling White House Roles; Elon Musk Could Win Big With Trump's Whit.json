I'm Jessica Dean in New York.It has been four days since Donald Trump's decisive presidential victory and we could learn some of his key Cabinet picks including CIA director, attorney general and secretary of Defense. The president- elect has already named his White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, seen as many as the architect of his 2024 win. And for more on how the Trump White House is taking shape, CNN's Alayna Treene is joining us now from West Palm Beach, near Mar-a-Lago. And Alayna, it's kind of deja vu all over again in the sense that it's a Saturday night and we get a post from the former president, now former -- now president-elect with some key information on who will not be joining his administration.",

      "sentences": "That's right. I think we're getting a little preview, Jessica, of what we can expect once Donald Trump is sworn in come January. Some of these, you know, late Friday, late Saturday night posts.But, look, he did write tonight that he didn't announce new names for his second administration but he did announce two people that will not be serving in that second administration. I'm going to read for you some of what he wrote. He said, quote, \"I will not be inviting former ambassador Nikki Haley or former secretary of state Mike Pompeo to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation. I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously and would like to thank them for their service to our country. Make America great again.\" Now, look, behind the scenes, I'm sure you guys have some questions about why he is saying this. But the reason I'm told that this is even coming up is because both Pompeo's name as well as Haley's name have been brought up in some of these closed-door conversations with Donald Trump's transition team taking place behind me on that island at Mar- a-Lago. Now I will say many people that I have spoken to over the last several days have said that they believed Mike Pompeo did a great job serving as Donald Trump's secretary of state and that he deserved a seat at the table this time around. However, Donald Trump for his part, his relationship with Pompeo is not what it once was. It's what many people have described it to me as, that their relationship has soured. He did not come out and endorse Trump early on, if not even later on, and that has been a sticking point. But then also, Donald Trump has questioned I'm told privately when his name has been brought up whether or not he actually could trust Pompeo and whether or not he was fully loyal to him. Now some of the jobs that he was being floated for, really the main job Pompeo's name I'm told was under consideration for was secretary of Defense. But now that is clearly off the table. As for Haley, look, Donald Trump had said that he had appreciated her getting up on stage at the Republican National Convention in July, saying that she supported him. She also offered I would remind you in really the 11th hour to go out and campaign with him. That never materialized, but discussions had been made about whether or not they would go out for a joint appearance before election day. But really, when it came down to it, Donald Trump has been telling his allies, I'm told, essentially that he hadn't gotten over all of the attacks that she had lobbed at him throughout that Republican primary. It was a very bitter battle between Haley and Trump. And also Donald Trump believed and still harbors animosity toward her, I'm told, for hanging on and staying in that primary fight longer that he deemed appropriate. So that's just some insight into maybe where some of this is coming from, as Donald Trump continues to remain, you know, locked in, locked down at Mar-a-Lago, going through some of these different candidates that he will be selecting for top Cabinet and other White House roles -- Jessica.",

And when you look at some of the names that have been brought up for some of these Cabinet roles, whether it is secretary of state or it's, you know, secretary of the Treasury or Defense, all of the names have been people who have been longtime Trump allies or personal friends.And so I would expect that when he's making choices here on who he is going to be putting in his Cabinet, he's going to be thinking about who he is going to be getting along with, but also who is going to be following his agenda, especially in the critical first 100 days here of his administration, when it seems that they are going to be working pretty aggressively to tick through a list of different policy items, especially with having control of Congress, too.",

So you have to look back on this era and some of the people in the Republican circles who may have had criticisms of him.

He said he actually won and that he was cheated. So yes, he always thinks he's got a mandate, but in this case, he's kind of right. He not only won the popular vote, not only won all the swing states, it's not official yet, but it looks that way, he also changed the coalition of voters who support Republicans.He got a higher share of Hispanic voters and it looks like preliminarily a higher share of black male voters. So yes, he's feeling good about himself. However, we've seen in the past with other presidents, they feel they have a mandate, they get in office, then all of a sudden reality hits them and, you know, who knows what happens at that point. I'd like to add one thing, by the way, that Meridith had said about Susie Wiles being loyal. She not only stuck with him through all of these things, she stuck with him during that classified documents investigation where she was hauled in front of the U.S. attorney's office and in front of the FBI, and was questioned, and she stayed by Trump.

But the details seem to be Ukraine gives up territory that Russia now holds and promises never to join NATO for about 20 years, and these are things that would be great for Putin, but they would be very bad for Zelenskyy politically and every other way. So we're going to have to see because Zelenskyy is in a difficult situation. You know, the war is not going well. Russia is making gains and Zelenskyy relies upon the United States to a great degree for weapons and financial aid.

They have time to think about it. I mean the Republican Majority in the Senate will ensure that however Donald Trump would pick if there is a vacancy, would get through quickly as we have seen. I mean, Mitch McConnell, when he was Majority Leader, he made sure that the opening created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia was not filled for almost 10 months, and then when Justice Ginsburg died, he made sure that vacancy was filled within days a nomination was made within weeks, it was filled. It depends a great deal who is in charge of the Senate. The Senate will be in Republican hands for the next two years and if you look at who is up, the likelihood is that they'll be -- that the Republicans will continue control of the Senate, at least that is the way it looks tentatively for now, of course, a great deal can change.",

They think that he would view that as being driven out of office by his critics and that he is not at all likely to do that.People who know Justice Alito think it unlikely that he will retire either. This is his life. He spent his life as a public servant. The question is, what do you do afterwards? He is a man who is defined by his work. If I were betting, I would bet there are no vacancies.

She signed onto the opinion that the Chief Justice wrote, but disagreed with part of it. Again, she disagrees about the interpretation of -- when the court throughout a statute under which some of the January 6th defendants were convicted and sentenced to prison, she disagreed that that statute should have been thrown out. [19:45:15] So, I think that she will bring some moderation and the Chief Justice to some extent as the same way.
