Just ahead, a delicate balancing act, the Biden administration weighs how to respond to a deadly attack on U.S. troops without escalating tensions.A dark reality for Gaza's most fragile. Newborns in Gaza face overwhelming odds with a failing healthcare system and dire living conditions. Plus, one issue, coming to the forefront of French politics, infertility. President Macron's plan to help tackle the country's declining birth rate and how French women are responding. We'll have a guest later this hour. Appreciate you joining us. U.S. President Joe Biden is weighing options for retaliation in response to a drone attack in Jordan that killed three American soldiers and injured more than 40 others. President Biden huddled with his national security team on Monday as they considered the options. Officials blame Iran-backed militants for the attack, though Iran is denying any involvement. The White House says the U.S. is not looking for a war with Iran, but won't rule out the possibility that President Biden is considering strikes within the country. The drone strike on Sunday marks a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East at what the U.S. Secretary of State called a volatile time in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We've made very, very clear from day one that we're going to defend our people, we're going to defend our personnel, we're going to defend our interests, and that's exactly what we've done. We've taken action, significant action to deter groups, to degrade their capabilities in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen. At the same time, the president's been very clear that we want to prevent broader escalation. We want to prevent this conflict from spreading. So, we are intent on doing both. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I'm sure the White House is looking at three options notionally.One is a really heavy option. Go after Iran, pick the set of targets. Another is a lighter option. Hit four or five different militia points and hit them again and again, over a period of two or three days. And there's a middle ground that says maybe you hit a couple of Iranian assets in the Gulf or maybe Iranian command and control in Iraq somewhere, but you don't strike into Iran proper.

Now, if we could get a reasonable ceasefire temporarily in Gaza, get the hostages released, that would be really good. But for Israel, this situation in Hamas is, you just can't live with it. You've got to get Hamas out of Gaza because that is -- it's a threat to the existence of Israel. And the same thing is true with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah in south Lebanon. So, it would be great to get the hostages released, take a lot of pressure off if you've got a six-week ceasefire, as is being talked about.

Alex Marquardt has details. ALEXANDER MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: According to most of the parties who were involved in talks over the weekend, it does appear that progress has been made in trying to reach a deal for hostages and for a pause in the fighting in Gaza. There was a meeting on Sunday in Paris attended by the CIA director as well as his Egyptian and Israeli counterparts and the Qatari prime minister, who then came here to Washington and on Monday talked about a broad framework that the parties had discussed with initiatives from all of them. It is clear that a lot of work still remains to finalize this deal and get it across the finish line, but a source familiar with the discussions tells me that a broad framework was agreed to by those parties who were in Paris. That would include an initial phase of civilian Israeli hostages released by Hamas and other groups that would be accompanied by a six- week pause in the fighting. That pause could be extended if more of the hostages are released, including the IDF soldiers, both men and women, and the bodies of hostages who are still being held in the Gaza Strip. Now Hamas would expect Palestinian prisoners to also be released from Israeli prisons, three Palestinian prisoners for every civilian hostage. That ratio could go up with the IDF soldiers. Now I asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the deal that is being discussed. He called it a strong and compelling proposal and said that there is some real, that there is real hope going forward. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I can just tell you that there is again strong, I would say alignment among the countries involved that this is a good and strong proposal.
