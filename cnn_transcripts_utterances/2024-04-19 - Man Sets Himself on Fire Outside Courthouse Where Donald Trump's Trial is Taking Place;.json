We have been seeing atthe top in the last half an hour or so, disturbing scenes of a person who apparently set themselves on fire outside the courthouse where Donald Trump's trial is currently underway. Now, two law enforcement sources confirmed the news to CNN. We are still waiting to hear more details, but what we know from our team on the grounds is that a man walked into the park across the street from the -- from the courthouse, set himself on fire, and then we found out that this man was throwing flyers we've been told into the air. This is according to a senior law enforcement official, we then also learnt he pulled something out of a backpack. It was not immediately clear, at least at this moment what that item was, and then he lit himself on fire. Of course, this is outside, of course, where the courthouse -- where Trump trial is underway. John Miller, I think is right there for us, and she joins us now. John, what are you learning about what unfolded here?",

Before doing that -- and this happened in the park directly across the street from the courthouse where the Donald Trump jury selection is unfolding. He threw a number of pamphlets up in the air, then ignited himself on fire, and then that caused emergency responders to run in that direction, an ambulance was called, he's being treated and removed to what we believe will be a burn center at Midtown Hospital. The pamphlets are a conspiracy theory about a university and its involvement allegedly with death plots and Ponzi schemes and so on. The signs talk about Trump and then Biden being together in some deep-state plot. So, what we appear to be dealing with is an individual who has been identified as a man in his mid-to-late 30s, who has been around here. And the question is, why here? Why now? Why this place? And we can only try to figure out what his motive is, which is probably to do this in a place where he knew the world media was watching, standing by just a few feet away, and to achieve maximum attention for whatever this message was he is trying to get out. It is not considered an act of terrorism, it is possibly an attempted suicide. It is definitely a call for attention, and right now, police are trying to put together the background of this individual, who he's been with, who he's been talking to, what his back-story is. And then, of course, gleaning what they can from these pamphlets, which sounds like a very involved conspiracy theory.",

So, he sort of took advantage of our focus of the public out there, everyone being focused on it and did it in a public place where there would be maximum viewership. But at least, what we know right now in terms of -- of sort of political -- you know, sort of ties or whatever, it sounds like he is someone who is just absorbed a lot of information about sort of crazy conspiracy theories and is both anti -- you know, confusing Trump and Biden, and that this has nothing to do with the Trump trial.

This video showing the scene right after the man was taken away there in New York. Now, we don't know his condition. A law enforcement source tells CNN the man entered a park across the street from the courthouse, threw flyers into the air, took something from his backpack and lit himself on fire. And, of course, this -- all of this happening just moments after the full jury panel was seated in Trump's hush money trial. We are waiting a press conference from the New York Police Department in about 15 or so minutes. And we'll bring you that when we get -- when it comes to us. But investigators said that they had the man flyers, had flyers that he threw into the air. And one of the flyers, according to the CNN team on the ground, said NYU is a mob front and had various kind of allegations of wrongdoings against the school. But clearly, as you heard from our experts here, from our team on the ground, and as you well know, there are cameras packed along all that main road, including our team who saw it as it was happening. Very, very hard images to look at. But, of course, as soon as we have more details on this breaking news, and as soon, of course, as we hear from the New York Police Department chief, we will bring that to you. Now, let's turn to the Middle East, because at this hour, it's still not clear what comes next after U.S. officials says Israel launched an attack inside Iran. An Iranian official says its air defenses intercepted three drones near an army base in central Iran in the city of Isfahan. Satellite images obtained by CNN do not appear to show any extensive damage at the base that was purportedly targeted by the Israelis. Iran thus far seems to be downplaying the attack. Following Friday prayers, Iranians did gather in Tehran's Revolution Square, as you can see there, to protest Israeli strikes on Iran and Gaza. Excuse me. Our Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. And, Oren, we know from Secretary Blinken, we heard him earlier today, that the U.S. was not involved in any operations with a strike in Iran. But does the U.S. believe, Oren, that this was calibrated in such a way as to de-escalate? I mean, does it believe this is over, basically?",

We know Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, when he spoke with Defense Minister YoavGallant several days ago, asked to be notified or updated ahead of any Israeli response or attack following Iran's attack on Israel last weekend. Now, from what we're understanding and from what the Italian said, that notification came within the last few seconds, essentially with the attack already underway before the munitions, before the weapons hit their target at a point where Israel wasn't about to call them back, essentially preventing the possibility that the U.S. could convince Israel to walk this back and not to carry this out. So you can imagine there would be some level of frustration with that, but also the U.S. realizing that this was not an attack that would lead to a regional escalation. It was instead designed to send a message and calibrate it in such a way that it didn't lead to that escalation. And on that note, I'll also point out, Isa, that one of the concerns of the U.S. over the course of the past week is would Iran's proxies in Iraq and Syria attack U.S. forces? That has not been the case. We have not seen an attack on U.S. forces over the course of the past 24, 48 hours, and we have not seen any significant movement from the Houthis in Yemen, another Iranian proxy.

Of course, the war between them still exists and through proxies. I think what's happened is the red lines that had sort of both sides thought they could operate in have become blurred, and we don't seem to be at a moment of escalation, but the possibility of what could have happened, you know, regional escalation, bloodshed, it did feel like it came close. We're not close to it at the moment, it feels like, but I think everyone got a better view of what's at stake, and that was what the real concern was. And the reason I say ambiguity, I think, you know, number one, you're not hearing any lines officially from Israeli politicians, and I think what we heard from the Iranians as well, which was essentially playing it down, which was telling their audiences that, OK, we activated our air defenses, there were some objects in the sky, and we shot at them. But essentially we're going to investigate, which is Iranian speak, if you will, for nothing to see here move along. There was a protest in Tehran, but of course a big protest like that, anti-Israel protest, wouldn't have happened without the government's say-so. So it allows sort of a little bit of venting of anger, but in no way is a military response. I don't think anyone should be fooled that this issue has gone away, but it does seem to be tamped down, and that's what everyone's been calling for, the Egyptians, the Emiratis today, the Jordanians, all saying de-escalate, and that's what we've heard from Israel's allies and partners. Even though on the eve, on the minutes before this attack took place, Iran's foreign minister was telling CNN's Erin Burnett that there would be an immediate and devastating response, but so far all that looks like rhetoric.

Unforgivable is what he said. But neither Ben-Gvir or Yair Lapid actually said that Israel had struck Iran. It was all implicit. And I think as everyone here, particularly the Iranians, are in the -- are in the, I'll use the word game, but it's not. It's a strategic position of sort of looking the other way, of not playing it up, but just trying to minimize it on domestic audiences. This will be overlooked. But the bigger issues remain. You know, Iran's proxies are still a major threat to Israel. Israel still faces a major conflict in Gaza, where now more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, faces incredible international pressure to hold that back. And Iran has interpreted that as weakness, that Israel is becoming a little bit isolated in a way that it wasn't before from its international partners.

So the judge in this case, he has his work cut out for him because each side is really pulling out all the stops and there -- there's a lot of advocacy. Look, that's what we do as lawyers. We zealously advocate for our client or for New York. And so we're going to see a lot of these issues, I think, throughout the trial. We're going to see a lot of sidebars. We're going to see a lot of out-of-court hearings relating to issues about how evidence is going to be presented, witnesses, and how the court proceeding is actually going to go forward. I think it's really foreshadowing what we'll see throughout this trial.",

So, they are going to go through all of the entriesthat were qualified as legal fees that serve as the basis for these falsified documents. And then they're going to talk about what was happening at that time. Donald Trump was running for president of the United States. And they're going to talk about how these payments to Stormy Daniels were in furtherance of squashing that because of the election. That's going to be a central part of the prosecution's case. They're going to focus on that. Donald Trump's team, on the other hand, they're going to argue that there's no evidence that there wasn't a mixed motivation for silencing Stormy Daniels, that the agreement, the hush money, that's not illegal on its face. So they're going to say that it's the prosecution's burden. But we're going to hear a lot in those opening statements because that's where the jury really gets the sense of both sides of the case. And it really sets the tone for what the jurors are going to listen for as the trial unfolds.",
