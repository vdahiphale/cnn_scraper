I'm the master of social media.And remember, as you said in the intro, this law kicks in January 19th, the day before Trump takes office. And so, what Trump has said is put the whole thing on hold, Supreme Court. Give me some time, some unspecified amount of time to sit down with TikTok, presumably with Congress, and try to work something out. By the way, he doesn't say what that solution would be. So, again, I think it's logical and rational on its face, but the justices have to apply the law here, they have to apply the Constitution, and Trump doesn't even make a constitutional argument or try to.",

If Trump wants, he can then go back to Congress and lobby Congress to pass a new law, really. So, if the Supreme Court upholds this law, the only way to undo the law then is for Congress to repeal it and pass something new in its place. So, even if the Supreme Court rules on this case, Trump still will have an opportunity to play deal maker here if he wants to do that. And it is important, as you mentioned, this was passed -- this law was passed by a bipartisan group in Congress and both the Joe Biden administration earlier in his first administration, Donald Trump had come out similarly saying TikTok is a national security ban.
