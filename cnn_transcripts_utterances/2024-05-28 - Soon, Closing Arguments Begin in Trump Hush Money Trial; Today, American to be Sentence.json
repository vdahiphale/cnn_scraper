And we are getting new reporting just in on how the lawyers plan to make their cases.First, Trump's attorneys will hammer the credibility of key witness Michael Cohen and question why other key figures in Trump's circle will not call to the stand. The prosecution is expected to focus on the evidentiary trail, text messages, phone logs, emails, checks, receipts, and the testimony of 22 witnesses, 20 for the prosecution, 2 for the defense.

And here we are the end, the culmination of this trial, closing arguments beginning when court begins at 9In addition to that, the people the prosecution didn't call who jurors sort of heard about. In some of the witness testimony, people like former Trump CFO Allen Weisselberg, who worked out the communications of those hush money or calculations rather of those hush money payments, also Keith Schiller, the former bodyguard who allegedly, according prosecution, had that crucial phone call with Michael Cohen, connecting him to Donald Trump to they have the witness discuss those hush money payments. They also believe that those documents are not false, everything that the prosecution has laid out for those jurors, not false because Cohen was Trump's attorney up until 2017. So, that will be part of their arguments. Then, of course, prosecution has its turn, and they say, you don't need to fully just believe Michael Cohen because they have the documents to prove it. They have the witness testimony. They have phone calls. They have the 34 falsified documents according to them, which includes the business vouchers, the invoices and the checks. So, it's going to be an eventful day in court today. Let me lay out exactly what we're expecting, full day of closing arguments. They actually could bleed over into tomorrow. And then, of course, jury instructions, that crucial part of this case, where the judge will tell the jurors how they are meant to interpret the law and apply it to all the evidence on the witnesses that they have heard from, those are expected to last an hour. And then, of course, deliberations begin the seven men and five women will go behind closed doors and determine the fate of the former president. Guys?",

The 40-year-old, he boarded a flight right back to Pennsylvania on Friday, just hours after a judge ruled that he found, quote, exceptional circumstances in that case. Now, Hagerich told officials that he did not know that the hunting ammunition that he had in his luggage, he had no idea that it was in that bag when he visited the country earlier this week. Here now is Hagerich and his wife on the uncertainty that played out on Friday. Remember, he was facing the possibility of spending 12 years in prison. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's so much demand here that Elon Musk's A.I. startup had no problem raising twice as much as they wanted. Originally, they wanted $3 billion, they got $6 billion.So, this company is called XAI, it's less than a year old, but it's already worth $24 billion. That is a lot of money. That is more than my New York Mets, your Boston Red Sox, the Yankees and the Dodgers combined. And, again, this company is less than a year old. Now, it raised money from Silicon Valley firms and a Saudi prince. Its main product is an A.I.-powered chat bot called Grok, and it trains on data from X, the social network, formerly known as Twitter, hopefully minus the trolling and the cursing there. Now, this company's ambitions are quite lofty. The mission is stated as to understand the, quote, true nature of the universe. Now, this is just the latest A.I. investment in what increasing looks like an arms race in the tech space, right? We're talking about a lot of major investments. Microsoft agreed to invest about $13 billion in OpenAI. That's the company that's known for ChatGPT. Amazon has invested $4 billion in Anthropic. Obviously, this XAI investment we just told you about. Then there's also NVidia, right? This is a company that only makes the infrastructure that powers A.I., but it's worth more than $2.5 trillion. Now XAI is also just the latest piece of the Elon Musk empire right now. He's obviously known for Tesla, right? Running Tesla is a full time job, especially lately, but then there's SpaceX. There's X, the social media company. There's the brain chip startup, Neuralink, Tunnel Company, the Boring Company. He is a very busy guy. Obviously, part of this empire has already been very successful. And the question now is whether or not he can replicate that in the A.I. space.",
