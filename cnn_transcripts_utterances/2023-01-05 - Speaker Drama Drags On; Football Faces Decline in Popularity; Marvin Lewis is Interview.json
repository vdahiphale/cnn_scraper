I mean both from kind of invoking, you know, Frederick Douglass and saying he wouldn't be anything but a Republican, I'll tell you, the Republican Party's a little different now than it was when he was in. And, secondarily, hearing the groans in the background too was kind of, to me, a little like jarring. I didn't - I can't see the visual of it, but this idea that - you know, look, Byron Donalds, I don't know much about him. He's a second term member of Congress. He's obviously in the Freedom Caucus. I don't know the dynamics in there. But I don't think it's beneficial to go after anyway. The times have changed. There are some members of Congress that are Republicans that I think hold the mantle of people like Abraham Lincoln, and there are some that - that aren't. And I think these 20 out there that are doing their best to tear down government - and, frankly, some of those have been trying to tear down government since they've been in Congress -- is not a great example of Lincoln Republicanism.",

It's a - it's a club.And, honestly, here's the interesting thing, I've seen a few members of this club try to distance themselves from this effort because there are a few that are supporting Kevin McCarthy.

It can do nothing else but elect a speaker. That is the only existence. That's why you see vote after vote after vote. Either you adjourn or you come in and you vote for speaker.

And so Donald Trump may not be an issue, but this idea of now the way to be a good Republican is to own the libs, is to say angry things, to say outrageous things, to yell, right, that, to me, is - you know, as a Republican myself, it's kind of disheartening to watch, obviously, because that's not the Republican I am. But I worry that even as Trump fades, which he is, that Trumpism takes hold. At the same time, though, I don't want to be totally dark. I do think there are some signs of optimism here. And the question will be, are there members of Congress right now, which I would be in this position four days ago if I was still there, is, you know, as he -- as McCarthy starts giving concessions - and, again, look, have no doubt, he will give any concession it takes to become speaker. That's what these 20 people know. Any concession - he'll make them all chairman. It doesn't matter. Ultimately that's what he'll get to. The question is, when do the moderates or kind of the normal Republicans start to get off the band wagon. If you've declared yourself only Kevin, you have no negotiating power. If you haven't, you can start talking to Democrats about a consensus candidate or talking about a different candidate within the GOP.",

He saw our colleague, Lauren Fox. She asked him - he said he was feeling about that. That they are working to find a solution. But he didn't say whether or not he has the 218 votes that he needs. And Warren Davidson, that we were talking to earlier, who he nominated Kevin McCarthy yesterday on the floor, and even he said he doesn't ultimately think McCarthy will get to 218. SO, we'll see. Mick Mulvaney says he thinks he's going to stay in there for now. He says his resolve in strong.
