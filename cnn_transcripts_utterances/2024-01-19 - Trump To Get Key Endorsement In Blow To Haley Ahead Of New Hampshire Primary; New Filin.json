That's the big question.I do know that the Trump campaign is putting a lot of peer pressure on members of Congress as well as these former candidates. We've already seen the endorsement from Vivek Ramaswamy, Doug Burgum, and now this evening, Tim Scott. I'm surprised a little bit that he's coming out because of the way Tim Scott started his campaign. He talked about in his opening speech and the way he launched his campaign about appealing to the better angels of voters in the Republican Party, saying, let's choose victory over victimhood, let's choose greatness over grievances. I saw that as a ding towards Donald Trump and his claims of victimhood and grievances. But, clearly, he feels as though Donald Trump has the momentum.

But in answering those questions you have to establish what we call as lawyers a chain of custody. How did the firearm get into the set? Who examined the firearm? At what point did they do their specific jobs before it got to him? Was it analyzed properly? Was he told it was a cold gun, meaning and thinking it was a prop, such that he would not believe even if he pulled a trigger, which he denies doing, that it would go off? And so they'll have to prove beyond the reasonable doubt that the standard of care that he employed really deserves to be criminalized, and that's why he'd be prosecuted if a jury would conclude that that were the case.",
