Good evening.Tonight, House Republicans are under mounting pressure to move forward with a critical foreign aid bill. That's after new images out of Ukraine illustrate in stark terms what could be the reality for America suspending aid to its allies. Take a look at this, in this new video soldiers can be seen raising the Russian flag over the key city of Avdiivka after Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw there. Adding to the pressure this week, the death of Russian opposition leader and staunch Putin critic Alexey Navalny and U.S. intelligence report suggesting Russia is working on a nuclear-powered space weapon. This has President Biden slamming House Republicans for taking a two- week vacation while America's allies are running out of critical supplies in Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But House Republicans say the Senate -- the Senate's foreign aid bill is dead on arrival, refusing to pass any legislation that they say does not address border security.Of course, we should note it was House Republicans that tanked a bill providing the strictest border security measures in decades, taking their cue from former president Donald Trump who didn't want to give President Biden a, quote, \"win.\" CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is here with me now. Priscilla, the president, he's really going after House Republicans and Donald Trump on this Ukraine aid issue. It's not clear whether or not it's going to have any effect on the House GOP.

He serves on the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees. He's also a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Congressman, great to see you. Thanks so much. How much influence does Donald Trump have over whether aid gets to Ukraine? REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX): Well, Donald Trump is the Republican Party, especially in the House of Representatives. If Donald Trump says that he doesn't want a piece of legislation to pass or even to get a vote on the House floor it's obviously not going to get a vote. And that problem really is compounded because you have a very young and junior speaker who had hardly any experience in leadership. And now all of a sudden because of GOP infighting in the House, he's thrust into the main speaker's role and feels very vulnerable. And he is. He can -- there can be a motion to vacate, a motion to remove him with one person asking for it and so he's in a very vulnerable position and doesn't want to cross Donald Trump.",

There's the potential that young people, young Democrats are not going to come out in the numbers that you need them to to win in close states. So, yes, of course it's a concern. And I have said that I disagree with the way that Benjamin Netanyahu's government is prosecuting this war.At this point, Jim, you know, they're essentially beating a dead horse, so to speak. They are pulverizing a people who have already been bombarded. Hospitals have been bombarded. Ambulance convoys, people's homes, thousands and thousands of children have died, and the Netanyahu government is made up of several extremists who are pushing this policy. Benjamin Netanyahu himself has a very selfish incentives to keep the war going because it's clear from polls that the Israeli people were basically done with Benjamin Netanyahu as soon as this war is over. So he's got a very selfish incentive to keep this war going. But in the meantime, while he's doing that, people are suffering, and Israel is not gaining much from the suffering of the Palestinian people. And the greatest danger to Israel is not Hamas. Hamas obviously committed an atrocious massacre on October 7th. And I believe that they committed war crimes in what they did. At the same time, Hamas does not have a Navy. Hamas doesn't have nuclear weapons. Hamas is not the greatest military threat to Israel. The greatest military threat to Israel is to allow Benjamin Netanyahu to continue doing what he's doing, which would spark a regional war or regional conflict with states like Iran and actors like Hezbollah and the Houthis and others who basically gang up on Israel. That would also draw the United States into a larger war, and so I support a ceasefire. I support efforts at a peace agreement that brings the hostages back from Gaza to Israel, but so far you've got somebody in Benjamin Netanyahu basically has no incentive to do those things.",

You know, he's up for reelection in less than a month.And his main political opponent is out of the way, dead. And then he looks at the U.S. Congress which is continuing with a small group of people stopping it. Not to be able to give the financial help that the Ukrainians need. So at this point, I think, you know, he's -- and judging by the video that we saw a couple of days ago, he's looking pretty happy and again pretty emboldened.",

So even to do this has to -- you know, you have to have bravery to do that.
