We are waiting for the video results. They should be out in about 10 to 15 minutes. The markets and there is an enormous amount for you and I to chew over during the hour. Norway, Spain, and Ireland to recognize Palestinian statehood. They call it an important step towards peace. The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called a snap general election, July the 4th is the date, as the Tory Party seeks to defy serious headwinds. The polls suggest defeat. And you might as well call this liquid gold. It is olive oil, extra virgin olive oil. Only the best on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Well, it is up more than 40 percent, the price of olive oil in the last year. The CEO of Colavita will be with me, but then, you know, the price is up because you've seen it in your supermarket. Together, we are live. I'm in New York. It is Wednesday. It is May 22nd. I am Richard Quest. I mean business. Good day to you. We begin with Ireland's foreign minister who tells me the time is right to recognize a Palestinian State. Ireland is one of three European nations that have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Here are the two countries: Spain and Norway, the first governments in Western Europe to take this measure. The decision has sparked fury in Israel with the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying it rewards terrorists and will encourage more attacks like the one carried out by Hamas last October. Ireland's foreign minister, Micheal Martin said he believes the move will actually help speed up a two-state solution. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So, and also, we are very conscious of the efforts being made by Arab States to present the comprehensive peace framework and about 14 states will meet on Sunday, next Sunday, and other than European, to discuss the ideas that Arab States have for a peaceful resolution of this issue.

The Irish ambassador to Israel wrote, I thought a very balanced piece explaining Ireland's position. It wasn't hostility toward Israel she claimed, but in essence, a way to boost the morale of a very depressed Palestinian population.
