I still think the speaker's job should be just to be the speaker of the House and not to be the leader of a certain party. But it is important.Now, Jim Jordan is not a great communicator. He is great on FOX News because he throws out all kinds of bombs, right? I don't think he would be good with a crowd that, frankly, is in a middle unless they don't wear suit jackets also and he can relate to them on that level. And so that is going to be an interesting thing. The reason I think that Jim Jordan can unite the caucus better is not because he's any better. I think he is far worse. It's because the incentive structure is such that these eight renegades that threw out the current speaker, Kevin McCarthy, are probably going to get their way, because they are willing to go to the edge of the earth, they are willing to withhold their votes to get rid of Kevin McCarthy. The question is, are there 10 on the other side willing to play that same game, to say hell no will I ever vote for Jim Jordan. If there are, Jim Jordan will never be speaker. And we may actually get to a consensus speaker, which would be better for the country. But unless that happened, I am not convinced there are those numbers. Look at Nancy Mace. By the way, she'll be on CNN, I am sure, at some point today. She voted against Kevin McCarthy because she said he was not pro-women enough. She has to immediately today, I would assume, come out against Jim Jordan and say no chance will she ever vote for Jim Jordan. She was just on Bannon's podcast, so I doubt that happens.

So, to your point, for years, the U.S. has been unable or hasn't been carrying out regular deportations to Venezuela. That changes this week, and here's why that's important.Venezuelans make up a larger share of border crossers than they have in previous years. If you look at the numbers, just in August, for example, there was over 30,000 migrants from Venezuela who were encountered by border authorities. Now, what often happens is that they are processed by authorities and then they're released into the U.S. as they go through their immigration court proceedings. That was really one of the few options that the administration had. And in some cases, they do send them back to Mexico, and the reason is because there are over seven million people who have fled Venezuela because of economic and political turmoil there. Just to give you a bit of context on that, Phil, that outpaces the number of people who have fled Ukraine where there is an active war. So, this is a regional issue and one the administration has been grappling with at the border. And now they're making the decision that they're going to have to send some back to Venezuela or try to over the next weeks to try to make a dent in those numbers at the U.S. Southern Border.

Of those that, more than 2400 were bused to Denver specifically, city officials have asked for help from the National Guard to help with the surge.They're also shortening the length of time that individuals can stay in temporary shelters in Denver, single people, it was 21 days. Now it's 14 for families with children, the amount of time in shelters actually increased by about a week. When we're looking at where we stand at this point, the city has hundreds of migrants currently in shelters. If we take a look here, you can see the increase in just the past month.
