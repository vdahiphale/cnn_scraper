Each of them only has a couple hundred people that live there. But there's homes are vulnerable, they're low lying, and they are just taking a beating.And we were also talking to the mayor of Keaton Beach. That's actually where landfall was recorded, about 7:30, 7:45 this morning. He was looking at a live feed of the cameras there. Seven, eight feet of water at that time, and the tide was still coming in. He's been mayor there for a long time. He's lived there for a long time. He says, a lot of storms have come through this area of the Big Bend but he's never seen anything like that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The winds have died down for the time being and the rain which was pounding is now just a steady extreme drizzle, I would say. This as the hurricane, Hurricane Idalia, which is still a category 2 storm is beginning to move into Georgia. The hurricane force winds have now crossed the border into Georgia as it moves through and affects tens of thousands of more people. And even as it moves through, even as the eye has now passed or beginning to pass into Georgia, or what's left of the eye, is beginning to pass into Georgia, it's still -- there is still extreme risk for storm surge hundreds of miles away along the Gulf Coast. As the tides continue to rise, and as the winds are still blowing the water into shore, there are still areas that are seeing the storm surge get worse. Let's go to Tampa now.

So, it's a very strategic asset for the State of Florida, not just our community.And having just returned, we had hundreds of trucks staging at those terminals, literally waiting to receive fuel. They will then head back out. There is some flooding near the onramps, back onto the major arteries, I-4, the Crosstown Expressway. And as soon as those are down and there's a break in that water, I know we're going to have some higher tides in about five hours from now. But they're going to start moving fuel.

It made landfall around 8Still, a category 1 storm as it moves over areas, bringing wind into areas with trees and really, is devastating freshwater flooding. But the concern in Florida is still the storm surge along the west coast, the Gulf Coast of Florida, and especially the Big Bend. Let's talk about that. Joining me now is the senior senator from the State of Florida, Marco Rubio, who I believe is in Miami. Senator Rubio, thank you so much for being with us. What are you hearing? What updates are you getting on the situation, especially along the coast where that storm surge is? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL):  Yes. Well, first of all, I actually think the National Weather Service, the hurricane center deserves a lot of credit. You know, they've improved on their forecast every year. And I think so far, not just where it's going to hit, but the intensity of it, the ability to predict intensity, and -- I think has been excellent. They deserve that credit. I talked to the sheriff of Taylor County, you know, that's where Keaton Beach is early this morning, about 7:40, shortly after a short landfall. So, I was glad to see I could get through cell phone coverage. And, you know, at that time, they were dealing with the winds. I think the real concern that I have, obviously, and I think you're hearing from the meteorologists and the experts is not so much the eye of the storm but the sustained winds for some period of time and areas to the east of that storm and then up north where you are. I believe you're in Tallahassee where you got all of those live oaks, this huge tree canopy that's very vulnerable, that's never really been tested by a storm of this magnitude. And then you've heard a lot about the storm surge. You know -- I mean, Cedar Key is, you know, it's a -- like a historic fishing village typesetting. Keaton Beach is actually one of the most unspoiled places of our state. Those places are going to be dramatically transformed, as are a bunch of areas on this path, both because of the tree cover that they have up there. It looks more like Georgia than, you know, tropical South Florida, for example. So, we're -- this is -- we got a few more hours ahead here of wind. And the only good news, if there is any, is that, you know, we avoided sort of the worst-case scenario in Tampa Bay which is the one we're always afraid of is this -- they're still going to have storm surge there but it's not going to be the worst-case scenario.",

You know -- and people do live there, but it's every year, every couple of years, where you're seeing this devastating destructive storm surge.

It destroyed all the mobile home parks, everything that was down there back in -- the storm back in, I believe, 2018. And what's going to get rebuilt is not just going to be up to code, meaning up to modern code to withstand that kind of event. But it's going to be a lot more expensive just because the cost of building it at that level.And think about it, if you're the owner of a land that has a mobile home park, and now you can sell it to someone who is going to develop it into a million-dollar townhome, you're going to go with the million-dollar townhome offer. So, I think it changes the nature and character of these places. In fact, we talked about (INAUDIBLE), you could see the area overhead and you could literally identify which were the houses that were built up to the modern code and which ones were pre-existing and how they withstood the wind. The water event, you know, obviously, is a very different dynamic. I mean, there's only so much we can do. You can elevate a little bit. But when you're talking about seven, eight feet of storm surge, I mean, it's very tough to build against that. And especially in the Gulf of Mexico, we have very low shelf on a geologist -- a marine geologist, but it's -- I know there's a low shelf there and so the water piles up much faster. And then you've got the inland flooding, too, if you've got significant rain events. So, it's changing the character of these communities.
