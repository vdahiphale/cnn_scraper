In two hours, Congress will convene to count the electoral votes and certify Trump's remarkable return to power on this snowy, Washington day.Plus, exclusive new reporting. A confidential 2019 report that I obtained details how security in New Orleans French Quarter was hampered by, quote, politics and bickering amongst city officials. My guest is the CEO behind the firm of the 2019 troubling report. Hi, everybody. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. And you're in the CNN Newsroom. And in just a couple of hours, the House and the Senate will convene to certify the results of Donald Trump's election win. A once routine and ceremonial process, until 2021, when Trump held a rally telling his supporters to fight like hell before a mob of people stormed the capitol, trying to overturn the 2020 election. Now, Trump, in his defense, maintained that he said peacefully and patriotically march to the capitol and denied sparking the riot. And after congressional hearings and even DOJ January 6th charges, now dismissed, Trump is back in power. And House Speaker Mike Johnson says, there will be no delay in certifying the results. CNN's Jeff Zeleny joins us from West Palm Beach, Florida. Before we go to Jeff Zeleny, I want to go to Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, is stepping down as the leader of his party.

Is this the case of Trudeau jumping before he was pushed?",

He said look, I can't possibly fight what will be an incredibly difficult election campaign for a government that's almost a decade old if I have to continually fight these internal battles.Now, look, there have been a long list of scandals as well as some achievements that he outlined there. But again, so many members of his own government coming to him and saying, we don't believe that you can beat conservative leader -- conservative party leader, Pierre Poilievre, in the next election, an election that has to be held by the end of the year. And Pam, as I've been saying all morning, stop me when this sounds familiar, this really leaves his party in a tough squeeze. The polls already indicate that they are more than 20 percentage points behind, and now they're going to have this succession battle and it will be rough with a lots of different people putting their hat in the ring. In the meantime, you have President-Elect Trump coming into office. I don't have to remind you in two weeks, threatening 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods imported into the United States. It is a tall order by any stretch. He will stay to be so-called caretaker prime minister. But also parliament will not be sitting. And that'll be interesting because it means that no government business can basically get done. It's really just governing on an emergency basis, if you will. Again, a lot of moving parts here. I will add to all of this, Canada just assumed the G7 presidency at the beginning of 2025. G7 meetings supposed to happen in Alberta, Canada in June. A lot on the plate here. And the prime minister really putting a personal touch on this, saying that look, I had a discussion with my three children at dinner last night. And that's when I made the decision. Something we all know he did not want to do.",

That was a chance for Justin Trudeau to perhaps look for a lifeline from Donald Trump for his own leadership in Canada.That, of course, did not happen. Shortly after that dinner in Mar-a- Lago -- and it was not a bilateral meeting. It was not a long conversation. Justin Trudeau was seated at dinner table with about ten other people or so. So perhaps that was also a sign of just the level of -- the meeting was rushed in some respects but certainly not a long conversation about things to come. But since then, Donald Trump has been belittling and mocking the prime minister, of course the beleaguered prime minister, as well as suggesting Canada should be the 51st state of the United States. Of course, not going to happen regardless of who the prime minister is. However, this does certainly raise questions for Donald Trump as well. Will he try and involve himself in the elections in Canada? How does he deal with this caretaker government? Do the tariffs he has proposed actually go through? We shall see. There are more questions at this very moment, as is often the case here, than there are answers. [11:10:00] But two weeks from now Donald Trump, after taking the oath of office, two weeks and one hour from now, this will be his challenge and his problem as well. But for now, no question this is a very major development that certainly was not foreseen when Justin Trudeau came down here to Palm Beach just a few weeks ago, Pamela.",

Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Washington -- of Massachusetts, I should say, joins us now from Capitol Hill. You are in Washington now. You're here for this sacred day, the certifying of the election. You know, when you look back four years ago, you had been on the job just a few days when those rioters stormed the capitol. What do you remember about that day? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS, (D-MA): A devastating day for American democracy. Shattered glass, wounded Capitol Hill police officers, National Guard turning the front porch of democracy into a fortress. And four years later, it's going to be a routine ceremonial day because Democrats walked back in on January 6th, 2021 and we supported and defended the Constitution of the United States when Donald Trump refused to.",

And America demonstrated something different, and then Donald Trump marked dishonor upon that 250- year tradition.Now, I'm told that he's trying to invite world leaders and celebrities to his inauguration, but no amount of glam is going to ever remove that mark of dishonor upon what he did on that day.",

I'm confident that they do.

First he's arguing that some of the evidence that was admitted against him at the hush money trial related to the time he was president. Therefore he should have been immune from that. Therefore he's entitled to a new trial.Second of all, Trump is arguing now that I'm president-elect, I'm immune from any criminal proceedings. Now, Judge Marchand has already rejected both of those immunity arguments. But what Trump says in the brief that he just filed a few minutes ago is I'm allowed to appeal that rejection by Judge Marchand. And while I'm doing that appeal, everything else has to be stayed. Everything else has to be put on hold. So Trump's argument essentially is while I appeal the immunity issue, everything has to be put on hold, including the sentencing that's set for this Friday.",

But the trial itself is already over. All we have left here is sentencing. And there's no harm, I think the argument would be, in going ahead with this sentencing, which will probably take a few minutes by Zoom on Friday.
