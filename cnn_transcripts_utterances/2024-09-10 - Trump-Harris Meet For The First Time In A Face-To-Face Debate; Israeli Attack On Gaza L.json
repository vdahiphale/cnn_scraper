      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, it's debate night in America. KamalaHarris will meet Donald Trump face-to-face and the stakes couldn't be higher. Also ahead tonight, you are looking at a crater in the middle of a so-called safe zone  in Gaza. This was the scene of a massive Israeli strike. The IDF say they were targeting Hamas terrorists. And Ukraine hits the Moscow region with a massive drone attack. We have a live report coming up for you. But first, tonight, the stage is set in Philadelphia, in just a few hours, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will come face-to-face for the first time in a presidential debate that could help put one candidate on the path to the White House in what will be the biggest moment of Harris' political career. The Vice President is expected to target Trump on reproductive rights. The former President on his part is trying to use the debate as a springboard to complete a political comeback that seemed well, unimaginable after January the 6th. He is expected to try to portray Harris as soft on immigration as well as on crime. Our Priscilla Alvarez is in Philadelphia for the debate and joins us now. Priscilla, this is going to be critically a defining moment of the campaign. Talk about the Vice President's mindset and the strategy going on -- going into this debate.",

      "sentences": "Well, sources often describe the Vice President as someone who prepares extensively and intensively, and that'sexactly what has happened over the last several days. She was in Pittsburgh before arriving here in Philadelphia yesterday. And that was where she was with her inner group of advisors where they were preparing day-in and day-out for what is, to your point, going to be a crucial moment in this general election cycle. Now, the sources I've spoken with have said that it was a robust debate prep and part of it included identifying where they could go to former President Donald Trump, particularly on the issue, for example, of reproductive rights. The Vice President is expected to lean into that and also needle the former President on his muddled messaging on abortion. And of course, she has been a key voice on this issue, an issue, by the way, that Democrats feel has galvanized voters, and one that they think gives the momentum going into November. So, expect to hear from her on that. Now, I will also note that the campaign has been trying to get under the former President's skin here in Philadelphia through the airwaves. This week, they released two ads, one ad particularly trying or at least, highlighting former Trump administration officials warning about a second Trump term. And the other trying to make fun in a way of former President Donald Trump's obsession as the campaign says with crowd sizes. So, pair it all together and what you see is a strategy by the Harris campaign to try to throw Trump off balance before they meet on the debate stage. But once they're on there, Alex(ph), I've spoken with say that she needs to stay focused. That is going to be something that she particularly prepares for. But another close Harris ally telling me that she, the Vice President is keenly aware that part of her task tonight is to introduce herself or re-introduce herself to voters, especially those who are undecided or persuadable. And so, all of that, it makes up for a big task for the Vice President, particularly in what has been a condensed race for her, but certainly, a lot of preparation has been going into this moment, which will also be the first face-to-face encounter between the Vice President and former President Donald Trump.",

You were showing clips before of him, you know, with ways in which she would get personal with his attacks, to the extent that the Vice President thinks that's not a good look for him, then she would have to indeed, you know, bring that out. But at the same time, you don't know how he's going to react. You don't know for sure what he's going to do. So, I think that the Vice President needs to also focus on what she wants to do as her affirmative plan, not just assume Donald Trump will go one way or another way. But ask, you know, what is the way she wants to go? And that's, I think one of the big challenges from both candidates, is you have to define for yourself whether you know, former President Trump or Vice President Harris, define where you want to go, where you want to take this debate, and not depend on somebody else's reactions.",

In fact, this humanitarian area in the southern Gaza Strip, the same one was attacked back in July when the Israelis said that they identified the military leader of Hamas Mohammed Deif; he's the head of the al-Qassam Brigades, the Hamas military wing. They said they thought he was there, and they carried out strikes at that time, killing 90 people, which Palestinian health officials say, half of whom were women and children.

He said, we also need authorization to use western weapons against military targets on Russian territory. The provision of longer-range missiles and the enhancement of our air defense system.

And that first of all, of course, it gives the Russians more ballistic missiles at their disposal, but it also allows the Russians to use the ballistic missiles that they do have. Like for instance, the medium-range Iskander missiles in totally different ways. They don't have to use them in short distances anymore. They can use them to hit longer targets that are far away like for instance, the Ukrainian capital. So, in every way, Secretary of State Blinken had said that this was a big escalation on the part of the Iranians also because of course, he believes that the Iranians are going to get technology from the Russians in return. And for a very long time, the Ukrainians have said they need longer distance strike capabilities, but they also need the lifting of restrictions on the longer distance weapons that they have received from the U.S. to strike deeper into Russian territory.

In just a few hours, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are set to face-off for their firstpresidential debate, and this could be the only debate between the two candidates with less than 60 days until election day. For those of you counting. Millions across the U.S. and around the world will be watching, as will our Kristen Holmes who is in Philadelphia. Kristen, just talk us through how Trump is preparing. I heard yesterday he doesn't prepare. What are his priorities during tonight's debate? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I wouldn't say he doesn't prepare. I would say that his team doesn't really like using the word preparation, and that's because Donald Trump himself likes to say that he's already prepared. However, they are certainly getting ready for this debate. And they say that essentially everything that he does is a version of preparation. We saw last week he spoke before the New York Economic Club and took questions. He also did a town hall with voters in Pennsylvania. They say that is all part of this, quote/unquote, \"debate preparation.\" The other thing that we know is that he has time on his schedule that they call policy time or policy review sessions. And this is time he meets with various lawmakers as well as some of his top advisers, Jason Miller, Stephen Miller, who advises him on immigration and goes over the different policies and also how to pivot away from things he doesn't want to talk about. For example, he does not want to be talking about abortion. They believe that this is not going to help him politically. So, how to pivot away from topics like abortion, which they believe that Harris will bring up, and focus on other things like immigration, like crime, like the economy, all things that they believe will help Donald Trump win in November. But the big question now is how Donald Trump acts up on that stage. There's a lot of concern from his allies of how he will react to Kamala Harris. Will he be incendiary? Will he let her get underneath their skin? And one of the things that I've been told by some of his allies is they've actually instructed him not to say anything. If he has to react to make facial expressions but not to actually say anything verbally in response because they worry about him launching this kind of personal attacks that will look bad for him. So, that's the big question tonight though because Donald Trump himself, he can be as prepared as one can be and still show up on that stage and be reactionary. Something we've seen time and time again, and the only person who can control how he acts on that stage is Donald Trump himself, and that's what we'll see tonight.",
