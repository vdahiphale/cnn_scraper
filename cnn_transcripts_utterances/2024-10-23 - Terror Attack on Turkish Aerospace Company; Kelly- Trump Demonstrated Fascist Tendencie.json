So this is just one of many people who want to align themselves with Trump (ph) now, either saying he is unfit for this office or who, in some cases, are actively campaigning for Vice President Harris. And she has highlighted those individuals at her campaign. She has cut advertisements that feature them. And it has been a big part of her outreach to connecting with independent and even some Republican voters. I should point out that the Trump campaign has vehemently pushed back against the assertions made by General Kelly. Here's a statement that they said. Kelly has, quote, \"totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his president while working as chief of staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump derangement syndrome.\" I should point out though as well that these comments come as Donald Trump continues to talk about the authority of the executive branch in ways that does give some people alarm and concerns them that he is playing into authoritarian tendencies.

But sometimes these concerns about Trump's desire to be a dictator or this idea that he has a fascist attitude, they get buried by the day-to-day debates about the economy and immigration and other matters. When Trump is at rallies and he brings up a dead golfer's genitalia or when he insults Kamala Harris and uses curse words about her, those stories sometimes get a lot of attention, a lot of oxygen. And I would argue they distract from the bigger story here. The bigger story is, are there a sizable number of Americans who would prefer an autocrat, who would prefer more of a dictatorial approach? Trump is speaking to those Americans. He's speaking to that impulse. We don't know how big of an audience in America actually wants that. But that's one of the questions in this election.

This is going to be something we'll be following for you and keeping on top of the story. Salma Abdelaziz in London. Thank you so much for that update. I want to move now to the U.S. secretary of state's message to Israel in his 11th tour of this region since the October 7th attacks. Antony Blinken saying today that Israel must now turn its military success in Gaza into a strategic success and end the war after the death of Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. Blinken is now in Saudi Arabia, heading there from Israel after meeting prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials. And he's been meeting the Saudi crown prince and foreign minister today. Blinken also referenced the ongoing conflict in Lebanon, which shows no signs of easing. Israel today striking what it says are Hezbollah targets in the Lebanese city of Tyre after the IDF issued evacuation orders there. Tyre is one of Lebanon's main tourist destinations. I'm now joined this hour by Jeremy Diamond. He is in Jerusalem for us. We've got Kylie Atwood at the U.S. State Department for an update. A lot happening in the region today, Jeremy, I want to start off with you, the latest Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon. Could you give us an update? What more can you tell us about the targets?",

      "sentences": "It certainly seems like every single day, we are watching an escalation in terms of the Israeli strikesinside of Lebanon. We have seen them expand their target list, expand the areas and the cities that they are targeting. And today that expansion was related to central Tyre as the Israeli military struck what they claimed were Hezbollah targets. We know that these strikes came following an evacuation warning that the Israeli military issued on Wednesday to residents in several areas of that city. They said that anyone near Hezbollah members, its facilities or its weapons would be putting their lives at risk if they did not move. And so what we have seen today are multiple strikes in the area of Tyre. We know that the Israeli military has also said that they have now killed three Hezbollah commanders in just the last 48 hours. But it needs to be underscored as we always do, of course, that there is a significant impact on the civilian population of Lebanon as the Israeli military carries out these strikes. And what we have also been told in the last 24 hours or so is the -- an accounting of the impact on Lebanon's hospitals that has been coming as a result of these Israeli strikes. According to Youssef Bakhash, the head of the Lebanese Doctors Syndicate, at least two dozen hospitals have now been impacted by Israeli strikes in Lebanon. And five hospitals are now out of service as a result of those strikes. The Israeli military is clearly pursuing not only a military strategy in Lebanon in terms of trying to go after Hezbollah's capabilities and to diminish their military capabilities. But they are also clearly trying to bring Lebanese societal and political pressure to bear on Hezbollah as well in combination with the diplomatic efforts that we have seen being carried out by the United States. With the special envoy, Amos Hochstein, in Beirut now in recent days, to see if there is a ceasefire that can be brokered between Hezbollah and Israel but there's no question that Israel's terms for that ceasefire have hardened in recent weeks as they have been able to deal one devastating blow after the next against Hezbollah. The question is whether or not that Lebanese societal and political pressure will actually come to bear in the way that the Israelis hope and whether it will be effective on Hezbollah.",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, we already have a readout from the State Department of the secretary's meetingwith crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. And there's a few pieces that they discussed. According to the State Department, they talked about common efforts to bring about peace in the region when it comes to these ongoing conflicts. Specifically to bring an end to the conflict in Gaza, to drive forth a diplomatic resolution when it comes to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. And it also spoke about the need for lasting regional stability, indicating that they did talk about the potential for normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. But no real specifics on any of these. And that's really where the question mark comes in. They've been talking about a lot of these efforts for a while now. The question is how they turn these efforts into actual action that could bring about peace, particularly when the Israelis at this moment in time haven't demonstrated a willingness to be on the same page with the United States when it comes to specifically bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza. I want you to listen, however, to the secretary of state as he was leaving Tel Aviv after his meetings with multiple Israeli officials, including prime minister Netanyahu. He continued to drive home the message that we have heard time and time again over the last few days for the Biden administration, that this is a moment of opportunity, they believe, to bring this conflict to an end. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  But more broadly there remains, despite everything that's happened, an incredible opportunity in this region to move in a totally different direction, one that actually provides in a durable way for Israel's security, for its place in the region. A country that's integrated, working with its Arab partners, accepted by them, isolating Iran and those who are trying to disrupt and destroy people's lives. You've got an axis of resistance on the one hand. You can see a partnership for peaceful coexistence on the other hand. Saudi Arabia would be right at the heart of that and that includes potentially normalization of relations with Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But, of course, the conflict in Lebanon is directly related to it. But we also will be watching to see what U.S. officials say about the willingness of the Israelis here to actually drive forth end to both of those conflicts because we know that that has been a major impediment over the last few months. And it appears to still be one, even though the Biden administration continues to beat the pavement on this and really try and drive forth an end. The background, of course, here in the United States is that the presidential election is just two weeks away. So time is truly of the essence for these U.S. officials.",

I mean, obviously any terrorists, terrorist activities means to create terrorism, create casualties, create balance (ph). But the timing is crucial. The timing is sensitive because  just recently yesterday, the leader of the Nationalist Action Party, who is a coalition partner of Afghan (ph) government, spoke above a new Kurdish opening. Quite a daring Kurdish opening again. The countries are once again talking about a new Kurdish opening. Therefore, the political logic behind this terrorist, terrorism, it's clearly to undermine this process, to clearly to prevent the -- a political settlement of the Kurdish issue. Thus far, we don't know which group is responsible for it. Obviously for Turkiye, there is usually the usual suspects when it comes to terrorism of that nature, whether it could be the PKK or other far-right or far-left organization. Previously, Turkiye has been also very much victim of the ISIS types, radical terrorist organizations. But the picture that we are receiving from the crime scene, from the scene indicates probably it's one of these far left or the PKK or similar terms organization. But that's why we don't know the identity of the group behind it. But the political logic is the crucial one. The political logic is basically to prevent or undermine any possible opening on the Kurdish issue and any possible settlement of the Turkiye's long-standing Kurdish issue. And particularly the call for PKK to lay down arms in Turkiye is growing. Even the pro-Kurdish party is actually making similar demands. Whoever is behind this operation clearly has a very clear political goal, which is to prevent this. And that's why it's crucial, basically irrespective of this terrorist act. The result to take political steps on this front should be actually strengthen rather than weaken in order not to give into the terrorist calls and terrorist aims.",

Turkiye, it's not the first time that it's been targeted by the horrific terrorist attack unfortunately. There has been subject to such terrorist attacks for a long time. So therefore, there will be all these questions and political that will be discussed. So that will -- all this question I think will be settled soon. But most important that this stage, which is the terrorist acts but also the identity of the terrorist group, because that will tell us quite significant about the motives behind it.
