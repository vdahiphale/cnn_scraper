That case starting tomorrow. And it is a case with major ramifications for Hunter Biden who could face some real jail time if he's convicted. It could also have some political implications as the president seeks reelection in November.We are joined now by Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland. He's the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee. Congressman, thanks so much for being here with us this Sunday evening. First, I want to go back to those comments from the former president from this morning where he talked about a breaking point for some of his supporters if he is indeed given jail time or house arrest. I just first want to ask you what make of those comments. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, we've heard those kinds of comments before from Donald Trump and they have led to violence as we saw on January 6th, when nearly 150 police officers were wounded, injured, hospitalized by a mob that Donald Trump had incited an insurrection against the government in order to block the peaceful transfer of power. So obviously we have to take those kinds of threats to the rule of law seriously. I would call on Mike Johnson and any other Republican leaders out there who I know are following Donald Trump in attacking his verdict, but I would call upon them to denounce and renounce any threats of violence and to say that it is our responsibility as U.S. citizens to stand by the rule of law and not to engage in violence against law enforcement officers, police, judges, prosecutors, and others who are in the criminal justice system. It's intolerable.",

What do you say to that argument?",

Donald Trump has had every right of his respected the right to presumption of innocence, the right to testify at trial, which he didn't do. He declares his innocence right now, but he was not willing to get up on the stand and to explain why he was innocent.That was his decision, but for him to go back on it now and somehow to say he was foreclosed the possibility of testifying is ridiculous, or saying he couldn't speak. That's absurd. He had every right respected and due process and the presumption of innocence. But 12 jurors found him guilty of those offenses. And Donald Trump as president had no problem presiding over Department of Justice that put lots and lots of U.S. citizens in jail and in prison for nonviolent offenses like drug offenses, like perjury and so on, and so I don't see why there should be a different standard for him.",

It is a non-violent offense.On the other hand, you know, you have a defendant who engaged in serious crimes against the election process and continues to levy threats against the rule of law.

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, there's no mystery about what happened. Anyone who followed the activities in the report of the January 6th Select Committee understand exactly what happened also, Donald Trump was impeached each by the House of Representatives in a vote of 230 to 197, a bipartisan vote for inciting an insurrection. And then there was a 57-43 vote in the Senate to convict him.That was not enough to get to the two thirds, but you have commanding bipartisan majorities in both the house and Senate who find that he obviously did engage in insurrection against the union. You know, I think that it's too bad that the Supreme Court decided to take up the near farcical claim that a president is somehow above the law and immune to prosecution when that has not been in the understanding of our country for more than two centuries. The D.C. Circuit Court opinion, which was a bipartisan opinion written by judges appointed both by Democrats and Republicans, was magisterial and authoritative on that point. And the Supreme Court really doesn't have anything to add other than months and months of delay in this process. So that is unfortunate, but I think the country can see that this is a president who -- or former president who exhibits spectacular disrespect for the rule of law, for the justice system, and is essentially incorrigible and personal behavior. It's shocking to me that you have, you know, the remnants of a once great political party gathered around this cult of personality, a convicted felon. That's a party that doesn't even want to allow convicted felons who've done good time, who've finished probation and parole, to vote. You know, they're opposing the right of people to vote and they want this convicted felon to be able to run for president the United States, and they're supporting him to try to restore him to power, you know, after he has pardoned a whole bunch of political criminals like Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Dinesh D'Souza, you name it. And he's going around the country promising to pardon the January 6th hostages as he calls them, or political prisoners, the people who were the violent shock troops of his insurrection against the government. So it's a dangerous situation that we're in as a society right now.",

Joining us now CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid. He's also the politics and foreign policy reporter for Axios. Barak, great to have you on, on this Sunday evening. First, let's just start with this deal that the president pushed Hamas to accept on Friday saying that it was an Israeli proposal. But there is an interesting push and pull internally in Israel because Benjamin Netanyahu is presiding over this government. If he accepts anything too far to the left, the right is going to abandon him and vice versa.
