Now that Trump has been informed that he is a target of Jack Smith's investigation, what happens next? And what we've learned about those 16 fake electors in Michigan. We're going to bring you \"Tomorrow's News Tonight.\" Meanwhile, it appears that the judge in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case will not fast track the trial. So, will it happen before the 2024 election? And the one and only Geraldo Rivera will be here tonight to talk politics, his exit from Fox, and why he says he'll use his energy to keep Donald Trump from becoming president again.

And if he doesn't, then the clock starts ticking.And so, we can expect that perhaps as soon as Thursday, the grand jury could vote on an indictment of the former president. We do know, Alisyn, that there at least one other witness. Perhaps a couple of witnesses might also be going to the grand jury probably for very, very short stints. In one case, you know, we know of somebody who has been in there a couple of times, going in for a third time. So, at this point, everything seems perfunctory.

Sometimes, prosecutors will use it to stir up the case by letting people know their targets and then see what happens next. That's a technique.But in this case, the target letter is coming at the near the end of the grand jury presentation to give the target notice that, A, they're a target. OK, guess what? We all knew Donald Trump was the target of this investigation. But to give him the opportunity, having formally been notified, to come in and testify, would he come in and testify? Not likely. Even if it was his desire, I think the lawyers he has right now, including Todd Blanche, would know his history of inconsistent statements under oath that could get him in trouble. So, this is a signal that they're rounding third base. Do I think we're going to see an indictment on Thursday if he doesn't show up? No. I think, as Evan hinted, the grand jury has a little cleanup work to do towards the end in that presentation, but I think it will be similar to what we saw in the documents case.",

When you think about the different charges that Trump may face if he's indicted, almost all of them require the presence of others. You talk about 371 conspiracy to defraud the United States government. By definition, it's a conspiracy. It requires the presence of another offender.And the rest of the charges have similar -- have similar elements like that. We know from the evidence that we're all very familiar with, from the work of the January 6th Committee up through the appearances of individuals in the grand jury over the last several months, we know that these potential charges involve the -- at least the folks who are closest to Donald Trump in the lead up to January 6th and in the immediate aftermath. So, people like John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro and Rudy Giuliani and others have been mentioned. So, the idea that ultimately Trump will be indicted by himself seems highly unlikely to me, although as of today, we haven't heard about target letters landing on anybody else's desks. I would mention, however, though, the delivery of target letters is not a requirement in the Department of Justice. It's certainly not a legal requirement.
