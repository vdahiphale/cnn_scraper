      "sentences": "Well, the Big Apple tonight is now one big stage. That's tonight on a special two-hour of LAURA COATES LIVE.Well, good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates here in Washington, D.C. And, you know, you say politics, what do you normally think about? Well, where I am right now in Washington. But today, all New York was a stage for the 2024 presidential contest because both men who are currently on that ballot, they're trying to turn New York, New York, the big city of dreams, into a dream come true for them in the form of a re-election. Call it who wants to be a fundraising bajillionaire. Well, Joe Biden's campaign tonight says they are breaking records and they are doing it in style, holding a star-studded fundraiser at, where, Radio City Music Hall, an event that just ended a few moments ago. People like President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, Stephen Colbert, and plenty more were there, including big names like Lizzo, who turns out took a DNA test and found out she's 100 percent in the audience. There's even the fanciest photo booth in the history of photo booths with Annie Leibowitz manning the camera. I'm serious. This whole thing is supposed to bring in $25 million. The Trump campaign, they now want to show anything Joe can do, they can do godier, maybe glitzier, even better. They've got a planned Palm Beach fundraiser for the former president and that's supposed to rake in $33 million from the donor collection plate. Part of today's hoopla, kind of three amigos sit down with the Smart List podcast hosted by actors Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes. The Biden campaign wants to make voters feel like everything is everything, the vibes are good again. But, you know, even at this fundraiser, there is a dramatic split screen that signals that all is really not well with the Democratic base. Because outside that glitz and glammy Radio City Music Hall, a protest. Pro-Palestinian voices rallying against the president's handling of the war in Gaza. And inside too, by the way, reporters in the room where it's happening say at least four of those demonstrators have interrupted the big Biden cash bonanza. Just hours before Donald Trump delivering his own version of a contrast, his campaign says they actually want knotting together politics and solemnity. He spoke at the wake for a New York City police officer, Jonathan Diller. Jonathan Diller was murdered on Monday during a traffic stop. Guy Rivera, the accused killer, he now faces first degree murder charges. This officer leaves behind a one- year-old-child. Now Trump apparently steered entirely clear of his campaign rival, ticking to a script of sorts and focusing his outrage on the alleged assailant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  A sad event, such a horrible thing, and it's happening all too often, and we're just not going to let it happen. We just can't 21 times arrest it, this thug. We have to get back to law and order. We have to do a lot of things differently because this is not working. This is happening too often.

Trump, for the entire month of February, only raised $20 million. That's how big that $25 million is. It's a large chunk of change, a historic chunk, as the Biden campaign was hinting at. And, again, a little bit more context, how much would Trump need to sell to reach $25 million? You know, he's selling those Bibles though. God Bless the USA Bibles. He would need to sell more than 400,000 of those to reach $25 million and he would -- and those -- remember those Trump Never Surrender sneakers, he would have to sell approximately 620,657 of them. So, that's why he's looking forward to that big fundraiser next month. But simply put, this type of stuff, this gimmicky stuff ain't going to get him there, Laura.",

In fact, the only thing I could really find that would match it or exceed it is a trip to space on Virgin, $600,000. That would be the only thing that to exceed it.But, of course, Laura, what we were talking about, Trump wants to get in on the action. So, Trump has his own big fundraiser heading into August where he may, in fact, outrace Biden's big bash. He's hoping to raise $33 million, my goodness gracious. And how much for the top ticket? At this point, it's looking like $814,600. So, the fact is Biden is doing a lot tonight but Trump made you a lot come April, Laura.",

You see it in poll after poll after poll. It's the reason why he had to have Barack Obama and Bill Clinton with him on stage tonight. You look at some of the polling in states like Michigan, where his numbers with not just Arab voters are down right now, but also voters of color, particularly in the Detroit metro area and Wayne County. You look at a number of other areas in key swing states that we saw even in some of the primary turnout elections, whether it's Hennepin County in Minnesota or whether some of the counties in Texas in the results of Super Tuesday elections.

Now, the other thing I do want to say about, I don't agree with you that it's party unity to have the protesters outside. I think this is a big issue. And I think it's why, when you start looking at polling when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes into the mix, it actually hurts Joe Biden. That's because he is -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has now gone all in. He's anti-war. He's picked an anti-war candidate to run with, and that's now going to be his big platform. And I think that's going to be enough to really spoil the election should Robert F.

It's not, pretty democracy is not pretty, but it's listening to folks, it's changing your position, it's compromise. That's what Joe Biden has done his whole career. And you remember he was Vice President Biden first. I was in that White House and President Obama needed him in 2012 when he was running against Mitt Romney to come and help him, and he needed him in 2008 to help validate him because he was the young freshman senator. So this is what you do. And we needed President Clinton to be the explainer-in-chief. I mean, when -- so all of these things for President Biden. So, that's what you do and you're seeing unity. Meanwhile, most of Trump's cabinet wants -- want nothing to do with him, his former vice president. So, I just think it's really stark. He's playing golf and going to court meanwhile President Biden is going around the country and touting his agenda. That's -- those are two really stark contrasts",

It's embodiment of what voters are looking to go against right now. And that just plays right into what Donald Trump has successfully played since he came down that elevator in 2015. He has embraced the fact that he's not surrounded by a bunch of political leaders, political luminaries, whereas Joe Biden is. That's going to be the challenge for Joe Biden. He has a challenge with his base right now his enthusiasm issue gap right now with this base.

Last month, she told the Australian Financial Review, we just don't have enough science for the things that we are telling and selling women. It's one of the biggest lies that's being told about women's health today. Now, to be clear, she is not called for the banning of the procedure. But those comments do take on a new meaning, given her new venture into politics. She made those comment, says, Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos are children, a move that briefly shut down IVF clinics in the state. Joining me now, politics reporter for Politico, Brittany Gibson. She has the byline on that new report. Brittany, thank you for being here. You compiled all these comments from Shanahan.

You always hear all these crazy stories about people getting shot, people getting stabbed in New York City and they don't realize they were until moments later. So, I was freaking out. But I turned around, didn't see anyone, and I turned back around to where I was facing and I saw the assailant running away.
