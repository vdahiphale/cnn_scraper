Inside Elon Musk's growing influence on president-elect Donald Trump.Plus, the Pelosi-Biden feud hits a new messy low as the former house speaker lays the blame on President Biden. But is she revising history or not? And Stephen A. Smith on the fallout from the election where he says Republicans got it right and where Democrats got it wrong, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" So Donald Trump is not even in the White House yet. We're getting a pretty big clue about who he's trusting to help him run it. I'm talking about Elon Musk. It turns out Musk joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the day after the election. A source says that it was brief, that no policy was discussed at all, and that Zelensky thanked Musk for his support with Starlink. You know what? It did raise eyebrows that the world's richest man with billions in federal contracts and, of course, a global satellite network got to be on a call with a foreign leader at war with an American adversary. And it may not be a one off. (Inaudible) CNN that Musk has been on several calls that Trump has held, has even joined conversations about staffing decisions. By the way, those decisions, they are coming. Cabinet picks, we're told, are already being discussed, and new job at the White House could be announced as early as this weekend. So while Trump allies are battling it out in Mar-a-Lago for positions, the finger pointing in the Democratic Party is getting worse. I mean, real ugly. Nancy Pelosi is now throwing President Biden well, under the proverbial bus. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

We know up and down the ballot there were some real issues associated with the messaging going into this, but also the polling, and what the exit polls actually show versus the polls that we saw just days prior, in the election cycle. But I think that Fetterman is right. The pile off for Joe Biden is quite frankly unnecessary, and it's really disturbing for the party.For someone who has had such seismic winds, we're talking about infrastructure. We're talking about reducing the price of prescription drugs, particularly looking at insulin. We're talking about bringing the economy back, staving off a recession, hundreds of thousands of jobs at it, an economy that's the envy of the world. It is very disturbing that you would see so much of a pile on. And I'm not exactly confident that even if there had been a prolonged primary, even if that had have happened and it was entirely different candidate, let's say it wasn't Kamala Harris, that Donald J. Trump still wouldn't have been extremely competitive and might not have and it still would have won. And I say that just because in every country where you've had an incumbent presidency, the incumbent party lost, in the post pandemic era.  That is something that happened globally. It's not something that is just -- something that we've seen as instigated in the United States. So you think that that pandemic fatigue, how people saw the economy irrespective to the fact that it is doing well is a very different thing, and that is something that needs to be studied. But in addition to that, I think that a lot of the information that the Harris campaign was getting and the information the Democratic Party was getting and utilizing to develop their policy strategies and how they talked about it on the campaign trail just seemingly all fell apart.

Arguably, one of the most important jobs, well, the attorney general of the United States seems to be in the news.

He's also blocked efforts to free wrongfully convicted individuals, and he asked the Supreme Court to delay Trump's sentencing and lift the gag order in the New York hush money case. The court rejected that effort. I want to bring in someone who is quite familiar with Bailey, Democratic congressman-elect from Missouri, Wesley Bell. He is the prosecuting attorney for Saint Louis County. Well, welcome congressman-elect Bell. I have to ask you, given your familiarity in particular, is Andrew Bailey qualified to be the top law enforcement officer in this country? WESLEY BELL, MISSOURI REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT:  Well, you know, we're getting into hypotheticals and I think what's more important is the idea that elections matter and elections have consequences. And as a result, the incoming president gets to make that decision. And my guess is no matter who he chooses, it's probably not going to be my top choice. But that said, you know, I think, you know, whoever he appoints is going to be someone that's going to further his agenda.

When you look at those issues that Democrats support, reproductive rights, a living wage, expanding Medicaid, when those issues are on the ballot independently, they win.And so I think it's also about making sure that that message is heard. And I think that that's something that our party is going to have to do better do better with and look to connect with those local community issues that really matter to folks on the ground.

That's one point that you could make if you're on their side even though the economy had improved vastly, particularly in the waning months, before the election, at least according to the reports.But still in all, as I've told many, many people, and I think you can relate to what I'm about to say, Laura, when it comes to black folks and minorities in this country, you can't come to us with data. You can't come to us with percentages. You can't come to us with the fact that inflation was once as high as 9.1 percent and that it had that dipped precipitously. We're going to look at the price of gas, the price of groceries, how much it cost to go out to dinner, what's the cost of our rent, mortgage, etcetera, etcetera, and that -- and how much money we actually have in our pocket. Then that's our definition of an economy. So that's one argument that you get that you're compelled to make. The other way to look at it from an economic perspective is that from the first day that Joe Biden got in the office, he put an executive order out that essentially opened the borders and over 12 million immigrants came into this country illegally. When you have that going on and the right is making a case that it drastically affected the economy in a negative way, true or not, there are some people that's going to buy that argument. Then you have to take into account some of the things that were going on in the streets of America in terms of crime and what have you, especially when it comes to men because he got most of the male vote. What happens with that? I've told this to people on many occasions, Laura. Most men, they think about two things. They prioritize two things, providing and protecting. So that's money in your pocket, and that's keeping your yourself and your loved ones safe. And anytime that imagery goes against that, you're going to look for somebody to blame. And it's usually the incumbent administration. And that's what I think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were dealing with, and they were unable to overcome.",

And what they were doing was making the case that you want to make an argument against the MAGA right, but we can look at the extreme left.In the end, those are the fringes. The vast majority of Americans, whether you're right or your left, you're usually leaning towards the center, and that's not what they're trying to encourage folks to do. And as a result, that sort of debunked the argument against the MAGA right per se. But we also got to sit up here and think about things from a very, very practical standpoint. We can talk all day until the cows come home about things being a threat to democracy when they were talking about Donald Trump. You have to listen to the argument that the other side was making especially tonight because they won. And so why did they win? Here's why they won. When you talk about a threat to democracy as it pertains to Donald Trump, they're going to say, A, we don't want to listen to that. We don't want to hear that because you guys always say that whenever it was a Republican candidate. You said it about Reagan in the '80s. You said it about, you know, Bob Dole when he was running up against Clinton. You said it about H.W. when he was in office before, he lost to Clinton. You said it about W. And then after that, you said it about Donald Trump. So that's the argument that you're always going to make whenever it's the conservatives. That's number one. Number two, you got to take into account, Laura, Joe Biden came in and said he was going to be a transitional president. He indicated that he was just a stopgap to calm the waters after the Trump administration to pave the way for a new generation of liberals coming down the pike. They won the midterm elections. It was supposed to be a red wave that never happened. The democrats won. He was feeling himself. He said, why do I need to leave? Look at what happened under my watch as the incumbent. I'm staying. And when he stayed, all hell broke loose because everybody had anticipated that he would be a one term president. Now he was saying he had no intentions of that being the case. So people that were positioning themselves to succeed him suddenly well, it was a quandary. It was a mess within the Democratic Party. He ultimately shows up on June 27th, embarrasses himself with his performance during that debate. The Democratic Party and donors and everybody in between said, no, he has to go. Three and a half weeks later, he steps down. They hand it to Kamala Harris. She's the presumptive Democratic nominee because she's the reigning vice president. But there was no primary that he endured, and there was no primary that she endured. And Trump was able to say, look at how they bypassed the process and what have you. And they want to talk to us about democracy. Whether you agree with it or not, it wasn't a constitutional violation or anything like that. But it did seem a bit shady, not just to the right, but also evidently to independence. They took all of those things into consideration. And in the end, they said, you got your argument, they have their argument. Here's my argument. My pocketbook and the streets of America are what's concerning me right now, and that is why I'm going to make the decision that I made. And that's why they won, and they won big.",
