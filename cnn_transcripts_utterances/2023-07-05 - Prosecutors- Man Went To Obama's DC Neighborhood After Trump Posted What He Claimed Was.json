And the bag of cocaine in the White House, where it was found and what that could mean about who left it there. Good evening. We begin tonight with a picture the federal prosecutors are now painting of the man arrested last week with firearms and a man full of ammunition in the Washington neighborhood, home to many dignitaries, including former president and Mrs. Obama. The details come from a court filing urging the suspect Taylor Taranto be kept in custody, and there are chilling alleged threats against House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Democratic congressman, Jamie Raskin. Also that he allegedly live streamed a claim he had a detonator for explosives, as well as evidence he got the Obama's address from a social media post by former President Trump. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is working the story, he joins us now with more. So walk us through the timeline of what exactly the former president posted and when this guy showed up in the Obama's neighborhood and if it's connected at all?",

So Donald Trump posts a newsletter that purportedly had the address of the Obamas in their neighborhood, where they live now in Washington, DC, and then Taylor Taranto, he re-posts that and he says, \"Got them surrounded.\"And then after that, he was already on the radar of federal officials. They were already tracking him because of some other things that he was doing and saying online, but then he starts live streaming himself in their neighborhood, in Washington, DC, and the Secret Service are there because they protect the residents around the Obamas. When they encounter him, he takes off on foot. They chased him essentially into the woods, where they arrest him, and then they look in his van and that is where they find evidence that he had been living out of his van, they believe in Washington, DC for the last few months and quite a bit of weaponry as well, that was being kept in that van.",

This is a man that was on their radar because he was at the Capitol on January 6th. He carried a cane and was in a scuffle with police officers and that they had been tracking him.And then he started live streaming some really unusual things. He went to an elementary school and was live streaming about January 6, because that entrance elementary school was near a Democratic lawmaker's home in Maryland, just outside of the District of Columbia. And then he was live streaming himself trying to get access to the videos of January 6 that Speaker Kevin McCarthy had on Capitol Hill. And so he kept live streaming himself, and then finally said he had his van and he wanted to blow it up, self-detonate it outside of a federal building. That's when the Feds really started looking for him, and then the next day, he ends up in the Obama's neighborhood. COOPER: Katelyn Polantz, appreciate it. Thank you. Joining us now, CNN chief law enforcement intelligence analyst, John Miller; also CNN political analyst and \"New York Times\" senior political correspondent, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent who is now a CNN law enforcement analyst.

They can be misinterpreted as a call to physical action or harm against an individual or people associated with them. Think about the issue with Paul Pelosi. So these statements that are made, these postings, they go beyond social norms. They are actually -- you know, they have a consequence, and we know that these messages have a consequence, not just from the actions of January 6th, but in this case, as well, you have an individual who feels empowered to act and engage in some sort of conspiracy theory action, because he feels supported by online postings.

He was planning on doing all kinds of things in his final year in office, seizing control of the federal bureaucracy, making changes to it, getting the White House that he wanted in terms of staffing, and this sort of anger and undercurrent of retribution.

It subsequently tested positive for cocaine, and one thing to know here is that where this was found is on the ground floor entrance to the West Wing. This is where visitors are typically brought in to the West Wing for tours on the weekends. It's also an entrance frequently used by White House officials. I'm told that this dime-sized baggie of cocaine was actually found inside one of the cubbies where visitors are asked to put their cell phones before entering the West Wing. Those cubbies are also used by White House officials before they go into a SCIF where they can view classified information. The Situation Room in fact, Anderson, is just around the corner. Now today, the White House press secretary, she repeatedly left the impression that this could have been a visitor talking about the fact that this was a heavily trafficked and traveled area of the White House, and also noting that this is where visitors come in and out. One thing that we should note, she wouldn't rule out first of all, that this could still be a White House official. And secondly, we should note that people who come on these West Wing tours, they typically know someone in the administration, or they know someone who knows someone.

He warns that Russian troops have placed objects resembling explosives, in his words, on the roof of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant which is the largest in Europe, which Russian forces have controlled for nearly 16 months. Ukrainian military says any detonation is \"not expected to damage the power units but may create a false impression of shelling by Ukraine.\" In response, the Kremlin claims to be taking precautionary measures to counter a threat to the plant, saying sabotage the Kyiv regime is \"high\" and it could have \"catastrophic consequences.\" Meanwhile, the Ukraine's Defense Ministry says they are facing stiff resistance from Russian forces north of Bakhmut and making gains to the south of the embattled city. Tonight, we are getting more insight on the battle for Eastern Ukraine from CNN's Ben Wedeman who spoke with Russian prisoners of war. Here's his report.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): No longer on the front lines, Anton recounts how he ended up a prisoner of war. Back in Russia, he was behind bars for the third time for drugs. ANTON, RUSSIAN PRISONER OF WAR (through translator): When they put me in prison, I heard they were recruiting. WEDEMAN (voice-over): Serve six months and they pardon you, he tells me. So he signed up with Storm-Z, a unit made up of convicts, attached to the Russian Defense Ministry. After only two weeks of basic training, he was shipped off to the front lines near Bakhmut. After days of intense shelling, no food and only rainwater to drink, he heard Ukrainian troops outside his foxhole. He assumed they would execute him. ANTON (through translator): I thought that was the end, he recalls. I switched my rifle to single-shot mode and thought, I will shoot myself. But I couldn't. WEDEMAN (voice-over): This video shot by shoulders of Ukraine's 3rd Assault Brigade shows the tense moments when Anton and comrade Slavo (ph) surrendered. The Ukrainian troops told them, \"Unlike Russians, we don't kill prisoners.\" We spoke to Anton, Slavo (ph) and another soldier in a makeshift jail in Eastern Ukraine, concealing their faces and not using their real names. The Third Assault Brigade granted us access to the POWs and two of their soldiers were in the room for the interviews. The POWs will soon be transferred to Ukrainian intelligence. They didn't appear to be under duress and agreed to share their stories. Slavo (ph) also serving time for drugs said conditions in the trenches were grim. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, RUSSIAN PRISONER OF WAR (through translator): Food was scarce. We didn't have medical kits, he says. His commanders took all the painkillers to get high, he recalled. And as a result, issued non-sensical orders. Morale was terrible. WEDEMAN (voice-over): Sergei (ph) was wounded by a grenade before surrendering to Ukrainian troops. He was a contract solider, not a convict. He completed his six-month contract in Kherson and went home. [20:50:00] But when he hesitated to sign another contract, a military prosecutor gave him a choice, \"Prison or back to the front.\" He ended up outside Bakhmut. Under constant Ukrainian fire, discipline collapsed, the officers fled, all illusions were shattered. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, RUSSIAN PRISONER OF WAR (through translator): It was very different from what I saw on TV, a parallel reality says Sergei (ph). I felt fear, pain, and disappointment in my commanders. WEDEMAN (voice-over): A law passed last year in Russia imposed sentences of three years to ten years for soldiers who surrender voluntarily. If he returns home in a prisoner exchange, Anton may end up again back in a Russian prison. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He signed a six-month contract, but because he was captured, his time in captivity in Ukraine won't be counted, and therefore, in the unlikely event that he will be offered over in an exchange, and in fact, the Russians really don't even want these convicts back. They want real soldiers back. If he goes back in an exchange, he'll be sent right back to the front lines because he hasn't finished his contract. So, my impression when we spoke to these men was that they were actually relieved, A, to be off the front line and, B, to be somewhere where at least they know that they're not going to be sent right back into what's commonly known as the meat grinder of Bakhmut, Anderson.",
