Right now, military leaders at Camp Pendleton are convening to review evidence in that case. CNN's Josh Campbell is following the story. And, Josh, goodness, the age of this girl, the details, on base for two weeks. Walk us through the possible charges and what we're expecting from today's hearing.",

Now, the U.S. military obviously has its own judicial system and this unidentified Marine has been charged under the code pertaining to rape and sexual assault of a child.As we look at those charges, we're talking about three counts of sexual assault of a child who has attained the age of 12 years old. Now, I won't go into the specific graphic details that were in this charging document but suffice to say it is graphic, indeed. It's worth pointing out that if this Marine is actually convicted, he faces potentially 90 years in prison.",

About two weeks passed. It's unclear what the nature of the relationship was between this young girl and the Marine, whether it was romantic, whether this was a trafficking situation. But this alleged conduct took place on June 27th. And the next day, June 28th, this 14-year-old is discovered inside the barracks at Camp Pendleton. Days later, that suspect is charged. As you mentioned, Jim, at this hour, this command group in Camp Pendleton is meeting to determine whether this suspect will actually be court-martialed. As we wait to see what happens there, it's worth pointing out that there are still very serious questions for the U.S. Marine Corps. Jim, you've been on numerous military installations. There are checkpoints. There are roving sentries patrolling the area. So still a major question, how did a 14-year-old girl get into the military barracks? A very serious situation.",

He wouldn't get into the details of what that condition actually is.But it's hugely significant that an American, who is detained in a Russian prison camp, was able to speak on the phone with the secretary of state. Of course, we have been told according to a source familiar with that call this is the second time that they have had a conversation. But it comes at this pivotal moment when Paul Whelan has been wrongfully detained for more than four years. And of course, the U.S. continues to try and push for his release. We're told that the primary messages from the secretary of state were twofold. First of all, to keep the faith and also that the U.S. government is doing everything that they can to secure Whelan's release. Now, his brother, David Whelan, was able to speak to Paul about that phone call, said it was a long and frank conversation. And here's what he said about the message that that phone call sent to the family and also to the Russians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But of course, U.S. officials are saying that is still a live offer. They still want Russia to pursue that offer they put on the table. But as you know, Jim, it's only gotten more complicated since they offered that to the Russians, given that Evan Gershkovich, another American, that \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, was also wrongfully detained in March of last year. So U.S. officials are working to secure the release of both of those Americans in Russia right now.",

The bill that LGBTQ organizations have said they're most concerned about is House bill 808, which effectively bans all gender-affirming care for minors, even if they have parental consent. So we're talking about surgical procedures, puberty blockers and hormone therapy. There are some limited, and we're talking extremely limited exceptions for children who may have certain disorders as well as children who began care before August 1st with parental consent and a doctor who deems it medically necessary for them to continue. Republicans have said they are, quote, \"allowing the state to take a cautious approach by limiting access to what they call life-altering procedures.\" But look, Democrats and LGBTQ organizations have called the legislation cruel and unnecessary. They cited suicide and mental health statistics. And we should point out that these types of care do vary by the age and goals of the recipient. And they're considered the standard of care by many mainstream medical organizations. Now, sponsors of the bill H.B.-574, that bans transgender athletes from playing girls' and women's sports. We are talking about the middle school, high school, and college level sports. Look, those sponsors say that they are, quote, \"protecting girls and women, that they are leveling the playing field.\" But look, Democrats and LGBT organizations again say that this is singling out a tiny fraction of the population. And as one lawmaker said, using a sledgehammer when a scalpel is probably more appropriate. One Democratic lawmaker pointed out that since 2019, the North Carolina High School Athletic Association has only approved two transgender girls to play in high school sports across the entire state. They say that it's simply singling out already vulnerable children. The third bit of legislation, S.B.-479, is a bit more expansive. It's called according to the right, the sponsors there, the Parents' Bill of Rights. Organizations have noted it's still going to likely disproportionately affect LGBTQ kids and their families. It requires parents to be notified if there's any pronoun or name changes. It also bans instruction on gender identity, sexual activity or sexuality from kindergarten through fourth grade -- Jim?",

And you know this is such a rural area, this is part of the Northwest Territories of Canada.So when you tell someone to evacuate, there's really not a lot of choices on how to get out. A lot of the locations, the fire is on both sides of the road. So people are having trouble. It is a terrifying situation. And all of that smoke not only extremely dangerous for the folks in Canada but it is coming down into the U.S., like we've seen periodically throughout the summer with other fires. So here is Yellowknife. And you can see from the satellite imagery, and you've been showing that as well, all of the smoke. Poor air quality all over portions around the fire, which is in extreme northern sections. And then just falling down to the south into the U.S. And so that's where we see those air quality alerts for portions of Minnesota. Here's Yellowknife right there. And you can see all of the fires burning around. So you can see how people could get trapped in that region and trying to find a way out because we have so many fires. And more fires are igniting by the day. We are going to see rounds of rain, wind around this region. So the rain definitely helps. If there are lightning strikes, that doesn't help. And of course, the wind is something that is not going to be in favor for the firefighters as well.

So as the new school year gets under way and we head into fall, public health officials say it's time to focus on these viruses again.CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, joins us now. Sanjay, let's start with Covid-19. It seems like we all know someone who has it right now. Where do things stand? What are hospitalizations like/ DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, first of all, just with regard to the number of cases out there, it's hard to know because there's not a lot of testing that's going on, Boris. And testing is not being required to be reported either. So it's harder to get a sense of the overall levels. They do wastewater sort of analysis around the country to get a sort of picture of the country more broadly. And that map gives you some idea. The dark ones are where there have been increases in the amount of wastewater samples. More Covid in the bright orange. Green is where it has gone down in some places. And yellow has more plateaued or sort of leveled. So most of the country, a lot of the country has seen an increase overall in the amount of Covid. But to your question, actually looking at hospital admissions, this is sort of a map, a trend line over the past several months, a couple of years, in fact, on how things have looked. And compared to, for example, August of last year, while we go up, we are about a quarter of where we were last year. So some good news, bad news. Bad news, it's going up. The good news is it's starting from a much lower level overall. So got to keep an eye on it.

For flu, before Halloween is when you should think about getting your vaccines. Covid, a new Covid booster is expected sometime probably near the end of September. That new booster will better target some of the more dominant strains. The most dominant strain is known as EG-5. This booster doesn't specifically target that but it targets another strain, which is pretty similar, so it should offer you some protection. With regard to RSV, if you're high risk for some reason, you have to talk to your doctor about that. But there's certain populations for which RSV is going to be recommended specifically to people who are high risk, for example, because of age or because of some preexisting condition.
