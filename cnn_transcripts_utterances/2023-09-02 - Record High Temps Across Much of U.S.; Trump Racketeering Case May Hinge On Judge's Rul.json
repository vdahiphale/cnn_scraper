This year, drivers hitting the road to celebrate will have to deal with the highest gas prices in years. The previous record for gas during the week leading up to Labor Daywas set in 2012 at $3.84 a gallon, according to a CNN review of data going back to 1990. Curb prices are just shy of that at $3.83 as of Thursday, according to AAA. Meanwhile we're also seeing record numbers in air travel. The TSA expects 14 million people will travel through its airports this holiday. CNN's Pete Muntean looks at the millions of Americans hitting the road and the skies this holiday weekend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is a climatic end to a record breaking summer of travel with a new survey saying more than half of all Americans expect to travel for Labor Day. At Chicago O'Hare, officials are bracing for a 7 percent increase in passengers compared to the holiday weekend last year. The TSA says after this weekend, the summer will set a new air travel record with more than 227 million people screened at airports since Memorial Day. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says flight cancelations are going down. But the latest numbers from FlightAware show it is delays that have increased.

And I would argue, going back to the case of McConnell, that senator McConnell, the concern there is that he might be impaired in his ability to do the job. It's not that he's 81. The other problem with age cut-offs is that they feed ageism, negative stereotypes against all older people. So and it's really a problem in this society. We know that there's lots of evidence. So in 2014 there was a poll of recent retirees. Over half felt forced out of their job or mostly so. In 2020, they surveyed individuals who were 50 to 80 and 82 percent of them faced ageism in daily life. So if we start to point to age, which is really a marker of something else, then there will be negative effects in terms of impacts on attitudes toward older adults.

France's president is making no apologies for banning certain types of Muslim dress during the upcoming school year. The latest ban targets abayas, a long, robelike garment. Despite sharp criticism over the decision, President Emmanuel Macron Friday reaffirmed that abayas and other religious symbols would not be allowed in France's schools. And he said teachers would have additional help to enforce the new rules. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): In the most difficult high schools, special staff will be seconded to work alongside head teachers and teachers to support them and to engage in the necessary dialogue with families and pupils. But we won't let anything get past us. At the start of the new school year, I'm going to be frank with you, we know that there will be cases, because we know that there will be, some through negligence, perhaps, but many to try to defy the republican system. We must be uncompromising. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The history of coups around the world is that the military, once it takes power, is very reluctant to give it back up. So while the opposition cheered the overthrow of the Bongo dynasty, which has been going on for more than 50 years, now they're a little dubious after hearing this televised address. Here's the way the televised address went as General Nguema went to the public. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. BRICE OLIGUI NGUEMA (through translator): The dissolution of the institutions of the republic is temporary. The aim is to reorganize them, to make them more democratic tools, more in line with international standards in terms of the respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law. But also in the fight against corruption, which has become commonplace in our country, money laundering and above all, the preservation of the environment, which is a battle dear to our country.

It's a curious choice since Mongolia is mostly Buddhist and has very few Catholics. Two dozen Catholics from neighboring China were there to greet him. Pope Francis is in Mongolia until Monday. Joining us is senior Vatican analyst John Allen. John, there seems to be a lot more to the pope's agenda than just Mongolia itself. Why would he travel some 5,000 miles to visit fewer than 1,500 Catholics? JOHN ALLEN, CNN SR. VATICAN ANALYST: This trip is probably going to set a new record for the country with the fewest Catholics than any pope has ever visited. The conventional estimate is about 1,450. He can actually shake every Catholic's hand in the country before he is done. Why Mongolia? Because in part this is simply the apotheosis of one of the hallmarks of the Francis papacy, which is the outreach to the peripheries. This is a pope who generally bypasses the established centers of power and wants to reach out to those forgotten, neglected and marginalized places on the globe and try to give them a moment in the sun. But that said, Kim, we also should not forget that, although Mongolia is a tremendously sparsely populated place of around 3 million people, it nevertheless is nestled cheek by jowl with two superpowers, China and Russia. Given particularly the conflict in Ukraine, obviously this trip gives him the opportunity to address those two giants.",
