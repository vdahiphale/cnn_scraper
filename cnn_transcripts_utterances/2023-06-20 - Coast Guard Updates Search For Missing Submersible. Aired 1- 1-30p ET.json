They definitely have some challenges ahead of them.Some of the key items I want to tick through here from the briefing, which is now just now beginning to wrap up, they called it a unique operation, as you were saying, a challenging operation. Some of the headlines here, about 40 hours of breathable oxygen that is left on board that submersible, just 40 hours. And when I asked Captain Frederick here, I said, even if you were able to get the necessary equipment to pull that submarine out of the water at this time, if you had it right there on the surface, would 40 hours be enough to conduct that type of rescue operation? And he said he couldn't answer that question at this time. Also, Brianna, he had indicated that the Deep Energy vessel has what is called an ROV unit that is currently right now conducting a search in the area where the submersible went down. ROV unit, that's a remotely operated vehicle that's operated, again, remotely. Think of it as some sort of a mechanical underwater vehicle that can be operated where they can search in the area. It has a camera on board, so it can try to see what it can, again, in the immediate area where the submersible went down and where the ship lost contact with it. But, again, very sobering to hear that just now at this point, some 40 hours of oxygen left. And, repeatedly, the question was asked, I know that you have got assets that are on their way, in some cases, still 48 hours-plus away from the area, the types of -- the types of assets that would be needed to lift a submersible at great depths up from that, from those great depths, to the surface, still hours and hours away, and at this point, just 40 hours of breathable oxygen that is left. One final point I also want to bring up here is that they have indicated that, at some point later on today, they're going to be releasing a graphic of a grid of the search area that they that they have done in this remote area of the Atlantic to show specifically where the air units have been searching, where the vessels at sea level have been searching to try to get sort of -- some sort of a grid together to give us a visual of that. But now just getting all these updates now from this Coast Guard, which is -- Coast Guard briefing, which has now just wrapped up -- Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Yes.So, Jason, let's talk about what is there and what's on the way. You mentioned, obviously, that Deep Energy ship, which has the camera capability. There are sonar buoys that have been set up as they're looking for something. We know that, in general, the U.S. and the Canadian Coast Guard are involved here. And there have been these reconnaissance aircraft that are flying over trying to find something. But, again, the conditions are very difficult. It sounds like, this evening, they may be getting some more Canadian Coast Guard vessels in the area. But it's sort of difficult to determine what the capabilities will be and how that's really going to help them further the search here.",

Today, it's looking a little better, winds at five to six -- winds are at a point where they say it's manageable at this point.",

They have got C-130s that are in the air, searching on the off- chance that this submersible has surfaced and is in the area.But, once again, the thing that really struck many of us here is that 40-hour-or-so window now that they're looking at, because this is what these five people on board have left to breathe, just 40 hours, assets still heading into the area. Again, you have got that ROV that's right now in the area searching beneath the water where the submersible went down. But, again, now they're just looking at about 40 hours of breathable air -- Brianna.",

They wouldn't be searching if they didn't think there was some chance here at some sort of rescue.So, hopefully, we're going to maybe hear some signs of progress as we continue to monitor this story.
