I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, and we're following breaking news overseas.Iran's president Ebrahim Raisi has been involved in a helicopter crash in a remote part of the country. That crash happening early this morning after the president and other officials attended a ceremony for the opening of a new dam near the border with Azerbaijan. Raisi's condition is unknown and rescuers are having a very difficult time reaching the site of that crash because of heavy fog and bad weather. And you can see now it's very dark there. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is tracking this story closely and joins us now with the latest. Nic, now some 12 hours later, what do we know?",

They said just a couple of hours ago that they had a signal from the helicopter. They got a cell phone signal picked up from the helicopter as well that they knew where it was.But now we understand from their head of Iran's Red Crescent, their equivalent of the Red Cross, they don't know. Rescue workers do not know at this time whereabouts the helicopter is. The government and the president of the country are calling on people to pray. The supreme leader rather calling on people to pray for the president at this time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Iran's government asked people to pray for their president. So they did. For hours, faith and the hope he survived a mountainous helicopter crash. All the country had to cling on to. Hours earlier, he was aboard a government helicopter on the way to open a dam in Iran's far northwest. It was a big deal, on the border with Azerbaijan he met that country's president. But within hours, Raisi's helicopter carrying him, Iran's foreign minister and other top officials back from the dam had crashed in dense fog, according to Iranian state news. A frantic search and rescue was launched. Ambulances rushed to the area, medics and mountain climbers searching for direction in the dense fog of the East Azerbaijan Province mountains. The weather conditions in the rugged, remote region too dangerous to use helicopters. The head of Iran's armed forces ordered the mobilization of all facilities and equipment to assist in the search. Army, police, even the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard. As the search continued, Iran's supreme leader telling the country the government has the situation under control. ALI KHAMENEI, SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN (through translator): Be assured that there will be no disruption in the country's affairs. The government authorities since they have learned about the incident this afternoon have been working hard and hopefully everything will be fine.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. President Joe Biden was briefed in the hour or hours right after this happened, according to the White House press secretary. But at this point that's all the White House will say simply that he was briefed. We haven't seen a public statement from Biden. We also haven't seen a public payment from Jake Sullivan, who is in the region having just met with the Saudis and then the Israelis.But that's not a surprise, and there are a number of reasons for that. First, the U.S. is trying to figure out exactly what happened here. As Nic pointed out, this is in a very remote region, so it's difficult to get information and much of that information will come directly from Iran or Iranian state media. Second, of course the U.S. trying to keep its distance, no reason to weigh in at this point, especially when you have so little information. So the U.S. is closely monitoring. But, again, at arm's length here. It is worth noting simply the situation in the Middle East. Iranian proxies have since the beginning of the Gaza war, carried out scores of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. Those have stopped with the past couple of months, but the U.S. knows that's a lever that Iran can turn on and off. And that of course is under Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's hardline government. He replaced Hassan Rouhani, who was viewed as much more of a moderate. So the U.S. has seen not only the crackdown on protesters, the carrying out of executions that Nic talked about when Raisi was head of the judiciary, but also the continuation of the hardline policies. He was also viewed as one of the potential successors for the current supreme leader. Now the only person who's viewed as a likely successor is the supreme leader's son. So that's another dynamic that the U.S. is watching very closely here. The Middle East, we have seen it's already de-stable enough, so they'll ultimately be looking for the possible spiderweb effects of this and whether that leads to more destabilization in the Middle East. A lot to watch here, but for now the U.S. is much more in an information gathering mode than trying to get out front of this at this point.",

You normally would want to have them go in separate helicopters.This was a big event evidently in Azerbaijan. They were dedicating a dam and so the president and the foreign minister went up there together. They probably decided to ride together in the helicopter, which was a mistake and now as a result of that, very frankly, Iran and the world really don't know whether or not the president and the foreign minister are still alive. DEAN: And it's been interesting to see how state media has handled this. They've been trying to give information, but it is state media and it's a question of how transparent they can actually be or they actually want to be.

But it's clear that the supreme leader is sending a very clear message that he's still in charge.The hardliners will remain in charge. There's no question in my mind.

And that is an imperative for him if he is to look to reel that coalition that helped propel him to the White House four years ago. And certainly at Morehouse, one of the key backdrops to his speech there was the conflict in the Middle East. There was some contention on campus before his arrival amongst students and among faculty who are displeased at how his handling that conflict and there was some question of whether his speech would be interrupted in protest.

Colonel, great to see you. It seems pretty obvious here that they are dealing with some pretty difficult weather and that weather could have been a factor in all of this. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Absolutely, Jessica. And one of the things when you look at the crash site right here, you notice, first of all that it's extremely mountainous, but when there's a weather front that comes through a place like this. It actually has a major impact because what it's doing is it's creating all kinds of conditions. The elevation is high. That means the temperature is low and it could mean everything from fog to sleet, to even possibly a snowfall in certain areas with the highest elevations.
