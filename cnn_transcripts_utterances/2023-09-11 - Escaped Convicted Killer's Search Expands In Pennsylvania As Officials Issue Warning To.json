At any moment law enforcement officials in Chester County, Pennsylvania are gonna give us an update on the manhunt for 34-year-old Danelo Cavalcante now in its 12th day. The operation has gotten a lot harder, expanding miles beyond the location that police have been focusing on because the five-foot-tall fugitive was spotted more than 20 miles away from the search area and take a look. He looks different. A doorbell camera showing him clean-shaven and in a green hoodie. Over the weekend Pennsylvania State Police said the escape murderer stole a delivery van and tried to make contact with acquaintances, people that he knows in the area. CNN's Danny Freeman is live for us in Chester County following all of this. So, Danny, do we know how Cavalcante was able to get past officers?",

I want to give you some context and I should note by the way we're of course waiting for that press conference expected to begin any moment, so I understand if you have to dip out. But just for some context here back on Friday we had the largest law enforcement presence just a few miles away in that main perimeter that police had been holding for the better part of two weeks and that was the spot that Cavalcante was able to slip out of. There were almost 400 officers out there. We saw troopers looking inthe back seats of cars, looking in trunks. That was the environment that Cavalcante was able to escape from. Here's a little bit more about what we learned yesterday specifically about this. He slipped the perimeter probably sometime on Saturday and then he stole a van from a nearby dairy farm and the reason he was able to steal that van was because the keys were in the car at the time. Then he drove a little more than 20 miles north of the perimeter, also north of the Chester County Prison where he escaped from, to the Phoenixville area. There we know that he tried to get in contact with a couple of associates that he had known before. Those associates did not help him at all. That's what he was looking for. He was looking for help. But because of those associates, because he tried to reach out, we got a glimpse of him on a ring doorbell camera and that's where you see the new images of Cavalcante, clean shaven, now wearing a green or yellowish hoodie that by the way, law enforcement says he got at that dairy farm where he also swiped the van. So that was the last sighting that we know of back on Saturday evening when that ring camera was taken. Then we learned that on Sunday morning, law enforcement officials, they actually found that van outside of the Phoenixville area. But Cavalcante was nowhere to be found --",

So, in the beginning, we were prepping here for the short game. We had a tactical response prepared in a certain area and while that response was being prepared, we had a group of investigators from the U.S. Marshals Service here, some of the brightest minds in the agency, having a contingency plan of what we were going to do, should he break perimeter or if he was outside that perimeter. So, we had proactively planned for this and I would say, you know, we have our pre-operational planning set, our tactical resources, our technical resources were all brought here and now we're planning for the long game. The search in the woods was to Cavalcante's advantage. He was in an eight square mile area that was very difficult terrain, that was very difficult to get to and there were some weaknesses in the perimeter. I think the incident command here was great setting up the perimeter, bringing in the resources and doing the absolute best we could. We had, I think, over 200 law enforcement officers in or around that perimeter but now we're going to prepare for the long game and the long game is what we do best, the U.S. Marshals Service, like the colonel said, does fugitive investigations every day. This is a manhunt and all that means to us is that it's a longer fugitive investigation with more resources, so we are prepared. (CROSSTALK)",

Some of those same challenges, some of those lessons learned from freeing have made us better as an agency. And we've taken those lessons and we adapt those here. There have been a number of searches between freeing and now. And again, we learn something from each one of those. We'll learn things from this search.

You know, Marshall mentioned, and I've alluded to them before, about the challenges in there. It is a unique place to search and really takes a lot of resources.You know, when some of those sightings occurred in there, we had skilled tactical teams in there from multiple agencies.

State police saying that the investigation has now shifted with state and federal partners bringing in additional resources, adjusting to what is needed.Officials saying, they believe he is still in Pennsylvania because he does not have the resources to get out of the state. In fact, officials were saying they believe he is still in Chester County, though there is no defined search area as of this moment. A couple of important nuggets from that press conference to point out. Officials believe Cavalcante has now reached out to several people looking for assistance. They say he's desperate and needs help. In fact, this image was taken from a doorbell camera over the weekend. You can see he changed his appearance there. This is one of at least two instances in which this escaped killer has tried to seek help from people. Officials in Pennsylvania warning anyone who might assist him, saying that those who may be aiding him will be prosecuted fully, but if you choose to cooperate with the investigation, you could be in line for a reward up to $25,000 in assistance and reward money for finding this convicted killer. Also notably, Cavalcante, his sister has been arrested and is now in deportation proceedings. Officials saying that she was refusing to cooperate with the investigation. They also feared that she might help her brother in this attempted escape. Let's get some perspective now from CNN law enforcement analyst Charles Ramsey. He's a former police commissioner in Philadelphia, not far from the area where this search is ongoing. Chief Ramsey, you've been listening to this press briefing. What most stands out to you now in the 12th day of this search?",

But it's not as if troopers are standing shoulder to shoulder.I mean, you know, there are going to be some gaps there. There are going to be some weaknesses. And unfortunately, he was able to exploit a weakness and at least escape that particular area, find transportation, and then go to an area that he was familiar with, with people who he knew trying to get help. He is desperate. He does need help. He needs transportation once again. And so, -- the warning that the colonel gave around making sure your vehicle is secure and all those kinds of things is very, very important because this guy needs to get out of the area. And the only way he can do that is if he can secure transportation.",
