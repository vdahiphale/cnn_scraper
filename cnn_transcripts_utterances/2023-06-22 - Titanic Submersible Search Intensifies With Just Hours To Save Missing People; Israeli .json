But they are the only indication of possible signs of life, maybe from the vessel, which has been missing now for almost four days. A deep sea French robot has been rushed to the safe. The Victor 6000 is one of the few vessels capable of operating at a depth of 20,000 feet. The Titan was heading for the wreckage of the Titanic, lying on the ocean floor 12,500 feet down. The victim 6,000 is remotely controlled. And while it's not able to lift the Titan to the surface, it could hook a cable from his own support ship and pull the submersible to safety. Contact with the Titan was lost early Sunday, less than two hours into its descent to the wreck of the Titanic. Each trip begins with 96 hours of oxygen, meaning a key deadline for finding this up is now just hours away. More details down from CNN Miguel Marquez. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAPT.

The likes of which I've heard from commanders they haven't seen since the days that they were operating deeper inside Lebanon or definitely inside the Gaza Strip. These aren't the types of rocks or bomb, sorry, that you would expect to see in the West Bank. And I'll just give you another example of how things have escalated. On that day in when the IDF was operating in Jenin, they had to put up a helicopter, a gunship to provide some cover for those soldiers and the gunship was shooting off flares. Now, you know, John, why do you shoot off flares because someone on the ground might be shooting a heat seeking missile at you. So that means that the Air Force is concerned that Palestinians in Jenin might have heat seeking missiles. This is a significant escalation, and Israel is going to have to crack down. We saw as you mentioned the targeted killing on Wednesday nights by a drone of that car with the Islamic Jihad terrorists. Also near Jeanine, they have just carried out a shooting attack. I don't know that we're at a third intifada yet. Let's remember. And you know, this, John, the Second Intifada was an institutional operation, it included the security forces of the Palestinian Authority. This is still just terrorist groups. I don't want to say just but that's -- that's who's operating. It's not the Palestinian Authority itself.
