BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Boris, it's people. It's people both in those countries damming the Volga River, which feeds most of the water into the Caspian Sea that runs through Russia -- Russia has put up dozens of dams there. There's a lot of overuse. But the underlying culprit that really seems to be out of control is global warming, climate change, that is making inland seas much harder to maintain a consistent water cycle. The Caspian has gone up and down over the eons as everyone has warmed and cooled. But right now, it's happening faster than ever before. The 4,000-mile coastline has receded, the lake levels have dropped by about five feet, and you look at the trends, it's getting worse and worse. And this is going to create sort of resource stress in a place that depends on this water, for drinking, farming and every other use you can imagine there in five different countries. But it casts a light on sharing resources in the age of climate change and they're becoming more scarce.",

And what you get there is not much new information about what happened. But what really punches through is what it was like in the stands, right? We've seen the video from behind the building where the gunman crawled up, where people are pointing him out and saying he has a rifle and alerting the police. But we've never gotten this sense from audio as to the level of fear, panic and sheer anxiety that was going on in the stands. Because what they couldn't see that others had is they didn't know where the shots came from. They didn't know what had just happened. They knew people were wounded. But if you listen to those 911 operators, because they're getting a lot of calls, and it's Butler County, there aren't a lot of 911 call takers. They're trying to triage the call by saying, are you with somebody who was hurt? Where is that person? And if not, they're just telling the callers, we're aware of the situation, police are taking care of it, and then trying very quickly to move to that next call.",
