Adams tweeting about the video of Tyre Nichols as someone who spent decades fighting for police diversity and against police abuse. He said, \"I feel betrayed.\" So the mayor, Eric Adams, joins me now. He spent more than 20 years in the NYPD and was a co-founder of an advocacy group that speaks out against police brutality. Mayor, good morning to you. Thank you for appearing. You're the perfect person to talk about these issues. So my first question, how did things go so horribly wrong in Memphis? MAYOR ERIC ADAMS, (D) NEW YORK CITY:  I think of things when wrong. It was clear that no one was there with a level head and really control the situation in the scene. We know policing is a very high-anxiety form of public protection but those officers lost control and they showed the level of abuse that is a really betrayal to those who wear the uniform every day and serve the job of public protection.",

Those officers I believe betrayed that when all of us attempted to diversify departments. But we're going to stay focused. We're going to keep moving forward. Diversity still is the key.
