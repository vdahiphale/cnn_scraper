The next is graduation. The facility has to be cleared relatively soon just to get the graduation set up and stabilized. Lots of parents want to come. Most of the students are not involved with any of this whatsoever.And I think that at least from Columbia's viewpoint, and I've talked to people at Columbia, I work with people who are working with Columbia, from Columbia's viewpoint, the escalation yesterday unless stopped and in other words entering the building unless stopped decisively in their mind would have just continued to other buildings. So the most important part that my takeaway and my nervousness earlier in the evening was of course whatever you think about the politics of this, these are students, they are young people, and that no one got hurt is the most important thing. We can figure out their motivations and whether they are from the university or not. But it seems like the police came in, they first wanted to de- escalate. They told people to disperse. They gave students what we would call off-ramps, to leave without arrest. And then those who wanted to or to stay or to be arrested were done so. So I look at it this now, then a little bit differently than I did four hours ago. And I think that's important to remember. These are these are -- John, we live in a world of like, you know, could it have gone, you know, what could have gone horribly wrong, and we're not seeing that yet. VAUSE: Yes.

So I want to be careful here. I mean, one is clearly there are outsiders and schools. All schools and universities have spent a lot of time advising them, which you've got to get the access control to these universities.There can be controlled, access to buildings, access to common areas. On the other hand, just to make clear, we delude ourselves if we think that this is just like outside agitators or naive people. The students are reflecting a very strong sentiment not just in the United States, but throughout the world. They are -- we may not agree with them. They are committed, they're allowed to protest, they are not allowed to trespass or to damage property. And I think as we look at the weeks ahead until graduation, which is essentially, you know, colleges and universities are just buying time until summer, right, when the students actually have to vacate, is to still allow for that peaceful protests. I think what we've seen is like it backfired significantly, when we don't give an outlet for these protests, whatever your politics are.

Judge Juan Merchan handed down a $9,000 fine for nine violations, the maximum allowed by law. $1,000 each if you can't do the math. Trump later criticized the punishment after the court and called the gag order unconstitutional. He likely faces more fines when the case resumes Thursday. CNN's Paula Reid has more now reporting in from New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jurors in the hush money case against former president Trump heard from a lawyer who represented two women who allegedly had affairs with him while he was married. Keith Davidson represented both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. He explained to the jury how he sought deals with the \"National Enquirer\" for both of his clients.

Davidson and McDougal were in conversation with ABC News about sharing her story, he testified, but McDougal did not want to tell her story and prefer the deal with the \"National Enquirer,\" which would have kept her story from the public.At one point while Davidson and Howard were negotiating, Davidson wrote, throw in an ambassadorship for me. I'm thinking Isle of Man? He said that text was a joke about Trump's presidential run. That somehow, if Karen did this deal for AMI, the publisher of the \"National Enquirer,\" that it would help Donald Trump's candidacy. Davidson said he received a hefty 45 percent of McDougal's $150,000 deal. Earlier in the day, prosecutors questioned other witnesses like Michael Cohen's former banker, Gary Farro, who provided details about a different hush money payment that was made to Stormy Daniels by Michael Cohen.

The judge ruled Trump violated the gag order nine times and charged him $1,000 per violation and ordered him to take down the offending posts by the afternoon, which Trump did.The judge raised the possibility of jail time if Trump continues to violate the gag order, stating, therefore defendant is hereby warned that the court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders, and that if necessary and appropriate, under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment. Trump's comments after a court appeared to be within the bounds of his gag order. But when court resumes on Thursday, the day will start with another hearing on four additional instances where prosecutors say Trump violated the gag order. Now, of course, these were all before Trump was found to have violated the gag order and fined that $9,000. It's unclear what the judge will do this time if he finds these violations are also valid.

This was his first official engagement since his cancer diagnosis back in February.We've only seen him once in public for an impromptu walkabout around Easter, but clearly, his doctors are comfortable enough for him to go back to his diary of engagements. We don't know how many there will be, but clearly, he's allowed to meet the public, and there's no vulnerability there. Royal sources being clear, they're not going to give any more detail about what type of cancer he has or at what point he is in the treatment. But this visit was significant. He chose a cancer center for this first engagement, because he wants to promote awareness around cancer. He spoke about the importance of early diagnosis, something that he's really keen to emphasize. He's using his high-profile position to get a positive outcome, if you like, from his illness. He was on good form, as was the queen. And we expect to see him more. The diary of engagement is there, but they're going to take each one as they go. Again, on medical advice.
