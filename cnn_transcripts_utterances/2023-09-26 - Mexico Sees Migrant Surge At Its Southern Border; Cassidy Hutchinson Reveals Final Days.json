(voice-over): It was just last summer that Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, became a star witness in the January 6th committee's hearing. And in her new book, \"Enough\", Hutchinson paints the closing days of the Trump White House as even more chaotic and lawless than described in that shocking testimony. Quote, \"Cass, if I can get through this job and manage to keep Trump out of jail, I'll have done a good job.\", Meadows tells her. It's a front-row seat to madness. At a mask-free Trump rally during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Former Presidential candidate, Herman Cain, contracted the virus and later died. \"We killed Herman Cain\", Meadows tells her. But this does not change the White House's mask policy. In fact, during a visit to an N-95 manufacturing plant, Hutchinson advises President Trump to remove his mask because his bronzer is smearing it.",

Meadows constantly reassures his boss that he will work to overturn the election that Trump clearly lost. Quote, \"I was irritated that Mark gave the president false hope\", Hutchinson writes. \"Of course, that's what the president wanted to hear, but he was damaging the country by concocting false rationales.\" This is a theme in the book. Soon-to-be House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Director of National Intelligence John Radcliffe both expressed concern to Hutchinson about the President erratically acknowledging he lost, then backtracking and saying he didn't. Both men blame Meadows, but it's Trump who is most erratic. After the US. Supreme Court refuses to take up the nonsensical lawsuit filed by Texas to overturn states that Biden won, Trump pushes Meadows. Quote, \"Why didn't we make more calls? We needed to do more. We can't let this stand\", unquote. Trump continues in a statement that could have legal ramifications, quote, \"I don't want people to know we lost Mark. This is embarrassing.\" When multiple lawsuits and attempts to overturn the election do not come to fruition, January 6th becomes the failsafe. (CHANTING)",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, Boris, it's fair to say that some people along the eastern seaboard felt robbed of a proper winter this year, but I think this winter could make up for it.May be retribution in the cards here. And it's also thanks to our friends El Nino, which is the equatorial warming of the waters along the eastern Pacific Ocean. And this changes the jet stream dynamics that drive the systems from the west coast to the east coast, basically taking the subtropical jet stream and pushing it further south, amplifying it, and allowing those winter storms impact the southern tier of the U.S. and along the eastern seaboard, as well. To conjure up one of my favorite max shows \"Winter Is Coming.\" Take a look at this image from Boston in 2015. We all remember the classic winters. That weather pattern I was showing you on our augmented reality map really lines up nicely with the Climate Prediction Center's winter forecast. They're calling for above normal precipitation favoring much of the eastern seaboard during the core of the winter season as the storm track is favored during this type of El Nino setup. What about temperatures? Well, climatologists look to previous winter, where we had strong El Ninos building just like this season, and they compare and contrast December, January and February. And you'll notice that the warmer temperatures are generally confined to the northern tier of our country. That's the above-average winter temperatures and that aligns well with the Climate Prediction Center's winter temperature outlook. You can see above-average temperatures for the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes and northern New England, with equal chances of above or below average temperatures across the Deep South. So this is something that we'll continue to monitor, but El Nino may favor a more winter-like pattern along the eastern seaboard -- Boris?",
