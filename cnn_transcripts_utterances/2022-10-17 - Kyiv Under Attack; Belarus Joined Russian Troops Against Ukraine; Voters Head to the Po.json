And I'm Rosemary Church.We are following developments out of Ukraine where explosions continue to be heard in central Kyiv. The first blast came just hours ago, and one official says Russia is now attacking the capital with kamikaze drones.

Then there were at least another two explosions, and we're right in the center of the city at the location or right next to the location of the impact of one of those blasts. You can probably see behind me there's still a lot of smoke in the air from that explosion. We don't know yet how many people may have been injured or possibly killed in this series of blasts here in the capital.We did speak to the paramedics who were on the scene. They said five ambulances took wounded away from the scene. But, again, we don't know what exactly was hit or how many people may have been injured or killed as a result, but we do know Russia that has been stepping up its attacks particularly on civilian infrastructure. And I think what makes today's attack or attacks I should say so notable is that we are hearing from Ukrainian authorities that the weapon of choice here were these so-called kamikaze drones, these Iranian Shahed drones that have been used more and more on the battlefield in the last month or so. And actually, as we arrived on the scene here, we saw emergency workers carrying away a part of the fin or the wing of one of those drones. And there have been other spotting of sort of remnants or detritus from the drones in different parts of the city. And really what happens in these scenarios where they're using these drones is that you are forced if you're the Ukrainian authorities to expend a lot of air defense in trying to prevent them from landing. There were small arms fires as people were literally trying to shoot down the drone from the sky before it was able to make impact. But, again, just to recap those main points for you, Rosemary, so far at least four explosions here in Kyiv this morning, more being reported nationwide with the Ukrainian air force saying that they have intercepted more than a dozen of these kamikaze drones so far this morning.

This is about Putin satisfying the hard liners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones.

In the Georgia governor's race, Democrat Stacey Abrams is challenging Republican Governor Brian Kemp in a repeat of their battle four years ago. And a CNN poll of polls finds Americans are almost evenly divided over which party, Democrats or Republicans, should control Congress.

You know, this, one month out, three weeks out from the election we are in extraordinary circumstance.Democratic candidates in the statewide races for governor and senator in many cases are levitating above low approval ratings for Biden to a much greater extent that we've seen candidates do for presidents in their own party really for the last 20 to 30 years. I mean, Arizona and Nevada, Colorado even, Pennsylvania, Georgia, all of these states, Wisconsin, Michigan with critical Senate and governor races, President Biden's approval rating is at 40 percent or below. We just don't have a lot of examples in recent political American history of candidates from the president's party winning midterm election in states where his approval rating is that low. For example, in 2018 Republican Senate candidates lost every state with Trump's approval rating was at 48 percent or below, much less 40 percent. And the fact that these Democrats are still competing in any cases ahead, in other cases basically even is a testament to how many voters are uneasy about the values of the modern Republican Party. But it is an open question whether they continue -- whether they continue to escape this undertow for another three weeks, and it remains a, you know, a real challenge for Democrats trying to avoid the worst in November.

Xi Jinping opened this event on Sunday, like he has in the past, laying out his nationalistic vision for the country's future. But this year is unlike any other because after 10 years in power, Xi Jinping is poised to be selected for an unprecedented third term as party leader. Well, this is a watershed moment for China. By the time the Communist Party Congress ends on Saturday, Xi Jinping is expected to hold the tightest grip on power since the days of Mao Zedong. Now, CNN's Ivan Watson explores how these two leaders shaped modern China. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Throughout the 73-year history of Communist China, two strongman leaders stand above everyone else. Founding father Mao Zedong ruled with an iron it's until his death. And now, Xi Jinping is expected to give himself that same right. Two unflinching authoritarians bookending years of tremendous change. In his decade on top, Xi has worked to reshape the Communist Party in his own image and reassert its dominance and every facet of Chinese society just like Mao did after 1949. After winning China's brutal civil war, Mao wasted no time with his revolutionary overhaul of the world's most populous nation. [03:35:03] WATSON (voice-over):  But his new regime wasn't capable of creating a promised socialist utopia. Instead, the poorly planned greatly forward (ph) led to three years of famine. Beijing ordered farmers off their fields and into factories and yet industrial modernization did not follow. Millions more died in the years after 1966 when Mao launched the cultural revolution, sending the People's Liberation Army and brainwash mobs against anyone perceived to be a political enemy. Mao's death drove the country into a political, economic, and ideological U-turn. Deng Xiaoping, a peer of Mao, emerged as the new paramount leader, and he changed course for China. To get rich is glorious, he said. Deng (INAUDIBLE) planned economy for a more open market, inviting the world to invest. Deng unshackled China's economy, but not the Chinese people. In 1989, when thousands protested in and around Tiananmen Square for democracy, Deng's troops crushed them. It is a history still denied by Beijing and one which Deng's successor, Jiang Zemin, struggled to live down. The flamboyant Jiang maintained Deng's economic reforms, ushering an age of breakneck growth and joining the World Trade Organization. Jiang also weathered criticism on China's human rights record. China's coming out party is a global power and economic juggernaut took place during the tenure of China's next ruler, Hu Jintao, usually stoic, welcomed the world to Beijing in 2008 for the Olympic games. Hu oversaw China's continuing economic success while many around the world hoped that with greater wealth would come greater freedom. But as Xi Jinping's China hosted his own Beijing Olympics earlier this year, the opened China many had hoped for now all but forgotten. Son of economist dynasty, Xi and his brand of nationalism pitched China once again against the west with tensions running especially high across the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese economy gasping for air as it's once vibrant private sector sputters under constant government threat. The Chinese people increasingly censored and monitored, with millions placed under sudden lockdown for weeks or even months in the name of zero tolerance for COVID infections. Xi also oversees the arbitrary detention of over one million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the past few years in China's far west where the United States say a genocide is happening. China denies this. It says that they are at vocational training centers. Among Xi Jinping's favorite slogans, the realization of the Chinese dream. But many fear his vision and policies may bring more nightmares in the coming years. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
