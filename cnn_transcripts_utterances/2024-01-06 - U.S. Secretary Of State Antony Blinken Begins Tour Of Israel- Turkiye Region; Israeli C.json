He arrived in Istanbul on Friday as part of a wider trip that will take him to multiple stops in the region, including Israel and the occupied West Bank.A State Department official said Blinken will try to use diplomatic back channels to send a message to Iran that Washington does not want the conflict to escalate. During his diplomatic push, he is also set to discuss the next phase of Israel's military campaign and plans for Gaza after the fighting is over. Nic Robertson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It said whatever lessons it ends up learning, it will apply them to future security challenges. Yemen's Houthi rebels are one of the Iranian proxies likely to come up in talks, as Mr. Blinken visits the Middle East. They have ramped up their attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea in recent months. This map shows all of the attacks on vessels between November and December of last year. While the Houthis say the attacks are retaliation for Israel's war against Hamas. Joining me now is Hisham Al-Omeisy, a conflict analyst and the senior Yemen adviser with the European Institute of Peace. A very good day. Can you help unpack for us what the recent Houthi naval attacks in the Red Sea mean for Yemen, the region and the world at large? HISHAM AL-OMEISY, CONFLICT ANALYST AND SENIOR YEMEN ADVISOR, EUROPEAN INSTITUTE OF PEACE: Definitely. They have been planning this for a while, a lot of people forget that the Houthis have been in Yemen for the past five years. And they have been trying and attempting to control the better part of the country since 2015. Now they have control over the Red Sea. They have been waiting for a golden opportunity where they can advance their goals further in terms of enhancing their persona in the region as the vanguards of the Muslim and the Arab world. In terms of extracting concessions from regional countries, the Gulf Cooperation countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. But also they've also moved internationally where they will strong-arm the international community. And they will continue to do this for the forthcoming few months, because it increases their legitimacy in the region.",

The Houthis remain defiant.Are they able to brush off the increasing international pressure they are facing from the likes of the U.S., the U.K. and so forth? AL-OMEISY: Yes they will. The Houthis for the past nine years have been fighting off a Saudi led coalition which was backed by the U.S. and other Western states, which they have managed to, for better or worse, win over even more territory. So they will definitely brush it off. They are looking for this opportunity, for this escalation because they want to advance their own goals. This conflict, this escalation basically serves to rile up their local base and it increases their footprint and is also a low cost conflict for Iran, their backers, to fight indirectly with the U.S. So they will definitely continue to do.

AL-OMEISY: It's going to be extremely difficult because for the Houthis it's very cheap, they're launching $1,200 worth of drones and speedboats that they're actually built locally at a very low cost. They could launch hundreds of those in a matter of weeks. In turn, for the U.S. and for the allies, it is very expensive to defend against those drones. One costs about $1.5 million and it's going to be exponentially expensive to basically fend off those drones. And if the coalition, the alliance, decides to basically bomb Yemen or have boots on the ground, it will bolster the Houthis' legitimacy, not just locally but also regionally. Soon enough you'll have fighters from, Iraq from Syria and around the world, even from Somalia joining the Yemenis because there are a lot of sympathizers. And they have sympathizers fighting off the U.S. and allies. The Arabs see them as the underdog. So it will escalate and it will regionalize the conflict. So there's a high cost there.",

Nine years now since the Yemen war began, devastating the people of Yemen, the entire country.What does all of this mean for peace negotiations that were underway and were very promising, could we now see, as you've explained, this escalate further and spark a wider war? AL-OMEISY: The Saudis, we've been getting words for the past two weeks from Riyadh, that the Saudis have been trying to de-escalate the situation. They're not trotting out the (INAUDIBLE) yet. They're still in negotiations with the Houthis. (INAUDIBLE), actually the U.S. envoy is coming to the region in the next week to try and salvage that deal. The Saudis have been trying to exit Yemen. Yemen has been the Saudis' Vietnam if you. Will and they've been trying to extract themselves from that conflict and they've trying to strike that deal. So they will look for ways to compromise with the Houthis. This is one of the reasons why the Saudis have not joined the U.S. coalition in the Red Sea. It's because they did not want to antagonize the Houthis. Hopefully we will hear something back within the next weeks unless (INAUDIBLE) of the alliance attacks Yemen, there are boots on the ground.

Here the justices have accepted a petition from former president Trump's lawyers to review whether the Colorado Supreme Court made a mistake when they removed Trump from the ballot.It's unclear exactly which questions or which issues the court will decide. But the big question in this case that has been litigated across multiple states with different outcomes is whether Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution applies to presidents. This is a question that has divided even judges within one state, Colorado. And this is a so-called insurrectionist ban. This section of the 14th Amendment prohibits anyone who engages in an insurrection from holding future office. But it does not explicitly say that it applies to the president. And that is one of the issues that the justices will likely have to weigh in on. The other big issue that's out there is, how this is enforced. Is it up to the states, the judiciary, is there a role for Congress? Right now they are not making it clear, the justices exactly, which questions intend to answer. Trump lawyers are framing this case as a request to return choice to the candidates and the voters. But the challengers insist that Trump's conduct in and around January 6th is exactly what this post-Civil War part of the Constitution is meant to protect against. Here is how this is going to go down. They have a briefing schedule that is pretty expedited; we'll see those briefs soon. And then on February 8th, there will be oral arguments, likely probably the biggest oral arguments of this. Term although there could be other cases that they're asked to weigh in on related to the 2024 election. Then they have to make a decision, putting enormous pressure on Chief Justice John Roberts to build consensus behind the, scenes and come up with a path forward, where, at least the vote count, whatever it ends up being on whatever decision they make, does not appear partisan. Certainly an enormous case for the court and an enormous test for the chief justice -- Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more on the fighting but a warning: his report contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A child's lifeless body carefully pried from the rubble. Gaza civil defense says this is the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah, a city where tens of thousands are seeking shelter. Heeding evacuation orders like these dropped by the Israeli military this week. It's not just Deir al-Balah. Several cities where civilians have been told to flee have been hit by Israeli airstrikes in recent days, including this camp for displaced Palestinian in the southern city of Rafah. That city has been struck repeatedly this week even as makeshift camps have ballooned in recent months as seen and the satellite images. YAMEN AHMAD, DISPLACED GAZAN LIVING IN RAFAH (through translator): I have been displaced from one place to another, Bureij, Maghazi, Nuseirat, then we left the last place for the safety of our children.
