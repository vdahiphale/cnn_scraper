That's also still a requirement here, yes? RAJUmaintained for sometime that that's a red line, specifically talking about work requirements. They had initially pushed for on several programs including the Medicaid program that deals with low-income health insurance. The White House has said that's off the table.

So therein lies the very difficult balancing act in keeping everybody together, trying to get a deal and get this through Congress in a matter of days.And, Jake, I asked the speaker about why he didn't make the same demands Republicans for spending cuts went on Donald Trump was president, when they suspended the debt limit three times.

CNN's Shimon Prokupecz has been covering the story since the beginning. He sat down with families whose lives have forever been changed for the worst. For the past year, these parents have been asking officials for answers, and not getting them. Those families knew CNN was able to obtain the footage of what happened that day through sources. In many cases, they asked Shimon and CNN to show them the moments that their children were evacuated from the classrooms after the gunman had been taken down. They said they needed to see what their children experienced. They hoped it would help them, and help others understand what this kind of violence does two children.
