We have new details on the painstaking negotiations that led to this historic homecoming.Plus, where your schedule? Top vice-presidential hopefuls are canceling their Saturday and Sunday plans. Why? Because Kamala Harris wants to meet with them one-on-one this weekend. And what a difference two weeks makes. I'll talk to a top Trump pollster about how the campaign has transformed since we last talked at the Republican convention. He was supremely confident then. Is he still? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. These are the images we've been waiting for. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich finally hugging his mother. Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva running to her daughters and husband. And that's former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan embracing his sister Elizabeth who spent years meeting with White House officials, trying to secure his release. They were all greeted by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at Joint Base Andrews just before midnight eastern time. You can see here what a moment. The president taking an American flag pin from his own lapel and pinning it on Paul Whelan, who spent five years seven months and five days as a Russian prisoner. Earlier in the day as the freed Americans made their way home, the president gathered with their families in the Oval Office, so they could talk to their loved ones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In 12 days, we've seen this astounding fundraising, this coalescing of the whole party behind her. And now she faces this weekend, you know, one of her biggest decisions as a nominee, and that is going to be to pick her vice-presidential running mate. She wants to then use that for momentum for more fundraising, more energy among the grassroots of the party throughout all next week. And then roll into the Chicago convention to utilize that for more fundraising and more energizing of the grassroots before getting into the reality, as she says, she's the underdog in this race. And there's going to be a very tough competitive campaign across these battleground states in earnest after Labor Day.",

Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As usual, it was a win for Putin or any other country that deals with us. But we got somebody back. So, I'm never going to be challenging that. It wouldn't have happened with us. We would have gotten him back. We wouldn't have had to pay anything. We wouldn't have had to let some of the great killers of the world go, because that's what's happened as you know. And the deal is very complex because it just came out.

And I think that it was really interesting how obviously, the president wanted to -- President Biden wanted to talk about the -- what it took to get these four Americans home, the impact on the family, just the emotions of that day. But he also really made it a point to bring in -- bring into context for the public, for voters, for Americans, why this matters in the context of the campaign. And obviously, this wasn't -- he didn't make political remarks by any means at the White House yesterday. But when I was in that room yesterday, one of the most forceful deliveries that he had was the fact that alliances matter, that you cannot coordinate this complex seven country swap of prisoners, if you don't have good relationships with our allies abroad. And that is -- has certainly been this, you know, occurring message of -- you know, when President Biden was still the candidate. That was certainly a message that he had against Donald Trump and his message that Kamala Harris is continuing as well, as noted by her comments on the tarmac last night.",

And it's the less is more sort of approach. And I want to give an example, and this happened in Houston on Wednesday, and it was the vice president's response to the comments that Trump made about her ethnicity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, there couldn't have been like a more designed place for her to be in the aftermath of Trump's comments at NABJ.And yet, she did not clearly want to make all of her remarks about that, knowing that it would be just adoration from this crowd on anything. She was saying this, no. She stuck to two sentences to make the point that she made, call it disrespectful, but also the same old show and not trying to be distracted from it. Doug Emhoff, her husband was at a fundraiser in Maine. He said, this is an attempt to distract. So, while -- when Trump says sort of outrageous things the way he said when he falsely claimed that she wasn't black at the NABJ. There is the ability for that to just move into an outrage cycle, and no doubt, get donations going and play to the base. But that's not what Harris chose to do here. What the candidate chose to do here was actually keep her reaction to it pretty limited and move on to try and keep the focus on what she thinks will actually serve her purpose in winning this election.",

It's actually Mark Kelly, a Senator who actually hasn't been a lot -- senator for a very long time, but he had won two very contentious campaigns in Arizona's Senate. So, he is a battle tested campaigner. But if you look kind of regionally, Josh Shapiro is more well known and well liked, especially in that Northeast Region. But obviously, you know, people like, you know, Governor Andy Beshear, Governor Tim Walz, they will have a lot to do to make themselves known to voters and they're already doing that now. We're seeing them all across their airwaves. They're basically auditioning for this vice-presidential slot in front of our very eyes, on television, our morning TV shows.
