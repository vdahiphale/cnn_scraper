If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with some of today's top stories.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Japan this weekend for the G7 summit. He'll also attend the Arab League Summit in Saudi Arabia. This comes as his country is preparing for a spring counteroffensive against Russia, and the need for more military aid is increasing. Negotiations in Washington continue over raising the U.S. borrowing limit. U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he can see a path to a deal and wants Congress to vote on a Bill next week. The high-level Arab League Summit is set to begin in just a few hours, as leaders gather in Saudi Arabia. This year marks the controversial return of Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad. He arrived in Jeddah on Thursday ahead of the gathering. His first ever Arab League Summit since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. Mr. Assad still controls vast swaths of Syria, though he remains a world pariah, with sanctions on this country. Many Syrians are angry and disheartened to see the Arab world welcome the Syrian president back into the fold, after years of killing and brutalizing his own people. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has this story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Assad or we burn the country, vowed his supporters, and the country burned. It was a regime's existential battle, where no holds were barred. Hundreds of thousands of lives lost, maybe many more. And millions forced into a miserable existence far from home, victims of a civil war. Their pain was the worlds to see. Atrocity so shocking, yet the world did little. 12 years on, Assad still denies attacking civilians and claims he was fighting terrorism. Now the ruthless president who unleashed hell on his people with the help of his ally, Russia, is not only a free man, he's now welcomed in some world capitals with red carpets and handshakes. WAFA MOSTAFA, SYRIAN ACTIVIST, FATHER MISSING IN SYRIA: And defeat is something that, you know, one, at some point, must accept. But this is beyond any conversation about defeat or win. This is about, you know, this is about the man who is responsible for the pain and for the suffering that I've been going through in the past 10 years. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Wafa Mostafa counts the days since she last saw her father, more than 3,600 days of searching, waiting, campaigning. Ali Mustafa vanished into the black hole of the regime's prison system, one of more than 130,000 forcibly disappeared by the regime.",

I might be able to save him one day. But, you know, normalization feels like the end of everything. It feels like the end of this hope. It feels like the end of, you know, what started in 2011 and it was like the end of my life.(END VIDEOTAPE) CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins me now live. Jomana, what's been the reaction from Syrians as Assad arrives at the summit? KARADSHEH (on camera): Well, you know, Bianca, people will tell you that Assad rejoining the Arab League, being readmitted again after all these years, after all he has done to his people and his country. Is really more symbolic than anything. But it is a very painful moment for a lot of Syrians who are watching this. Watching him arrive in Jeddah yesterday. Coming out of the plane, looking relaxed, all smiles, to handshakes and red carpets. That really is a very, very painful moment. And Syrian activists will tell you that this is not just a shameful moment, as they scribe it, for the Arab world, for Arab leaders, they say that this is also very, very dangerous. This sort of victory lap trip that he is on right now is in dangerous precedent, they say. What kind of message does this send to dictators and autocrats and people like Assad who have been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity? I mean, Bianca, his regime according to legal experts, there is more evidence against that regime, than there was against the Nazis in Nuremberg. This is one of the most documented wars of our time. And then you have the man accused of leading that regime, accused of all of these atrocities, arriving to the sort of welcome, and being admitted into the Arab League. And they will also tell you, Bianca, that what happened in Syria, the fact that there was total impunity, that nobody was held accountable. The regime itself as a whole was not held accountable for what happened. Bashar al-Assad not being held accountable and as well as his Russian allies. The Russians who have also supported him in his campaign to recapture much of the country, and all of the brutality and killings, and strikes, that we saw over the years. And they will tell you, the fact that this happened, the fact that no one was held accountable, that that emboldened President Putin. That it allowed for the war in Ukraine to happen. This is what a lot of Syrians feel. And today, Bianca, we are hearing from the Arab diplomats saying that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine is going to be at that Arab summit, this highly, they're high-level summit taking place in Saudi Arabia. So, seeing Bashar al-Assad and Zelenskyy in that same summit is going to be something that everybody is going to be watching and how that all plays out. Of course, especially as you have many of the Arab countries with very close ties to Russia -- Bianca.",

And we're still getting reports of really harrowing rescue operations, let's take a look at what we saw from yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (voice-over): Thousands of evacuations continue in Northern Italy after deadly floods and landslides wiped out key infrastructure. Several people died and rescuers continue to search for the missing. A pregnant woman was lifted to safety by the Coast Guard called in to help with water evacuations. An elderly couple evacuated from their home overnight. Bridges washed away have hampered rescue operations. Roads have become impassable. FAUSTO CASANOVA, SUPERVISOR, PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY (through translator): We close the road to Forli-Cesena (ph) after the flooding of the river Cordana (ph). A torrent flooded on the via Amelia in the Castel (INAUDIBLE) area. The Mata (ph) bridge collapsed near Osuna ala Amelia (ph). The situation is very complicated. The only road available to reach Faenza and Ravenna is the Via Emelia (ph). The highway is closed due to flooding. NADEAU (voice-over): The floods have even sparked fires. KELI SHARK, FAENZA RESIDENT (through translator): I was expecting the river to rise after the red alert warning came through. But instead of breaking through in two or three places, it burst its banks and the water came with no warning. What can we do? We're waiting for the help of civil protection teams. They're not here at the moment. So, we're helping in order to save our houses. What can we do other than that, we'll wait until someone helps. NADEAU (voice-over): Residents who can't stay with friends and family are being housed in local cinemas and museums. Weather conditions are expected to improve slightly before another system moves in. (END VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (on camera): And now you know when we see the sort of lull in the weather today, they are expecting more rain in the coming days. It won't quite be as heavy as they say as it was before. But we're also seeing warnings, as you mentioned, of rain and wind all across the country. Which is going to put those rescue operations probably under a lot of pressure across the whole country -- Bianca.",

From the car scene here, meandering around the square. Security guards reportedly prevented him from entering when he was first approached. Moments later he returned at high speed and rammed through the gates. He made it to a courtyard where he got out of the vehicle and police then arrested him. A doctor assessed the man and said that he was, quote, experiencing a serious state psychophysical alteration. Scientists in Abu Dhabi are researching aspects of the date pod that are, well, the pits. Dates are a healthy, delicious but the pits inside not so much. However, researchers may have discovered a new use for the seeds. And as CNN's Christina Macfarlane shows us in today's \"BOLD PURSUITS,\" it's a bit fishy apparently.
