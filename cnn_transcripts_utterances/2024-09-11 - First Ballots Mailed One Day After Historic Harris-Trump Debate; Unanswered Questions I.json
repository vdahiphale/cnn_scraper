Alabama, today, the first state mailing out its absentee ballots amid an avalanche of headlines declaring Vice President Kamala Harris the winner of last night's debate against former President Donald Trump. There are many reasons why this debate did not go well for Mr. Trump. One might be exemplified by his staggeringly absurd lie about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating local neighbors' cats and dogs. We'll take a closer look at that bizarre moment in just a second. But, first, let's take a step back because we have been telling you for weeks that this debate would be a defining event in the race where Americans would have perhaps the only opportunity to hear both candidates make their case and the same arena side-by-side. And while by no means are we equating the two performances last night, it is also true that at times both Trump and Harris fell short of giving straightforward answers to questions about how exactly they went good run the country. Vice President Harris began the debate by punting the first question on the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They limit their intake of information to that which comports with their preexisting beliefs and narratives. It's a booming business. Websites, cable channels that generally only interview folks from one party or the other with anchors openly rooting for one candidate or the other.

On this 23rd anniversary of 911, we should also note, Loomer posted last year that 9/11 was a, quote, inside job, unquote. Trump continues to bring this person along on his travels with him. Why? I don't know. But we should note it's not just Loomer who is in Trump's circle embracing this migrants are eating your cats meme. It was also pushed by Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. And other lawmakers who frankly often seem more motivated by a desire for clicks and owning the libs on social media instead of facts and truth.
