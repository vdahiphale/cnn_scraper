President Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain is expected to step down in the weeks ahead after the president's State of the Union address. Klain has worked alongside Joe Biden on and off for decades and his departure comes at a challenging time for the president with a special counsel investigation into handling of classified documents and a possible re-election campaign. Let's get right to CNN's Arlette Saenz. She joins us from Delaware where President Biden is spending the weekend. A little bit of news over at the White House this Saturday afternoon, Arlette.

      "sentences": "Yes look Jim. This will mark a pretty significant change in the leadership at the White House as CNN has confirmed that White House chief of staff Ron Klain is planned -- expected to step down from his post in the coming weeks.Sources say that that transition is expected to happen at some point after the State of the Union Address which is slated for February 7th. And this comes as really there has been very little turnover when it comes to the inner circle of advisers that have been working with President Biden. Klain has been there from very beginning of this White House, also worked with Biden when he was vice president as well as during his time in the senate. And it comes as there really haven't been that many senior staff that have left the White House since Biden took office. Now, Klain has overseen a host of accomplishments for the administration when it comes to navigating the coronavirus pandemic, also getting an infrastructure bill signed into law as well as passing historic investments in climate change initiatives. But of course, he has also faced a number of challenges in the job including that withdrawal from Afghanistan, also troubling numbers when it comes to the economy and now as the administration is handling the response to the handling of classified documents after President Biden left office. Now, sources say that this decision has nothing to do with that classified documents saga. Klain has often talked about how this is a very grueling job and it's not typical for a White House chief of staff to remain in the job for the entire four years. Of course, President Biden is also potentially gearing up to run for re-election, and there are multiple battles expected in the years ahead when it comes to working with Republicans up on Capitol Hill. Now, as Ron Klain is expected to leave in the coming weeks, much of the focus will now turn to who his replacement would be. Officials have been quietly talking about who could potentially remain replace Klain in this role. And a few of the names that are in the mix include Steve Ricchetti, counselor to President Biden; also Anita Dunn, a long time advisor; as well as Jeffrey Zients who led the coronavirus response for the White House in the first few years of the Biden administration. The are also a few cabinet secretaries who might be in the mix. Tom Vilsack of Agriculture, as well as Marty Walsh of Labor. But certainly this will mark a very significant change for this White House as President Biden is also preparing to take on some challenges in the coming two years.",

Molly, you first.An investigation at the Supreme Court has apparently failed to discover who was responsible for the leak of the draft decision -- the Dobbs decision that ultimately overturned Roe versus Wade. The Supreme Court marshal was forced to clarify that he did also talk to the Supreme Court justices as part of the investigation. According to the reporting over here at CNN but found nothing to implicate them or their spouses. I have to tell you, this is starting to feel like a \"Knives' Out\" mystery. Do we need Benoit Blunt to come in and solve this. Maybe there's another movie in the works, Meryl Streep to play Ginni Thomas? I mean what do you think here? JONG-FAST: Don't do that to Meryl Streep. I would say that I think some of the reporting around this, that the justices didn't have to sign affidavits, just the staffers. I mean you know -- look, you don't know who leaked it. There's been a lot of people on the left who thought the right leaked it. A lot on the right who think the left linked it. But it is to me -- if you're going to do an investigation and not have any of the Supreme Court justices or their spouses, you know -- I think that is -- you're missing out on a large number of people. So I wonder what this investigation was really about. If it was sort of set up to never really succeed.",

I mean it's kind of astonishing that they haven't been able to figure this out. CUPPmany as 90 people touched this decision before it was released. That's actual, I think a lot of people that you might want to talk to and I'm not sure it benefits a justice or his or her spouse to leak it, but I could see a low-level staffer getting real excited, you know, about having some big news, and maybe being on one side or the other on the issue, and you could plausibly see both, you know, wanting to slip it to Politico. So I'm actually much more interested in the sort of folks at the bottom, that they may or may not have talked to than I am the justices and their spouses. I just don't think -- I mean this is so embarrassing for the court. I don't think it benefits the justices themselves that this happened. So I'd be looking elsewhere. But that's just me.",

You know, to get Marjory Taylor Greene's loyalty for his speakership nomination. I mean it's just disgusting. She should have been sidelined, marginalized, gone months, years ago, based on the stuff she said and the stuff she's done. And instead she's being rewarded. I mean I remember on CNN however many years ago when Trump called her a star of the Republican Party and I said, I have no doubt she will be.

And we know this is a 14,000-pound multi-ton snowcat, the snow plow that he owns, that he had used to move a car that was stuck in his driveway, that a family member got stuck in this unprecedented snow in the area. And he gets off the snowcat after he tows the car and it starts to roll and he had to jump back up on the snowcat and that's when he fell off and it rolled on top of him.
