      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with breaking news. After thrashing the gulf coast of Florida, Hurricane Idalia is now targeting Georgia and South Carolina with heavy rains, dangerously high winds, and serious threats of flash flooding. Idalia is now a category 1 storm, but it made landfall as an intense category 3 storm earlier today. The area of Florida's Big Bend took the biggest hit. Big Bend is the part of Florida where the panhandle meets the west coast of the peninsula of Florida. This was the town of Steinhatchee just a few hours ago, so much standing water in the streets that only the roofs of these homes and businesses were visible. Up the road near the town of Perry, Florida, the brutal winds toppled this gas station awning. The winds in the area gusted to 85 miles per hour earlier today. And just take a look at this storm damage in Keaton Beach, also in the Big Bend area, where the eye of Idalia came ashore shortly before 8:00 this morning. This home has been ripped apart. The entire roof in front of the structure are gone, debris scattered all across the yard. The city of St. Petersburg shared this video with us saying it rescued more than 75 people so far. More searches are still under way. The National Weather Service also reported water rescues under way in parts of Georgia today. We are, of course, learning about the tragic first deaths from this storm. Two people who were killed in weather-related traffic accidents in Florida this morning. Idalia right now is barreling toward Savannah, Georgia, with the center of the storm 60 miles away. And that's where we find CNN's Ryan Young, literally the calm before the storm. Ryan, how have conditions changed there as Idalia is inching closer and closer to you? RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Jake, this community has been on high alert. It is a coastal town. So, they're aware of how dangerous a hurricane can be. We've been watching the water all day. They're worried about this water rising, so much so that a lot of businesses have been putting a lot of preparation into this. As you can see, this business is closed. They have the sandbags stacked up here on the outside and we have been seeing this multiply all across the area. The government has also told people, look, we want people to stay home. We're not sure when the streets are going to flood. But we want to show you something, Jake, the preparation has really got really extensive, especially at the businesses that are along the riverfront. That's what you call a water dam. They filled this up with water to make sure when the water hits the banks and comes toward all this commerce that the water stops here. And it is fortified with wood and water in this, so it moves, but at the same time the water stops here. To bring you back this direction, Jake, because the conversation has been a lot about the wind. One of the largest bridges in Georgia, the Talmadge Bridge, which is so beautiful here, is just over there. They closed that at 2:00. They wanted to make sure that there were no cars going across that. And just under the bridge, this is the perfect combination between commerce and the port authority, which comes right through here. They stopped all the ships from moving in. We heard all the planes have been canceled in coming to the airport. You put all that together, people are worried about power going out. This has not been a rain event. What this has been so far for us is a wind event. But at 7:00, that could change and that's what they're concerned about. Low lying area, lots of wind, lots of water, it could all end up being pretty bad, especially with the images we have seen down south. So far, though, so good, Jake.",

Hurricane Center keeping that 75-mile-per-hour moniker there, but I think we're losing some of that. That will be 75-mile-per-hour gusts on some of the land- falling big storms, some of these outer bands.Another thing going on here, as the storm rolls up the coast there will be beach erosion, all the way from the low country of South Carolina, possibly even toward Tybee Island as far south there, that's not far from where Ryan is, then all the way up to our North Carolina as those waves come on shore. But another thing with those waves coming on shore will be the potential for tornadoes. There is the center, I guess, getting really big, not seeing an eye anymore, kind of surrounded by radar, surrounded by rain, most of the rain to the west of Savannah. I think we'll see some gusts to 50 again. There is the heavy rainfall to the west, some spots over eight inches of rain already on the ground, almost half a million people now without power. It's going to take a long time for this to all get back up in the air again. I-10 still closed, debris all over at this point. Travel across northern Florida, southern Georgia not recommended and all the rainfall still to come, not only Lowcountry, but up toward Piedmont. That water has to run back down, you start to get to some topography and all of a sudden, you run the risk of flash flooding -- Jake.",

Not on the ground, but warnings.But every time you see one of these big cells come on shore, there would be water spouts with it. And then you get a little bit of friction from the land, it also could spin on land and make a tornado. So, yes, that threat is still there. But as the storm now moving almost 250 miles per hour, transits all the way up this band will be here and then there and then there. And so, yes, that tornado threat will move from the south to the north as the day goes on and then further to the south, that tornado threat completely goes away.",

As soon as the winds drop below the critical levels, we had teams on the island checking those that decided to hunker down and weather out the storm there. We very quickly went through our recovery and rescue operations.

And come on over here, we'll show you just how close it came. If this tree goes maybe a foot, another 45 degree angle to the right, then this family inside is really in some trouble. So, we did speak to them, very nice young couple and had their daughter in there when it happened. They were very relieved, of course, that it kind of fell the other way, but they were -- they had a lot of anxious moments at the height of the storm. But we can also show you that people here are not out of danger yet. Even though the street has been cleared, but take a look, a lot of downed power lines. The power line is down over there. There's another power line down the street here. Officials are saying, you know, if you -- if you evacuated and you want to come back to your house, don't really come back if the neighborhood is like this because downed power lines can be killer, some are still live and it's just very, very dangerous to try to navigate. Another thing and maybe you can hear it behind me. That house back here is running a generator for power. This house back here, I'll just kind of pivot and Jonathan will take in here, they're running a generator off their truck over here. That is also the cause of some real damage. Officials here in Florida, Louisiana, always tell us that a big cause of death are people improperly running their generator maybe inside their home and dying of accidents inside the home. But these people seem to have it under control. We can also give you an update, Jake. We just spoke to county officials who say that in Leon County, a little bit more than 38,200 customers are still without power and officials told me earlier what they're telling people is don't let go out, let the power crews navigate the streets. Get out of their way. Even though it's sunny out and the storm has passed, you've got to let these first responders and these power crews do their work to get things back to normal, Jake.",

And quite honestly, while the effects could have been course, we definitely took it on the chin. It -- I would say that this, as far as comparison, this is probably one of the worst flooding events in terms of water that we've probably seen this county probably since the no-name storm back in 1993.",

But, yeah, our crews were able to work seamlessly with our sheriff's office and our fire and rescue teams. We've got everybody out that wanted to get out. Folks really got scared seeing the water rise and not stop. Other folks stayed put and as the waters receded, it was fine. We've finally been able to get our shelters clear to allow things to start to return to normal. But again, I can't underscore the importance of heeding evacuation orders. If, you know, I was having conversations with our fire chief this afternoon and it's his opinion and I share it if that storm turned, just like, let's say an Ian did, a last minute turn, then it hit directly, we had shelter space available for almost 12,000 of our citizens ready for evacuation in those zones, and maybe we took in a couple of hundred, but if it turned, we'd be doing a lot of body recovery right now, Jake, and that's unfortunate. People really need to really take these orders seriously and we only get lucky so many times.",

Since then, CNN reported on other instances in which McConnell fell that his office had not disclosed.Let's bring in CNN's Manu Raju, and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Manu, first to you.

What do you see in the video of this latest episode?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, I mean, what we see is something that essentially is freezing, and this is a term that's often used when describing various neurological things. He's obviously freezing, he's not saying anything, his face is sort of frozen in that position. But also, even his hands, if you look at that video, his hands are attached to the lectern, his aid comes over, tries to get him to try to raise his hand. He's sort of really holding on very closely. It's very tightly, I should say, to the lectern. You know, it -- there's a lot of things that come to mind, the more you know about the various neurological conditions, the longer the list is, but certain things like stroke or things like that are probably less likely. He gets -- he walks away and he's moving his arms and legs as he walks away. Seizure is less likely, as well, about 30 seconds where he appears to have some component of freezing. I think what really struck me in that, I think Manu alluded to this, is that, you know, his aides don't seem that surprised by this. So we've seen this episode a couple of times but you get the impression that it happens more often and this is something they are used to dealing with. And if I remember correctly, as Manu has reported, last time, it's not even clear that he saw a doctor after these episodes, so they don't seem like they are entirely surprising. So while it's, you know, as you say, hard to watch, doesn't seem like this is lightheadedness, it seems to be something that is really ongoing, someone who has Parkinsonian-like condition for example, whose medications are wearing off, or something like that, that is something that can explain this behavior but as I said, Jake, it's a long list of possibilities here.",

Is this more sort of being distracted by what else is going on in his body, and his brain at that point, these freezing episodes? Is it buying time in some way to allow him to not be freezing as much, you know? So there's different possibilities here.
