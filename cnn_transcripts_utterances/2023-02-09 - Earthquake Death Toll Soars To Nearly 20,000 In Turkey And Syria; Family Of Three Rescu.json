AT THIS HOUR, trying to cling to hope as rescue and recovery efforts continue in Turkey and Syria, and the death toll continues to climb.Plus, new details out today about what that Chinese spy balloon may have been capable of. A member of Congress who was just briefed on the incident is our guest. And North Korea showing off its military arsenal in a very big way as Kim Jong-un's daughter steps into the spotlight. This is what we're watching AT THIS HOUR. Thank you so much for being here, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan. The images coming out of Turkey and Syria continue to just boggle the mind. How widespread and just complete the devastation is just building after building pancaked. And freezing temperatures of course challenging every effort to find survivors. Yet, still moments of hope. A mother and two sons were just rescued alive today after being under the rubble for more than 70 hours. The death toll though, is still rising as well, now passing 17,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands of people are without a place to live. For the first time since the quake, United Nations aid convoy was able to cross into northwest Syria today to bring help and aid there. Let's get to it. Salma Abdelaziz is live in Turkey for us. Salma, what more are you learning about the rescue efforts, the recovery efforts today?",

I just want to play you this video. It is absolutely joyous.You're going to see this little boy in a red sweatshirt. He's being carried in a blanket like he's a miracle baby. And he absolutely is for everyone here in Turkey. Rescued after 78 hours under the rubble. You're going to see after him another little boy in a blue sweatshirt, that's his brother. Their names are Mammoth (ph) and Mellette (ph). Their mother was also found safe. You can see the joy on the faces of those rescue workers who've seen so much grief and anguish. And that joy really replicated across the country. They've been playing the images of these two boys repeatedly here on local television. We know one other family, a mother and her six-year-old child pulled out after a 20-hour rescue ordeal. And that's the thing to point out here, Kate. And the case of these rescues, these were people identified alive yesterday. It was just a matter of time, of the length of time it requires to pull them carefully out of the rubble and the rebar. It is very unlikely, unfortunately, that more survivors are going to be found now four days into this crisis. Hope is absolutely fading. These rescue efforts, unfortunately, may soon become recovery efforts. And whatever hope people did have, that's turning into anger and frustration towards the government. Many feeling that the authorities didn't do enough, didn't act fast enough. You mentioned those pancaked buildings. There are also serious questions being asked as to whether or not buildings were up to code if they followed the rules. And if there was any failure by the government of President Erdogan to make sure that people were safe, could lives have been spared. We have one last thought here because you mentioned Syria, a tiny trickle of aid flowing in there just six trucks. They had shelter equipment just to keep people from being on the streetscape. But that is a tiny drop in the bucket of the need, the enormous need on the ground in Syria.",

First on this balloon, a senior State Department official says this balloon had what's known as significant signals intelligence gathering capability. Meaning, it can pick up on communications and transmissions either below it or near it.Again, that's according to a senior State Department official speaking to reporters just earlier today. That makes it more concerning that what it flew over, including a large part of the continental United States and several sensitive sites, according to the Pentagon, even as the Pentagon has continued to insist that this didn't give the Chinese any capabilities above and beyond what they already have. That is spy satellites and other means. But this balloon didn't just exist in a vacuum. This, the U.S. officials now say, is part of a larger surveillance program run by the People's Republic of China that has sent balloons like this one, not exactly the same, but similar in their purpose, similar in their intent over some 40 countries over the course of the past several years. A number of missions undertaken, several dozen, according to the officials that have spoken with CNN. And this latest balloon is just a part of that. There is more information coming out about the balloon including Biden administration officials briefing the Hill right now. So we do expect to learn more. One of the key questions is zeroing in on that timeline. How soon did President Joe Biden know? And why was there a delay in shooting it down until it was off the east coast and not the West Coast?

It's good to see you, Congressman. Thanks for coming in. With all the necessary caveats, that you can't talk about classified information, let's talk about it, please. Broadly, you come out of this briefing feeling what, about this spy balloon incident? REP. RITCHIE TORRES (D), SELECT COMMITTEE ON COMPETING WITH CHINA: Look, the actions of the Chinese Communist Party are cause for concern, and the American people and their elected representatives in Congress have a right to know when foreign surveillance objects like spy balloons intrude into American airspace. I'm introducing legislation known as the Aerial Intelligence Collection, a revelation act, the Air Act, which would require the Defense Department to immediately disclose to Congress when a foreign surveillance object has invaded our airspace. You know, we know of at least five instances of Chinese spy balloons infringing on the sovereignty of the United States invading our airspace. We know that the Chinese Communist Party has a global surveillance program that has infringed on the sovereignty of more than 40 countries and five continents. And so most people, including myself, were unaware of the existence and full extent of the problem. You know, I think of American airspace as the property of the American people.

You know, during the Trump administration, there were three Chinese spy balloons that went undetected. And so I give enormous credit to President Biden for improving the ability of the United States to detect foreign espionage. And as far as I'm concerned, the President made the right decision and shooting down the balloon as swiftly and as safely as he possibly could. You know, people should keep in mind that the balloon was the size of three school buses. And so you cannot impulsively shoot down a balloon above it land, and then allow the debris to endanger the lives of people in the structural stability of buildings.The President was right to wait for the balloon to move above water, and then shoot it down safely, which is precisely what he did.",
