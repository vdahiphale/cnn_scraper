So the market is down and these are the events of the day. President Zelenskyy to Davos, every death is a result of war. The Polish Prime Minister to Germany, stop procrastinating and let us send what we need to send. And the Norwegian Sovereign Fund to the markets. Executive pay is too high. Live from the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, January the 18th, I'm Richard Quest with my friend, and together of course, we mean business. Good evening from Davos, and tonight, a powerful moment at the World Economic Forum. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy led a moment of silence. It was in memory of the 14 people who were killed when a helicopter crashed in Kyiv only hours before. Among the dead was the Ukraine's Interior Minister. President Zelenskyy says the crash victims are the casualty of war no matter what actually caused the helicopter to go down. His main reason for speaking to Davos is to push for more equipment particularly tanks, and President Zelenskyy warned when Russia invaded, the world hesitated, and he urged don't make the same mistake again.

YURII IHNAT, UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE (through translator):  Various factors, radio communications and the technical condition of the helicopter needs to be examined. This will take at least several weeks. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Denis Monastyrsky was one of Ukraine's most important officials. We traveled with him to the Chernobyl nuclear plant shortly after Russian forces withdrew from there. Monastyrsky frequently visited the front lines to help boost morale. DENIS MONASTYRSKY, UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator):  They have such a strong fighting spirit and are ready for any scenario. We heard the shells exploding but no one is afraid as everyone is ready. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Ukrainian forces are currently facing a major Russian onslaught in the eastern part of the country near Bakhmut and Soledar. And dozens were killed when a massive Russian missile hit a residential building in Dnipro.
