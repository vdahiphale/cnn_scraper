Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cancelled his delegations talks last week after the U.S. abstained in a United Nations vote demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.Senator Van Hollen's comments come as Israeli prime minister doubled down on military operations in Rafah, saying there is no victory over Hamas without it. Netanyahu also dismissed renewed calls for an early election. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Jerusalem where protests are underway. MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, a great deal of anger being expressed here in Jerusalem tonight. This the first night of what protesters hope will be four days of rallies all the way down to the Knesset. They've set up their tents and what the urgent call here tonight is for Benjamin Netanyahu to go. These people want elections held. They're angry about the way the war has been prosecuted. Now we've heard from the Israeli prime minister earlier tonight ahead of this protest saying that he believed that his policies that had been responsible for bringing half the hostages home so far, and doubling down on the idea that a ground invasion of Rafah, he said, will be necessary to win this war. Now that will be at the heart of negotiations, conversations in Washington, when the Israeli delegation gets there this week. But there are also talks that are now taking place in Cairo. The hostage talks have started once again with Egypt and the UAE trying to get both sides to agree on some kind of deal that might lead to that six-week ceasefire. The exchange of some of the hostages for several hundred Palestinian prisoners. There are still a number of outstanding issues. But one of the big themes of this night and the protest signs that we've seen is the anger that's nearly six months into this war, so little has been achieved, and show many hostages still remain in the hands of Hamas. A great deal pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu over the next few days as these parallel talks take place, and they had hoped is the emergence that a ceasefire might be found -- Fredricka.",

And finally, in 2022, the Biden administration took up this challenge and had so many listening sessions, public comment, 20,000 comments. I mean, race and ethnicity is very, very important to so many Americans. And being accurately portrayed is very critical to the services that we have, as well as the kind of images that we have in society. Now, for Asian-American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders, which is what we call AANHPIs, it is so important not to be lumped together. We have over 100 different race and ethnicities and over 70 languages that are spoken. And if you just lump us together, it masks the vast differences that are between our different groups.",

For instance, those in the Southeast Asian categories, that is those who are among Laotian or Cambodian only earn a bachelor degree at 15 to 17 percent. And they need the help.

So it can have such tremendous differences. Let me also say that knowing these differences can have a tremendous beneficial effect on society as a whole, because when you have these big differences, people operate on model minority stereotypes.
