Her first appearance on the campaign trail as the presumptive nominee coming just hours after securing the backing of key party leaders. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  Vice President Harris has done a truly impressive job securing the majority of delegates needed to win the Democratic Party's nomination to be our next president to the United States. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  Kamala Harris is a common- sense leader who knows how to deliver real results. TAUSCHE (voice-over):  Harris raking in more than $100 million, mostly from new donors, recruiting 58,000 new volunteers across the country and racking up critical endorsements from actor George Clooney after his call for Biden to step aside to prominent voices across the party. GOV. ROY COOPER, (D-NC):  I endorse Kamala Harris 100 percent for this job as president. GOV. JOHN CARNEY (D-DE):  I think we're going to see a whole different thing now. We've got a great person leading the way, our vice president. REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA):  The reason nobody ran against her is because she's superb.

And that's not to say they're not concerned. I think they still know that it's going to be a tight race. She's still sort of polling around the same as Biden was before the debate. So, neck and neck with Trump. In 10 days or so, they think they'll be able to see real polling and see how she polls, not just, you know, nationally, but in the swing districts, how does her being at the top of the ticket affect down ballot Democrats like members of Congress and some of these swing seats in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California. And I think the party is just relieved to have, you know, Joe Biden off the top of the ticket. It was a moment of standstill. The donors were not giving and then the money just surged. And I think that's a sign. And then you saw grassroots money as well. I mean, $1.1 million unique donors, that's a lot. So, yes, there's a lot of excitement. It's a honeymoon. It's kind of incredible because like she doesn't even have a campaign slogan yet, you know, there's really not, you know, this type of talking points going around, messaging. It's like, I'm continuing the Biden administration, but I'm different, but they really haven't drawn out the contrast yet. So, we're in kind of very weird, unchartered territory strange political water. Like, I see -- I've been talking to even surrogates, and they're not really so sure what to say quite yet.

You completely, you know, append a race, that impacts Trump. I mean, the polling, the messaging, they thought that they were in a good position to beat Biden.

That's been the elusiveness for the last several months as we've heard that they've been close before. Certainly, the language would suggest that they're closer than ever now with the secretary of state saying just last week, that they are inside the 10-yard line, an American football analogy, that means that they're incredibly close to scoring. But when you talk to members of the administration, it is clear that one thing that they believe could be the legacy of this administration is securing not only a peace deal between these two parties, but also more stability in the region as a whole. They've been seeking to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel and to further the Abraham Accords that were put in place by the Trump administration. They want to solidify and expand the stability in the region, and certainly, that's going to be something that you can expect will be a top priority this week and for the next six months.",

Disgraced Democratic Senator Bob Menendez is to resign from his seat effective August 20th. It comes after the New Jersey senator was convicted of 16 counts, including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent. That was during his role in at a year's long bribery scheme. Majority Whip Dick Durbin says he doesn't expect to see Menendez again in the Senate. U.S. President Joe Biden has told reporters he feels well. That was during his first public appearance since dropping his re-election bid and recovering from COVID.

The U.S. vice president speaking to supporters in the key battleground State of Wisconsin, the same state where the Republicans held their national convention last week. Now, the two most powerful Democratic members of Congress, meantime, that's Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, formally endorsed her candidacy. That was just a few hours ago. All this as speculation swirls over Harris' running mate. And Republicans, yes, they're sharpening their political attacks. One Republican congressman calling Harris a DEI vice president. We're going to decode all of this for you. And for that, we've invited Harry Anton. OK. DEI VP. Translation, diversity, equity, inclusion. Now, that label suggests that Harris is not qualified otherwise, which is clearly an attack on her.

And you're right, you bring up the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has been doing historically well among younger voters of color, black voters, Hispanic voters. In fact, he's doing better with young black voters by -- at least was against Joe Biden by about 40 points. He shrunk the margin by about 40 points compared to where we were back in 2020 at this particular point. And indeed, at this point, Donald Trump looked like he was on the road to putting in the best performance among black voters of any Republican since Richard Nixon in 1960. I don't get this attack because it brings race into a campaign in which, in fact, the racial polarization had shrunk significantly and to Donald Trump's benefit. And more than that, when you look at the polling, what you actually find is that a majority of Americans are actually in favor of DEI programs. So, as a political analyst, this attack just simply put -- in my opinion, it doesn't make sense. Even if it plays to the Republican base, to the middle of the country, where this election is going to be won or lost, I think it is a losing message, and a losing message, surprisingly, from a campaign, the Donald Trump campaign, that so far, has actually hat its head on right and has actually put forward a campaign that had, in fact, put Donald Trump into the lead, at least before Joe Biden got out of the race.",

I should point out thatReuters/Ipsos has tended to be one of Donald Trump's actually worst pollsters. So, the fact that even if it's within the margin of error, right, no clear leader, the fact that he's trailing by two, that doesn't really mean all that much to me. I think that is well in line with what we saw before Joe Biden exited the race when, of course, back then it was just a hypothetical matchup between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. But it's a close race nationally. There's no doubt about that. But ultimately, this comes down to the battleground states, a lesson that was well learned by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Al Gore in 2000, where they won more votes nationally, but lost the presidential election. What we know is that at least based upon the current coalitions, and of course, this may change given, of course, that Harris just got into the race, but traditionally, over the last few cycles, the Democrats have had to win nationally by at least a few percentage points in order to win in the Electoral College. We're talking about states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. If Harris wins by two points nationally, let's just say that poll is directly on, I still think Trump would be the slight favorite. Because he simply put -- has more voters in those states that kind of line up with how sort of the breakdown has been going down where he can lose by two points nationally and still win. But if that poll is exactly right, I honestly am not sure who would necessarily win. And we're just going to have to wait and see, because some of that swing state polling had really turned against Joe Biden after that presidential debate. We have limited numbers on Harris. What we do know is that she tended to do better, at least in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pennsylvania, of course, probably being the most important swing state than Joe Biden did at least before the announcement. And if that two-point lead is right, I wouldn't be surprised that the first swing state polls that came out perhaps showed Harris down by a point or two in the states that ultimately matter. But I got news for you, a point or two with still more than 100 days to go until the election, that's game on. That's a race that is way too close to call, and one in which on the day of the election, even if we had polls looking like that, it'd be a race that'd be way too close to call.

His trip overshadowedby an upheaval in U.S. politics after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Mr. Netanyahu will address both houses of Congress Wednesday, the same day Mr. Biden speaks to the nation about his decision to drop out of the race. Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet President Biden on Thursday and Former President Trump on Friday. Jewish Voices for Peace, a self-proclaimed anti-Zionist group, launched a sit in protest meantime south of the capital calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to arms sales to Israel. Images, as you can see there, show people being detained by police. Kylie Atwood has our report. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Paula, there is optimism from U.S. officials in terms of these ongoing negotiations to try and reach a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. These efforts have been going on for quite some time now, but late last week, the secretary of state said that they are within the 10-yard mark here, but that the last 10 yards can often be the hardest and they're still sticking points. We'll watch and see where this goes, particularly this week, when prime minister -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting Washington. And the family members of hostages are making their voices quite loudly heard here in Washington this week, many of them traveling to the city to make sure that members of Congress and members of the Biden administration who are meeting with Netanyahu are making it very clear that they believe that there is a deal to be had now. They're urging, pressuring that there is a deal that should be taken by Netanyahu, and they're making their voices heard while he's here in Washington, meeting with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and the president of the United States.

In the case of talks between Hamas and Fatah, we actually saw earlier discussions hosted by Beijing back in April. And if we look back even further, since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, China has tried to serve as a leading voice for nations condemning Israel and calling for Palestinian statehood. The Middle East is a part of the world where the United States has long been a dominant power, and experts have questioned if China can have the same geopolitical clout. Yet, last March, Beijing played a role in helping to establish better relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after diplomatic friction. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
