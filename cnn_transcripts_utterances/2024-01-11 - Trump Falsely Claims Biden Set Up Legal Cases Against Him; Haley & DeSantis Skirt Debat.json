Plus, two football Titans calling it quits after 24 seasons and six Super Bowl titles, Bill Belichick says goodbye to the New England Patriots and after 17 seasons and six national titles, Nick Saban retires as Alabama's head coach. We're going to talk about it with Bob Costas, a legend in his own right.And leading this hour, the 2024 race is closing in and we're down to just four days before the Iowa caucuses. But instead of being in Iowa, the Republican front runner, Donald Trump, was in court using his civil fraud case to grandstand before the judge set him down. And fresh off last night CNN debate today, Ambassador Nikki Haley and Governor Ron DeSantis campaigned in Iowa as did former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who is trying to sway any possible votes their way. And joining us now, Republican presidential candidate, Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas. Governor Hutchinson, thanks for joining us. So, I want to get your response to something Donald Trump just said outside the courtroom in his civil fraud trial against him. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My legal issues, every one of them, everyone's civil, and the criminal ones are all set up by Joe Biden, crooked Joe Biden. This is something that's never happened in this country. Even the civil ones, this is civil, this set up by Biden. Every single just about case that I'm involved in is set up by Biden. They're doing it for election interference. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And once again, he's misleading his supporters, and giving them anger at our system of justice when there's not any justification for this particular case. Now, sure, there's complaints about one or more of the cases that they shouldn't have been brought. But in terms of this one, it's a civil fraud case, no connection with the President of the United States. And then here, you have a businessman accused and found guilty of dealing dishonestly in his business services. Let me tell you, that would disqualify most candidates for the presidency. You've got that compounded by a jury of the peers finding in a civil case that he committed sexual abuse. You've got for criminal cases that are pending against him. All of this should be a warning sign that this is a person of poor character. And that should have been answered very clearly last night on the debate that he -- his character does not justify election to presidency of the United States.",

But we're going through 30 different cities leading up to the caucus, it's our return to normal tour. I'm going to be traveling in the snow today for another meeting up into Cora, Iowa. And so, I believe that we can beat expectations here. And the fact that now I'm the only candidate in this race that talks about the experience of securing the border, the only candidate that actually has experience in dealing with fentanyl and the opioid abuses, in terms of my responsibilities as head of the DEA, so I bring that experience. But I also am the only one in this race that has not promised a pardon during this campaign to Donald Trump. And I think that distinguishes me, it doesn't get me everybody's vote.

A judge set a trial date for this June.As House Republicans tried to connect President Biden son's financial dealings to President Biden, this week, the House Oversight Committee is interviewing more of Hunter Biden's business associates behind closed doors, including a New York art dealer on Tuesday. And after eight of these interviews, the Committee has only released two transcripts, despite pledges of transparency from the Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, including last month right here on THE LEAD.

So the notion of doing an investigation and keeping everything private has been thrown out the window by their own actions. Devon Archer is their most important witness, according to Jim Jordan, and his transcript is now public.So what is the actual rationale for not releasing the remaining ones? And then the other problem is that they consistently misrepresent what the witnesses say, excuse me, in their closed door depositions. They did it with Devon Archer. And now the media and every all the public has been able to see how much they lied and misled the American public about what Devon Archer said. And Hunter Biden's point is, listen, I don't want you to control what you release, and what you say about what I said, I want to speak directly to the American people. If you want to do deposition style in public, do a deposition style. If you have all these questions and documents, do it in a public hearing. But I do not want you to twist my words, to cherry pick and to mislead the narrative to the American public. I want to answer your questions, your allegations directly to the American public.

I don't know if Seahawks fans could swallow Bill Belichick showing up and reminding them of that. And even worse for the Atlanta Falcons who led on a Super Bowl over Brady Belichick and the Patriots 28 to three, and the Patriots came back from a 25 point deficit won in overtime. I think and I'm not claiming to have the greatest level of expertise here because I'm not as close to it as I once was. But from the outside, it looks like the Chargers are the best bet because they have good personnel. And they have in Justin Herbert, a very, very good young quarterback who is in place already and they have some good personnel Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack on defense. Belichick can't go to a team that has to rebuild.Now the Charges were five and 12 this year, but they lost a lot of games by one score.
