The Pentagon deciding against that for now. We're told that, while the balloon's flight path does bring it near sensitive sites, it's not considered a major risk.

The U.S. says they believe -- they're very confident, in fact -- that it's from China, a balloon that drifted in or came in over Canada and has been over sensitive sites, the Pentagon admits, over Montana.Now, they haven't specified what those sites are, but Montana is home to several ballistic missile fields, ballistic missile silos and perhaps, that's what this surveillance balloon was going after. The Pentagon says when this first came over, and they started watching it, they did launch F-22 fighter jets. In the end, the decision was made not to shoot this down. President Joe Biden asked for military options, for the possibility of what it would take to shoot this down. In the end, senior military leaders, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, the top U.S. officer, recommended against shooting it down for a number of reasons. First, there is a risk to what's on the ground: facilities and people there on the ground. Even if it is Montana and isn't densely populated. More importantly, though, the Pentagon says they don't believe this has intelligence-gathering capabilities: what satellite communications above what Chinese spy satellites already have. In the end, a decision was made not to shoot it down. But the Pentagon emphasized that, should they determine this is a high-risk, they do retain that option of carrying out a military option against this. Essentially shooting this surveillance balloon down. The Pentagon will keep watching this. It's important to note that the Pentagon did bring this up through diplomatic channels, both in Washington and in Beijing. And it comes at a time of incredibly high tensions with China.

We're going to have a live report from our Steven Jiang in Beijing when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [00:31:56] HOLMES: You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Michael Holmes. For several days now, a suspected Chinese spy balloon has been flying over the Northern U.S. It entered via Canada and is currently floating above Montana. The Pentagon closely monitoring the balloon. But for now says it will not shoot it out of the sky, even though the balloon is close to a number of what they describe as sensitive sites. A brief ground stop was ordered at local airports. Fighter jets were mobilized. And of course, the timing of all of this is pretty terrible. The apparent provocation coming as the U.S. secretary of state gets ready for his first official visit to Beijing. Tensions were already pretty high. China furious over U.S. plans to expand its military presence in the Pacific, for example. The Pentagon chief was in the Philippines earlier this week, where the U.S. is getting access to four more bases. Beijing says that the deal will endanger regional peace and stability. I want to bring in CNN's Beijing bureau chief Steven Jiang now. I guess, Steven, what is the trust level right now between the two nations? Especially as this spy balloon flies over the U.S.?",
