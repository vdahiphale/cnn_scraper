He's going to argue that, look, the whole indictment against Trump should be thrown out because the actions described in there and in the criminal charges against Trump are protected by the First Amendment, by the political speech protections in the First Amendment. I want to read what Sadow wrote in his in his motion submitted to the court before today's hearing. He wrote, \"The First Amendment in affording the broadest protection to political speech and discussion regarding governmental affairs not only embraces but encourages exactly the kind of behavior under attack in this indictment.\" As you mentioned, too, we've heard similar arguments that have been made in front of Judge McAfee and in other cases that have not been successful. So it'll be interesting to see if McAfee, how he questions Trump's attorney and how prosecutors push back against Sadow's argument today in open court. As you mentioned, it's all going to be broadcast live, so we'll get to see it for ourselves. But meanwhile, big picture, Fani Willis is really trying to shift attention back to the case, back to the criminal charges against Donald Trump and his remaining co-defendants. We've spent about two months talking about Fani Willis's personal life. Take a listen to what she said when we caught up with her at an unrelated event in Atlanta and asked her about the state of the criminal case in Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I talked to a number of advisors who said that they are aware that these First Amendment cases in the past have not been successful. But last night, one adviser reminding me that Trump's lawyers, which they do often, get paid a lot of money to exhaust every single avenue, all of this being their efforts to try and delay any sort of trial until after the election. That has been their goal the entire time.And I will remind you, they felt very good after the Fani Willis decision, despite the fact that Willis could stay on the case, they felt that it was a scathing report and damaged her publicly. But they will keep an eye on that. The other thing of what Donald Trump is doing today, you are going to see him in New York. He is going to the wake of the NYPD officer who was shot and killed at a traffic stop in Queens earlier this week. Again, that is in New York, and there is a reason that you're going to hear about this trip from Donald Trump's team. They are going to try and contrast Donald Trump, again, going to the wake of this fallen NYPD officer with Joe Biden also being in New York and attending this glitzy, as they say, glamorous fundraiser, to see a little bit of a political angle there as well. But when it comes to Georgia, they will have their eye on this hearing to see if anything does come of it.",

They say it could go even higher because there is a big, small dollar contribution. People can still send in 25 bucks or so to watch some of this event online. But look, the bottom line of all of this is the Biden campaign is doing quite well in the fundraising. They have surpassed the Trump campaign and the RNC significantly and it always helps when you have a few former presidents at your side. But John, that is perhaps what is so interesting about all of this. There has been so much intrigue of course, about what the former presidents think about President Biden's re-election bid, of course, both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton are younger than President Joe Biden. President Joe Biden ran for president before either of them, so just the history of this alone is so extraordinary. It is a rare meeting of the Democratic side, of the presidents club, if you will, of course, absent Jimmy Carter, who is still in Georgia and George W. Bush, of course, also not there, but they are running against Donald Trump, so that's why this is so extraordinary. But John, if you think back to history, sometimes presidents are the best explainers of presidents themselves. So Bill Clinton and Barack Obama will be called upon by the Biden campaign to try and not only unify the Democratic Party, but also sort of build up some of those coalitions, that fraying Biden coalition that really has happened. But the fascinating part of tonight, Stephen Colbert will be holding a conversation with all three Democratic presidents -- Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden.
