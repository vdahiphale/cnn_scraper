Are you aligned with Antifa?There's other sort of less out there ways that they try to get at that. They say, where do you primarily get your news? From what source? They say, have you ever been to a Trump rally or an anti-Trump rally? Have you ever worked for or against a Trump political organization? But I'll tell you, Dana, what the lawyers are looking for. Look, the textbooks say we're looking for fair jurors who can call it right down the middle. This is a competitive exercise. The lawyers are looking for jurors who are inclined for their side. If you're the D.A., frankly, you want people who dislike Donald Trump, and if you're Trump's team, you want people who support him.

And, you know, Trump's lawyers came in saying that the gag order is restricting Trump from defending himself in this case. And they said they're seeking limited relief.They want him to be able to address two witnesses who have been outspoken about this case, Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen. They also said that Trump should be able to call out what he views as political interference, one of the prosecutors this case and focusing on his ability to speak about a motion that has been publicly filed. That is when they've asked the judge to recuse himself. You'll remember the judge had altered his gag order that he put in place to cover his daughter because Trump was focusing on work that she does for democratic groups. Now the prosecutors argued that this was much more than what they were asking for. They want to stop the trial so they can make these arguments. They said that this is far too late. They could have brought this case up on appeal once the judge had issued the gag order even before he amended it, but they waited until now just one week before the trial. You know, how this is going to play out is that this judge denied for now, but a full panel will get briefs on whether to stop this trial based on this argument. Now, those briefs are due on April 15th. That is the day this trial starts. There will not be oral arguments, and the judges will issue a written decision sometime after the 15th, once jury selection is underway. You know, that is the first part of this, and then they are going to still try to continue to challenge the gag order, even after this initial decision on whether the trial starts on time is made.

She said it was very stark, the non-caring aspect of this. And also when Jennifer testified that she would not have done anything differently, she said it may have been misunderstood, but it really, really had a stark, stark reaction amongst the victims. She said the guidelines were not enough. So right there, because the guidelines for these crimes were four to seven years. So you knew something else was coming. The judge said she prayed about this. She was up nights worrying about this, thinking about the fact that. There is rehabilitation that needs to be done for these victims, but also deterrence so that no one else in this country would do something like this. They have to see that and then she pronounced the sentence 10 to 15 years. 15 years is the maximum for this offense.",

Her response was, they need to ask the question, where did the gun come from? Regarding the minor child, where did it come from? That can launch the investigation right now.And I think that in regard to gun violence, prosecutors are looking at this because someone needs to be responsible. And if you have a minor child and you have a gun in your home, knowing there's a minor child and it is not locked, it is sitting around, it is loaded and something happens. There have been cases where there is child neglect charges for a parent, but not homicide. This is what makes this case stand out from any other case that has been brought before in this country.",

This is not five days in prison and we're talking years in prison. I mean, it's a significant sentence, no question about it.And I have to say, you have to think about this in the context of the broader debate that we've had as a society about firearms. There has not been is much regulation of firearms. There's been a lot of debate about that. And now you're seeing the criminal laws being used in a more aggressive fashion by prosecutors in response to that. In other words, if truly guns are going to be more prevalent, now, the onus is going to be on parents to safely store them. If ultimately at the end of the day, we're saying that school shootings are a matter of personal responsibility, Well, if it's a minor, parents have to see these warning signs, whether it's a dark drawing like there was here, or as the judge mentioned, warning signs coming from the school itself, it's going to, I think, spark a lot more debate in the months and years to come.",

We saw that happen in historic and unprecedented fashion last year when Matt Gaetz pushed out Kevin McCarthy, speaker, eight Republicans at the time, joined with Democrats to vote out McCarthy. Will that happen again? A large part has to do with Mike Johnson's deal making to keep the government open. But now how he will handle the issue of Ukraine aid, so central to his political future as push. There's a major push among supporters to get that done immediately. Johnson has not said how he would proceed on that as he's talking to Republicans about a different approach than the Senate. Now, Marjorie Taylor Greene made her grievances known not just in a letter to her colleagues this morning, but also last night in a town hall back in Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R), GEORGIA: He's also worked with Hakeem Jeffries and the White House, not with his members. That is not what a Republican speaker of the House does.

Which was not the case with Kevin McCarthy, and a lot of that has to do with how they see how he proceeds on the issue of Ukraine.But again, Mike Johnson has not detailed how he plans to proceed, given the sharp defense (ph) within his own conference on proceeding with Ukraine aid.
