The two are expected to discuss a peaceful transfer of power. Now this meeting did not take place after Biden won the election in 2020. Trump will also meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson while in Washington. People in southern China are leaving flowers and candles in tribute to the victims of the country's deadliest known attack on the public in a decade. Police say 35 people were killed and more than 40 others were injured after a man allegedly drove into the crowd in an outdoor sports center. The driver was caught by police as he tried to flee the scene. And authorities in Ecuador say they have regained control of one of the country's largest and most dangerous prisons. Violent clashes between inmates at the penitentiary in Guayaquil left at least 15 people dead and 14 injured Tuesday. At least nine inmates are expected to face murder charges.",

Their goal is to cut bureaucracy, regulation and wasteful spending.The president-elect will also have to decide if he'll pardon any January 6th rioters.

CNN has previously reported that the Trump team will now argue that as president-elect Trump cannot be sentenced, that he has constitutional protections from either being indicted or prosecuted or even sentenced by state actors. Now, it's unclear if that will be successful, but the judge has at least one more week before he has to make any decision in this case and we can expect both sides will likely weigh in with their thoughts on this over the next week.

From Usagi to Man-yi, these are the areas there are still going to get rainfall from the storms that are still coming. Now, Da Nang picked up some rain, as we expected, in the overnight hours, but really only about 100 millimeters. Most of the heavier rainfall was south of Da Nang.Now, we take a look at Toraji, the storm that did affect the northern part of the Philippines a couple of days ago, really falling apart now. And that's kind of what happens when the water isn't as warm as it has been. And there's a little bit of shear out there, too, but really, we're going to take this storm and turn it into nothing. There were some showers in Hong Kong today. Now, let's pay attention and focus on what's still coming -- Usagi. Usagi will likely be a typhoon of about 185 to maybe 195 miles per hour as it makes contact here with the extreme northeastern part of the Philippines. A very strong event. Then, farther off to the east, still to come, there's Man-yi. And that's where it's going all the way down to the south, and then making another run at the exact same place here across the northeastern part of the Philippines. Now, will they be 30 or 40 miles away, likely, from the landfalls? But they could be very, very close. And many, many models are taking this very seriously when it talks to -- he's talking about so much precipitation that could come down 250 to 500 millimeters more rainfall in places where we just showed you all of that flooding. So, yes, there will be wind in some spots. We'll pick up 200 kph. That's a lot of wind. But it's the rainfall on top of the mountains that could really get people in trouble as that water tries to go down the hill and all the way back out toward the ocean.

So at the moment, about 10 percent of Iceland is covered by glaciers. And we have over 32 active volcanoes here.RAFFA (voice-over): Scientists say the Askja volcano in Iceland's central highlands has risen about 80 centimeters in the past three years because of pressure building underneath it that's pushing the ground upwards. The theory is that magma or pressurized gas under a volcano increases as glaciers melt because the heavy ice no longer weighs down the Earth's crust, allowing magma to move more freely underground. And those subterranean pressure changes can permeate to areas which aren't directly under glaciers, like Askja, which is just north of the country's largest glacier. But with recent eruptions in Grindavik, a town in southwest Iceland, which not only put on a spectacular lava show, but also forced the evacuation of the town's residents, scientists are eager to learn more about what's triggering such volatility.",
