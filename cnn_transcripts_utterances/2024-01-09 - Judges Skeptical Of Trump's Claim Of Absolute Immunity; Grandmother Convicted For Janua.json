Good evening, thanks for joining us. We begin tonight Keeping Them Honest with the former presidents' striking claim in court today that nothing a president does in office can be criminally prosecuted unless he or she is first impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. That's what his attorney, John Sauer told a three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals today. And what's more, in a remarkable exchange with one of them, Judge Florence Pan, he conceded that the principle would apply even if a president ordered a hit on a political opponent.

And I want people to understand, there is no magic to these formulations. We're in new ground here legally. It's not like there's some code hidden in the Constitution.

I do think that's a question that courts would want to think about seriously. And for that reason, actually, interestingly, the special counsel said, look, you don't have to agree with Judge Chutkan, that there is no such thing as presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, in all circumstances, full stop. You could just say that in the circumstances presented here, it is very clear, there is no immunity. And we're going to leave open for another day, the possibility that in some very narrow set of exceptional circumstances, there might be presidential immunity. And he gave the example of a president who on very short notice, has to decide whether to order a drone strike, right? We said that might be the kind of situation where it is a national military interest at stake and there is very little time where a court might say, we're reluctant to say categorically there could never be presidential immunity.

That is their argument. Obviously, people disagree with that.But that's the argument that they had been making, that it wasn't electioneering, that he -- as he has now said, which he was not saying at the time, he knew the election was over, and that that's what he was doing in his official duties. It went into a complete different way, and they essentially ran into a brick wall with these arguments, not only with Bruce Castor's quote, right there that the judge was referencing, Judge Pan, I think, providing a really difficult time for Trump's attorneys, and I don't also think it went the way that Trump thought it was going to go from the optics perspective, either, because instead of it kind of being this big, showcase moment of him going into court, again, being able to use it, which was a purely political decision, I was told, you didn't see him going into court, and instead, you saw his attorney kind of getting browbeat by the judges with these deeply skeptical questions of their arguments.

Two weeks from tonight, we count the votes here in New Hampshire.Remember, back in 2016, this was Trump's first win. This was the beginning of the path to the nomination for Donald Trump. New Hampshire was kind to Donald Trump. So look at these new numbers in this poll, and it is quite striking when you see it. Nikki Haley within 7 points. 39 percent for the former president. 32 percent for the former South Carolina governor, Chris Christie a distant third. Ramaswamy running fourth. Ron DeSantis in low single digits in fifth. Asa Hutchinson just barely an asterisk in this poll. But think about that, she's within seven points in this poll. So Iowa will send her on to New Hampshire. The question is with how much momentum. And one quick point, Anderson. We say this all the time but in New Hampshire especially, the composition of the electorate, two weeks from tonight, excuse me, for turning my back, will be absolutely critical. In New Hampshire, Democrats, Independents, they're undeclared voters, can show up on Election Day, essentially declare yourself a Republican for the day and vote in Republican primary. If it's a conservative electorate, Trump will win. Among conservatives, he's up over Haley by 40 points. Among registered Republicans, he beats Haley by 37 points. Among voters with no college degrees, we know that's the Trump base, he's up by 17 points. But look at this. Among Moderates, Haley beats Trump by 42 points. Among undeclared voters, meaning Independents, by 26 points. Among those with a college degree, 12 points. So, who shows up, the full composition of the electorate in New Hampshire is going to go a long way to say whether Nikki Haley can come close or conceivably even beat Donald Trump.",

The gray you see, the darker gray, the lighter gray, excuse me, are suburban counties in Iowa. We know the suburbs are Donald Trump's kryptonite. They have been. He did -- he beat Hillary Clinton in the suburbs in 2016, but since then that's been his kryptonite. Again, in New Hampshire, I -- and James made the point, you know, Independents, Moderates, do they show up for a Republican primary? If so, it probably helps Haley. Who shows up in Iowa? More than 60,000 people have moved to the Des Moines suburbs since the 2016 race, right? They're not all Republicans, but do they -- but do -- those who are Republicans show up. You see the suburbs around Sioux City, around Cedar Falls, around Dubuque. That's where Haley has a chance. To beat Trump, that would be an earthquake. But to come out maybe surprisingly close, it is mathematically possible. The flip side of that is across the top up here, across the bottom down here, those are the evangelical rural counties that Ted Cruz actually beat Donald Trump in 2016. Trump is expected to run it up there. If DeSantis is going to surprise us, that's where that will come, among homeschoolers, among evangelicals. There's no evidence of that at the moment in any real strong, sustained way. But again, right now, we're in the pregame. When we see who actually shows up Monday in Iowa, and then two weeks from tonight in New Hampshire, that will tell us a lot about which Republicans are deciding to come out, especially if the weather's bad, because they want to make a statement about who leads their party.",
