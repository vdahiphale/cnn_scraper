Now that is -- that has a document deadline of February 19th, which is fast approaching. So we'll see what happens there. This is all part of Republican's full-court press, trying to hold the president accountable and hurt him politically as a result of Hur's final report. Of course, there were no charges against the president, but Republicans have seized on the parts of the report that question his age and his memory. We should expect that to be a big part of their questioning when Hur eventually does come and testify.",

And he didn't specify from where it originated. But sources are telling CNN that it is very sensitive information related to Russia. And he is calling on the Biden administration to fully declassify that information so there can be a fuller debate about what exactly is going on. Now, we did hear from the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who was briefing at the White House just within the last hour. He expressed some surprise that Turner came out with this information. Sullivan saying that he had offered and, in fact, plans to go to Capitol Hill tomorrow to brief members of the so-called Gang of Eight -- that's congressional leaders -- as well as leaders of the national security committees about what exactly this intelligence is. And he expressed some surprise that Turner essentially preempted that briefing before he was able to go over to Capitol Hill. But Sullivan also not revealing exactly what this threat is or from where it originates. And in fact, when he was asked specifically whether this is cause for Americans to worry, he said he wasn't able to answer that with a straight yes, but he did emphasize that certainly President Biden will be you making decisions that would place the safety and security of Americans at the forefront. And he also emphasized the Biden administration's record in declassifying certain information in the past. And you'll remember, particularly when it comes to Russia, that is something that they have not hesitated to do, if it doesn't compromise the so-called sources of methods of gathering that intelligence. So it's certainly a developing situation. And a lot of questions still to be answered about what exactly this threat looks like.",

We can sometimes find infected lymph nodes as well.In this man, as you reported, he was immunocompromised. So it spread much further and faster. It caused fevers and muscle breakdown. And eventually, unfortunately, full body shutdown and death. But in most people to date, it's not as serious. It's just one or two of these little blisters on your skin that then go away. I wouldn't worry too much if you're not out there in contact with wild animals in the Kenai Peninsula or surrounding regions. But it is a reminder to get checked if you have strange skin lesions. And particularly, if you are someone who's handling wild animals, to let your doctor know so that they can test for Alaskapox, for Mpox, or for other things that are often carried by animals.

RANNEY: I mean, bubonic plague, anthrax, Mpox, again, Alaskapox, these are all diseases that are carried by animals and can be transmitted to humans. Unfortunately, with climate change, frequent air travel, mass migration, thanks to both climate change and war and political instability, were going to see more and more of these incidents going forward. So it's why it matters so much for us to have good public health monitoring systems, a stable supply of medications and protective equipment for physicians and other health professionals.
