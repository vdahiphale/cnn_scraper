The statement says Hamas was detected in the area trying to rebuild its operational capacities. The IDF says it's working to stop that from happening. We're also getting word of an Israeli strike on a mosque in Gaza overnight which reportedly killed at least 21 people. In Beirut, CNN crews reported near constant explosions this morning as Israeli strikes pounded the city. Israel's military says it struck Hezbollah weapons facilities overnight and suggested more is coming, but Hezbollah is firing back. Israel says about 30 projectiles crossed into Israel this morning on top of about 130 that came in on Saturday. Some of them were shot down, but others got through. That's happening as the IDF is on high alert for tomorrow's anniversary of the October 7th attack. And as the region braces for the IDF's expected retaliation against Iran for its strikes on Israel this week, Israel's Prime Minister says his country has no intention of backing down.

I mean, for instance, we did see yesterday the United States announced $157 million in aid to Lebanon, but it's not lost on anybody here in Lebanon or anywhere else in the region.The same country that's providing aid for civilians is also providing Israel with billions of dollars to conduct this military campaign here in Lebanon and in Gaza. There just doesn't seem to be a foot on the brakes. I've covered many of these conflicts before, between Israel and Gaza, between Lebanon and Israel, and we've always seen that either Democratic or Republican administrations did what they could to bring the fighting to an end. What we've seen is statements coming from American officials, but they're not using the leverage they have to stop this conflict. And the worry is that after a year of this war, in which tens of thousands of people have been killed, there just doesn't seem to be the political will to do what needs to be done to bring it to an end.

Officials have been speaking with their counterparts in Israel around the clock, trying to ensure about their response, hoping that ultimately the decision of how to respond will be a measured one. But this all comes as a at a very complicated moment, as the anniversary of Hamas's attack against Israel approaches on Monday. And President Biden is now dealing with this conflict on multiple fronts. He has tried to seek a diplomatic solution to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza for a year now. But so far, that has not come to fruition. And at times, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has really gone against some of the advice that the U.S. has offered. Now they are also dealing with this conflict in the Middle East, really opening on two fronts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Israel and Iran.

There was definitely heightened security. You could see more agents on the ground. But the rally on Saturday was really about honoring the victims, especially the man who had died in July. His name was Corey Comperatore, and Donald Trump spoke at length about him on stage. He actually paused his remarks at 6.11 p.m., the exact time, 12 weeks earlier, that the gunmen had fired those shots for a moment of silence. Donald Trump also spoke about the victims who were injured that day and thanked local law enforcement on the ground. However, part of the speech in Butler actually reminded me of the speech Donald Trump delivered at the Republican National Convention just days after that assassination attempt, when he had promised a message of unity and gave one for roughly 30 minutes, but then segued into kind of the typical Donald Trump we know, by using harsh rhetoric and attacking his political opponents. He did the same thing on Saturday, as did his running mate, J.D. Vance. Let's take a listen. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me. J.D. VANCE (R-OH) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First, they tried to silence him. When that didn't work, they tried to bankrupt him. When that didn't work, they tried to jail him. And with all the hatred they have spewed at President Trump, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him.",

Vance have in the past tried to claim that perhaps Democrats and their rhetoric, arguing that he is a threat to democracy, could have been responsible for the assassination attempt. Of course, there is no evidence to suggest that that is true.And just one other moment of note on Saturday is that Donald Trump called up Elon Musk to the stage. This is the first time we have seen Musk not only at a rally, but to get up on stage and speak at one. Also worth noting, Musk first endorsed Donald Trump just moments after the assassination attempt in Butler on July 13, so kind of a full- circle moment there. And, of course, Musk has become really a top surrogate for Donald Trump. On Saturday, he argued that this is going to be the most important election of Americans' lifetimes.

Protesters gathered in cities across Israel Saturday ahead of that painful anniversary. Huge crowds rallied in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and other cities blocking traffic and handing out ribbons to motorists. Their demanding Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, act quickly and decisively to free those still held captive in Gaza. Protesters blame him for letting an entire year go by without securing the release of all the hostages. All right, for more, we're joined by Salma Abdelaziz from London.

Multiple sources tell CNN it's believed the hackers were likely searching for sensitive information regarding national security and could have accessed wiretap warrant requests. The hack is the latest targeting U.S. federal agencies that investigators have linked to China.The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington denied the claims, calling it, quote, a distortion of facts. A fire broke out underneath a Frontier Airlines flight as it landed in Las Vegas on Saturday. A witness captured this terrifying video. Frontier says the pilots detected smoke as the plane arrived from San Diego. They declared an emergency. During the hard landing, the jet's tires blew. Fire and rescue officials on the ground managed to contain and extinguish the flames. Luckily, no one was injured. All 197 passengers and crew on board evacuated safely via air stairs, and the incident is under investigation. All right, in sports, after perhaps the greatest season in baseball history, Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani proved Saturday night that no stage is too big for him. Speaking of no stage too big, CNN Sports Correspondent Coy Wire joins me now. Coy, clearly no jitters in his playoff debut.",

Leading up to the game, Ohtani said that playing on this stage was something he dreamed of as a kid, well, in game one of the NLDS against the Padres. After seven years in the majors, that dream came true. Gone. The ball leaving the stadium fast like it was trying to beat LA traffic.Second inning, a two-run shot. Ohtani's first career postseason hit, home run tying the game at three. And he wasn't done. Fourth inning, LA trailing again. Ohtani gets another knock, this time a single. And then check this out, three batters later, Teoscar Hernandez bringing him home on what would end up being the game-winning hit as the Dodgers hold on to win 7-5. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHOHEI OHTANI, LOS ANGELES DODGERS DESIGNATED HITTER (through translator): The stadium was electric, and I was just really able to enjoy the game today. It's really hard to play loose in the first game of a playoff series, and I'm sure Yoshinobu, you know, wasn't satisfied with his outing today, but I think we played a really good game against a really good opponent.
