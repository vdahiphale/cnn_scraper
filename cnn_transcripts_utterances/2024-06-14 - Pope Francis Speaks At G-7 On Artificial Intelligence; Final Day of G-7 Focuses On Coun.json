Here you can see the president greeting Pope Francis after the pontiff made a historic address.Francis was the first pope ever to speak in front of the group of world leaders where he gave a dire warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence while also calling for a ban on automatic weapons. Also on the pope's agenda, a private sit-down with President Biden. CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, is in Italy there covering the G-7 and is with us now. So, Nic, how significant was this visit and the speech by the pope?",

Recognizing that the Europeans and the United States still on slightly different footing when it comes to how they're trying to sort of deal with -- with China through trade relations and trying to get some alignment there. But also the understanding as well -- I mean, we heard this from President Biden yesterday when President Zelenskyy was talking about he'd had a phone call with President Xi and President Xi said that it assured President Zelenskyy that Russia -- that China was not giving weapons to Russia. President Biden chipped in then and he said, yes, China may not be supplying the weapons, but they're supplying -- supplying the technology to make those weapons. So I think this was, again, an issue that we'll probably see reflected in the communique that will come out after the summit is finished.",

So, Brianna, really important to understand that, at this point, U.S. officials tell us that they have no evidence to suggest that any of these eight men were sent to this country by ISIS as part of a specific plot or to do a specific kind of violence, right?But U.S. intelligence officials did pick up on some really concerning rhetoric, some extremist rhetoric from at least some of these people either on their social media or indirect communications. And the concern for U.S. officials specifically was that these men could have been radicalized by ISIS-K once they were in the United States, feeling potentially isolated, homesick, financially vulnerable, right? Exactly the kinds of things that we know make people vulnerable to terrorist propaganda. And so officials are very concerned in particular about ISIS-K, the group that these men are believed you have to have links to. Because the strategy that ISIS-K has been pursuing is rather than training and fielding operatives the way that al-Qaeda did with the 9/11 attacks, for example. What they're doing is they're really emphasizing their propaganda networks and their online recruitment efforts in an effort to try to inspire so-called lone wolf attackers. And so that's exactly what U.S. officials were concerned about here. They watched these men for a period of time. But once this information came to light about their rhetoric, they moved to go on and pick them up and arrest them. Because, of course, in an environment in which -- in a global environment in which U.S. officials are warning that the possibility of a terrorist attack against the United States, particularly a lone wolf attack of somebody perhaps inspired by the violence in Gaza, for example, they're worried that that level is particularly high. And so out of an abundance of caution wrapped these guys up. SANCHEZ: There's also something about the story that highlights the vulnerabilities at the southern border.",
