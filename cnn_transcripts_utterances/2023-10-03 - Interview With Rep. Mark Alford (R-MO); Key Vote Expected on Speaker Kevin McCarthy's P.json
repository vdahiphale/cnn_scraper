That is just minutes away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  I truly believe, though, the institution of the House, at the end of the day, if you throw a speaker out that has 99 percent of their conference, that kept government open and paid the troops, I think we're in a really bad place for how we're going to run Congress.

The House cannot govern until they elect a new speaker. So, thisafternoon, in just a matter of moments, we expect a vote on the House floor to try to block the effort by Matt Gaetz to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership. At the moment, Kevin McCarthy is expected to lose that vote. Then there will be an hour of floor debate, and then there will be the actual vote to eject Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House. He is expected at the moment to lose that vote as well, because there are more than five Republicans who plan to vote him out, that he can only afford to lose four on a party-line vote, and, at the moment, no Democrats coming to his rescue. In talking to Republicans today, there is fury at Congressman Matt Gaetz and fears that this dysfunction could cost them the Republican majority in 2024. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

So, you can see Jake, where this is heading. Democrats are ready to sink him. Republicans are furious about Matt Gaetz.

Do you expect Kevin McCarthy will survive this historic challenge to his leadership? I mean, if he doesn't have any Democratic votes and if he loses a handful of Republicans, I don't see how he survives. REP. MARK ALFORD (R-MO):  Well, Jake, you're absolutely right. It's going to come down to probably four or five individuals who never liked Kevin McCarthy from the beginning, who fought him at our conference when I was a member-elect. And here for orientation, we were inside this conference. And from the very beginning, they were on the attack. They wanted to present -- Nancy Pelosi did not have this in the House rules that there could be a motion to vacate. She did away with that. They came in. They wanted to have a motion to vacate. I proposed a majority of the majority. I advocated for that. It got whittled down. And for Kevin McCarthy to get this leadership speaker role, he basically gave in to these people. And it only takes one -- one vote now, like Matt Gaetz did, to get before the U.S. House of Representatives and call for a vacate of the chair. And that's exactly what happened.",

We would be in conference and he would say, wait a minute. What are you really -- what are you really trying to say? And every conference that we have, he has listened to people. We might not always get our way. But everyone has had their say. We have matriculated this ball down the field like a football game.

One of the big problems that Kevin McCarthy has -- the first big problem is these five recalcitrant Republicans, Gaetz of Florida, Crane and Biggs of Arizona, Good of Virginia, and Burchett of Tennessee. Those are the big five, and he only has a margin of four. But, also Democrats, he has a big problem with Democrats, because they do not trust him, they do not like him.

I just -- in Democrats I have talked to, Kevin McCarthy, in the aftermath of January 6, when he first came out and seemed like he wanted to hold Donald Trump accountable for his actions, for his repeated lies about the 2020 election that led up to the insurrection, and then flipped on that within days to go down on bended knee to Mar- a-Lago and keep Donald Trump in the fold and keep his conference loyal to Donald Trump, that is something many Democrats I have spoken do not -- are not going to forget, A. B, as Ritchie Torres told you, this notion that, just weeks ago, he launched this impeachment inquiry that the Republicans' own witnesses suggest that there's not enough evidence for to be at the impeachment process yet is another reason I have heard from Democrats that they have no interest in engaging in this conversation about Kevin McCarthy. So, yes, I don't think Sunday helped matters, but I'm not sure we'd be in a different position.",

After Democrats came out of their caucus meeting, it was very clearthat the trust for Kevin McCarthy was not there, but Democratic leaders making it official in this letter to their colleagues, saying -- quote -- \"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican civil war. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican motion to vacate the chair.\" That means they are not helping Kevin McCarthy. And, time after time, member after member we spoke with earlier today made clear that was the consensus in the Democratic Caucus meeting, from Pramila Jayapal who came out and spoke with us, to others who are members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, which is a more moderate caucus of the Democratic Caucus. It was very clear that they have a problem with Kevin McCarthy, and it isn't a problem that just happened today. It is not just Democrats saying, we don't like Kevin McCarthy and we think he's vulnerable in this moment. It is because they feel like this is a pattern of behavior from the speaker of the House that, despite the fact that they have come to the negotiating table with him on issues like the debt ceiling earlier this summer and spending levels earlier this year, that he did not stick to those deals. And that's part of the reason they're not bailing him out now -- Jake.",
