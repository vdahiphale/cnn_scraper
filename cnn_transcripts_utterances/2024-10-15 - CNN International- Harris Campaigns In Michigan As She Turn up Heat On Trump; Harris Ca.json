So, as we look at what is happening in terms of today with Kamala Harris, she is really starting to make this push. We're seeing a lot more media out there, even it's not perhaps what people think of as traditional media. So, there is the town hall with Charlamagne tha God, also speaking to other very important black groups, of course, as she is trying to boost support there. Is there any evidence that this is starting to have an impact? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, the theory that the Harris campaign has here is that the people who are paying the most attention to, even what we're saying, or the traditional outlets, are largely decided about what they're going to do in the election. But, it's getting to the lower information, lower propensity voters, the people who are not as tuned into politics, and appealing to them both to vote at all and then to vote for her is what needs to be done here. As you said, today, part of the focus is on appealing to black voters, especially black men. She will be talking with Charlamagne tha God, not just about the issues overall, but specifically about this agenda that she released yesterday, called the opportunity agenda for black men, and that has a bunch of things aimed at improving the economic status of black voters and black men, in the hopes that she can get those numbers to where she needs them to be in terms of turnout, in terms of turnout for her in key swing states across the country. That would be the ones that could help deliver her to the presidency.",

      "sentences": "That's right. I actually would argue that some of what the Harris campaign is saying is an exaggeration, and some of it isn't true. I mean, Donald Trump does do, for his part, a ton of media. He speaks to the press very frequently. I was just with him a couple of weeks ago where he was taking questions from us. I was able to ask him a question. He also is doing a lot of the same type of alternative media, as the Trump campaign calls it, going on these different podcasts, trying to reach voters that are normally not as political. Everything that Isaac laid out is the same kind of strategy that the Trump campaign is looking at when it comes to those types of media interviews.However, we will see him today. I do want to talk about what he is going to do today, because, again, it does kind of -- it is a juxtaposition with what the Harris campaign is saying. So, this morning, he is going to be in Chicago, interesting, because, of course, we are 21 days to the election now. Donald Trump keeps visiting blue states or cities in blue states that really will not be consequential in the election for the point of it's not going to be a close race. Trump's team recognizes Chicago is not a battleground city or in a battleground state. But, he is going to be taking questions from Bloomberg News. I do think you will see -- I mean, Bloomberg News, for the Trump campaign's part and opposite of what is -- what the Harris campaign is saying is a very mainstream, credible media outlet that is going to be pressing him on certain questions. So, you'll see that today, around 12:00 p.m. Eastern. And then later, he is going to Georgia. Of course, early voting is kicking off in that state. That is a battleground state that Donald Trump's team is very much running aggressively in this cycle. For Georgia's part as well, I will say, when it comes to the overall battleground map, I know that the Trump campaign is actually far more worried about some of the blue wall states, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, far more than they are Arizona and Georgia. But, again, they recognize that he lost that state in 2020 to Joe Biden. So, he is going to be running in there very hard today and in the next couple of weeks.",

He basically said that he had a town hall in Pennsylvania last night, and it was amazing, and that he wanted to stop in and just play music for the crowd, while these people were having -- being seen by medical staff.

Great to have both of you with me. I feel like it's been a little too long since I brought you -- saw you both. Let's pick up where my colleagues left off, maybe starting with Alayna's reporting on what happened last night at that Trump rally. Shermichael, she makes an interest -- an important point, I should say. There is no indication that this was a health issue. It was awkward. It was weird from plenty of people on the ground. It was bizarre. There was no, apparently, no security issue that required him to stay on stage. But, given what we've seen, are you concerned at all about his behavior? SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, what I think is, if you're running a campaign, you have to know your candidate, and the golden rule in politics is to do no harm. One thing that I have gleaned from Donald Trump, watching his campaign from when he first ran in 2016, is that he really sort of feeds off of the audience, off of the crowd. It's almost like he is an entertainer. He enjoys that. And so, I probably would have shortened the Q&amp;A, knowing this about my candidate. I would have shortened it to 20 minutes. Then I would have pivoted to allow him to make some remarks. I think that probably would have boded well for him. It would have been a little more controlled and sort of allowed his sort of natural tendencies to benefit him, which I think would have ultimately led to a better performance, and we probably would be covering this far differently than we currently are today.",

But, this is very much a step further than that.This is Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a letter directly to senior Israeli officials, saying, look, you have 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation. They write, quote, \"They need to see urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory.\" That means to improve the humanitarian situation. They also point out that humanitarian aid to Gaza has dropped by 50 percent since the spring, and that September was, quote, \"the lowest of any month during the past year in terms of humanitarian aid flowing into the Gaza Strip\". So, this is what they want to see addressed. It is the consequence here that is significant. For the past year, the U.S. has supplied Israel with effectively the weapons it needs to conduct its military operations, certainly defensive and very much offensive in Gaza and Lebanon, and they say, look, that's at risk by U.S. The U.S. has to continually evaluate that the foreign military assistance it provides is not being misused and does not violate U.S. law. They're saying that here is at risk if the humanitarian situation and Israel's efforts to address the humanitarian situation don't improve over the course of the next 30 days here, Erica.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry says China flew a record number of warplanes around the south governing island as part of a new round of war games. 153 Chinese aircraft were detected during military drills on Monday and Tuesday.

A previous pair made their way back to China with a new cub last November. This is the cargo jet that brought the new duo to the U.S. It is called, wait for it, the Panda Express. For its part, the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington spent a million dollars to revamp its panda exhibit before they arrived.

That's because there have been so many concerns about safety and security, the harassment that so many FEMA workers have faced in recent days, especially since Hurricane Helene hit much of the southeast.We know as well that there was that arrest on Saturday. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office in North Carolina arrested that 44-year-old who had been making threats to FEMA workers, and then was arrested in a vehicle outside of a relief site where donations had been given out, and he was armed with a rifle and a couple handguns.

This is all, of course, these interviews, part of an effort by the campaign to help bring about a more diverse electorate to shore up support for the candidate amid concerns about the erosion of support, specifically among black males, in this battle with Donald Trump.

And you would think that the line behind me would be the major story here. But, just about an hour ago, we got a ruling that we were standing by for from Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney that has to do with certification. This was stemming from a lawsuit brought forward by Julie Adams. She is a Republican on the Fulton County Board of Elections, and she made news in the spring by refusing to certify the presidential primary results.Judge McBurney, though, sending a very clear message in his ruling that certification is mandatory under Georgia law, and this is what he is saying and part of his ruling. \"If election superintendents were, as Plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so, because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud, refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced. Our Constitution and our Election Code do not allow for that to happen.\" I mentioned two rulings on certification that we're standing by for, the other having to do with a reasonable inquiry law that was passed earlier this summer by the State Board of Elections here, which Democrats fear could give a rogue election county worker the ability to decline certification.

Several Republican-run municipalities are opting against using the drop boxes, while they're being embraced in heavily Democratic cities. Critics allege that they could facilitate election fraud. For more, I want to bring in my colleague Sara Murray. So, those were the concerns, of course. Then there are the realities and the facts of whether there have or have not been fraud.

But, we have seen, from Donald Trump and from many of his allies, huge misinformation, especially around ballot drop boxes. We saw a ton of this around the 2020 election. Trump out there saying that the ballot boxes were being stuffed, that you could just take a ballot box and walk off with it. That's not the reality.But, what the reality is in some of these communities is that you have local mayors. You have local sheriffs who are not comfortable with these ballot drop boxes. They're worried about voter fraud or the appearance of voter fraud. And so, they're trying to make a decision for their communities that ballot drop boxes shouldn't be offered. And we attended a very feisty city council meeting where a mayor was trying to essentially do away with the community's ballot drop box, and the clerk was saying, look, this isn't your call. This is my call. And we saw very heated arguments from both sides of the aisle. We saw constituents who felt it was really important to keep this ballot box. This was in Wausau, Wisconsin. And we heard from plenty of others who felt like this was going to be a magnet, again, for ballot stuffing, for voter fraud, for that kind of thing. Ultimately, the drop box lives on in Wausau, Wisconsin. But, as you pointed out, that is not going to be the case in a variety of communities. And the way it works in Wisconsin is it's up to these different municipalities to decide if they're going to offer this drop box option to return ballots or not. So, this is an evolving situation, as you pointed out, even as these absentee ballots have gone out, and it's time to decide whether to return them and how to return them.",
