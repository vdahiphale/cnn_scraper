The controversial leader of the Wagner mercenary group is said to be one of ten people on board a private jet that went down Wednesday evening. No one survived the fiery crash.Officials say eight bodies have been recovered so far. And Prigozhin's body hasn't been officially identified. A video posted on the social media platform Telegram appears to show the jet plunging one of its wings missing. The plane was heading from Moscow to St. Petersburg. Flight data suddenly shows it stopped transmitting around 6 p.m. local time. Prigozhin was a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He led his mercenary forces in several key battles in the war in Ukraine but turned against Russian military leadership, staging a brief mutiny in June. US President Joe Biden suggested the plane crash may not have been an accident. Here he is.

I can tell you that in the light of day the focus is now on the crash site itself, trying to piece together the evidence that we can glean from images that are coming out of that as to what exactly happened here.State media are reporting that debris may have been spread over around a two kilometer radius. We're now hearing from RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, saying that a piece of the tail section has been found 3.5 kilometers away. So there appears to be some spread when it comes to the debris. There's images showing body bags being removed from the site. It's cordoned off by police. Seems to be a pretty rural area. So the focus is on that, but also some comments that we're getting in from eyewitnesses. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VITALY STEPENOIK, EYEWITNESS (through translator): I heard an explosion or a bang. Usually if an explosion happens on the ground, then you get an echo. But it was just a bang. And I looked up and saw white smoke. One wing flew off in one direction and the fuselage went like that and then it glided down on one wing. It didn't nosedive, it was gliding.

Thanks so much for being here with us. So I just want to start with your reaction to this. I mean, it always seemed from the minute that Prigozhin's short-lived mutiny failed, as though he was on borrowed time, given Putin's grim track record. EDWARD LUCAS, NON-RESIDENT SR. FELLOW AND SR. ADVISER, CENTER FOR EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS: Yes, Kim, I think either Putin was on borrowed time or Prigozhin was on borrowed time. One didn't really feel that Russia or indeed the planet was a big enough place for both of them. Putin really was a public figure. He called Prigozhin a traitor. Prigozhin had launched this mutiny and before that had insulted Putin personally using language that one couldn't use on CNN. And so after the failure of the mutiny, this sort of temporary fix where Prigozhin was allowed to go and live in the Russian client state of Belarus and seemed to resume more or less his role in Russian public life. That always had to be temporary. And so I thought it would probably be falling out of a window that would be his end, as it is it was a plane falling out of the sky.",

      "sentences": "Well, you wrote in the aftermath of the Prigozhin mutiny that, quote here, \"the Russian leader's power rests on his reputation for competence and decisiveness.\" So if Prigozhin were killed on Putin's order, it would reinforce the other aspect of the president's image, which is as a vengeful strongman. I mean, what message do you think this sends to his rivals? And does this hint at a wider purge, do you think? LUCASseen General Surovikin, who was perhaps the most successful of the Russian generals in the Ukraine war, has been relieved of his role as an Air Force general. And it's thought that he may have been sympathetic to Surovikin. And we've also seen some other signs of purges inside the Russian elite. And so I think the system is fundamentally unstable. It relied as I wrote a few months ago on Putin's reputation for omniscience, for knowing everything and omnipotence, being able to do everything, and for getting things right. And clearly he's not getting things right. It's not just the war in Ukraine. But Prigozhin should never have been able to launch that mutiny in the first place. That's what you have military intelligence for. And having launched it and having failed, he should have been behind bars or dead by the end of the day, not running around, grandstanding. So I think that it shows the fundamental weakness of the Putin regime that it's got to this stage. And I think we also are going to see several more shoes falling here as the rouse go on about the division of the spoils who gets Prigozhin's enormously lucrative empire of dirty tricks (inaudible) operations in other countries and so on and that will be also a lot of paranoia within the Putin's circle about who may be up he lay it down what's going to happen next.",

The four-time indicted former president is set to leave his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club in the afternoon and fly to Atlanta to turn himself in over the Georgia election subversion case.He's expected to be processed at the Fulton County Jail, where officials say he'll be treated like any other criminal defendant. Trump has already agreed to a $200,000 cash bond. He plans to return to New Jersey in the evening. Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani is one of three former attorneys with the Trump team who voluntarily surrendered to Fulton County authorities on Wednesday. We'll have more on that in a moment. So far, nine of Trump's 18 co-defendants in the Georgia election subversion case have turned themselves in ahead of Friday's deadline.

So Trump loomed large even in his absence, but for the most part, the candidates avoided talking about the 40-point elephant not in the room, as the moderator said. Was he really the big winner here? BROWNSTEINclearly was. I mean, Trump made the calculation which I think many political consultants would have supported as a whole, you know, hard- cold political assessment, that he was so far ahead, he didn't need to elevate or give oxygen to these other candidates by appearing on a stage with them. And it was incumbent on them to make him regret and then ultimately reconsider that decision by using his absence to make a case effectively against him. And again, apart from the one question where into the issue of his legal vulnerability. And you saw Christie and Hutchinson raise those arguments about, you know, his behavior. Really no one else over the course of the two hours, apart from Haley once on coming at him from the right on the debt really made him a target. I mean, there was nothing that happened there that would cause Trump to reconsider his choice, not even to engage with these candidates. As long as they use his absence to go after each other. Why would he ever put himself in a position where they can, you know, challenge him directly? It looked, the people I talked to after the debate, it looked an awful lot like the strategy of the Republican candidates in 2016, where they avoided direct confrontation with Trump and the hope that eventually something somehow would cause his support to peel away and they would be in position to pick it up if they weren't viewed by his voters as too antagonistic toward him. It didn't work then and by every indication it is not working now and you have to think that after this debate, if the candidates are really running to beat him as opposed to being his cabinet or vice president, there would be a reassessment of their approach tonight.

So David, take us through Wagner's role in some African countries.DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it came long before Wagner became a worldwide name because of its involvement in the Ukraine War. The military group was working across the African continent and the Middle East. If you look at this map, here are some of the areas that in the past and currently Wagner has been operating. Now, their operations have been a combination of direct military involvement, such as Mozambique and at the moment in Central African Republic and in the West African country of Mali. But they've also been involved critically in so-called psyops, in trying to persuade citizens and leaders to shift their allegiance away from the West towards Russia. This is something that CNN has reported on extensively over the years. And it's notable that the most recent video of Prigozhin alive appeared to be from the African continent, where he said he was ready to expand their operations there. Wagner has been making a play to get involved in Niger, the country that recently had a coup. The group is roundly condemned for human rights abuses in their operations on the continent, including as Nick was reporting, their executions and wholesale attacks on groups that included civilians. The U.K. Parliamentary Investigation Group recently said that it was a significant failure of the U.K. and one can expand that to other countries of not paying enough attention to Wagner's operations on the continent and the impact that it's had.

The big question is how much influence did he have on the day-to-day operations on Wagner, given his outsized personality, you can believe it was pretty substantial.And let's not forget there may have been other key Wagner officials on that plane that crashed. So if the operations headquarters in terms of manpower has been taken out as it were, or has died, then it could have a significant impact. The places to watch, I think, are in Central African Republic and in Mali in particular, where the governments there and the junta have been dependent on Wagner in providing security. And Wagner, for its part, has been dependent on those countries for getting monetary assistance and directly mining precious minerals to help support their operations across the world. Now, if their leadership structure collapses now, that could have a very significant impact in the short term on Wagner's operation and in the long term on those countries' security status. Kim?",
