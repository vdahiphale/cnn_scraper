Professor, the official narrative is that the Kremlin had nothing to do with this plane crash. But we now do have official confirmation from the Kremlin that the Wagner chief died in that crash. What do you make of the mourners now openly gathering at a makeshift Prigozhin memorial in Moscow? Do you think that in depth, you know, what significance is the Wagner chief taking on?KIMBERLY MARTEN, PROF. OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, BARNARD COLLEGE: Well, you know, first of all, I think that it's pretty clear that it is very convenient for the Kremlin that Prigozhin died, whether or not they ever take responsibility for having done it. Prigozhin had been a thorn in Putin side for the last couple of months after he staged the mutiny in late June. And it's not surprising that there are some mourners for him, but the size of the crowd is relatively small. And something to keep in mind is that there are no armed Wagner formations on Russian territory at the moment. And so it would be impossible for a Wagner group these days to stage another mutiny as Prigozhin did in late June.",

And in fact, the group was named after him. His nom de guerre was Wagner, because he saw Richard Wagner as being the composer that the Nazi government in Germany was fond of, and he considered himself to be fond of the Nazis.So that's one of the people that died, that may have great resonance for people who were in the Wagner group. But there's no evidence that in recent years, he had been doing that much directly for Wagner, the other person who's very significant is Valeriy Chekalov. And the reason that he's so significant is that he was running Prigozhin's businesses in Syria, and was also apparently responsible for logistics. And so in addition to having military experience himself, he was somebody who really had a handle on the business empire that was associated with Prigozhin. And so again, it was a convenient person for Putin to have we gotten out of the way so that other people in the Kremlin can take over the business enterprises associated with Prigozhin.",

And so it's telling that the only way that if what we believe is true that this was an assassination, it's telling that the only way that he was able to feel comfortable in controlling Prigozhin was to have him killed.In a sense, as many people have said, it's almost like a mafia way of acting. It's not the way we expect a normal government to act. But certainly we'll have to look forward to see what is happening next. One question that remains unanswered is how the Russian troops in the field in Ukraine fighting right now in that war that Putin launched last year, how they feel about it, how much respect they had for Prigozhin, and whether they feel that this instability sort of negates what they've been doing by putting their lives on the line for Russia.",

It is from the state of Uttar Pradesh in India which is governed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu Nationalist Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party and this is what it shows. 39 seconds of complete torture of a seven-year-old young Muslim boy. He is being slapped on the forehead, on the face, and then on the waist. And all of this, the instructions of the class teacher sitting there on her chair and selecting three boys to come up one after the other to hit him. Now the police have opened a case and an investigation in this incident and they have said, and I'm going to quote them here, \"It's come to our awareness that the female teacher declared when the mothers of Mohammedan students don't pay attention to the children's studies, their performance is ruined.\" Now, you also have the opposition that has condemned the incident. This video, like I said, has gone viral online and has led to widespread condemnation and dismay. Rahul Gandhi from the main opposition political party here in India has tweeted, and here is what he said and I'm going to quote him here. \"Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like a school into a marketplace of hatred.\" This is the same (INAUDIBLE) spread by the BJP that has set every corner of India on fire. So he is obviously blaming the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, the Indian prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief minister of the state of Uttar Pradesh for the \"religious intolerance,\" quote unquote, that he talks about here. This comes at a time when the Muslims in India, which is about 14 percent of the total population in India, according to activists have been persecuted over the years and have been facing harassment and have been marginalized, according to activists across the country. There has been widespread condemnation on this one incident. The teacher in that video has been quite belligerent and openly asking for those children to thrash this young boy, who keeps wailing, Laila, he keeps crying through that video. This is torture and the psychological effects on that young boy, of course, cannot even be explained here. Back to you.",

They will relieve four astronauts from the Crew-6 mission, who are due to fly home next weekend.

But the new arrivals said they look forward to working with everyone, stressing the need for unity and cooperation in space. A new study suggests the connections that we feel with our loved ones don't always end after death. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, more than half of Americans say they have been visited by a dead relative in their dreams or in some other form. Many also reported to feeling a late relative presence or even having their loved one communicate with them. Researchers say that a survey included responses from Americans of all religious backgrounds, including Buddhists, Jews and Muslims. That is very reassuring. It was a magical event in Germany, hundreds of Harry Potter fans dressed up as the Boy Wizard to successfully break the world record for the most Harry Potters to gather in one place. A total of 1,748 people showed up at Hamburg City Hall topping the previous world record of 997 costumed fans.
