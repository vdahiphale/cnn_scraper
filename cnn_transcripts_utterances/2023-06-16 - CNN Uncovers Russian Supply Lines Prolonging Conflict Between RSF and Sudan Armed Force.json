The conflict in Sudan has now enteredits third month and since it began in April, more than one million children have been displaced. That is according to UNICEF. Tragically it says 330 children have been among the fatalities there. The conflict broke out in April between Sudan's army and the paramilitary rapid support forces and despite numerous attempts at ceasefires, the fighting rages on. Civilians are suffering, with the U.N. reporting most hospitals near conflict areas are actually out of service. While Sudanese rights organizations say atrocities are being committed in Darfur, and CNN has uncovered evidence that the Russian mercenary group Vagna is complicit continuing to support Sudan's rapid support forces paramilitary throughout the months of fighting, despite calls by the way by U.S. and others for support to cease. An exclusive CNN investigation, we uncovered the Russian supply lines, prolonging the conflict between the RSF and Sudan's armed forces that have displaced around two million people since mid-April and pushed the country further into a humanitarian crisis. The RSF denies links to Wagner and any involvement in mass rape. As part of this investigation, CNN verified and corroborated incidents of rape perpetrated by the RSF, including one which was captured on video that we feel, it is important in the face of the RSF's repeated denials to broadcast part of that video. But we must warn you, it is graphic and it is disturbing. Here's CNN's Nima Elbagir (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The U.S. State Department responded to CNN's investigation saying that attacks on civilians must end.The Department's Africa Bureau tweeted that the war has brought back rape, murder, ethnic-based killings and the destruction of whole villages in Darfur. The blame, according to the statements you can see there, lies with the RSF and its allies. Well, Russia meanwhile has launched a massive missile attack on Kyiv, even as African leaders arrived in Ukrainian capital on a mission of peace. Ukraine says at least six people were injured as residential areas were hit. Ukraine's military claims it brought down a dozen Russian missiles that includes six hypersonic Kinzhals. And the African delegation includes South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who's been criticized for his close ties to the Kremlin. The leaders will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That will happen today and then they will head to Russia for talks with President Vladimir Putin that is happening on Saturday. Meanwhile, there is fierce fighting on the southern front. Early on Friday, Ukraine said its soldiers have had partial success and that Russian troops put desperate resistance around Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Russia has a different take on the war's progress. President Vladimir Putin says Ukraine is not breaking through Russia's defenses and will soon run out of military equipment. He spoke earlier at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Mr. Putin also says that Kyiv's losses on the battlefield are 10 times that of Moscow's and that Ukraine has no chance against Russia. Keeping an eye across all these new developments, Sam Kylie is following all of this from us from Kyiv. And Sam, I think it's fair to say, look, it's been a while since you and I have spoken about diplomatic efforts at least to end this war. So, talk us through this African delegation, what they're hoping to achieve and whether Kyiv is potentially on board with their peace initiative here. Sam.",

Well, U.N. agencies are calling for urgent as well as decisive action to prevent more deaths at sea after the latest disaster on the Mediterranean. A boat carrying hundreds of migrants sank on Wednesday killing at least 78 people. Many of the survivors were transferred by bus to a migrant camp near Athens on Friday. Nine crew members have been arrested on suspicion of people smuggling and other charges. Our Melissa Bell has more now from Kalamata in Greece. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Nine Egyptian men have been arrested on suspicion of people trafficking, just some of those who survived the disaster of Wednesday morning here, not far from the coast off of Greece. Those men now are under arrest. The other survivors, most of them, those who are not still in hospital, have now been transferred towards Athens where their asylum applications will be processed. It is, of course, the fate of the other now believed to have been many hundreds who may have lost their lives that has been forefront of the mind of so many people hoping for answers, some of those, desperate relatives that turned up here in Kalamata hoping that their loved ones had survived. As the survivors were taken away to Athens, one man who'd been looking for his brother was able to see him, touch him, hold him through a fence. Most of those who turned up here in Kalamata, of course, were disappointed. Given the scale of the tragedy is now believed that 750 people may have been traveling on the boat, we may never know their true numbers and we're unlikely ever to know their actual name. We do understand from the survivors that there were women and children on board. They were in the hold and, of course, given what the Greek Coast Guard say about the 10 to 15 minutes that it took for the boat to sink, they had very little hope of being able to make it out. What the NGOs that work in places like Kalamata and all around the Mediterranean fear now is that given the tightening of European policies with regard to immigration, that these kinds of tragedies may actually increase.

MPD officers discharge firearms at people without assessing whether the person presents any threat, let alone a threat that would justify deadly force. We also found that MPD officers routinely disregard the safety of people in their custody.

An Africa delegation,including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will meet the Ukrainian president on Friday and then head to Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin. That's happening on Saturday. They see a chance to mediate in a war that has hit African countries especially hard while the war is impacting the global food supply chain. The fallout of course from the war is aggravating food insecurity in Africa, as well as food inflation, and worsening an existing hunger crisis. A Black Sea grain export deal has helped alleviate some of that pressure, but Russia has threatened to quit the agreement separately. The leaders are trying to make a difference when it comes to issues of global governance from peace in Ukraine to climate change. Well, the African Union has had success in mediating peace. If you remember, it got Ethiopia, as well as Tigray fighters to lay down their arms. Can this African delegation have an impact?

And so, the hope from the African part is that they have won some sort of goodwill with Russia. I am skeptical of how successful they can be because as your correspondent said, even as they arrived in Kyiv, Kyiv came under a barrage of missiles from Russia. And where China has failed, where France has failed, where Turkey hasn't been able to make much progress, it just seems unlikely that this delegation of Africans is going to be able to make a significant, move the dial significantly more than has been moved already.",

The idea that the Ukrainians would abandon some sort of justice for them through the International Criminal Court process seems really unlikely. And it's also unlikely that the Russians acquiesce, would remove tactical nuclear weapons because it gives them some sort of leverage and negotiation.

So, this is an attempt for Africans to make a substantive contribution to issues of global governance, as you said, whether it be on climate change or now in this situation, the war in Ukraine.

They've always maintained that independence. So, yeah, I think the presence of Ramaphosa on the team will raise those questions in the West. However, from the African perspective, it would seem that because South Africa has already endured a lot from its Western partners because of this relationship with Russia, it gives South Africa leverage. And so, that leverage attempts to bolster what leverage the Africans themselves can wield. But, yeah, you're right. Some on the delegation voted against resolutions - - voted for resolutions condemning Russia, and others haven't.

We are going to turn our focus now to Africa and the Biden administration'seffort to enhance the U.S. presence on the continent. When Joe Biden hosted an African leaders' summit in December, he concluded it with a surprise commitment. He pledged to visit Sub-Saharan Africa sometime this year, the first president to visit the heart of the continent in nearly a decade. In February, U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, if you remember, spent five days visiting Namibia and Kenya, carrying a message of how the U.S. can help to grow democracy as well as empower women. But China and Russia are pressing their own African agendas. China, in particular, has made investments in Africa a priority. China is Africa's largest trading partner, reportedly doing four times as much business with Africa as the U.S. does. All of this comes as many the African nations are pushing to be bigger players on the world stage as shown of course by today's visit as we've been discussing by African leaders to war-torn Kyiv, Ukraine. Time now for The Exchange. And joining me now is the man planning Joe Biden's visit to Africa later this year, Johnnie Carson has been U.S. Ambassador to Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe. He's currently the U.S. Special Presidential Representative for U.S. Africa Leaders Summer Implementation.

I can't get a job. My pop didn't like the way French was going. And he wanted to leave French. I just remember my mother working two, three jobs. I walked in on my mother one time crying, praying. You don't want to see a mother like that. What other options you got? I hit the streets. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the story started from then, and the story finished when she came back. Because it was, you know, we came here immigrants, we came here with no papers, my father came. He tried different businesses that didn't work, he went back, so my mother stayed. She did not know English, welfare. I mean, you know, the grind of all grinds, you know. Me hustling any day can get deported. You know, my brother got deported. It was a leap of faith, you know, and my mother just stayed in the States for 25 years to make sure we -- was good without seeing her family at all for 25 years. So, when she went back and I took her back, she finally met up with them. That was the moment where it was just like, okay, the story made sense.",

But I still have to push through and stay strong and still make it happen. They always see French Montana doing this, you know, conquering certain things. That's cool that's highlighted. You know people always go but what's not highlighted is the struggle and the things that happen that without them there wouldn't be no French Montana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
