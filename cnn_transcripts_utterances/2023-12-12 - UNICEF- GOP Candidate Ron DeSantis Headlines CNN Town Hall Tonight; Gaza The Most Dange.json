You know, and in many of these areas where the fighting is most severe, obviously, civilians have been ordered from their homes. But when that happens, those who remain are often the most vulnerable, those who cannot leave. Often this is elderly, elderly individuals, family with elderly parents, with young children, with children with disabilities. You know, when we speak to parents, they are exhausted, mentally, physically, just absolutely shattered by the exertion of trying to keep their children alive on a day-to-day basis.You know, it is hard to imagine just the sheer level of terror, of pain, of misery that families are going through every day, each and every day. And the parents are making impossible choices. Do you stay? Do you take the risk of moving when we've seen the fighting move around the territory? Even basics like water, you know, is now potentially a death threat for children. We know that there is just not enough, and the water that is there could make children sick.

Four women testified at a Senate hearing about how they were victims of sexual harassment and assault while at the Coast Guard Academy.

Lawmakers blasted the Coast Guard for mishandling and covering up years of sexual abuse, especially at the Coast Guard Academy. That is until CNN started reporting on it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Nothing. Until CNN disclosed it. If CNN hadn't disclosed it we might still not know about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But both Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator, and Republican Senator Ron Johnson said this was the most powerful testimony they have heard. And that is because four brave women agreed to tell their stories of sexual assault, including a cadet at the Coast Guard Academy.CNN has uncovered a long history of rapes and other sexual assault within the Coast Guard that were often mishandled or hidden. And when the Coast Guard did a years long investigation to figure out the depth of the problem, they kept the results a secret. That meant the Coast Guard didn't fix its issues and raise awareness about them. Though the current Coast Guard Commandant has ordered sweeping changes since our first reporting five months ago. Now the women who testified today represent decades of service in the Coast Guard and most of them faulted Coast Guard leadership. Which in the past made it difficult to report sexual assaults. Many times the victims were punished if alcohol was involved while their assailants went free. They were even promoted in some cases. Current cadet Kyra Grace Holmstrup was raped by a fellow cadet on campus and says while the reporting process has improved and she was given a victims advocate and counselor, which many of the other women hadn't been given, she still had difficulty with leadership. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CADET KYRA GRACE HOLMSTRUP, U.S. COAST GUARD ACADEMY CLASS OF '24: And then I got to talk to a chaplain. And when I went to talk to that chaplain, he asked me who assaulted me. And I told him. And he said, oh no, he's such a good guy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
