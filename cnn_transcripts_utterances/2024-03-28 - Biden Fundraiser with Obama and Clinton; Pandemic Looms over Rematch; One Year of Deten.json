And tonight these donors will get a taste and a preview of what this general election fight will look like as President Biden, former President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton are on stage at Radio City Music Hall for this high dollar fundraiser that so far the campaign says has brought in more than $25 alone.If you take a look at Biden's fundraising advantage over Trump, he already has about $71 million in the bank. That's just in his campaign account. It's about double that when you factor in the Democratic Committee's as well. Then for Trump, he has $33.5 million. So really this will help advance the president's fundraising agenda as he's looking to gear up his operation to take on Trump in November. But really this speaks to a high-stakes moment also for the involvement of the former presidents. Advisors I've spoken with from - for both Biden and Obama have said that they want to strategically deploy Obama going into the election. They feel fundraising is a big way to see it. We likely won't see him on the campaign trail though until the fall as early voting gets started.",

All while crooked Joe Biden is laughing his way to the bank.\" Matt, he is doing something pretty specific here. I mean the language is very harsh.

And while we have moved on, of course, from lockdowns, mask mandates, virtual school, the memory of the pandemic really still haunts American life, and it may influence what voters do in November as they face the same choice this time that they faced in 2020. As a recent \"New York Times\" analysis notes, public confidence in institutions has slumped since 2020 and just hasn't recovered. Fears of political violence and even civil war are at record highs. National happiness rankings are at record lows. And the view of the economy remains extraordinarily bleak. Josh Rogin, let me just get you to weigh in, big picture. This was a worldwide pandemic. We're not just seeing it in the United States. We are seeing it across the world. But it is really impacting our current politics. JOSH ROGIN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Of course. I think for a lot of understandable reasons, people want to memory hold the pandemic. They want to just pretend it never happened. Of course, the Trump campaign would love to pretend that it never happened because that forces people to put themselves back in that situation in mid-2020 where all of our lives were affected dramatically and people around us were dying, people were losing their careers, people were losing their businesses. And I think if we're being honest about that period, we have to say that the Trump administration handled it terribly and that they, you know - I documented at the time, President Trump, you know, ignored the early warnings. He minimized the pandemic for a while. He told us to put bleach into our skin to fix it on national TV and, you know -",

I don't think he understands counterinsurgency.

If the goal is to eliminate Hamas, is the prime minister, Netanyahu, accomplishing that, or is he causing another generation of people who are going to want to violently oppose Israel?",

There's no way that the Palestinians or Israelis will ever live in peace as long as a terrorist organization, with the destruction of Israel written into its charter, is in charge of the Palestinian people. So, everyone who wants peace, whether you're on the Palestinian side or the Israeli side, or somewhere in-between, we should want the elimination of Hamas.But I agree that Prime Minister Netanyahu's strategy is not getting us there. One of the key lessons that we learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, again, after making a lot of mistakes along the way, is that with every innocent civilian that you kill, it serves as a recruiting tool for the other side. And by that measure, Netanyahu has clearly recruited a lot more terrorists than he's eliminated. And if you actually get into the details of the math here, how many they say they have actually killed, you - it really raises this question. And I think that that's why - and, again, this is not going to end in a few weeks. This is a much longer-term game with an ultimate political solution at the end of the day that Israel has yet to define.",

Remember that when the Republicans kicked out Kevin McCarthy, we went for three weeks without a speaker. Congress was frozen. The first time in American history that that has happened. That would never happen under our Democratic watch. It's certainly not going to happen under a Democratic speaker. And so we will be on board with trying to reduce the chaos that Republicans are bringing to Congress and, frankly, all across the country, headlined by people like Marjorie Taylor Greene.So, I think that a Speaker Johnson is actually willing to work with us, then we might be able to make a deal. Remember, Democrats reached out multiple times at multiple levels, even myself, just to colleagues in the House to try to strike a deal with Kevin McCarthy, and he absolutely refused. He absolutely refused to even talk to Democrats about finding such a deal. I think Johnson was - is probably wiser than that. But make no mistake, I don't think Johnson is a great speaker. We've had the least productive Congress since the Great Depression. It's just a question of trying to avert the Republican chaos. And that's why Democrats are always willing to talk.",

But we're also now talking about IVF, right, and we're talking about what this means for people who want to start or grow a family, but also we're going to see attacks on the access to contraception.
