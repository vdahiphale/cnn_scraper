      "sentences": "Breaking news just into CNN, a judge in the State of Georgia has just issued a ruling in Donald Trump'selection subversion case. The prosecutor Fanni Willis can stay on the case. Ryan Young is with us this hour, this is hugely significant. Fanni Willis will continue to be able to prosecute this case. But there are it seems, conditions Ryan explain. RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Well, the conditions the part that we're still trying to read through at this moment, this ruling just came down it several different pages. We've been able to scramble just to get to the point where we know that she'll be allowed to stay on this case. And this as far as the prosecution is concerned, this is really important in terms of the timing. We know that this prosecution wanted to be able to start this trial sometime before the election. If there was a change at the top, we know that that would probably delay things. There's already a chance that this will not happen before the 2024 election, because in Fulton County, especially for a racketeering case, it could take months for a jury to be set. So I know that ruling came down in the last five or six minutes or so we're actually pouring through it right now. I have a producer sitting behind the camera, who's actually reading some of the pages from the judge. But what we know is two weeks ago, Judge McAfee said this would be the timing for the decision. And, of course, Fanni Willis has been trying to do whatever she could to make sure she stayed on next case. And for people who are out there who may not remember all the particulars here, Donald Trump's attorneys were able to bring to light some of the information about Fanni Willis and her lead prosecutor Nathan Wade having a relationship, when did this relationship start? And did she have any sort of benefit from this relationship over the months that this has been going on? And so Fanni Willis was basically saying this relationship started after she hired Nathan Wade. Nathan Wade was going through a divorce. And inside that divorce, several parts of this conversation started to come out that they were traveling together. Fanni Willis said she used her own money to pay back Nathan Wade for some of these trips. But then people started looking at all the extra money Nathan Wade was making. And he was saying was because of all the long hours for this case of racketeering case of this size, is quite an undertaking. So you understand what they were sort of trying to say that he was working extra hard, and there was no impropriety there. But I think the judges and some of the early indications, sees that some of this does not look right. And the fact of the matter is Fanni Willis gets to stay. We're not sure if Nathan Wade will get to stay on this case, based upon what we're reading so far, in terms of this ruling. So again, this just coming out in the last three minutes or so, I believe it's over 20 pages. So I haven't had a chance to read it all the way through and describe what he is basically saying, but we do know that the DA gets to stay in this case. And you got to think the political ramifications, especially for Fanni Willis, she's running to keep her seat as district attorney. So she gets the stay on this case. And we'll read through the rest and bring it to you a little later on.",

AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Absolutely, she's been very clear that she didn't see any reason that she should be disqualified or not have an opportunity to continue in the case.

But presumably, she will find someone in Fulton County that she can bring on board because Nathan Wade was a critical part of her team. He did a substantial amount of work on this case, and I suspect that she'll need someone to replace him if indeed, he does resign or she asked him to resign consistent with the judge's decision. But the case will move forward. Hopefully it'll get back on track and the judge will set some dates and the prosecution of Donald Trump and Co-Defendants will continue.",

But when you look at the evidence that was presented, the defendants burden of proof, they hadto prove that there was a some kind of financial incentive that Fanni Willis received as a result of selecting Nathan Wade to be on this case. And quite frankly, they failed to meet that burden. They did not establish that. They in fact, had no evidence to suggest that she did that. They had evidence that they took trips together that charges were made to Nathan Wade's credit card statement, but Fanni Willis testified that she repaid him. And they were not able to discredit her on the fact that she paid for all of the trips and all of the -- you know engagements that they had together. So there wasn't evidence. So I think what the judge was moved by in this case, and he makes reference to there being the appearance of impropriety. And yes, of course, you have the former law partner to Nathan Wade giving very inconsistent testimony to what he had said in text messages to Trump's attorney. And you had a disgruntled employee who contradicted the testimony of Wade and Fanni Willis. So arguably, you can make the claim an appearance, but that's not what the Georgia law requires, which is why this judge has not disqualified Fanni Willis. But you have to imagine the tremendous pressure that the judge was under this. He just kind of split the baby. He did something that he thought would appease both sides. He left Fanni Willis on the case, but he disqualified Nathan Wade or basically said Nathan Wade, had to resign. I wish the judge had had more courage. And I wish the judge had helped these defendants to the fact that they did not prove their case.",

So this decision, I totally agree. It is an actual conflict of interest standard. The judge found she couldn't meet that. He did impose this appearance of impropriety standard. As I said best bad decision and that the DA's office can cure any concerns the judge has if Mr. Wade resigns, that will be a blow to the team. Fortunately, the DA's Office has a deep bench. There are 10 or 11 people who sign off on pleadings in this case. So oh, yeah hopefully they can get somebody in and make him or her the Chief Operating Officer, which I think is what Mr. Wade did.",

As far as procedure, the judge expressed some concernabout what the appropriate standard was, at least in the earlier hearing. He tried to remedy the appearance of impropriety by suggesting that either Wade resign or Willis' office resign. Georgia has a procedure for an intermediate appeal. That would gum up the works if the judge would sign off on an intermediate appeal, if the Court of Appeals would take it. The only time limit on that would be a decision prior to December 31st, which would put them after the November for 5th presidential election. So I would try to gum it up procedurally. Substantively, you know, Mr. Trump likes to make his own spin on things. And I don't think he is exactly known for his silence about other people's foibles.

We -- I would not be surprised if Trump and team try to appeal this decision. But ultimately, with Fanni Willis remaining on this case, this means that Trump and the Co-Defendants will have to face the underlying charges, which is what this case has always been about. So as much as I don't like the ruling, I am glad to see that Fanni Willis will remain on the case. I think it is the right thing -- with a defense attorney, there was absolutely no reason for Fanni Willis to be disqualified because of a personal relationship.

The evidence is strong. There are recordings there are Republican officials who are testifying against him at the trial, the Georgia's Governor, Georgia Secretary of State, both of whom are Republicans. This is an important case, and it has important follow on effects in the sense that if he were convicted of federal crimes, and if he were reelected, he could pardon himself.

She's very clear eyed about that. She's clear eyed about -- clear eyed about her responsibilities. And who her -- you know obligations her fiduciary duties are as a district attorney. So I disagree with the judge. I don't think she would be unduly influenced by Nathan Wade. Clearly, Donald Trump, in all of his efforts to delay, the various trials that are pending against him is always going to engage in smear tactics. He's always going to attack the credibility. He's going to attack the character of the prosecutors. We've seen him do it with respect to Letitia James in New York. And this is a case that is no different. It doesn't matter what these people did or how they conducted themselves. Trump's playbook is to attack, attack and attack, and he's going to do so in this case. So I think, again, the judge, decision partially right. But more importantly, Fanni Willis gets to stay on the case.

He's been on the bench for eight months. He used to work for Fanni Willis. He was in the Major Crimes Division of Fulton County. I think she was several supervisory levels above him. And then he was also an Assistant United States Attorney, a federal prosecutor in the Atlanta Office of the United States Attorney's. He was there when the former president called on his boss, the U.S. Attorney, to institute the federal investigation into voting fraud in Georgia and his boss resigned.

And the defendants, the defense counsel, I should say, have pushed back on those comments. They want her to be disciplined for making those comments. They wanted the judge to take those comments into consideration as they -- as he considered this disqualification motion. But again, if you listen to the attacks that have been made against her, you cannot, I think conclude anything other than that they have been both racist and sexist. And again, a playbook that Donald Trump and his team use a frequently is to make racist comments sometimes coded, sometimes not.

When he was underinvestigation when he was in the White House, he did have lawyers that were assisting either the presidency or the White House or him personally, who had a lot of experience in that realm. And the folks he has now a top his defense teams, particularly in Georgia responding to the Fulton County case. And then his top defense attorney in many of the other criminal cases, but namely, the person who's going to try his case, or be his main defense attorney in the New York Attorney General's hush money cases, first criminal case likely to go to trial. Those are courtroom lawyers, with a lot of experience, who know those courts quite well, and the systems and the people, the judges, the jury pools in those two areas in New York and Georgia very, very well. And so it's not like he has people who are inexperienced, he has savvy, people who are on his defense team. He also has, you know, defense attorneys who not only have some political experience, or at least have an understanding of how politics can factor into a court case. They're now serving Trump and haven't had many shifts in recent months. And so they're learning as they go along. How this is working? They have to respond to each judge differently. And they have to take the opportunities where they can. Becky, a reminder, any time where Donald Trump is in court, and has one of these cases in front of him or he's a criminal defendant and they're not talking about him as the defendant and him seeing these charges when they're talking about Fanni Willis, that is a win on his behalf in just a political sense. And on top of that, the other thing that is always a win for Trump is any time there is the potential for delay. And here we just spent several weeks watching this judge work through this motion, rather than moving the case to trial here in Florida. We don't have a trial date for his federal classified documents case. And then of course, New York we don't know if that's going to get a delay as well.",

A judge in the Fulton County case has said that special prosecutor Nathan Wade should step aside if District Attorney Fanni Willis is to remain on the case in order to dispel the cloud of impropriety as he describes it created by their romantic relationships, So Areva Fanni Wade can stay on the case. We are guessing that she will stay on the case, as long as Nathan Wade steps aside. Just to get your kind of closing thoughts, if you will, this dropped about 45 minutes ago. We've discussed an awful lot about what this ruling means whether or not we believe when you believe that this is the right ruling and what happens next?
