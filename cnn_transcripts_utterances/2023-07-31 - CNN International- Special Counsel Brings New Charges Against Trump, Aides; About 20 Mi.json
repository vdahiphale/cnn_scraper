But I also think that Jack Smith has really strengthened his evidentiary hand from the trial. Under the rules of evidence, now, he's going to be able to bring in a lot more testimony regarding this obstructive scheme. Regarding acts that weren't even necessarily in that particular venue in Florida.

They were accused on Thursday, according to -- objected rather -- on Thursday, according to the Christian aid organization where she works. CNN's Athena Jones has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know U.S. authorities are working closely with their Haitian counterparts and with U.S. government interagency partners to try to resolve the crisis. But there's also a lot of things we don't know. It's unclear right now who is responsible for this kidnapping or whether they've made demands, whether for ransom or anything else. El Roi Haiti, which is the humanitarian organization, the Christian humanitarian organization this nurse for New Hampshire was working for put out a statement. Here's what they said in part. Alex is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alex has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus. Now El Roi has also said their highest priority is her safe return of this mother and her child. And they want to limit the amount of information they're sharing. We also heard from a State Department spokesperson saying they have no higher authority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. But this kidnapping comes at the time of welling concerns about the worsening violence in Haiti. It was just two years ago this month that then President Jovenel Moise was assassinated by a gang. And there's been a power vacuum ever since. With some gangs taking control of various different swathes of the country. The State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Haiti because of the frequency of kidnappings, crimes, civil unrest and also the poor health infrastructure. And just last week, the State Department ordered all family members and nonemergency personnel of the embassy to leave the country immediately because it's so unsafe. This came after at least three days in a row of restrictions when embassy staffers and families were supposed to stay there on the embassy compound because things were so dangerous. The U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during a recent visit to Haiti that Haitians are trapped in a living nightmare with humanitarian conditions that are beyond appalling. Guterres went on to say, we are calling for a robust security force deployed by member states to work hand-in-hand with the Haitian National Police to defeat and dismantle the gangs and restore security across the country. But the bottom line here, we're still awaiting for more details of this scary, dangerous situation there in Haiti. Athena Jones, CNN New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But there are contacts directly with the security services in Haiti. And so, what's happening right now is that the State Department, their bureau that handles international law, as well as the Justice Department and others who have been engaged for many years in dealing with these kinds of scenarios. They're reaching out to their Haitian counterparts.But remember about a year ago, we had roughly 20 missionaries kidnapped as well as well. And at that time the Justice Department and the FBI got involved through diplomatic contacts through the State Department orchestrating that to try to work with their counterparts in the security forces in Haiti to find the missing Americans. So that's likely what's happening right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "They haven't said anything yet. But no, they have been denied it. And this comes after comments by President Zelenskyy on Sunday. Essentially saying, you know, gradually he says the war is returning to the territory of Russia and this is an inevitable, natural and fair process, he says. And really this is the third time in four days that we seen Russia accused Ukraine of attacking its soil. This one a drone, according to the regional government in the Bryansk region -- and if we could pull up a map of that -- it's just across the northern border of Ukraine, really, on the border that he says that a building was hit. No casualties, it happened overnight. But they're cleaning up the damage.They didn't claim as of yet they had shot down that drone, whereas with the attacks on Moscow on Sunday. And then remember there was a missile that hit the Rostov region -- but didn't hit the Rostov region on Friday because so far Moscow's been claiming that it's been shooting them down. So that is potentially noteworthy. But separately, Max, this morning we're hearing of this missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, which is President Zelenskyy's hometown in central Ukraine. I think we can potentially show you a map of where that is as well. We're hearing so far that two buildings were hit. An educational institution and then apparently the second missile -- this is according to the interior minister -- destroyed a section from the fourth to ninth floors of a residential building. So far there's only one person killed, 10 injured. But they are concerned that people are still trapped under the rubble. So rescue efforts continue there. It was just six weeks ago that the same town was hit by a missile attack that killed 11 people.",

And they're trying really to bring in, as you say, not just their Western allies, the traditional allies that provide weapons, that impose sanctions on Russia and things like that, they're trying to bring in the likes of India and Brazil. Really the countries that Russia has been trying to court. And certainly we saw the African summit continues to try to court the developing world.So this will happen in Saudi Arabia. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says that it will happen this coming weekend. So crucial to watch that. They say that it will be leading up to potentially a leader summit at the end of the year, not involving Moscow, though.",

The president of Chad traveled to Niger's capital hoping to find a political solution. The images of him with the country's ousted president, Mohamed Bazoum, may be the first public picture of Bazoum since he was deposed in a military coup on Wednesday. Meanwhile, thousands took to the streets to express support for the two leaders. Niger is a former French colony. But some of the most tense demonstrations were held outside the French Embassy. Protesters damaged the building, chanting against colonialism and waved Russian flags. In neighboring Nigeria regional economic leaders hit Niger with a host of sanctions and threatened to use CNN' force if the coup leaders don't restore the elected president within a week. CNN's Larry Madowo is monitoring this crisis from Nairobi. Two cross pressures here. The one from outside the country in support of the president it seems. And also a lot of support being shown within the country for the coup leaders.",
