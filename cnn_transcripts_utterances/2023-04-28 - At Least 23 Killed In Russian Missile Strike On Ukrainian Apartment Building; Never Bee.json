They're trying to reach their children through cell phones, but getting no answer. Here is what happened today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice over): As usual, the terror comes at night as Ukraine tries to sleep. A mother described hearing the missile roar in and throwing her children into the bathtub, under pillows. Another filmed the seconds afterwards. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): My God. I never thought this would happen. A rocket hit our building. I am covered in blood. I don't know. My windows were blown out. This is the kids' room, but we're all alive. We're just all covered in blood. God, we don't have windows, anything. I'm so afraid. WALSH (voice over): As usual, as dawn clarifies the victims in this apartment block in Uman, it was only those hoping to escape the war. SERHII LUBIVSKY, UMAN RESIDENT (through translator): We felt the impact, heard the explosion. We were on a balcony until 7P:00 AM. All the rooms were full of smoke. WALSH (voice over): The rubble hiding some of the agony, but also surrendering some throughout the day, this body removed hours later. That morning, as tension around a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive grows, Russia fired 23 missiles only two got past Ukraine's NATO improved air defenses. But lest you think the horror of Uman an error, similar strikes hit buildings in Dnipro and also killed a 31-year-old woman and her two- year-old. They had fled the war to this, her parents' suburban home, but its savagery found them. Kyiv is hoping to turn the tables, slowly taking out valuable Russian targets in the south like this radar system. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) WALSH (voice over): With social media videos fueling fears like this one, apparently showing a Russian ammo depot hit in occupied areas that Ukraine will soon assault. (PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language.) WALSH (voice over): Kyiv very silent about when and where they will attack, which made this day's comments by the Defense Minister about their high readiness, particularly intriguing. OLEKSII REZNIKOV, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): In a global sense, we are ready in a high percentage mode. The next question is up to the general staff. As soon as it is God's will, the weather and the commander's decision, we will do it. WALSH (voice over): Ukraine's need to move mounting as Russian lashes out. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

General Hertling, today, we heard the Ukrainian foreign minister say in the aftermath of these latest attacks that: \"The way to peace is to arm Ukraine with F-16s.\" This has suddenly been talked about certainly since the beginning of the war. Are fighter jets the answer? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I don't believe they are, Anderson, and I know this has been a debate and I know I'm going to get heat for saying this. But you just don't put a pilot in a different kind of airplane and expect the kind of results that the US and NATO forces have seen in conflicts around the world. It takes years to train that kind of capability, where you have a coordination between the ground forces and the air forces with close air support, with combat air patrols, all of those things are critical. It is beyond the measure of just putting a pilot in a seat and training them on flying the airplane. It's that coordination between ground and air. That is what is so difficult. That takes years to do. What we're seeing right now is there is no magic potion to stopping Russia attacking Ukrainian villages, hitting Ukrainian civilian targets. Those are war crimes. What is critical right now is the combined arms operations that the Ukrainian ground forces are going to do within the next several weeks. They are going to coordinate their new infantry fighting vehicles, their strikers, their artillery, their additional tanks into a ground campaign. The air would be great if they had it, but they don't have it and that is not something that can be completed within weeks or months, it is just --",

You're either force-oriented or terrain-oriented. The Ukrainian force is going to be terrain-oriented. They are going to look to regain ground. They have to do that in a quick lightning bolt. And what's going to be different, Anderson, and we've got to watch this very closely. In the past 14 months, Ukraine has been on the defensive, Russia has been on the offensive. They kind of come to a little bit of a slugfest over the last couple of months, but it is still that case. Within the next couple of weeks, you're going to see Russia turn to the defensive and they have been preparing that for months and you're going to see Ukraine go on the operational offensive and it is more difficult to do that. They will pick the time and place of their choosing in terms of attacks. They will look for seams in the Russian defensive belt, which Russia has been preparing, and they will take the new equipment they received from the West and conduct that combined arms operation. One of the things it is going to be -- that we need to watch is how they conduct breaching operations. In other words, getting through the defensive belts that Russia has created with minefields, trenches and wire. It's going to be a difficult fight over the next couple of weeks.",

It is also the first time he has testified about January 6th under oath.

The special prosecutor had Mike Pence in there before the grand jury all day yesterday. He wasn't taking the Fifth Amendment because he doesn't have any criminal exposure. He wasn't invoking his special role as president of the Senate, because the courts had already rejected the claim that that special role entitled him to stay silent when it came to what the president was doing and saying to him.

Ground zero for her fight and for many is her home state of Florida because of legislation backed by Governor Ron DeSantis and the Republican controlled state legislature.As we've been reporting on the program, the criteria for pulling books off shelves of Florida schools is not clear often, and there's been a lot of anger over the move. One Florida school district removed Blume's book \"Forever\" from shelves. And her novels have faced bans and challenges for decades because they often dive into puberty and sex. The new documentary \"Judy Blume Forever\" on Amazon Prime dives more into her story. And in theaters today is the movie, \"Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret,\" based on her bestselling book with the same title first published in 1970. The iconic author Judy Blume joins me tonight. Ms. Blume, it is such a pleasure to meet you. You have had such an impact on so many generations of people. I remember when \"Forever\" came out, it blew my mind when I was a kid. You faced people trying to ban your books from a long time ago. Did you ever imagine you would still be facing these kind of attacks in 2023? JUDY BLUME, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR: Never. Never, never, never. And of course, it's not just me, it's a whole lot of people who are facing the attacks today. It's much worse.",
