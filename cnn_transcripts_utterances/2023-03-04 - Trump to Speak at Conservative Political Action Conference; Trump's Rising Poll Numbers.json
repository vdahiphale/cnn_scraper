I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Just minutes from now former President Donald Trump will be less than ten miles from the U.S. Capitol, addressing a crowd of his adoring supporters as, for all intents and purposes, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination. Despite his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Trump has been leading in several polls of Republican voters as he delivers the keynote address at the annual CPAC gathering later on this afternoon. Even though other GOP contenders are warning the party to move on from Trump his MAGA faithful have come to dominate the Republicans' long- time marquee event. At any moment CPAC will announce the results of its new presidential straw poll. We understand that coming in right now, Trump has won the last two with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis coming in second. Both times DeSantis has not formally announced for 2024 and he's skipping this year's gathering. But let's talk to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She joins us now from CPAC where they're gathering in Maryland just outside the nation's capital. Kristen, I understand the results of this non-scientific -- we need to emphasize -- it's a non-scientific straw poll, that those results have come in. What are the results?",

      "sentences": "They are. And again yes, as you said this is unofficial, this is nonscientific, it is just based on who is here at CPAC.And unsurprisingly Trump did win that straw poll 62 percent over DeSantis who is at 20 percent. Everyone else's numbers are much less significant. Now, it would have been a huge blow to former President Trump had he not won that his straw poll. This conference, which used to be a beacon for all potential Republican hopefuls for president, has really become a complete Trump-fest. People are here to see him. And almost all of the speakers support a Trump 2024 presidential run. They want him to be in office again. We heard from a number of people. Now Jim, I do want to note that we did get some exclusive reporting on what Trump is going to say when he takes the stage. And it is -- there's a lot here. He's going to double down on isolationism, something that we know that has been dividing the Republican Party. He's going to say that the Republican Party will never go down -- go back to a party that gives -- citing endless words like giving enormous amounts of money while they cut benefits at home. He also says that they're going to never go back to a country that supports political dynasties in either party. And then he also talks about with a little bit of a fatalist kind of attitude here. He says this is the final battle -- they know it, I know it, you know it, everybody knows it. This is Trump-speak. This is something that we have heard time and time again and something that he does when he is particularly in front of these kinds of crowds who like the Trump-speak. And I think that this will go over well with this crowd because many of these people are just here to see him. The other thing I want to say here is that he goes after the deep state again. One of the things that he said when he was running in 2016. A lot of this sounds a lot like the rhetoric we heard back in 2016 when he was running. It's very different than what we heard in 2020 when he said I will totally obliterate the deep state. I will fire the unelected bureaucrats and shadow forces who have weaponized our justice system. I think we know what he's referring to there. Of course, one of the things that he has done in reaction to the many subpoenas and many investigations from the Department of Justice is that they're politicized and weaponized and clearly going after that in his speech today again, Jim.",

      "sentences": "Yes. You know look, as you pointed out, Jim, that's an unscientific poll. But let me give you some scientific numbers that we've sort of seen over the last few months dating back to last year and the trend lines that we've seen.Look at this. I think there are two things to take from this graphic. Number one is that Donald Trump's poll numbers fell from June to October of 2022 when he was at 52 percent to 41 percent immediately following the election, right? That's not a big surprise. A lot of Trump-backed Republican candidates did poorly in the midterm elections and I think Republicans turned against him while DeSantis rose from 23 percent to 31 percent. But look what's happened in the first two months of this year. What have we seen? We've seen Donald Trump kind of rise again from that 41 percent then he's at 43 percent in January then to 44 percent in February and his advantage over Ron DeSantis which was ten points at the end of last year has now risen back up to 15 points. It's not the same level that it was in the middle of last year when it was about 30 points but still 15 points is higher than 10 points. And Jim, there's nobody else who's anywhere close. Everybody else is in the mid to maybe high single digits. So at this particular point Donald Trump is the favorite for the Republican nomination in 2024. That's just what the numbers say, Jim.",

I mean he did this back in 2016 where he was pretty far out in front for much of that process and ended up being the nominee.

But more than that, more than that, here's what I'll point out. I will point out that people in Trump's position have won about 75 percent of the time in competitive primaries since 1972.Now, when you have someone in Ron DeSantis' position and someone in Trump's position, people in Trump's position have won about two-thirds of the time, a little bit less. But still two-thirds of the time to 75 percent of the time is pretty gosh darn good. So at this particular point, look, is Trump heavy favorite? No. But he is the clear favorite and that's what I think I would take away from the numbers we were just looking at, Jim.",

Let's talk about this what Trump is now doing with executive privilege. I mean put aside the fact that he's now on the same page, pretty much, as Mike Pence, his former vice president, that they both don't want him to testify, or at least that's the way Pence is putting that out there publicly.

I think Donald Trump has a steep, rocky, uphill climb legally.He's invoking executive privilege, meaning I had conversations when I was president with one of my key advisers, my vice president, that needs to remain secret. But he's got two big problems. One, Donald Trump is now a former president. While it's not impossible for a former president to invoke executive privilege, the courts have said that it's much more difficult for a former president to invoke executive privilege than a sitting president. So that's number one. The other problem Donald Trump has is this is a criminal grand jury subpoena. And usually courts are going to honor criminal grand jury subpoenas and typically, with some exceptions, but typically executive privilege does not prevail over a grand jury subpoena. So it's a shot in the dark here. I think it's got a chance of succeeding but only a very long shot chance here.",

His argument is that in my role as vice president, I was also president of the Senate and the constitution says that members of Congress cannot be forced to answer questions outside of Congress itself. I do think the court will say, it can apply to the vice president. The problem is you have to go sort of question by question and decide is this within his legislative duties -- his proper legislative duties? This is what happened with Representative Perry. This is what happened with Lindsey Graham. And both times, the court went through and said only a very narrow subsection of your testimony is protected, that which applies to actual legitimate congressional duties.

We've got through the court of appeals and whoever loses there is going to try to get it to the Supreme Court. You are talking about months of delay. Supreme Court Does Jack Smith have that luxury to wait that long? Could we see Donald Trump indicted and it lands -- try to land in the middle of the electoral campaign? Absolutely. That could come out of Fulton County. That's a different investigation. But look, Jack Smith is operating from a disadvantaged position here because Merrick Garland wasted about two years before Jack Smith ever came aboard.

I don't want people in Darlington, Pennsylvania or on East Palestine, Ohio to think that this bill would somehow supplant what we should all do -- federal, state and local right now to help the people and to hold Norfolk Southern accountable. Norfolk Southern But going forward we have to have much tougher safety requirements for any train carrying hazardous materials. That's one of the problems here, not enough safety requirements for that kind of hazardous material being transported. Also more inspections, better and tougher inspections of these rail companies and really tough fines. Right now under federal law, you could only impose fines on a company like Norfolk Southern in the tens of thousands. They should be hit with, if they're culpable, they should be hit with multimillion dollar fines at a minimum and that's what this bill would provide.

For a bill that is as comprehensive as this, speaking to the safety issues, making sure that we're upping substantially the fines that can be imposed to hold companies accountable. But I also should say that Norfolk Southern right now, bill or no bill, has to remain committed not just over days and weeks or months but years.

I think people are out in the streets, because this is a struggle, to quote President Biden with respect to the United States, for the soul of America, for the soul of Israel. The Israelis have an image of themselves, their own democracy as liberal, humanistic, holistic, apart from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Israel proper. And I think that there's the perception in large numbers of Israelis this government is determined on the occasion, as we move, Jim, to the 75th anniversary of independence from the state Israel, the boundaries of this state and the identity of this state are very much open and very little unsettled. So there's a lot at stake here and it's evident by the numbers of Israelis in the streets.",

Obviously, he is by far seen by a lot of Israelis as the person they want in that position. So how do Israelis find their way out of this? Obviously, it seems both sides have gotten it to a point where things are very emotional and people are very invested in two very diametrically opposed opinions as to where the country should go next?",

Whether that can be found, Jim, I don't know. But if this judicial reform passes its three readings of the Israeli parliament, which has passed its first reading, the Supreme Court, I suspect, will declare it \"unconstitutional,\" quote, unquote. Even though Israel doesn't have a formal constitution, and you're going to have a truly constitutional crisis. You've had calls - former Mossad director of the Israeli CIA, the Mossad, basically said that Israeli intelligence, security officials, are not obligated to obey the directors of a legitimate government. That's where this is heading. And I think the consequences could be very dire, even for a system like Israel that has avoided, by and large, over the decades, violent protests.",

I'm hoping folks can sort this out with us right now. CNN sports analyst and \"USA Today\" writer, Christine Brennan, joins us now. Christine, please, help us out.
