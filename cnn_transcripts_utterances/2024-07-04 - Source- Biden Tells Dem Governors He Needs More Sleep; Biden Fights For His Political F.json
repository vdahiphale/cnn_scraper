Sources tell CNN the President told Democratic governors during yesterday's White House meeting that he needs more sleep and he plans to stop scheduling events after 8 PM.That meeting was an attempt to reassure Democratic leaders that he could win re-election and serve out another term. His campaign faces a critical test in the next 48 hours. Tomorrow, President Biden is set to hit the campaign trail and then we'll see him in his first televised interview since the debate. Today, in new taped radio interviews, he again pushed back against calls for him to step aside. Let's get the latest now live from the White House with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. And Priscilla, how does President Biden hope to regain the confidence of voters over this next critical stretch?",

Of course, we'll see the President today during the July 4th celebrations here at the White House. He's then going to two battleground states, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And, of course, he'll participate in that high-profile interview with ABC News tomorrow.Now, advisors had been talking over the last week in ways that they could put the President out there more often and try to make the point that that energetic North Carolina rally that we saw him at after the debate, that that wasn't just a fluke, but that is the person that they see behind closed doors. But the reality, of course, is that it hasn't calmed nerves. And the President, I think, is trying to give us a glimpse of what his message might be on the road with a pair of interviews that he did with Black Radio this week. Take a listen.

But it's a week out from the debate, and still all corners of the Democratic Party are really in panic and quite frustrated with the reasons they've been given so far. That includes some of the conflicting responses that we have heard from the White House over the last 24 hours.The White House now saying that the President was briefly checked by his doctor after the debate. Remember that at the time, officials had told reporters that he had a cold, which is part of the reason for his debate performance. And that comes after the White House Press Secretary had said he hadn't received any checks from a doctor aside from his physical in February. So these evolving reasons and explanation are just complicating and adding more layers to an already difficult situation for this campaign as it tries to salvage the President's re-election bid.

      "sentences": "Well, there's a few things. One is that you mentioned Donald Trump is trying to keep a low profile. That's very rare for him, but Republicans really do want Democrats and Joe Biden to be the story right now. And so you're seeing them really not weighed into the spotlight that much, which again is not usual for Donald Trump.Now, despite that, of course, you did see that video of him criticizing Joe Biden as well as Kamala Harris. It's unclear if Donald Trump knew that he was being filmed in that moment, but he did reshare that video on his own Truth Social page. So it's clear he's also happy to attack both of them in this moment and pile on to what is already - some of the criticism that the Democrats are seeing over Joe Biden's fitness to serve. I will say though, however, behind the scenes, just from my reporting and talking to Donald Trump's team about this, they're also very uncertain of how this impacts their own campaign. Remember, Donald Trump has spent months setting up a general campaign infrastructure. They've built out this massive data operation, all of that focused on going after Joe Biden. And the reality really started to set in earlier this week, I'm told, that there is a very real possibility that maybe Joe Biden will no longer be the candidate. And so they're really trying to grapple with how that impacts them. And at the same time, you know, a lot of people have argued in the past, even Donald Trump himself has said he didn't think that Joe Biden would make it to the Democratic convention, that he would ultimately step aside. He's been saying that for months, but now that it's actually happening, when I talk to some Republicans, they actually argue they think Biden would be the best candidate for Donald Trump to beat. And so they're trying to figure out really what this means for their own campaign, as well as, again, keep the attention on Democrats and let Joe Biden and the criticism he's facing be the story right now.",

We are joined by former Democratic Senator from California, Barbara Boxer, and former Press Secretary under President Clinton, Joe Lockhart.Senator, you said give Biden two weeks to fix his ailing campaign. It has now been a full week since the debate. We haven't even seen a TV interview or press conference yet. That's not going to come until tomorrow and next week, respectively. Is he moving too slow on his reset? BARBARA BOXER, (D) FORMER U.S. SENATOR, CALIFORNIA: No, I meant two weeks from now. The article you're quoting was run today. Two weeks. I agree with Debbie Dingell. I disagree with these members who are coming on TV for their five minutes of fame and pushing out a man who has been one of the greatest presidents since FDR. And by the way, I say, because there are two schools of thought. My school of thought is show us the comeback. You've done it your whole life, Mr. President. You've come back from personal losses. You've come back from political losses. And here's the thing about these members and folks who are coming on your station and a lot of your experts pushing this man out right now, before he has a chance, is this: We know that Donald Trump is the true threat here. We know, because he talked 30 lies in 90 minutes. That's what he put out there, 30 lies. He refused to accept the results of the election. He's already going after Liz Cheney and saying she's guilty of treason, which by the way, the penalty for that is murder. It goes on and on. He also said at the debate that Democrats would kill babies after they're born. And everybody's focused on Joe Biden. And last point, how many times have we seen Trump fall asleep at his own criminal trial where he was found guilty of 34 counts and also liable for sexual assault in another courtroom against E. Jean Carroll. So please spare me your five minutes of fame. Give this man a chance to pick himself up. He's done it so many times.",

Boxer will likely remember that senators and some member of Congress privately were talking about going to the White House and trying to convince the President to leave. And the fact of the matter is people are going to figure out within a week or two weeks, as Sen. Boxer said, that he's not leaving. And that's when people will rally around him.The second thing I think is on strategy. I don't think campaigning is the best thing. Again, a lesson from 1998, 1999. He has the unique position of being president and doing things as president. And I think that's the best way to position himself as a contrast to Donald Trump. It's not about style.

Give him time to make his comeback.Everybody that you put on the show, fine. They have a right. I'm concerned. Everyone is concerned. Take a deep breath, be a grownup. And I think, you know, Joe is right. I remember those days of Bill Clinton. Could he ever make a comeback? Could he ever do it? He did it. Joe Biden has done it many, many times. So all this jumping on this, pushing him hard out the door because he did have a terrible debate and I think he does need to get out there without the prompter. In addition to doing what Joe says, I agree with people that I have often agreed with like Debbie Dingell, you've got to get out there and prove you still have the mojo. He may or he may not, but give him that opportunity. And I don't care when the Republican convention is. I care when the Democratic convention is. And I'm going there and it's going to be August and either we're going to rally around our president or we won't, but it's in his hands. And I believe that he can show this. But I still keep coming back to the President - excuse me, I really, I don't mean you at all - in general, calling for Joe to get out and this and that after this man who's a convicted felon and who instigated a complete insurrection on our nation's Capitol. They don't tell him to get out. So something is off in America. This is Independence Day. Trump has a plan to fire the entire Justice Department, replace it with people loyal to him and go after people he doesn't like. And it's really frightening.
