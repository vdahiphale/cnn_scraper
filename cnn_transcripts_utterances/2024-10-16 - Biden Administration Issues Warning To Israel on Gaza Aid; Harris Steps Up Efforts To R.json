Those attacks would be revenge for Iran's ballistic missile attack earlier this month.

What we're also seeing is that this is a clear Israeli position that has been established with artillery fire now firing off in the distance. And it's interesting because the Israeli military, of course, is describing all of this as limited targeted raid. But we are also seeing, of course, that they have established positions inside of southern Lebanon for an offensive that they insist is not going to go much deeper. This is an established Israeli military position inside of southern Lebanon. How is this a raid? COL.

And more than five decades later, Humphreys says she's found a way to further optimize it.While chemo treatments attack cancerous cells, they also attack healthy cells like hair follicles that can resemble the bad ones. Athena, Humphreys' prototype reduces the temperature of the scalp during chemotherapy treatments. The cold temperature restricts blood flow to the hair follicle cells, which can block the chemo from reaching that area to damage or kill the hair follicles.
