Woodward says, one of the most striking themes, is the former President's inability to reflect and take action, on the Coronavirus crisis that was enveloping the country. Listen to one of Woodward's exchanges, with Trump, in the summer of 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB WOODWARD, AUTHOR, \"THE TRUMP TAPES\": Was there a moment in all of this, last two months, where you said to yourself, \"Ah, this is the leadership test of a lifetime?\"",

He kind of goes, from denial, to concealment, to the crime. I call it a crime, not telling the people that he had been warned that by his national security advisers, in the most vivid way, which is outlined in these tapes. The interviews with them, where they are telling him - I've done - I've known 16 national security advisers, going back to Kissinger, and never once heard one come and tell the President, \"This will be the biggest national security threat to your presidency.\" And it wasn't about China or Russia or Iran.

And that the projections are, before the winter, they could take Russia back to its border, pre this incursion, and up to Crimea. That has resulted, in addition to the Crimean Bridge, being attacked, with this new threat, of Russia, using missiles, trying to take out the infrastructure, in Ukraine, and the Iranian drones. We stood next to the power plant, in Kyiv. There's only one that Russia has been attempting to hit, that would take out the electrical power, in Kyiv. And they've hit all the buildings around it, but not it. But they're continuing to try to target it. What President Zelenskyy is asking for, and what we're trying and, I think, the United States is diligently trying, even with our NATO allies, to put together, is some sort of air defense that would allow them to respond to this new threat, of the Iranian drones, and these missiles, to try to preserve their infrastructure, as they go into the winter.",

We now have Iran that's engaging against allies that are Israeli allies, including United States.\" They have certainly a long-term benefit of us all being able to defeat Iranian systems.
