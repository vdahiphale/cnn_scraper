That's a huge, huge swing from a few months ago when Trump led President Biden in all of them. Now of note, these polls show that Vice President Harris, the sitting vice president, is tied or has an edge on the issue of who can bring change.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez in Savannah, where the Harris-Walz team continues their bus tour.

But it has informed these aggressive strategies that we're seeing them employ in states like Georgia, a crucial battleground state that it's not only notable that the two are here, but also significant where they have been visiting. And that is south Georgia, those rural counties that typically lean Republican. But that is where the campaign chose to kick off this bus tour with two stops yesterday. The vice president expected to have more today. And that strategy, according to senior campaign officials I've spoken with, is essentially peeling off those votes from Republicans while also doing well in metro Atlanta. So, in these rural counties, it comes down to losing by less. And by doing that they think they have a path to victory in a state that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes in 2020.So, the vice president, or vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, were taking these stops yesterday to meet with voters, high schoolers, as well as voters at a barbecue restaurant. Today, the vice president will be headed to some small businesses before participating in a rally in the arena behind me. So, yet another opportunity for her to appeal to voters with the campaign knowing that this is going to be a state that they're going to want to notch a victory in, in November. It's not going to be easy. That is according to every campaign official that I've spoken with. But what these stops do tell us, or provide a window into how they are strategizing, and that is by going and opening offices in these rural parts of the states with hopes that they can take those votes from Republicans. What does the Harris campaign see as the stakes for this interview, this big interview with Dana Bash in just a few hours?",

As you mentioned, he is coming into today's event with those Truth Social posts, where he has controversially been attacking the -- Jack Smith, the special prosecutor in those cases, and several of these other legal cases. Also some inflammatory remarks about his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.

You know, I heard David Urban apparently got his talking points in the email early this morning, running down the list of things that they want her to answer. You hear the - you hear that my friends on the right saying, why do you have Tim Walz besides you? And then you just go back and look throughout history. You saw the joint interview between Joe Biden and Barack Obama. You saw the one that our own Scott Jennings, I believe, put together with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. You saw John McCain and Sarah Palin. You saw Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton. I mean, the list goes on and on and on with joint interviews. Those talking points fall flat.But there is something there that has to be answered. And I think that it's again a good tune up for the debate. When you're talking about Afghanistan, we were spending, you know, $300 million a day in Afghanistan. I mean we - that's what we were spending at war. And it was a tough decision to withdraw. And the Biden-Harris administration made a tough decision. As president of the United States, you're going to have to make tough decisions. That is what Donald Trump did not do it because he was afraid to make a tough decision. On the issue of fracking and health care, what happens when you are vice president of the United States is, sometimes you evolve on issues. You understand what governing is. You see how that governing plays out. You have those experiences. You traveled to western Pennsylvania. And what was the position in 2019, you understand today is not a position where the country is. That's how you govern. Like, that is not where the country is, where she was in 2019. The country is right where she is now on this campaign, and she just has to articulate that. And so I appreciate David's talking points this morning about where she was then, but those are questions, yes, that I believe Dana will have to ask, questions she will have to answer. But at the end of the day, if she comes off tough, if she comes off presidential, if she comes off understanding that it's not just joy, but it's that joyful warrior, that she's going to fight for every American, then look, it's going to be a home-run.
