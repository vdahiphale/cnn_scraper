Some of them ended up appearing on North Korean movies playing the evil Western character. So it's not always a life of gloom and doom if these people do end up staying in North Korea. But that was back decades ago. It's a very different situation now between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States.",

But when the border was closed during the pandemic the bills kept coming but they didn't have anybody who could actually go in and carry cash and bring cash. So one by one, countries started closing their diplomatic operations and there are no fewer diplomats, fewer foreigners, fewer NGOs. North Korea and its people are more isolated today than, arguably, they have ever been in their entire history of 70-plus years of the existence of North Korea because all of the foreigners who were kind of forced out during the pandemic -- the government has imposed incredibly new stringent measures to try to prevent people from fleeing to the south. They've bolstered border security. They've tightened these surveillance state apparatus that was already incredibly strong. And so people inside North Korea are literally living in this kind of black box of isolation from the rest of the world. It's a very, very difficult time to try to get a message in or out. That said, there's email, there's phones. Those things still work. And so people are going to be using backchannels trying to find a way to start talking about this American and how to resolve it. And I can guarantee the North would like to resolve it as well. This is kind of a pain in the neck for them -- not something that they asked for. They just kind of had this thrust upon them.",

She's a member of the House Armed Service Committee and former CIA analyst who worked alongside the U.S. military during three tours in Iraq. And Congresswoman, there's a lot I want to get to with -- to you on related to what's going on on Capitol Hill, but I want to start with this because you noted you had been to this area I think in 2021. What's your sense of what this means or what it could mean and, I guess, the plausibility of accidentally walking across this line? REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI):  Yes. I was there with a congressional delegation -- a bipartisan congressional delegation in 2021. It is one of the most constrained areas of the world. I mean, it -- again, these are all first reports so no one really knows what's going on, but it's hard to imagine that someone just sort of mistakenly wandered off and then got grabbed by the North Korean side. You are looking at them. They are trained on you. You know exactly where the border is. And these tours are designed to show you just how rigid the security is. So it seems like a really strange story to me and -- but we'll have to see what happens. It just seems odd. MATTINGLY:  Yes, and we're getting more reporting as we speak. Our reporters are kind of working the phones. This is just starting to develop right now. I do -- on the U.S.-North Korea relationship, we were talking last block -- constantly talking to White House officials saying we're -- the door is open if they want to talk. There has been no engagement. Obviously, they have continued to escalate very aggressively their missile launches and tests.",

They -- they are saying please regulate us, which is very strange for a group from Silicon Valley. That's not usually what we hear. But we don't know exactly the right way to do it. And so, we've been trying to educate ourselves and get smart but there's no way around the fact the future of warfare in the world is going to be powered by AI and less about hardware, ships, planes, and more about technology.",

They're deeply investing in space technology and artificial intelligence helps them do that.And so, we're watching them leapfrog in a way that if you're a military person you're saying this increases our vulnerability.

Jayapal's statements. She walked them back. We also had some crazy inflammatory statements yesterday about the connection between COVID-19 and Jewish people for someone who has been invited to testify in front of Jim Jordan and the Judiciary Committee. So I put out something that just said, like, can we just cool it on the rhetoric? She apologized. She called and reached out to me. And we have a statement -- or that we're going to -- or a resolution that we're voting on. It's very simple. It's three paragraphs. It's about support for Israel. So I'll be voting for it.

If you're going to call out something on one side, call it out in your own caucus as well. And that's a good lesson for everybody in Congress.I think it's a signal of how broken Congress is. That we just don't sort of have that even hand and say nasty rhetoric should be pushed back on no matter who it is. We basically say well, if it's my side it's OK, but if it's the other side it's like the end of the world.
