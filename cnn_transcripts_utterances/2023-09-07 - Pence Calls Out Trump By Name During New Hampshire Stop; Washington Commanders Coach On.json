But it's important for Republicans to know that he and his imitators in this Republican primary made no such promise today. I mean, the truth is Donald Trump, along with his imitators, often sound like an echo of the progressives they seek to replace. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

First of all, this poll had a lot of bad news on health and vigor. Look at just Biden inspires confidence, for example, and the Democrats are down 53 percent. That's bad. Independents, 25 percent. That's anemic. But then look at his overall favorability. Biden's at 31 percent among Independents. That's really bad. Donald Trump, though, is at 26 percent. That's even worse. And when you ask Independent voters in this poll which comes closer to your view among Independents, any Democrat better than Trump, 47 percent. Trump better than any Democrat, 27 percent. So I'm not -- there -- you know, this is the old Reagan line -- \"There must be a pony in there somewhere\" for the Biden team. That there's the silver lining somewhere.

He was a Hollywood A-lister tracked by paparazzi and fans alike, but he's a mountain lion. I think what P-22 did -- he showed us that wildness had not been banished even in a place like L.A. When I met with the National Parks biologist he told me these mountain lions were going to go extinct. I just remember thinking not on my watch. They are literally inbreeding themselves out of existence here. Picture if you were on Tinder and you're swiping and all you're getting is family members. That's what mountain lions south of the 101 here are getting. They are trapped by this freeway. It's an environmental problem that there's actually an easy solution for. You don't want the animals to get hit. You build the crossing, they use it, done. But nobody has ever been crazy enough to try to put it in one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world, and over one of the busiest freeways on the globe.

So this is an excerpt of a biography written by Walter Isaacson that was obtained by my colleague Sean Lyngaas and it really provides a new window into Elon Musk's thinking about Starlink's role in the war in Ukraine.Now, as you said, according to this biography, Musk did, in fact, order his engineers to turn off Starlink's satellite communications for the Ukrainians when they were trying and planning to launch a sneak attack on Russia's naval fleet around Crimea. According to the biography, that was because he had spoken to Russian officials and he believed that doing so could prompt a response by Russia that was akin to a quote, \"mini Pearl Harbor\" and that Russia might actually respond by using nuclear weapons. And it also kind of delves into his ambivalence about using Starlink in a war setting writ large. He said, quote, \"How am I in this war? Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people can watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes.\" Now, according to his excerpt, Ukrainian officials begged him to turn the satellites back on and he actually had a conversation with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as the chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Mark Milley about the anxieties that Washington had about Starlink's power and, of course, how he was kind of turning it off and on. But really, this just underscores how powerful Starlink is and how important Elon Musk and his services are to the U.S. government and the Ukrainian government, Phil.",
