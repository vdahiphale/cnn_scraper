And it also means -- it puts forward a narrative about her campaign and her coming in second. She already came in third in the Iowa caucuses. And I think part of what she has to do is really hit home two different things. One, this idea of the future of the Republican Party. What do we want the Republican Party to look like? What do we want it to stand for? But then, also, the policy aspect of the party which, it turns out, Republican voters do care about; Republican voters in New Hampshire really do care about. And so she started to do some of that. We saw her critique Trump on things like Social Security, on things like the gas credit, on his age, on Biden's age. But, you know, for right now, while she's painted a vision that I think is about stability in the midst of chaos, in the midst of Trump's chaos, it's not enough.

I think Judge Kaplan is being careful here. He controls his courtroom. I think if Donald Trump continues to push, that may well happen. But you all identified the -- the four most important words, \"I would love that.\" I mean, that's why he's there. Nothing could serve his purposes better. And I want to be clear, there's some legal strategy happening here. There's no question, though, this is political. I mean, just keep in mind, he didn't even go to the first trial, which was really, in a way, higher stakes. Now the result of the first trial that he's liable, they carry over to this trial. So it's interesting to see the two of them, Judge Kaplan and Donald Trumps, two alphas, I would say, in their own environments, go at it.

In addition to the trials he does not have to attend, he doesn't have to be present for, as he doesn't -- as he didn't have to be present for several of the trials that we've had over the last couple of weeks.

He is someone who needs to be protected. He is someone who needs to be supported. He's managed, as you mentioned, to raise an incredible amount of money off of this. And I think the more that we see of this, it just really strengthens his case to the Republican Party at large.

Most align one way or the other but they refuse the label. Who say, I might hate the way that he acts, except that I like some of his policies. Or they believe the system is corrupt. I mean, more than 70 percent of Americans right now believe that there's a two-tier system of justice. One of the things that he talks about. They believe that the system is unfair, that it's rigged to treat the elite differently than the rest of everybody else. And so this idea that Donald Trump can come in and blow up that model, that he's willing to fight back, that he's not afraid of all of the usual things, is appealing to a very, very large group of people. And that's why you're seeing the states that matter most, those seven states that matter most, poll after poll is saying that Donald Trump can beat Joe Biden.

You're looking at those live pictures.House Speaker Mike Johnson is currently in that city, casting very serious doubt on whether Congress can pass a bipartisan immigration deal. It comes after top congressional leaders met with {resident Biden at the White House on Wednesday. Now, Republicans are blocking Biden's Ukraine aid request over strict border policies that they passed in the House last year. Speaking to CNN last night,  Johnson would not commit to bring a deal to the House floor without those policies, even if it passes the U.S. Senate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): If the best we can get does not solve the problem and not stem the flow, then it will not be acceptable on the House side. And I have said that very clearly from day one. We have to solve the problem. This is not about getting political points for one side or the other. It's about solving the problem that is now a crisis for every community. Every state is a border state now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the White House and President Biden really used this roughly 80- minute meeting to try to lay out the stakes for Ukraine as this aid is currently faltering over in Congress. National security adviser Jake Sullivan and Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, really laid out point by point what the real-world impacts would be to Ukraine on the battlefield, even pointing to classified information as they made their case. The White House said that the president in his meeting discussed, quote, \"the strategic consequences of inaction for Ukraine, the United States and the world. He was clear Congress's continued failure to act endangers the United States' national security, the NATO alliance, and the rest of the free world.\" The White House also said that President Biden did acknowledge that he believes that there needs to be action taken now to address -- to address some of the issues on the U.S. Southern border. And that is where these -- these negotiations and talks have really been stuck. The approach for how to address border policy is currently at odds up on Capitol Hill. You have those Senate negotiators, Republicans and Democrats, who have been working to try to reach some type of agreement for weeks now. The White House has made concessions in these talks. But House Speaker Mike Johnson said that what is being proposed at this moment is simply dead on arrival in the House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
