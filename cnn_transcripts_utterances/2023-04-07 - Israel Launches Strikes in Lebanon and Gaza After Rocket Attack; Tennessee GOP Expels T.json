Then they stormed the mosque a second time just hours later.

Because in every committee I was on, I stood up and spoke out and on the House floor, we're some of the most outspoken members.

If those voices are cut out of the process, it allows folks to be able to do something, like kick out two representatives who we should say are probably going to come back.This was done just to be a humbling of two young black representatives. This was not done for real political purposes. These are folks who -- and I think the representative is right, when you talk -- when you were reading yesterday about folks locally, this is built up for a long time, and this is not just about the actions that happened recently.

Like we can move away from the actual tangible issue that was being protested here when we focus on things like decorum.But when you heard, you know, folks like President Obama weighing in, talking about civility, talking about the break of decorum and rules or polarization and the divisions in society, I think those words paper over some stuff too. This is not a both sides polarization type thing. This is asymmetric polarization. This is one party that has changed in much different ways, even in the Democratic Party has changed. And so when you hear a Republican base, they are much more willing to use their power to really see -- to really cut the other side out of the process. They're really more willing to see the other side as inherently invalid in that democratic process, and that is unique to the Republican side. That's not one-to-one between R and D.",
