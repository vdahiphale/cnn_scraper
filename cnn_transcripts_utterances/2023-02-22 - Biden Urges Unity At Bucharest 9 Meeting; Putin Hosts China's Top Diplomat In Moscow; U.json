Starbucks chief executive, Howard Schultz, tells CNN he is leaving this time, no really leaving this time. And Jamaica Tourism Minister will be with me. He wants to create a fund to help popular destinations in times of crisis. Live from New York, midweek, Wednesday, February the 22nd. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. Both Presidents have been shoring up support of their allies in the war on Ukraine. On the US side, President Biden's on his way home, Air Force One is currently over the North Atlantic. You can see they're just about to leave Western Ireland. The President and his team, probably discussing how to deliver on the promises he made to provide Ukraine with weapons and money and to keep the EU allies united. Before he left Poland, President Biden met leaders of the eastern flank of NATO that called the Bucharest 9, and the President stressed the importance of sticking together. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, I think it's quite telling that Vladimir Putin, you know, the leader of such a big country, obviously, the head of state of Russia, took the time to meet with Wang Yi and once again, also in front of camera said how important the relations between China and Russia are to the Russian Federation. Obviously, the Russians have been hit with a lot of sanctions over the past year, they rely on China really to reorient their entire economy now, but also, of course, to get technology as well. And so, a lot really depends on China as far as Russia is concerned. As far as the Chinese are concerned, I think it was also quite important for Wang Yi because he said during his meeting with Vladimir Putin that obviously the relations between the two countries are very good, especially between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. But he also took a swipe at the United States saying that third countries would not interfere in the relations between China and Russia, obviously, that seem to pertain to the fact that the US has been voicing concern that the Chinese might think about providing lethal aid to the Russians for use in Ukraine -- Richard.",

I mean, one of the things that we saw yesterday in his address to the Federal Assembly is that there was not really very much in rhetoric that would see Vladimir Putin ramping things up. He didn't say something like that would be another big offensive, there was really subdued rhetoric, if you will. I think right now, the Russians themselves are sort of recalibrating a little bit. I think their military capabilities are in a pretty difficult state to at the moment. But of course, they do depend a lot on China and they do look towards what China is saying about the conflict in Ukraine. They definitely understand that the Chinese do not want this to escalate any further, that the Chinese certainly don't want this to become a confrontation between Russia and the West, even though that is something that for instance, you hear a lot on Russian state TV, that that is exactly what the Russians think it is. I do think that to that extent, the Chinese do keep that in check a little bit simply because the Russians economy is so dependent on China right now, just being on the ground here, it is surprising, Richard to see just in the past year, how Chinese products have for instance, on the roads, but in shops already replaced a lot of things that had been there from the West before.",

The reason why I would argue, Richard, we're not seeing even more of an impact in the market is because this data is pretty old. Right? This news is pretty old. Three weeks ago is a long time in today's economy. Let's go through just the last few weeks and see what we've learned in terms of the US economy. February 1st is the last time we heard from Federal Reserve Chairman, officially. We have, of course heard from him since then, but officially that's the last time we heard from the Fed. February 3rd, just a few days later, Richard is when we got that blockbuster January Jobs Report, three times what economists were expecting in terms of job growth. Then the next week, February 14th and 16th, we got two hotter than expected inflation surprises, inflation reports, both CPI and PPI, and then also that same week, we got strong retail sales. So the question now, Richard, on everyone's mind is what does the Fed do with all of that data?
