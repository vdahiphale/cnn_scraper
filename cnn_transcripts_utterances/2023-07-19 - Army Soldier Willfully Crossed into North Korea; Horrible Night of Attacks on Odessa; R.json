Any criminal defendant is going to look for other people to blame and to say that it was mitigated because they were misinformed or they were misled or given wrong legal advice even. And so certainly that's going to play a part in all of these defenses.But in the specific state charges, I think you're going to see that they actually signed documentation that asserted incorrect information about their location. And so in terms of actually defending that by saying that you didn't know whether that was lawful or not, I mean that's going to be an uphill battle for them specifically. And so certainly they will implicate the other people that were involved in that, but those state charges are kind of a standalone set of charges, in my opinion, and it does not limit Jack Smith from proceeding federally against any of these same people also for that matter.",

He was a junior enlisted soldier and he was assigned to U.S. Forces Korea. And essentially what appears to have happened here is he was on a tour of the DMZ when he willfully, and without authorization, crossed that demarcation line into North Korea. Now, the back story here is interesting because our sources tell us that he was actually held in a detention facility in South Korea for 50 days, facing disciplinary action there for assault charges in South Korea. And he was actually set to be sent back to the United States to face further disciplinary action by the military in the form of actually being separated from the Army. But he -- when he went to board his flight, he apparently did not get on the plane. The military officials that were accompanying him could not accompany him as far as the gates and they essentially lost track of him. He was then able to, at some point, sign up for this tour, went to the DMZ and then crossed that demarcation line, again, voluntarily. There's no sign here yet that he was coerced to do so. Now, the U.S. military does say that it is working with its North Korean counterparts to try to resolve this situation. But as we know, the U.S. has not had diplomatic communications with the North Koreans really since President Biden took office. They have tried and tried to reach out to them for talks and they have simply not responded. So it remains unclear whether the military to military channels are going any better here. But we did get a statement, according to ABC, from Travis King's mother, who said, quote, I can't see Travis doing anything like that. She said she last heard from her son a few days ago when he told her he would return soon to his base in Fort Bliss, Texas. And she added that she just, quote, wants him to come home. Abby.",

He finished the day pardoned. And then he was invited to the Kremlin for tea just a few days later. There was that remarkable meeting by Prigozhin and some of his commanders at the Kremlin on June 29th.But this shows, according to Richard Moore, the head of MI6, that Putin is under pressure, that he did not see this coming. He says that Putin was forced to cut what he called a humiliating deal to save his skin. You'll recall that on June 24th, Phil, we heard that the mutiny was suddenly ending, that a deal had been struck, brokered by the president of Belarus, saying that Wagner would be going to Belarus. We have seen, in the past few days, some of those Wagner troops heading into that country. But clearly now, Phil, according to the head of MI6, Putin is rattled and we believe that he is trying to weaken Prigozhin, while trying to keep those Wagner fighters, inviting them to join the Russian military, because they are still a considerable fighting force.

RON DESANTIS (R-FL), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, here's the problem, this country is going down the road of criminalizing political differences. And I think that's wrong. Alvin Bragg stretched the statute in Manhattan to be able to try to target Donald Trump. Most people, even people on the left, acknowledge, if that wasn't Trump, that case would not have likely been brought against a normal civilian. And so you have a situation where the Department of Justice, FBI have been weaponized against people they don't like. And the number one example of that happened to be against Donald Trump with the Russia collusion. That was not legitimate investigation. That was being done to try to drive Trump out of office. And so what I've said, as president, my job is to restore a single standard of justice, to end weaponization of these agencies. We're going to have a new FBI director on day one. We're going to have big changes at the Department of Justice. Americans across the political spectrum need to have confidence that what is going on is based on the rule of law, not based on what political tribe you're in. And then the second thing I would say is, this country needs to have a debate about the country's future. If I'm the nominee, we'll be able to focus on President Biden's failures, and I'll be able to articulate a positive vision for the future. I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what happened four years ago in January. And so, I want to focus on looking forward. I don't want to look back. I do not want to see him. I hope he doesn't get charged. I don't think it will be good for the country. But at the same time, I've got to focus on looking forward. And that's what we're going to do.
