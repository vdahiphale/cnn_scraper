      "sentences": "What's exactly that bill? This is a plan. These are not things that the President can do unilaterally. Some of these proposals would require a Congress to pass legislation. And when it comes to potentially amending the Constitution, of course, that would also involve the states.But here, the President has proposed 18-year term limits for justices, a code of conduct for the justices that is actually enforceable. They do have an ethics code, but there's no enforcement mechanism, so it's effectively toothless. And then he's also proposing a constitutional amendment to prohibit blanket immunity for president. So that is, of course, a response to the Supreme Court's recent decision related to former President Trump and whether he had immunity. And the President wrote in an op-ed today that the reason he is offering these proposals is, quote, \"What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public's confidence in the court's decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.\" And he is referring to the fact that the approval rating for the high court continues to decline. A lot of questions about ethics and even recent decisions. Now, Phil, one of the most prominent responses to this so-called plan has been from Leonard Leo. He is not a household name, but he is the architect of former President Trump's whole judicial strategy. He, along with Mitch McConnell, helped the former president usher in this conservative supermajority. He doesn't talk too much, but today he weighed in on these proposals saying, quote, \"Let me be clear. If Democrats want to adopt an across the board ethics ban for all branches, I'm in favor of that. No jets, no meals, no speaking honorariums, no gifts for anyone from anyone for any reason in any branch, starting with Congress. Until they support that, let's all be honest about what this is, a campaign to destroy a court they disagree with.\" So it's clear, Phil, Congress is unlikely to act on any of these proposals. It's hard to get legislation, even when there is some agreement, this is increasingly a partisan issue. But Leonard, he has laid out some ideas that I think he might find some consensus with the Democrats. But obviously something that is not likely to gain traction in an election year.",

Now they certainly are looking towards that.Paula Reid, as always, thanks so much. Well, in Iowa today, a six-week ban on abortion officially takes effect. About 20 states now have full bans at -- or partial bans at six weeks, before many women even know they're pregnant. And those bans are possible, of course, because the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. This year, though, the court actually rejected efforts to enact even more restrictions. In one case, the justices voted 6 to 3 to allow doctors in Idaho to provide emergency abortions. Today, our Supreme Court expert Joan Biskupic has exclusive new reporting about how that decision came together. Joan joins me now. Joan, I always, like, weeks after we finish each year, I wait anxiously for your behind the scenes reporting --",

Abortion should be able to occur. MATTINGLY: You know, you talk about Ketanji Brown Jackson's role here. Talk about Amy Coney Barrett.

One of the other things that we learned in this briefing by the FBI is that the shooter spent a lot of time actually preparing his attack. They discussed how he was, you know, looking online, doing online searches for some of these chemicals, for some of the things that he would need to be able to build these improvised devices.We also know that he spent a lot of time doing a lot of searches on things like assassination attempts of the Slovak prime minister earlier this year. Also about mass shooting events.
