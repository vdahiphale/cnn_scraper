      "sentences": "Senator Carper, recognize for your questions. SEN. TOM CARPER (D-DE)Mr. Rowe, Mr. Abbate, thank you for joining us today. I have the privilege of representing Delaware, the first state to ratify the Constitution. We did that over 200 years ago. And the Constitution sort of outlines how we elect our leaders. And it changes with respect to technology over the years. But there's, for as long as we have been a country, threats to our leaders when they pursue elective office. We're going to be gathering -- some of us gathering in Chicago in just a few weeks. Others will be gathering in other parts of the country to help make sure that what was adopted in that original Constitution is actually carried out faithfully. And it's just incredibly important that those who aspire to elective office, those who take on those challenges are protected and their families are protected, as well as those who surround them. I share with my colleagues my prayers for those who've been killed or injured on July 13. We're grateful that our -- one of our presidential candidates was is -- OK. But I have a question about what -- I still can't get over how a 20-year-old loner, 20-year-old loner could somehow outfox, outsmart two of the smartest federal agencies and state agencies in law enforcement, with an odds of like 1000-1 and be able to almost pull this off. It just blows my mind. Hopefully, we will get to the truth and all of that. I'm a Navy guy. I spent 20 many years of my life in the Navy. I learned as a midshipman that when the ship runs aground at sea, the commanding officer is held responsible. Whether the commanding officer is awake, asleep, at the helm, but that commanding officer is held responsible. And I think we have to make at the end of the day -- I'm not interested in a blame game, but I'm sure it's been finding out who was responsible and making sure that they account for their responsibility. My question is, what policies are currently in place to facilitate real-time information-sharing between the Secret Service and local law enforcement during an event and what changes to information sharing practices will the Secret Service make in light of the apparent breakdown in communications on July 13?",

I -- we haven't found anything yet that would have alerted law enforcement or FBI or Secret Service to his intention activities in advance of this event.I will note, however, to your prior question, that we do have a very strong relationship, an integrated relationship between FBI and Secret Service and every other federal, state, local agency you can imagine. We have constructs like the joint terrorism task forces and violent crime task forces where we're cross-embedded with each other. And when it comes to this event and others like it, we're always talking in advance. In fact, with respect to this event, we did have a meeting between U.S. Secret Service and FBI in the days leading up to the event to determine, assess whether there was any information or intelligence pertaining to a threat against the rally or to former President Trump or anyone else there. There was an absence of that in the lead-up specifically. And, again, none of us had any information in our holdings with regard to the ultimate shooter.",

Mr. Rowe, in your written testimony, you stated that you -- that to prevent similar lapses, like the one on July 13 from happening again, you will ensure every event site security plan is certainly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it's implemented. Based on your testimony, the security plan for the Butler event deviated from the Social Security (sic) standards. How would vetting by multiple experienced supervisors fix that?",

And part of what we had started doing with the former president's detail is having them send out site agents, having them send out supervisors.

On this day, in particular, because of the connectivity challenge, as you noted, there was a delay, and he flew his drone at 3:51, approximately. So, moving forward, we are leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure that we have dedicated connectivity, so that we're not reliant on public domain, so that we can ensure that, whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational.

But the rifle would not have fit fully into this backpack to be concealed in whole. We have video that was recently found of the shooter walking in a distance from his car just before 6:00 p.m., about 5:56, I believe. And based on everything we have, we assess that he returned to his vehicle at that time, got the backpack, and then proceeded back to the area and to the AGR building. And then he's observed, of course, on the roof, just minutes later, holding the backpack in front of him. In fact, there's dashcam footage from a police vehicle that shows him briefly traversing the roof with the backpack in front of him. And then it's just minutes after that he's actually seen by the officer who I described with the rifle on the roof. It's possible that he broke the rifle down, though we don't have conclusive evidence of that, and took it out of the bag on the roof in those moments before and reassembled it there. That's one of the theories we're looking at and working on right now.",

There's been a lot of conversation about the -- and even in your written and verbal testimony, you have talked a lot about the communication and the disparate nature in which it's happening across the different channels. One sort of foundational question that I have is, are all elements of an event communicated on the same channel? If I lost my kid and I'm at a big rally, are local law enforcement talking on the same channel about me losing my kid that they're talking about a suspicious individual?",

I want to thank you and Chairman Durbin and the ranking members for holding this joint hearing today. And thank you to our witnesses not only for being here, but for your careers of service to our country and to the men and women you lead. I am really grateful that former President Trump is safe and extend my sympathies to the family of Corey Comperatore, who was fatally shot at the rally, and my sympathies to everyone who was injured. On July 13, major failures nearly led to the assassination of a presidential candidate who is also a former president of the United States. The Secret Service has to be fully transparent about how this happened and how it's going to change moving forward, understanding there's also a need to balance Congress' engagement in oversight with allowing law enforcement to conduct an ongoing criminal investigation. I want to thank the agents of the Secret Service for selflessly acting to protect elected officials and their families and our former presidents. We're grateful for their sacrifices and their service. And I want to thank all law enforcement and particularly law enforcement officers and first responders who worked to minimize harm to the crowd on July 13. Mr. Rowe, I want to start with you. New Hampshire hosts many political rallies. Protecting the speakers and attendees at these events requires extensive coordination between state and local law enforcement, the Secret Service staff, and obviously campaign events staff. As a former governor, I have experienced some of the challenges that this type of coordination can create, but we know that this coordination is really essential to public safety. It's clear that there were significant coordination failures on July 13. You told us earlier that the local SWAT team told the Secret Service that local law enforcement had eyes on the AGR roof, but there are reports that members of a local SWAT team never met with the Secret Service in the days before the Butler rally. What steps does the Secret Service take prior to political rallies to ensure that the agency is effectively coordinating with the candidate's security details, with state and local law enforcement and with campaign events staff?",
