      "sentences": "All right, hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And at any moment now, President Biden is set to depart from the White House as he heads for the campaign trail in South Carolina. Today's event in that early voting state comes on the heels of Biden endorsing a deal that could lead to the U.S. shutting down the border with Mexico. The president is now throwing his support behind a bipartisan Senate bill that sources say gives the U.S. the authority to crack down on illegal migrant crossings at the southern border using tough new measures, including implementing a shutdown when the border is overwhelmed. For more on these developments, let's bring in CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez who is already in South Carolina. Priscilla, what can you tell us about Biden's expected plan while in that state?",

And it's also a state that will kick off the Democratic nominating process for the first time, a change that Biden himself supported.But of course, all of this comes as President Biden is also navigating the complicated politics of the U.S.-Mexico border. The statement that he released on Friday marked a stark shift from where the White House has been in the early days of the administration as he tries to also fend off incoming attacks on immigration policy from former President Donald Trump. And in this statement, President Biden said that the compromise that Senate negotiators have been working on was tough and fair, but it was one line in particular that really struck current and former administration officials that I've been speaking with, and immigrant advocates. That was the following, quote, \"It would give me as president a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed, and if given that authority, I would use it the day I sign the bill into law.\" What that means according to our colleague Manu Raju is that the Department of Homeland Security would be able to shut down the border if the daily crossing average was over 4,000 people in a one-week span. Now this is something we've seen to some extent in practice during the coronavirus pandemic when former President Donald Trump invoked a restriction that allowed authorities to turn away migrants. That was something that Democrats and immigrant advocates condemned, and it's something that could come back in a different type of authority in this compromise. And it's also one that the president is embracing. And that really just goes to underscore the realities that this president has had to face on this issue. He's had to take a tougher stance amid record migration on the western hemisphere and as Republicans criticize his administration for the way they're handling the U.S.-Mexico border, but also fielding intense and fierce criticism from allies, including progressives and immigrant advocates who say that this is not the position President Biden was ever expected to take when in 2020 he was campaigning to restore the border and asylum.",

She's on the ballot for the primary, and remember the caucus is actually the race where the state's crucial delegates will be awarded. But because she is not on the ballot here, they're acting like Donald Trump already has this state in the bag.And because of that, it gives him and his team a good opportunity to try and make the pivot that they've been wanting to make for some time now toward a general election. Today we're going to expect to hear from Donald Trump. He'll talk about the economy, about crime, and also the border. As you mentioned, definitely an issue now that has all eyes on it. Already this morning, the former president has issued five different posts on social media railing against the border. One of them -- in one he said -- excuse me, I lost the quote. Here we go. In one he said, \"It is the worst border in the history of the world, an open wound in our once-great country. Terrorists are pouring in unchecked from all over the world.\" Now, Fred, I think the timing of these posts is very noteworthy. It comes as Donald Trump has been in private and publicly urging lawmakers to reject a bipartisan deal to secure the southern border. Part of that, I'm told, is because Donald Trump wants to continue talking about this in the leadup to November. But he also does not want President Joe Biden to have a big victory on an issue that he thinks is a vulnerability for a lot of Democrats. And so I think today you're going to hear him talk a lot about the border, you're going to hear a lot about attacking against -- making attacks on Joe Biden. And I also do expect -- a big question is whether he will bring up the E. Jean Carroll verdict where he has to award $83 million to her. Donald Trump is very furious about this. I've talked to his advisers. He's called it ridiculous on social media. He said that he plans to appeal it, something his attorney has also said. I expect Donald Trump will bring it up today just given how fresh it is, but that's something we'll be watching for. Fred?",

But she has in recent days called him unhinged, called him thin-skinned. And this is part of an effort to resist his calls and the calls from the Republican establishment to step aside, to exit this contest.In the next three-and-a-half weeks, she's holding 13 fundraisers in five different states. Her campaign says she raised upwards of $2 million since New Hampshire. And so certainly no indications that she's slowing down at any point and exiting the field. And her message to voters really is that she can capture the voters that Trump can't -- the moderates, the independents -- in a general election.

And there are actually reports that McMahon had paid out settlements to multiple women while serving as WWE's CEO and chairman had been circulating since at least 2022. But a lawsuit filed Thursday that accuses McMahon of explosive allegations of sexual assault, trafficking, and physical abuse was apparently the straw that broke the camel's back.The lawsuit was filed by Janel Grant, a former WWE staffer who worked at the headquarters of the wrestling behemoth McMahon founded. Grant is alleging that McMahon dangled a job offer at WWE and later promotions in exchange for sex. Grant's lawsuit also alleges that McMahon trafficked her to other men inside and outside the company, including John Laurinaitis, who worked in the company's talent and relations department and also named as a defendant in the suit. McMahon has denied the allegations and said he's prepared to defend himself in court. Attempts by CNN to reach Laurinaitis previously did not yield a response. And Fred, CNN has so far been unable to get reaction from Laurinaitis. After Grant's allegations were made public, McMahon resigned Friday night from his role as executive chairman of TKO, the parent company of WWE. TKO in an email to staff and in a statement to the press addressed only McMahon's job status with the company but did not discuss the specifics of the allegations. The statement says the following, \"Vince McMahon has tendered his resignation from his position as TKO executive chairman and on the TKO board of directors. He will no longer have a role with the TKO group holdings or WWE.\" As early as Thursday, TKO was apparently already distancing itself from McMahon. In a statement it made it clear that, quote, \"Mr. McMahon does not control TKO nor does he oversee the day-to-day operations of WWE. While this matter predates our TKO executive team's tenure at the company, we take Ms. Grant's horrific allegations very seriously and are addressing this matter internally.\"",

So the fact that the museum is making this change actually sends a pretty major signal to the rest of the field. Now here's what's happening. As you said, today the museum has closed two major galleries dedicated to the eastern woodlands and the great plains. Now, these galleries house several items, including Native American cultural items. And they are now going to be closed to the public. You can't walk through those galleries anymore. And so many of the display cases have been covered. We actually asked to go inside of the museum to get some video of these display cases, but they didn't let us. The whole idea here is to no longer display or show off these items. Now, why is this happening? You mention the federal rules that are going into the -- into effect. And what these rules require is that museums and federal agencies now have to consult and obtain informed consent from descendants, tribes, or native Hawaiian organizations before displaying or researching human remains or cultural items. Now, this is actually an update to a law that's been on the books since the 1990s. That's the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. But for many years there's been a lot of criticism that this law did not center the voices and experiences of the nations or of indigenous people to decide how these objects should be displayed.

Then he goes to the NFL, three straight NFC championship titles, a Super Bowl berth in 2012. He fell short to the Ravens that year. His brother, John Harbaugh, coached against him in that game.",

It would be nice if they would go to the Super Bowl, but first we've got to get through his first season once he gets there. MORIARTYAnd I think with Justin Herbert as quarterback, with all the openings that were, eight NFL openings this cycle, and Harbaugh, I think, picked the Chargers because they have a proven guy like Herbert under center. His record as a starter isn't great, 30 and 32. But he is really talented, and Harbaugh has been able to develop some quarterbacks in the past. What he has done with J.J. McCarthy the last couple years is really, really impressive.",

He has been at Michigan since 2018. So he understands the culture, what it takes to win. Recruiting-wise, that also helps because he knows the kids that they're going to sign next month with early signing day and then moving on the years to come.The other thing is, it's a lot cheaper to hire a first-time head coach. His buyout if it doesn't work out three or four years down the line, it won't be as much as some of the other big-name coaches that they could have gone after. It's also really late in the coaching carousel cycle to go after a big name like that. So it's exciting. Any time a black head coach is named the head coach of power five level is a win. So really, really a great situation for Michigan, and we'll see if it works out.",
