His son, Hunter Biden, is headed behind closed doors to face questions from House lawmakers.This deposition has been a long time coming. We've been talking about it a long time and quite a spectacle in the lead-up as Hunter Biden -- he wanted to testify publicly but Republicans wanted to question him away from the cameras. Katelyn Polantz is with us tracking all of this. So what is going to happen today, Katelyn?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. You would be forgiven if you feel a little confused waking up this morning because it does appear that Speaker Mike Johnson has sort of changed his mind in terms of the direction that they want to go. He has offered to move forward with a short-term spending bill to get them over this government funding deadline coming Friday at midnight, but only if they can get a broader agreement on the spending packages moving forward.Essentially, what this short-term deal would do is it would kick Friday's deadline to next week. The deadline after that to March 22. And then you would have the situation where you would continue to have these staggered dates that lawmakers have to work beyond. But the argument from the speaker's office is this would guarantee that appropriators know exactly where they are headed. This is the fourth iteration that we have seen of these punted deadlines, however, and it's not clear that this is all going to come together because it does require them to agree on sort of a broader negotiation about what to do about some of these poison pill policy writers that they have been fighting over. The same things that have really kept them from reaching deals over the course of the last several months. So that's where things stand. It's also not clear how the conservatives in Mike Johnson's conference will take this news. Do they view this as a positive? Do they view this as really just kicking the can down the road to the inevitable? I think that remains to be seen. The House of Representatives is coming back tonight. That is the first opportunity we're going to get to talk to some of these members and see how are they feeling about this direction -- this back and forth from Speaker Mike Johnson -- John.",

It reportedly involved almost 2,000 employees, right, spending billions of dollars since 2014, all with the mission of trying to build an electric vehicle.But now, according to multiple media outlets citing anonymous sources, Apple is pulling the plug, right? They're walking away altogether and they're deciding to pull out all that money and all of those people into the next shiny bright object, artificial intelligence. Now, Apple is winning some early praise here. The stock did go up a bit yesterday on this news. A veteran tech analyst, Dan Ives -- he says that Apple is clearly making the right move here because of all of the struggles in the EV market. Ives wrote a note to clients saying that, quote, \"Apple saw the writing on the wall to rip the Band-Aid off.\" And it's true, Kate.

But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that [Apple] typically enjoys on its products.\" So think about that. Even at $100,000, Apple didn't know if it could really make money here. So if you're Tim Cook you have to decide between plowing billions of dollars more into the uncertain EV market or going head-first into AI, which has almost limitless potential, it's probably not that hard of a decision.",

He says he's not looking for preferential treatment.Just to explain what's happened here, obviously, Prince Harry left the royal -- his working -- his role as a working royal. With it came lots of public support. Part of that was security from the police. He left that public role. He lost that security. Now he says he has a right to it when he visits the U.K. So this is a debate around that. I think what a lot of lawyers on the other side say is -- looking at this -- you're just another VIP now. You're not a member of the royal family. You're not fulfilling a public role so you shouldn't get all of those public benefits. And they are offering a bespoke service, effectively. So think about a big Hollywood A-lister coming over to the U.K. If there's a credible threat against them, then they do get armed police to support them. But it's not a given. Harry wants it to be a given. He wants it every time he comes over. He's cited that actually for the reason he hasn't brought his kids over to the U.K. in recent years. But we have just heard he's going to appeal it. Should he have an exemption? Should he be a completely different type of VIP than currently exists? The judge today said he felt it was fair to give him a bespoke security service -- so only getting that armed support when there is a credible threat against him when he comes over.",
