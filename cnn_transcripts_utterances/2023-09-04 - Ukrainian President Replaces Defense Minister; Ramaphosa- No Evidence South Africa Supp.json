First up though, your other headlines is our South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, says that an investigation has found no evidence that his country loaded arms and ammunition on to a Russian cargo ship late last year. There appears to be progress in efforts to mediate the conflict in Sudan. The Kenyan President William Ruto told me today that a meeting will be held on the sidelines of the African climate summit in Nairobi. And later this hour over 70,000 attendees still stuck at the annual Burning Man Festival, flooding and mud is left the Nevada desert venue site impossible. We'll this for the second hour of \"Connect the World\". The Kremlin says that talks between the Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan today have been constructive the top level meeting aimed to resurrect the Black Sea Grain initiative, a deal vital to ensuring food and fertilizer can leave ports in Ukraine safely. Well those talks follow another important diplomatic development in Russia's war on Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has replaced his Defense Minister, citing the need for new approaches, and I quote him there in his ongoing counter offensive. The move comes at a critical time as Ukraine enters a new phase with allies and weapons donors. So tonight we ask, what will this new phase of war look like? We've got team coverage for you. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia region and an International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson. He's been in and out of Ukraine over the past 18 months, of course, reporting from London today. Let's start with you, Nic, what do we know about what was discussed between Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier today? Let's start there.",

There have been promises we feel that we're being lied to by Ukraine's Western backers. And we don't take this at face value. And he's offering an alternate proposal to get Russia's grain to some six African nations by shipping it to Turkey. And then having Turkey on ship it to those countries potentially expanding there. What was actually agreed here, so if there was anything specific really didn't come out in the public forum, but we did hear from President Erdogan. And he did say that he was hopeful that deal could be put back together soon, I think was his word. But we don't have a sense of timeline. And we don't have a sense of how the gaps between what the U.N. have in its proposal, what Russia wants to see. Now we don't have a sense of how those might be bridged.",

He's had extensive knowledge of so much of this for being involved, as he has been in some of the prisoner of war exchanges. But he's also taking over at a crucial time, because what we understand from President Zelenskyy, what he's been saying these last few days and weeks is that September is going to be an extremely busy period. Not just as Ukrainian forces try and press ahead with their counter offensive, but also in terms of asking Western allies for more weaponry that will allow them, they believe, to make the difference when it comes to their frontlines. So this man is taking over at a critical time, both in terms of what Ukraine is going to be asking allies for. But also about what Ukraine is trying to do in terms of its own weapons capability, bringing weapons that are able to bring this war to Russia itself. And that is something that Ukraine has been doing more and more successfully. This Rustem Umerov takes over at a point when not only is he going to pursue those two aspects.

It also comes as China battles a number of economic challenges with one of the country's largest homebuilders warning of default. On Sunday, the U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters that he was disappointed that Xi was not attending the summit, but suggested that he will be meeting with him in the future. Biden did not elaborate. A U.S. tensions and tensions with China have flared over Taiwan, trade and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

So it's already missed those it's now in a grace period. But that ends next week. So default could be around the corner. And actually, this is something that the company warned about just last week. They warned that they could default on debts; they also posted a loss of $7 billion for the first half of the year. Now Moody says it has around $4.3 billion of debt that matures between now and the end of next year.

This happened in Shanxi Province last month. Police say the pair breached the wall so they could have a shortcut and caused irreversible damage. The part that was damage is known as the 32nd Great Wall. It's one of the surviving complete walls and towers that date back to the Ming Dynasty. Well it's banned in many countries in the Middle East; UAE could legalize this multibillion dollar industry soon, more on that up next.

Many would argue that Dubai and the UAE genuinely is many steps ahead from Saudi Arabia, while there's so muchdiscussion about just opening up tourism in Saudi Arabia, for example, even, you know, starting the discussion of potentially even bringing an alcohol, Dubai has deregulated the alcohol industry. It's changed its weekends, it's changed laws around owning property here. It's really trying to entrench itself as a tourism hub. And this was the next step. Now if you want to go gambling, or you want to go to a casino, basically, in the entire region, you have to go to Egypt, we have to go to Lebanon and locals are not allowed. So that might be interesting in terms of what the parameters will be around there. But in terms of economic benefit, yet, as you mentioned, it's in the billions according to Bloomberg, it could be around $6.6 billion. And just looking at the potential investment of other hotels, you're going to need more capacity; you're going to see more FDI coming through into the UAE. And I think we need to focus on what we see in Ras Al Khaimah that will be really interesting example of when they get the license. What we'll be seeing through coming through there in terms of who's allowed to go into this casino. How will it operate? I think the regulatory environment is shifting dramatically Becky. And this is because the UAE wants to stay a leader and wants to keep its position as a prime tourist spot in the region.",
