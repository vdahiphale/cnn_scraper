One is clearly Prigozhin has been the Head and the figurehead of the Wagner mercenary group in Africa where it's been doing the Kremlin's busy bidding, propping up leaders there and extracting mineral rights gold in some cases, diamond and others.So the fact that he should appear on the margins of this Africa summit really seems to send a message to those Wagner client's states in Africa, Kremlin client's states in Africa and reality that the business operation is there and it continues to work. How much support there is from the Kremlin is unclear. We know that some sort of Wagner allies Prigozhin allies within the Russian military have sort of been disappeared, if you will. We know the British MOD believes that Prigozhin is suffering financial troubles right now to pay his mercenaries. So there seems to be an effort to prop up his image as a viable, ongoing, mercenary enterprise supporting leaders extracting minerals in Africa. But what else does it tell us? It's very, very hard to say is that a message for Putin? Undoubtedly, if he is there in St. Petersburg, mingling with these delegates, this cannot be without Putin's say so. And Putin had threatened him with severe retribution for this mutiny barely a month ago.",

[08:05:00] But that's a very simplistic way of looking at of course because the overall wheat price has shot up since Russia pulled out of that Black Sea Grain Deal. And that means that African countries can be affected. And he certainly belabor that point saying that, according to the Russian Head of state, it is the sanctions which is stopping Russia from getting grain fertilizer or other products out to the developing world. And particularly to parts of Russia and he said that they will be doing that in the coming months shoring up their credentials in Russians mind as an aid partner, at least two African countries, Max.",

In fact, as we have seen many times North Korea often looks for opportunities to make the symbolic displays of power and might and what happened today is certainly no exception. We saw North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un along with Russia's Defense Minister.Basically go on a tour if you'd like have a have a military display almost a show. There. They saw what has been described by state media as new type weapons as well as equipment. It's interesting because North Korea and Russia have enjoyed a long time relationship. A partnership almost in fact, we recently heard from Russia's Defense Minister talking about Korea's People's Army saying \"has become the strongest army in the world\". It is obviously not alone here. China has a presence as well. We saw the three of these nations come together during this historic moment, especially as the rest of the world condemned the war in Ukraine. These three nations have really formed an alliance together. North Korea accused by the United States of supplying weapons to Russia in that effort and China, not necessarily condemning Russia, in fact, if anything kind of maintaining a cozy relationship with Russia through all of this. So Max, it is 9 o'clock at night right now in Pyongyang so far no sign of a big military parade which is perhaps emblematic of these kinds of anniversaries. We'll certainly be keeping watch.",

The 56 year olds cause of death has not yet been made public but isn't being treated as suspicious. As CNN's Randi Kaye looks at her rise to fame and the deeply troubled life that later followed.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Sinead O'Connor singing the hit song that catapulted her to international stardom, nothing compares to you. The song was written by Prince, and in 1990, she topped the music charts with her version of it. The Irish singer earned four Grammy nominations for the song and the album it was on. She also won the award for MTV's video of the year. In 1991, Rolling Stone magazine named her Artist of the Year. O'Connor's singing voice was extraordinary pure power. And her stage presence electric but behind all of that, or perhaps helping fuel it, there was pain, lots of it. O'Connor spoke about how her mother abused her in a recent Showtime documentary called Nothing Compares. LATE SINEAD O'CONNOR, IRISH SINGER: My mother was a very violent woman, not a healthy woman, mentally at all and she was physically and verbally and psychologically, spiritually and emotionally abusive. My mother was a beast and I was able to soothe her with my voice, was able to use my voice to make the devil fall asleep. KAYE (voice over): Sometime after her parents divorced O'Connor at age 14 was sent away to live in an asylum run by the Order of Our Lady of Charity. O'CONNOR: I was a bit messed up, and it wasn't acknowledged what had happened to me in my mother's has. KAYE (voice over): O'Connor's mother died in a car accident in 1985, two years before her debut album was released. O'Connor often used her music to address social issues and inspire change. In 1992, one Saturday Night Live, O'Connor tore up a photo of Pope John Paul the second to protest sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. O'CONNOR: Fight the real enemy. KAYE (voice over): In 1999, she became the first priestess of a dissident Roman Catholic group. And after the Catholic pre sex abuse scandal broke wide open, she called on the Vatican to stop covering up the truth telling Anderson Cooper this in 2010. O'CONNOR: The one thing that victims really require for healing and so do the rest of us, as Catholic people is a full admission by the Vatican that there was an active cover up in operation for decades. And since 1922, KAYE (voice over): O'Connor long struggled with her mental health. She attempted suicide at age 33. In 2017, she posted this video of herself at a motel in New Jersey, in the midst of a mental breakdown. O'CONNOR: The people are over remembering those are the most vulnerable people on Earth we can take care of our things so -- KAYE (voice over): A year later, she converted to Islam and changed her name to Shuhada Sadaqat. Last year, O'Connor's 17 year old son Shane died by suicide. O'Connor shared this photo of the two of them just last week on Twitter. Despite saying in 2021, she would quit making music and touring. O'Connor recently recorded the opening song for the hit show Outlander seventh season. KAYE (voice over): Sinead O'Connor was 56. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
