Polls are now open in the critical South Carolina Republican primary. Voters there are deciding between former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as the next GOP presidential nominee. It's an election being closely monitored around the world, especially in Ukraine. Today, that nation is marking two years since Russia's invasion. Leaders from several western countries are in Kyiv to reinforce their support as fears grow that crucial U.S. military funding will come to late. And new developments in Russia where a spokesperson for late Putin opposition leader Alexei Navalny says his body has been turned over to his mother, more than a week after he was found dead in a Russian prison. All right, let's begin in this country with a GOP presidential showdown underway right now in South Carolina. Voters are heading to the polls in the Palmetto State today for the high stake's primary between former President Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who is fighting against the odds for a win in her home state. She vows to continue her campaign regardless of tonight's outcome, while Trump is looking for a decisive victory. We have team coverage of today's election. Kylie Atwood is at a polling site where Nikki Haley just voted. But let's begin with Alayna Treene, who was also at a polling site but in Mount Pleasant. Kylie in Kiawah Island. So, Alayna, to you first, what kind of voter turnout Are you seeing there?",

And there is a lot of people at this polling location. A lot of voters eager to have their voices heard today.And it is a huge day. I mean, this is the state where the former president's campaign is expected or are expecting to deliver the final blow to Nikki Haley and her campaign. And it's also a place where it's Nikki Haley's home state, and she wants to have, you know, a good showing here. She -- I think her campaign as we've heard from our coverage with her campaign that they are not expecting to win necessarily today, but they do want to get closer than they did in New Hampshire, where she trailed Donald Trump by 11 points. I just want to point out something interesting. I heard from some voters today, Fred, as we were grabbing them as they exited the polling location. One voter, her name was Kelly, she is a Democrat. She said that she came out and voted for Nikki Haley, after Haley had sent a series of fundraising text messages to her and also encouraged Democrats to get out and vote for her today. And I think that's really interesting for the dynamics of this race, because here in South Carolina, it is an open primary. And that means Democrats and Republicans and independents, all of them can come and vote today. And so, it will be interesting to see whether or not that will help her get more support. Now, for Donald Trump's part, they are very confident that he is going to win today, the latest polls show that he is up by 30 points over Nikki Haley. But I can tell you from my conversations with Trump advisors that behind the scenes, the former president is very frustrated that Nikki Haley has refused to drop out thus far. He's really eager to begin a general election pivot to November and begin attacking Joe Biden, and they see Nikki Haley as standing in the way of that. Fred?",

And it's visible in places like Mount Pleasant, a suburb of Charleston, where we've been seeing over the last couple of weeks, you know, they're popping out of the ground like spring flowers, those campaign signs of Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. I'd go down the road one day, and I'd see a slew of Nikki Haley signs. And by the time I was driving home, there were an equal number of Donald Trump signs put in front of her signs. So, the side warfare is going on. The kind of usual cadence of things is happening. But there is an excitement here that I'm hearing on the ground. When I went to Nikki Haley's rally last night, I spoke with a woman who told me she was excited to have a choice that she didn't feel like she's had one in past elections, including in 2020, and including in 2016.

And yes, some of those individuals were people of color. So, I think it is, in many ways more of an extension of the way that Donald Trump has been talking about himself of at the same time, that he is talking about himself and positioning as something of a strongman candidate. He'll also in the same breath, look to paint himself as something of a victim and that he is the only person standing in the way of indictments coming to normal everyday people, which we know that transitive property doesn't add up.

And that's something that they see as something of a glimmer of hope that says, hey, our message does have a home. This may not be the traditional coalition that we've seen Republican presidential candidates build, but they are arguing and making the case that, that general election voter doesn't want Donald Trump, doesn't want Joe Biden, and she's trying to emerge as that candidate who people could unite and unify behind.

Because it shows that she is trying to get that message across the state, even at the same time that she has been crisscrossing it herself on a navy-blue campaign bus.But in terms of that electorate, that's a great question, because I'm sitting here in Charleston. This is the first congressional district by and large, there are pieces of it that are also in the sixth, which is currently represented by Jim Clyburn. The first is represented by Nancy Mace. Why does that matter? Nikki Haley endorsed Nancy Maze in her 2022 reelection bid on that GOP primary. Donald Trump endorsed Katie Arrington in that contest. What happens next? Nancy Mace won the first congressional district handily in that GOP primary. But fast forward to where we are today, Nancy Mace has endorsed Donald Trump. So, whether Nikki Haley's message plays -- pays off here in the first, it's going to be really interesting, because this is a place that's home to many suburban women, who are definitely a core constituency of Nikki Haley, and has been turned off greatly by Donald Trump. So, I'm really taking a look at the first, also want to see how she does in the sixth, which is heavily Democratic. And you know, I think that, you know, the more socially conservative upstate is going to be really inhospitable territory for her at this point.

And to be clear, I think the prosecutor gave them this issue, both the special prosecutor Mr. Wade as well as Fani Willis as we look at there. And obviously any good defense attorney is going to capitalize on an issue.But this case is about what if anything happened regarding the President and the 18 other defendants. Well, now, pared down, four pled guilty, three of which were attorneys for the Trump campaign, whether there was any wrongdoing, and it's about the process and fairness in the process. And just the minute, Fredricka, let's talk about that. There's a grand jury that gets convened of citizens of Georgia and that grand jury doesn't decide guilt or innocence. They decide whether there's reasonable cause to believe that crimes were committed, and defendants committed them. They had that process. Moving forward, right, in the event, the case proceeds, there'll be a trial jury, a trial jury will make a determination based upon guilt or lack thereof, beyond the reasonable doubt all having to be unanimous. And so that's the case. This is a side show, and certainly the judge had to entertain it with an evidentiary hearing. The question for me is irrespective of cruises, and whether she likes Australia, and does she keep money in the house or not. And what did her father tell her and when they met, is the President and anybody else getting a fair trial pursuant to the processes, and whether this at all would impair that? And so that's I think, where the focus needs to be, and not so much on these text messages and the dalliances if any. But listen, that's my perspective, certainly the judge has to have a proceeding in court. And we'll see what that proceeding unveils when they go back on Friday, Fredricka, March 1st, for the continued proceedings.",

We have 134 hostages according to the Israelis, as many as 30 may have been killed on October 7th, their bodies taken the Gaza by Hamas to trade. And then there are more who have died in captivity. So the longer this goes on, the more concern for the health and wellbeing of these hostages. Again, I think, you know, nobody ever lost money betting against Arab- Israeli peace, Israeli-Palestinian peace. But I think this time around, the pressures on both sides may be sufficient in order to secure this limited deal, 45 hostages in exchange for a six-week pause in military activities on the part of the Israelis.",
