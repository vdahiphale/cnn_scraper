      "sentences": "Top of the hour. Good morning, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga.New this morning, a Russian missile strikes in Ukraine, this time targeting rescue workers in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. Officials say they were trying to save the survivors of a missile attack carried out last night when Russian launched another round of strikes. CNN is at the blast site and we'll take you there in just a moment. Also this hour, new tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese officials condemning the U.S.'s move to gain access to bases in the Philippines close to Taiwan. We'll have more on that in just a moment. And on Capitol Hill, we're expecting to hear soon from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy after his big meeting with President Biden yesterday on the debt ceiling, and just before a divisive vote to remove Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from the foreign affairs committee. But, first, let's go straight to Ukraine. CNN is on the ground, near the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, where city officials say the Russians are again targeting civilians with missile strikes on the city. Joining me live from Pokrovsk, which is close to the frontlines there, is CNN Senior International Correspondent Frederik Pleitgen. So, Fred, I know you were on Kramatorsk earlier today, quite close to some of these attacks. Now, two attacks, right, one overnight, and as we mentioned, one happening as rescue workers were coming into that apartment complex.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that is absolutely correct. There was a first attack that happened overnight in Kramatorsk and hit a residential building. The Ukrainians are saying that it was hit, Bianna, by an Iskander missile, which is pretty heavy surface-to-surface missile with a big warhead. A building was pretty much flattened by that strike. The Ukrainians are saying that three people were killed, one person was still missing.So, at that site, there was an active search and rescue operation going on. There was a big search and rescue operation, a lot of cranes being in use, more than 100 police officers alone were at the scene. Now, we went to Kramatorsk earlier today to film of some of what was going on there, some of that search and rescue operation. As we arrived in Kramatorsk, at the site of that first blast, as we parked our cars and got out, there was a second missile attack targeting the building that we had just parked in front of. So, I would say that the first missile hit about 40 or 50 yards away from where we were. It was a giant blast. You could also tell it was a very big missile. And, obviously, a lot of people then went running for cover. We also tried to make our way to safety, to a hardened location. And as we were going there, I turned around and looked up and I saw a second missile hit the exact same building once again. Now, the Ukrainians are saying that there were further people who were wounded in that attack. They say that this time, it was two S-300 missiles that struck in that second strike. Those are normally used to shoot down airplanes, Bianna. And if they are used against ground targets, they are very inaccurate. And, of course, if they're used against ground targets in densely populated urban centers, it makes things all the more dangerous. However, the bottom line of the whole thing was that there was a place where there was an active search and rescue operation, and that place was targeted in a densely populated area once again today by the Russian military, Bianna.",

      "sentences": "I mean, it has the hallmarks of yet another war crime committed by Russians, Fred. And this is coming as E.U. officials are in Kyiv today, and Ukrainians continue with their two main asks. One is that fast-track membership to join the E.U. and the other is for more advanced, long range weaponry, ATACMS and obviously F-16s. Any indication that either one of those asks will be granted any time soon?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think right now, western governments, Bianna, as far as those fighter jets are concerned, they're really saying that, at the moment, that's not something that's in the cards. That doesn't necessarily mean that down the line, it is not something that could possibly happen. But I think right now, it is going to be very difficult to do that.But one of the things, of course, that Ukrainians would really want is those longer range missiles. That's something -- I have spoken to so many Ukrainian officials over the past couple of weeks that we've been in the country, and all of them say longer distance weapons are absolutely necessary. They need them, they say, to stop some of those the Russian logistic lines that have been put further away from the line by the Russians to avoid some of the multiple rocket launching systems that the Ukrainians have, but also, for instance, to prevent the Russians from conducting strikes like the ones that we saw today, which happened from a further distance. Those missiles can travel pretty far distances, and the Ukrainians say they need something to be able stop that from happening. Now, currently, that is not the case, the missiles that the Russians used today almost impossible to intercept. So, the Ukrainians are saying, we need to hit those things before they can actually take off. In order to do that, they need longer range missiles. So, that is definitely very high on what the Ukraine -- on the agenda of what the Ukrainians want, and they hope that they get it from the U.S. and possibly from the U.S.'s allies as well, Bianna.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And that's why China is so upset about this. We will get to that in just a moment here. But a major announcement coming from the United States and the Philippines with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meeting the national security leadership of the Philippines, including his counterpart and the president, and expanding upon this agreement, what's officially known as the enhanced defense cooperation agreement. That gives the U.S. access to military bases. They will now have access to more military bases.And although neither the U.S. nor the Philippines have said what bases those will be, we know in the past they have expressed interests in bases in the North Philippines. And that's where we can bring up this map to get a sense of why China is reacting the way it is, because that could put U.S. forces at Philippine military bases even closer to Taiwan than before. We see on the northern side of Okinawa, where the U.S. recently announced a newly reorganized Marine unit just a few weeks back. That's just 200 miles off the northern coast, and now potentially less than 200 miles off the southern coast, China and Taiwan could be looking at some U.S. forces there as well depending on how this agreement is plays out. And that is why you see China responding with this accusation of the American selfish agenda and accusing the U.S. of being the one to affect the regional stability. But it is also bigger than that. The former Philippine president, Rodrigo Dueterte, had moved the Philippines closer to Beijing. And this is the current, the new administration, essentially realigning that, still careful with how it operates vis-a-vis Beijing, but also making it clear it is moving the Philippines back towards the United States. And that for the U.S. is an accomplishment especially as it shifts towards that region, towards the Indo-Pacific region and efforts to contain and deter China, especially as some officials more concerned than ever about a potential Beijing invasion of Taiwan.

Personally, though, the U.S. government said that that does not bear true to how they view the situation right now. Nonetheless, very alarming. Oren Liebermann, thank you.Well, back on Capitol Hill, we are waiting to hear from House Speaker McCarthy ahead of a vote of to remove Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from the foreign affairs committee and following its high-stakes meeting with President Biden on the debt ceiling.

Kevin McCarthy, the speaker, making clear to reporters, told me and others yesterday and the days after, he said he does have the votes to kick her off the committee over her past comments which were criticized as anti-Semitic, she apologized for those comments. But, nevertheless, he has vowed for the past year or so to take her off of the committee after the Democrats removed two Republican members over their comments in the last Congress.Now, this will require a vote of the full house. We expect that to happen later today. Kevin McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republican votes. He is likely to lose at least one, but they believe they can keep the defections lower. Now, once they get past this issue, then the bigger issue about avoiding the first ever debt default in U.S. history looms large. Kevin McCarthy did meet with President Biden yesterday. They both sounded positive after the meeting, but they also made clear, Kevin McCarthy did, there is a lot more work to do. And McCarthy told me last night that he rejected one of the key issues, one of the key demands from the White House, which is to raise the national debt ceiling don't include any conditions, no strings attached. But he told me he would not accept a clean debt ceiling increase. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY:  I did not go in there with any predetermined things we had to have. This is our very first discussion. The discussion today was he was never going to negotiate with me. So, we just spent an hour together. We had times that we disagreed, but in the parts that we are disagreeing, we are very honest and I was very straight-forward on things I would not do?",

Kevin McCarthy made clear yesterday, and as Manu just detailed, there is a long road to go here. Nobody expected yesterday to have the president or the speaker emerge from that meeting with a roadmap to exactly how this is going to get resolved. This was just the very beginning of to process.But I think that for both of their benefits and sort of the message that they want to put out there on this, both the president today at the prayer breakfast and Speaker McCarthy yesterday kind of just wanted to turn down the temperature a bit. They were doing so much shadowboxing before they sat down. So, to emerge from this and express optimism about a professional, respectful relationship while still acknowledging the very hard work of actually finding a path to avoid default remains ahead of them, I think both things can be true at the same time.",

So, that is why you have President Biden now saying, I have been there, done that, and this is why we are firm when we say we want a clean debt bill.

So, if indeed Kevin McCarthy sticks to his position and this conference holds him to the position of a clean debt ceiling being nonnegotiable, not something that they're going to pass, well, then does the White House start agreeing to some spending cuts that happened simultaneously in a separate package? Is there a path around the semantics of a clean debt ceiling hike or negotiation? It seems to me that's going to be the resolution here.They are clearly going to negotiate. There's no doubt about that. What the White House is trying to accomplish here is saying, we have got to pay the bills on the money already spent.

And I think this is example number one today of how that plays out.Whether or not it is going to have real world ramifications for the way things get done in Congress from here on out, I am not so sure, but it is certainly something that the Republican base has been demanding, is enthused about and that Kevin McCarthy wants to prove after that really elongated battle to become speaker that he can keep the conference together on things and actually even something that is a message item, keep the conference together and deliver on some of what they promised back in November.",

I mean, who would have ever thought we would be at a time where one day the FBI is searching the home of the current, the sitting president, and on another day, we are talking about whether or not the president's son has a laptop out there floating around information that could be damaging to the president.
