Things are slowly getting back to normal there. And it was a pair of youtubers, aptly named the McCoys, who helped lead the end to this 11-day manhunt. It all happened over dinner. They were on a date night. And about five days into the unsuccessful manhunt, they decided that they wanted a piece of this reward. So they decided to go into that vast and rugged -- rugged wilderness. And after about six days, they made the discovery following a pack of buzzards flying overhead and also that foul odor.

And so far, police said that it has not been positively identified as Joseph Couch, but it's believed to be the suspected I-75 shooter because of items found near the body. No cause of death given, Brianna, but there was a weapon recovered nearby. His body is currently in the capital in Kentucky where it's going through those positive identifications. The couple, meanwhile, they are $35,000 richer. I talked to Crimestoppers earlier this morning and they are expected to get that full $35,000 reward -- Brianna?",

So it's important to point out, in this case, the former presidents campaign is the victim of this Iranian cyberattack. The administration, however, the Biden administration, Biden-Harris administration has said that, in this election cycle, Iran and Russia, in particular, have accelerated, in the words of deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, who just spoke yesterday at the aspen cyber summit. She said that those two countries have accelerated their activities to interfere in the 2024 elections. So the administration is making a lot of efforts. FBI Director Wray announced an action against China on the cybersecurity front, where they we're recently targeting critical infrastructure. The administration has been very clear about Iranian efforts to influence the election.

That gets us down to the low what's level since about 2021. We should still note, though, that we are still seeing more than 100,000 deaths from drug overdose in the United States every year. And these are numbers that are much higher than we we're seeing before the pandemic when, during covid, these really started to surge a lot. So we're seeing trends going in the right direction. Researchers are trying to figure out, are these real? And they say there are some indicators that say, yes, not only are fatal drug overdoses down about 10 percent, but non-fatal drug overdoses also are declining by about 15 to 20 percent nationally. We are seeing that Fentanyl-related drug deaths are declining, particularly sharply, down 20 percent in the data from Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.
