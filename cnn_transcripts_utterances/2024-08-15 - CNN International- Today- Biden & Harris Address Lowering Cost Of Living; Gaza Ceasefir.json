Isaac, this is the first time we're seeing Biden and Harris together in this type of joint events since Biden stepped aside and we're now learning more about his head space since making that decision, tell us about that. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Look, obviously, it's a very difficult July for Joe Biden. He felt turned on by a lot of members of his own party and a lot of old allies, including Nancy Pelosi and to an extent, Barack Obama as well. He feels somewhat relief to not be running. Presidential candidates always say that the best days of their campaign are the first day and the last day of the campaign but he also was hoping to run again. So there is a little bit of wistfulness and there's definitely frustration about the circumstances that led to him essentially being pushed out of the race. But his commitment does remain now to making sure that Donald Trump is not the president. I think those two clips that you played at the top, they're really good at it Harris saying that he -- in saying, thank you, Joe, and her saying about him -- sorry, saying about her, that she's an incredible partner and then she's going to make one hell of a president, that's the kind of connection and unity that they are trying to convey now and into next week for the Democratic convention.",

So, we heard from President Biden today saying, we want to negotiate on all of them. So, this is really going to be cumulative.

CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  They do appear to be huge. The real question will be, to what extent do they affect the private market? Because so many private insurers sort of benchmark their policies. There reimbursement rates against what the federal government does in the -- especially in the Medicare program -- to some extent in the Medicaid program. But that reimburses at much lower rates.

We've seen that happen in other countries when politicians are in control of the money supply that tends to lead to worse inflationary outcomes because nobody trusts that the government is not going to print more money to pay its bills or juice the economy just in time for an election, for example. Beyond that, Trump has, of course, said that he would deport millions of immigrants. That presumably includes the immigrants that pick our produce and build our homes. You can expect prices for those things to go up. He's also said or some of his advisers have suggested that he wants to devalue the dollar. And then there's his tariff policy. He wants to impose 10 percent tariffs the other day actually, yesterday he said and maybe 20 percent tariffs on all goods coming into the United States. Maybe 50 to 100 percent tariffs allegedly on Chinese products. Those tariffs will be passed along to U.S. consumers, at least in part is previous trade wars had the exact same consequence. There's been a bunch of studies looking at this and found but the cost of those tariffs were passed down to consumers who, who bought the affected products.

They leave just shortages. They lead to uncertainty. They lead to black markets, et cetera. You know, that has been very discouraging to see her lean into. Beyond that, I'm interested to see what else she says about taxes. How much does she emphasize, for example, expanding the child tax credit? Does she maintain Biden's pledge to not increase taxes of any kind on households making under $400,000, how much wiggle room does she leave for the corporate tax rate, which obviously Republicans want to lower and the Biden/Harris administration has proposed raising, but maybe there's a trade there. Who knows, you know, what the child tax credit or something else? So, those are the things I'm looking for.

The health ministry there reporting 40,000 people have been killed since this conflict began ten months ago. That's about one in every 55 people who live in Gaza, the majority, women and children. It's a stark reminder of the deadly cost of this war and why mediators are applying pressure for Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement. Negotiations are expected to continue into Friday. Now earlier today, U.S. national security communications advisor John Kirby said that the talks are off to a promising start.

So that was taken as a good sign and it was understood that the mandate that they've been given by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would allow them to move things forward.The caution from -- from John Kirby was that while this is a positive start, don't expect immediate results and I think that's what we're seeing already and it's not surprising. And these things don't get immediate results because its proximity talks that are sequential. So one party meets and it looks like the Israelis will be meeting again, not only with the Qatari and Egyptian mediators, with the U.S. mediators as well, that there'll be meeting again tomorrow. So that also is a sort of a good sign. And then there's the possibility that the mediators, this is expected that they will meet with Hamas after that. But then, of course, Hamas has representatives in Doha that they're going to have to reach out to Yahya Sinwar, the leader in Gaza, and that process often takes time. So, nothing fast. But if you look at the fact that there was so much concern about getting the talks going in the first place. And now, they're already huddled into a second day, positive step.

NATALIE STRAND, PROFESSOR OF ANESTHESIOLOGY, DIVISION OF PAIN MEDICINE AT THE MAYO CLINIC:  Well, ketamine has been used in medicine for, I mean, 50, 60, 70 years. So it's a very common and usually very safe drug. In fact, that's one of the things we love about it in anesthesiology. They're really five main reasons we use ketamine in the hospital or outpatient care. One is to start anesthesia or to give procedural sedation to somebody who needs sedation but doesn't need to be completely out for a procedure. We also use it for pain medicine, both for acute pain and chronic pain. But typically this is not highly monitored setting. We can use it for mental health treatment. I think a lot of people know about that using it for depression primarily. Also, some researchers showing it can be helpful with anxiety, with PTSD, even with addiction, because it might treat some of the depression and anxiety that goes along with addiction. We also use it for pain relief. That end of life. So terminal illnesses and palliative hair and reuse it in the emergency department. So in the right hands, in the right setting, it is very safe, very useful, and very commonly used. While it does not have the physical potential for abuse the same way that opioids are benzodiazepines do, you can develop a psychological dependence on it.

So to go back to your original question, when we administer ketamine IV or intramuscularly, patients are always monitored. We monitor heart. We monitor oxygen saturation. We monitor respiratory rate. So if someone is taking ketamine for the most part in these -- these access points, they should be monitored.

Since the race changed three weeks ago, allies of the former president have been calling them for him to focus on the issues concerning voters, not his new opponent. Yesterday, Trump was supposed to address voters in North Carolina about his plan for the economy, but continued to attack Kamala Harris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They wanted to do a speech on the economy. A lot of people are very devastated by what's happened with inflation and all of the other things. So we are doing this as an intellectual speech. We're all intellectuals today. What happened to her laugh? I haven't heard that laugh in about a week? That's why they keep her off the stage. When Kamala lays out her fake economic plan this week, probably, it will be a copy of my plan because so basically that's what she does. She's not a brilliant person. She is not a smart person. She is not very smart. But it is crazy, isn't it, though? Isn't it crazy? She was so disrespected just a few weeks ago. And now, its like Kamala, Kamala. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, joining me now. Shermichael, let me start with you. As we all know, Republicans have been pleading with Donald Trump to try to focus on the race its focus on the issues. Yesterday's event was not a typical Trump rally. I mean, people were seated. It was a smaller venue, but he is still, Donald Trump, he went on several tangents, attacking Kamala Harris. Shermichael, did anything Trump say yesterday, calm those concerns among those within his own party who believes he needs to focus on the issues, not her?",

      "sentences": "I mean, there were some substantive aspects of it. He talked a little bit about her copying his policy positions that he announced a couple of weeks ago. He talked a little bit about inflation, about rising costs. He talked about immigration. He went back to his phrase of we're on the brink potentially the World War III if you elect to Kamala Harris, which will be a continuation of Joe Biden's failed foreign policies. That's how he phrased it.And so, I think you're going to get a little bit of both, right? You're going to get some policy and you're going to get some 2016 Trump. And I just want to remind the audience in 2016, Donald Trump ran against arguably one of the most qualified individuals to be president. Fast forward to 2020 and what really only change that dynamics, I believe was the fact that we were in the midst of a once in a lifetime international pandemic. And the fact that a significant amount of Americans voted by mail those two variables would not be in play this November. And so, while the race is still close, I think as long as the former president can talk about the tangible things while still being himself, people liked that about him. I think that this race can continue to be competitive.",

He's at every opportunity where President Biden to shift the economic trajectory of the country. Most Americans, despite the fact that inflation has improved do not feel it. Okay?Again, were in a once in a lifetime pandemic. The United States was not the only country that's all its economics changed. We weren't the only country that saw seismic jobs decrease. Everybody all over the world saw that. And I also want to say, everybody knows Donald Trump's temperament. They voted for him, overwhelmingly in 2016. He exceeded expectations in 2020, again, despite the fact that we're in the midst of a pandemic barely lost by 81,000 votes across four states. So this idea that Maria is articulating here, that he has somehow absorb of being able to be worthy of the presidency because of his past inclinations are because of the recent trials and verdicts against him, I am not convinced based on how close this race is that a plethora of people in the middle believe that because it is not just Republicans, Rahel, that are given Donald Trump this bump that he continues to have that, he's maintained for over a year now.",

Not necessarily the law plus four years, but the next four years, Maria, Biden was asked earlier today how he feels about Vice President Kamala Harris, perhaps distancing herself from his economic policies. And he said essentially, she won't.Do you believe that, one? And if she doesn't, is that a mistake?",

      "sentences": "So here's where I think we have to inject a little bit of reality because I know that -- and Shermichael just did it, right, trying to connect Kamala Harris with the economic policies of the last four years. And guess what? That's fine. Because the Biden administration's economic policies are actually incredibly popular, Rahel, this is what Republicans don't understand.This -- and this is what has been so frustrating to the Biden administration because the policies themselves, if you poll the policies themselves, in surveys, in polling, in focus groups they pull off the charts, $35 insulin caps, $2,000 prescription drug caps. They talked about it today at the event that she had with the president, continuing to expand access to health care, student loan forgiveness, job creation, the infrastructure bill or law that actually injected millions of dollars into so many districts and states that Republicans were tripping over themselves trying to take credit for a law that they even did not pass themselves or didn't approve of. And so, again Kamala Harris doesn't need to distance herself from Biden's economic policies. What she needs to do is exactly what she's doing right now to put her own signature on it for her to be able to talk about it, and to be able to talk about it in future terms of what it will do, continuing to expand the middle-class continuing to lower costs, which is the one thing that voters really feel in their pocket books. But the economic policies themselves, Rahel, people were not happy with Donald Trump, Joe Biden matchup, and that showed and that I think was what showed that the Biden economic policies he wasn't getting credit for it. Kamala Harris will get credit for it because she is new and fresh and energetic and young and now she can point to the old guy here, the past, say the past. What we don't want is Donald Trump.",
