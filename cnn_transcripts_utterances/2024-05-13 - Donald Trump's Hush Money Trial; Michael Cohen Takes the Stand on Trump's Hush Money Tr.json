If prosecutors really have buttoned up already, most of what you're going to hear from Cohen, either through documents or other witnesses up until about 2017. And that's when the direct examination is really going to be make or break for this case.Now, Cohen confirms he previewed some \"National Enquirer\" stories about Trump's political opponents. So there, David Pecker, Michael Cohen, trying to use this platform to damage his opponents. Among them, he says, were stories about Hillary Clinton wearing very thick glasses. Some allegations that she had some brain injuries. Now, David Pecker also testified that they would have run negative stories about the Clintons anyway, because they sold well. But Cohen confirms that AMI would sometimes send over covers to him before they were published. But getting through all of this, again, much of this has been supported, corroborated by other witnesses. What is not, though, is that direct link between Trump and falsifying business records.",

He didn't care what was inside the magazine. He cared just about the cover, the impact it had on -- right at the checkout counter.

And I think that could potentially, you know, obviously we have no idea how the jury will interpret any of this. Maybe they'll believe nothing Michael Cohen says, maybe they'll believe everything he says. But it is important that they are kind of establishing that this was Michael Cohen's role. That this is what he did for Donald Trump.And so, his testimony, you know, can speak to this. This is interesting, though. Michael Cohen has not yet looked at the jury. He's answering questions directly to the prosecutor. I'm not a prosecutor, but I think you would as a prosecutor want Michael Cohen to look at the jury to kind of establish this relationship with them. As Keith Davidson, when he -- Stormy Daniels' attorney who negotiated this deal with Michael Cohen, when he was testifying, his entire body was turned towards the jury, away from the prosecutors almost, as he was looking at them and directly answering their questions. It's notable that Michael Cohen is not doing that because he's probably the most important witness who needs to develop that trust and that relationship with the jury.",

So, at the very least that's one time that Trump makes the mistake of not speaking in code, not nodding his head, I don't like that guy, the way we see in \"Godfather\" movies.
