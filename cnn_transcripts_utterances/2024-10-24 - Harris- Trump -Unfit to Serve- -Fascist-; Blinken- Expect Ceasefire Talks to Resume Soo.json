I believe Donald Trump is a danger to the well-being and security of America. Our country deserves to have a president of the United States who is not afraid of good ideas and does not stand on pride. I'm never going to shy away from good ideas. And I'm not going to feel the need to have pride associate with a position that I've taken, when the important thing is to build consensus to fix problems. I believe in fixing problems. I love fixing problems. We cannot and I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. But we do need to take seriously the system that benefits the richest and does not help out working middle-class Americans. I come from the middle class and I believe that the middle class needs tax breaks to be able to actually not just get by but get ahead. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

To capitalize on for all parties and drive an end to the conflict in Gaza. It's clear that with this trip he's been in Israel now, he's in Qatar. He's trying to create momentum toward that end. What is a bit unclear right now is if there's actually any momentum that has been created by this trip. He has not been able to say exactly who is going to be the new leader of Hamas after Yahya Sinwar. The other countries who have been engaging with Hamas, including the Qataris, who said they have had conversations with Hamas leaders in recent days, they don't know who is going to be replacing Yahya Sinwar. And then on the other side you have the Israelis, who aren't expressing any immediate desire to bring an end to the conflict in Gaza. There was a glimmer of potentially some forward movement, on working toward this end when the secretary of state said today that negotiators, they're going to be meeting in the coming days to try and drive forth of course, the hostage release deal and a ceasefire deal in Gaza. Listen to what he said on that topic during his press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  First on negotiations, on negotiators, on the one, where, the who, can I provide more information? The answer is no but that will unfold in the coming days. All I can tell you is what I said earlier and what the prime minister noted is that we do anticipate that the negotiators will be getting together in the coming days. And again, what we really have to determine is whether Hamas is prepared to engage. And I believe that we'll be able to do that, starting in the coming days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're trying to look at a framework, a new potential series of frameworks, to develop somesort of concept that all parties could sign on to, to get this ceasefire and hostage release deal going again. But notably are two parts of this. First of all, he didn't say that Hamas negotiators have actually committed to meet with these negotiators who are meeting. So you can't really do much at the table unless Hamas is there. And second, when it comes to these new ideas that they are exploring for a framework to get to an end to the conflict, to release these hostages, it's very clear that they don't know what that new framework is going to look like. So it's going to take a while if you think about how this has happened over the last year or so for them to actually solidify a framework that parties can sign on to, before they can actually get to a yes here. So it appears there's quite a bit more progress to be made.

What Harris has is a massive political problem over the issue, however. We've talked in the past about how Arab American voters and progressives in this key swing state of Michigan, for example, may not show up to the polls because of this. But talking about a two-state solution and a moment of opportunity is fine but it doesn't really bear any relation to what's happening on the ground. If Harris wins the election, I think you might see some separation with Biden then. But if she loses and Trump is the next president, all the administration's leverage just disappears because all the parties, especially the Israelis in the conflict, will just wait until the Trump administration comes along in January.",

Politics is very tribal in the United States. I don't think you'd see an awful lot of people switching between those two candidates. But the question that an undecided voter has to ask -- and we saw this playing out in the town hall -- is whether, despite their reservations about Harris' capacity to improve their lives very quickly -- for example, bringing down the high cost of groceries, the prohibitive price of mortgages and rent. Do they go with her because they want to avoid everything that Trump brings with him, the extremism, the vengeance, the endless cacophony of Trump's style of politics? Or do they put all those worries aside and just cast a vote on the fact that they are hurting economically? People are very concerned about the immigration issue. And all polls show that those are two of the key issues in the election. And Trump is more trusted to deal with them than Kamala Harris. The international situation, the wars in Ukraine and Israel are also playing into this. So it's quite a difficult choice that a lot of these voters are having right now, although it seems difficult for perhaps outsiders to understand that anyone's not made up their mind about Trump after nine years that he's been on the national stage.",

But Harris is trying to broaden this into a question, not just of Donald Trump's threat to democracy but his personal instability, his extremism and his character. This is something that potentially could work in some of the key areas of the election; where she was in that town hall meeting last night was in a suburb of Philadelphia. She needs to get massive margins around Philadelphia, for example, to win that key state of Pennsylvania. A lot of the voters she needs are moderate Republicans who don't like Trump and are wondering when, who to cast their vote for. And women voters, these kind of character issues and the specter of Trump's return could actually be an actionable thing for her to get those voters to the polls. So although broadly democracy is not a huge concern of most voters, it could actually be something that's important in certain key areas, the areas that will decide the election.",

But no one heard. No one did anything to save them.\" Sama shared Mosab's love of language and, every time they spoke, she would tell him about all the new English words that she had memorized since their last conversation Mosab took this photo in June 2022 during Eid.

Donald Trump declined to say what he would dowith the minimum wage when he visited McDonalds on the weekend. Now Election Day in the U.S. is less than two weeks and, so far, nearly 25 million Americans have already voted, either in person or through mail-in ballots. That early voting number will keep rising as November 5 gets closer. For context, more than 150 million in total ballots were cast in the 2020 election. We have CNN senior politics writer Zachary Wolf, tracking the early voting trends from Washington and looking deep into the data, hopefully giving us some insights of where we are headed and what the data is telling us right now.

      "sentences": "Yes, let's look at the numbers. The first thing we need to know about early voting is that this is a verydifferent year, 2024, than four years ago in 2020. That was the pandemic year. A lot more Americans were voting by mail that year. So it's hard to compare the data from 2020 with the data from 2024. And that's why we see that early voting is down pretty much across the board. You see in Wisconsin, that's a key state. It's down 65 percent, it's down less than some of the other states like Georgia, where they had that record first day. Things have fallen a little bit but people are voting less early and by mail, more or less by mail. And I think there might actually be an uptick in early voting. But these numbers are put together. Now let's go a little bit deeper and see what we can figure out from the actual data that we get. There are some states out West in Nevada and Arizona, where we have some partisan preferences for the early votes so far. In both of those states, there have actually been more Republicans vote so far than Democrats -- than Democrats. And that turns on its head what was happening in 2020. Now again, the numbers are very different since the vote by mail element is different. Also Republicans have not been as opposed to early voting this time around, they're actively trying to get their people to vote early. And that carries over to Pennsylvania where Democrats still have an edge in the early vote. But it's certainly not as big as it was in 2020.",

But what we do know is we have some demographic data. We know that the number of white voters and Black voters is relatively the same. A few more white voters as a percentage of voting this year than there were four years ago. But the overall numbers again are down. So for instance, it was about 650 (ph) Black voters had cast ballots at this point in Georgia in 2020. That number is closer to 0.5 million today. So it's hard to compare the numbers. We'll just have to see what ends up happening. But certainly the number of white voters is up compared to compared to 2020.",
