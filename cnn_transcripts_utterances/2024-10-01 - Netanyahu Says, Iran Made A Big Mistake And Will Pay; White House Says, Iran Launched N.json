I'm on the grounds of an elementary school here in Central Israel, and you can see behind me the damage that was wrought as a missile struck this area right beside the school. Those are second and third grade classrooms that you can see there where the walls have been broken down, the windows shattered as well.The Israeli military says they cannot yet confirm whether this was indeed an Iranian missile, but we saw officials here putting together the pieces of the shrapnel to see if they can identify the specific type of missile that was used here. But it did indeed come as Iran fired 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. We saw video of the impacts happening, not only on areas, civilian areas like this, but also some of the air bases in Israel. The Nevatim air base, for example, CNN has geolocated several videos now showing multiple explosions, multiple impacts by those ballistic missiles at that air base. We've also seen impacts closer to Tel Aviv, near an intelligence base that the Israeli military has just north of that city. And so now, Wolf, this is certainly a very tense moment in the region, as the Israeli military vows that there will be consequences for this attack. When Israel carries out that retaliation is not clear yet, but, certainly, Wolf, this is the latest escalatory step in a region that is already very close to boiling over.",

Of course, the impact on civilians in Beirut and in Lebanon has been vast. As we've seen, about a million Lebanese civilians have been displaced. The Israeli military also appears to be expanding its ground operation in Southern Lebanon. Last night, we were very close to the border as we saw Israeli troops crossing into Southern Lebanon.

And along with those attacks and assassinations came the deaths of Iranian Revolutionary Guard members as well. So, they say that they're taking revenge for their own people as well. But interestingly, just before the attacks last week in New York, I spoke to the Iranian vice president who said that, you know, we have exercised a huge amount of restraint, that we believe we are being dragged into a war, that we are being entrapped into a war, and we do not want a war.

If you've been listening to this program, Naftali Bennett, former prime minister, had some pretty tough words for Wolf in what he says they should do in taking the opportunity to strike Iranian nuclear sites, and the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. agreed with him.CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, that was very concerning to hear that, Kasie. I think that the Israelis certainly have that as an option, but I think it would be unwise for them to go that far. A more realistic and sensible option in this particular case would be to do something more on the economic side or at a scaled down level on the military side. And this would be, you know, for example, attacking an airfield or several airfields in Iran or doing something like that. The best option, of course, is to do none of the above. But that is I think where the Israelis are going, they're going to try to do something that sends a message to Iran if cooler heads prevail. They're going to go into a mode where they go after, you know, perhaps a discrete set of targets to send a message that this is, to their mind, unacceptable behavior, and then go from there. But the Israelis do have the capability to conduct long distance aerial operations against Iran. Not necessarily completely on the nuclear side, going after a nuclear facility, but they certainly have the capability to attack, say, an airfield or a government installation if they chose to.",

And they need to say in this particular case, you know, yes, we understand you want to do these things. You are upset that this has happened and it's it was a very dangerous escalation.

It certainly will likely lead the questioning, but there are so many other issues on the economy, on immigration and just on the top of the ticket as well.

So, look for both of these running mates to try and defend and promote the candidacies for the people they are running with. But also it is the biggest moment and the biggest opportunity for both Vance and Walz to make their case as well. For Vance's side, he is trying to improve his likability. Of course, he's been criticized for some of his comments that some critics have viewed as a sexist. For Walz, he potentially has some exaggerations of his own record to clean up.

Does J.D. Vance come and really try to make an appeal to the middle, to the undecided, or is he coming to find new base voters? Does Walz take a different approach?
