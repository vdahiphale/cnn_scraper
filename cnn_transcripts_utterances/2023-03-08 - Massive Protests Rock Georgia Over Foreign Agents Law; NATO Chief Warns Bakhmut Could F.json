Anger building over a controversial draft law, which critics say is an attack on civil society. I'll be speaking to Georgia's president later this hour. Then, the NATO chief warns Bakhmut may fall to Russia in the coming days as a fierce battle around the Ukrainian town grinds on. Plus, Britain's prime minister vows to fight for its new immigration bill, which human rights groups say breaks international law, we'll have more on that coming up. But first, this hour anger, determination and fear for the future of the country, all really filling the streets of Georgia's capital, Tbilisi right now. Tens of thousands are rallying in front of parliament at this hour to protest a proposed law requiring foreign funded organizations to register as foreign agents. Now, Georgians fear it will push the country closer to Moscow where a similar law has been used to justify intense financial scrutiny of Vladimir Putin's critics. So what was supposed to be a Women's Day march earlier today turned into an anti-Russia rally, in an earnest amount for unity with Europe. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, much like Ukraine, the former Soviet state of Georgia has a long and troubled history with Russia including an invasion 15 years ago, and that is adding to the worries on the street. Our Matthew Chance has more on the turmoil that has erupted in Tbilisi. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Georgia, another former Soviet state, now plunging, it seems, into anarchy. Recent, days witnessing these pitched battles in the capital, Tbilisi. Between riot police using tear gas and water cannons and pro-western demonstrators, some clinging desperately to European flags. With war raging in nearby Ukraine, a Russian-style foreign agent law being debated here is unleashing this anti-Moscow outrage. The Russian version has been used to crack down on independent aid agencies and media in the country.",

Thanks very much, Matthew. Now to Ukraine because Russian fighters are still advancing in Bakhmut, but are taking heavy losses in the progress. That is according to Ukrainian military officials. They say defense forces are holding them off in several areas in and around the city. Earlier, the leader of the Wagner Mercenary Group filmed this video inside Bakhmut, saying his forces now control the eastern part of the city. He claims the Russian army is well prepared, full of modern weapons as well as Intelligence. And that they are waiting for their time to surge forward after Wagner forces paved the way for them in Bakhmut. But western officials say Wagner is quickly running out of prisoners to recruit and sent to the frontlines. And the U.S. top spy chief says a victory in Bakhmut does not signal larger Russian gains. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AVRIL HAINES, U.S. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains. But Putin most likely calculates that time works in his favor, and that prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia's strategic interest in Ukraine, even if it takes years.

Now, Washington McGee, she was unharmed, but Eric Williams received gunshots to his legs, according to his family. Now, it's unclear their current condition, the hospital is not releasing a statement. But according to Washington McGee's mother, she says that she is expecting her daughter to leave the hospital today. So we're hoping to get that news at some point today. Now, what we're learning more about today, Isa, is a better picture of what exactly happened to these Americans. According to Mexican officials, the Americans crossed into Mexico at about 9:18 a.m. on Friday, and then they got lost. Their cellphone didn't have a great service, they couldn't find the doctor's office where Washington McGee was supposed to get this medical treatment. And so, they were driving around. And the timestamp that we have for that dramatic video of these Americans getting dragged into the bed of a white pickup truck, is 11:45 a.m. So according to Mexican authorities, there is more than two hours that transpired between these Americans crossing into Matamoros, Mexico, and that dramatic video. Now, according to Mexican authorities, then they used surveillance video to follow that pickup truck at some point. But all of those traces went cold until Tuesday morning, that's when they say that they received a tip, they followed that tip that led them to the Americans. They say that the Americans were in this wooden house in the outskirts of Matamoros, Mexico, and that one individual was arrested. This individual is 24 years old. A resident of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Which is the same state where Matamoros is in. What's interesting here is that Mexican authorities are not releasing whether this individual is linked to criminal organizations. As you remember, a U.S. official with information about this investigation told CNN that these Americans were mistaken for Haitian drug smugglers. And so, there is still a lot of questions about all of that. And of course, the big question is they found the Americans, but they didn't find the kidnappers or the killings. I should add that both the Mexican authorities and U.S. authorities are conducting a criminal investigation. Isa?",

I feel that I'm not only answerable but I think that the only reason why I decided to run for the presidency, why I want to be the president of this country is to help to bring this country closer and eventually in the European Union. That is really a historic choice, one that maybe will not present itself again. We are in a very complex, to say the least, geographical position. But we have been given -- and that is very important -- the European perspective. And European perspective means that the objections that existed before, because of our geographical position, saying, well, we don't know whether that's really Europe, have been now put aside. So we have really a huge chance, together with our Ukrainian friends and our Moldovan friends, to join the European Union.

So Georgia is not the next. It's the ongoing, really, victim of Russia's aggression, of Russia's imperialism. And that might be another way, an indirect way, to try to put a foothold in Georgia. Georgia is extremely important, because we are the Black Sea. We are the next extension of the European Union in a place, the Transcaucasus, that is very important for the future balance in the world and around Europe. So clearly, Russia is not going to let go very easily. But Russia is losing its war in Ukraine. Russia is losing any kind of attraction that it might have had on anyone. All the neighbors of Russia know that Russia has been or is or will be trying to get territories of other countries. And that is something that should stop. Really, the fundamental point of the war in Ukraine and how it will end is -- will be to stop Russia from being that occupying power that it has been over the last century-and-a- half. That is our future. Russia has to understand that, if it wants to be considered as a normal partner of international relations, it has finally to understand that it has borders, like any other country and no rights to invade anybody else.",

Dozens of elite fighter pilots boycotted training exercises today, the latest display of opposition to judicial overhaul plans that critics say would kill democracy. Protesters have been taking to the streets for weeks, as we've been showing you on the show. And they're gearing up for what they call a national day of resistance. That is expected to happen on Thursday. Let's get more now from journalist Elliott Gotkine, who joins us now from Jerusalem. We've been showing our viewers these protests against the government's judicial reform for weeks now. Some have become, I think it's fair to say, quite violent. Is there a sense that this latest boycott by the Israeli Air Force pilots, who, of course, are a unifying force for the, country the first line of defense, that they can move the needle and halt these reforms from taking place?",

They're not only obliged by law to fly on missions so they're not saying they're not going to fly on these missions yet. So you can consider, this according to one fighter pilot, a kind of yellow card, as you would see in soccer, a yellow card to make sure to try and get this government to take note, to pay heed. Because if it doesn't, the consequences for the state of Israel and its ability to protect itself could be very serious indeed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOTKINE (voice-over):  They bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 and regularly hit Iranian targets in Syria. Even some of Israel's combat pilots are now firing warning shots, with reservists from one squadron skipping a training session, suggesting they may not heed the call of duty if the government rams through its judicial overhaul.
