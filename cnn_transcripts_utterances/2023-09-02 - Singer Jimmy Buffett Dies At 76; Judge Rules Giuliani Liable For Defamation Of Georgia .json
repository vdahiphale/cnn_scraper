Colonel Leighton, great to see you as always, thanks so much. So what do you think the real state of the counteroffensive is? You believe what President Zelenskyy is saying, that this counteroffensive is advancing to some extent. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Absolutely. So let's take a look at the map here, Jim. And one of the key things to look at is this southern area right here. This is where everything is really happening from a Ukrainian perspective. There is also some fighting going on right here in the east. So, if you go into the southern part of this, a few detailed areas here, this town of Tokmak is a huge Russian logistics area. What the Ukrainians want to do, they've already gained some territory right here, they want to move this way, and then down this way toward the Sea of Azov, cut the main highway. There is a highway that goes this way that is the main Russian supply area. And if they cut that, they will, in essence, cut this land bridge, the so-called land bridge between their occupied areas here in the east and Russian-occupied Crimea. If they do that, then what they've got is a path forward to actually cut them apart and make it possible for them to advance.",
