They were visiting family at a kibbutz close to Gaza when they were taken hostage by Hamas. The IDF said today believes that 210 People are being held hostage in Gaza. The group says the current priority is the return of all of the hostages. CNN's Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward is with us now. So let's start at this convoy of trucks coming in, 20 passing into Gaza. But officials in Gaza, and those who are watching from outside of the Strip, they say that it's just not enough.

      "sentences": "That's right. Essentially before this latest spasm of violence, so let's say three weeks ago, Victor, more than 450 trucks of aid according to the UN would go into the Gaza Strip every day. So now it's been two weeks of no aid, relentless bombardment, mass displacement, 20 trucks is obviously just a drop in the ocean. But officials are saying that they're hopeful that this is the start of something more sustained, more continuous.The UN believes and hopes that potentially tomorrow or on Monday that more of their trucks could go through. Today those 20 trucks were Egyptian Red Crescent trucks. They drove through the Rafah Border Crossing. They unloaded that aid which, as you say, was food, water and medicine. Palestinian trucks then loaded the aid and drove it through to the Gaza side. Now there's a meeting today of Arab leaders here in Cairo. It's called a Conference of Peace. President Sisi, the Egyptian president spoke in the last hour or so. He said, this is a welcome sign but it's not enough. We need to build on this and establish a sustained humanitarian corridor. We need a humanitarian ceasefire as well. And beyond that, we need to work on establishing some kind of a peace process, a two-state solution, so quite a long list of things that need to happen. Right now there seems to be consensus, at least on that first step of trying to establish a more continuous or sustained humanitarian corridor, but there are conditionalities on all sides. And that is what is making it difficult. As you mentioned, the Israelis have been reluctant to allow fuel in. Fuel is needed to power generators. Generators are needed to keep the hospitals going. The hospitals at this stage are barely functioning. The fuel supplies according to one UN person who I was speaking to will be out or depleted in two or three days. So that is a vital resource that is desperately needed and negotiations ongoing to try to get at least 100 trucks in every single day, in what would be the beginning of a continuous corridor. And hopefully eventually also, the establishment as the Israelis had previously mentioned, and also President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have some kind of humanitarian zone, where some of the 900,000 displaced people inside Gaza could find some refuge and some respite. We are still though a long way from that.",

They want to get out. At this stage it's not clear when they will get out. But again, the hope is that within the next couple of days, there would be an opportunity to get those foreign nationals out. That, of course, does not do anything to help the more than 2 million people who are still in Gaza and cannot get out. Not on the Israeli side and not on the Egyptian side.",

They were visiting their family in Southern Israel when this horrific, horrendous surprise assault by Hamas took place. They were released on humanitarian grounds, we understand.Now, Qatar was the country that was primary in this release, in negotiating. This release Qatar being a major backer of Hamas and able to speak to that group on the ground, but there was a lot of wrangling, diplomatic wrangling that happens in order to get hostages out. And President Biden has said that this is absolutely a priority for the US administration. He says he's been working around the clock to get more hostages out. But when you look at that situation on the ground, that must be absolutely horrifying for families who believe their loved ones are trapped inside Gaza, a place that is being bombed in besieged, hundreds of airstrikes falling there a day. I think there is a signal, a sign in this of hope. But again, it is that fear from Israeli officials that some of these hostages could be used as human shields that continues to worry families, and there is no letting up. There is no slowing down of Israel's military offensive that puts potentially many of these hostages in the crossfire. Qatar says it's going to continue negotiations with Hamas. Egypt is involved as well in an attempt to try to get more hostages out. Hamas also released a statement saying that this is a sign of their goodwill, essentially a sign of showing that US-Israel are liars and that they're willing to let people out, especially because this is on humanitarian grounds. But again, serious concerns, serious worries, we're talking about potentially 200 hostages trapped in a warzone.",

This is -- we have no option, my wife and I, but to be strong. I think we would be in a different situation if we didn't have a one-year-old son with us. Basically have had to run for our lives. We -- being in northern Gaza with my wife's family at the beginning of the war, and then when the IDF announcement came in to basically asking everyone in northern Gaza to leave south for their safety and to save their lives. We did -- we actually started diving down with no place to go down south. It's like asking someone to pick up from Massachusetts and go to Ohio in 24 hours, and just plan to be there indefinitely. So we're staying at a friend of a friend's house, someone that we've never met in our life, who happened to have their home close to the borders. We thought that strategic that we could stay close to the border because we have faith that the State Department would work on extracting us or getting us out of Gaza through some type of an arrangement. We've been here for a week. We're staying in a normal single family home, two floors with about 40 people sharing everything we can share, from food to drinking water supplies. Because basically about a 1.1 million people were asked to leave northern Gaza and heads out, many of whom are in a similar situation like us, and including American, hundreds of American families that have made at the crossing that basically even some cases switch locations every night because they don't have a place to stay at.",

We left northern Gaza where bombing was a lot more intense than southern Gaza. We thought, relatively speaking. And we came to what was supposed to be a safe zone in southern Gaza Strip, Rafah. We're about 10 minutes away from the borders. And as I mentioned, the day before yesterday, there was a bombing, an airstrike about 100 meters away from the house. There's constant shelling, constant airstrikes in the area where we are. So we pretty much are cooped up indoors all day. No power. Power, we rely on solar panels that last (inaudible) that we try to charge our phones so that we stay in touch with the outside world. And there's no internet, the entire internet network has been taken down. So we try to rely on cell phone signal. We're fortunate that we have our US number roaming with us that we could pick up different cell phone providers that allow me to speak to you right now. But others are living completely in the dark. My wife and I tried to calm each other down every night. (Inaudible) sleepless nights since day one of the war. I think my wife's biggest pain as well is we try to avoid seeing footage on the TV. We actually try to avoid watching news because when you see that man of civilians and innocent people, and life lost, and you see children among them, our biggest nightmare is that our son Yousef would be potentially one of those children one day. And that's something that we can think of. We took us three years to have Yousef. We've been married for several years and had tried to make a baby and things didn't work out. And we had to go through artificial insemination and IVF basically, and three years of trying during COVID with many canceled cycles. For anyone who's been -- who's had to go through it, they can relate the emotional trauma that comes with it, and only to be in a situation where we're not even considering fear for our lives. We're mostly concerned about -- fear for our son's life. So all -- dealing with all of this while not getting enough support from our US government is just unthinkable right now. It's the last thing that we thought (inaudible) the US government (inaudible) we thought we had no issues from day one that we were fortunate enough to exit, but that's not how things are translating on the ground. We keep getting promised that we'll cross over to Egypt and that's not happening. And I don't know why we're stuck in this situation. We mourn every civilian and innocent life death on all sides, no matter what belief or religion, or faith they have, or even no faith at all. That's our moral values. That's how we've grown up as Palestinians. That's why I'm proud to be an American because that's what we live by. Yet, we feel like we're -- our lives has little to no value.

General, good to see you.So, I obviously prepared a list of questions to ask you but you've been listening to that conversation. What's your reaction to what you just heard? JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, FORMER US ARMY: Clearly, what was described as the human face of combat, human face war. It's timeless. It's been like this forever. Innocent folks get wrapped into it. And his predicament is clearly one that will not be resolved quickly if the gates are open, and he can get his family through God bless him. And we certainly would pray for that. I look at this and I go, you know, the circumstance is horrible, it's tragic. All you need to do is go back to the Hamas leadership and say, okay, guys, you brought this upon yourself when you murdered 1,200 Israelis directly across the gates of Gaza. And this is where we are right now. So clearly, the timing is horrible for that great young American family visiting other family in Gaza. So we need to pray and we need to work as hard as we can to ensure their release. But there will be, I would suspect, Victor, there will be a ground assault., It will occur, I would imagine, within the next day or so, who knows what the timing looks like. The IDF is building up its forces. It will probably be a ground assault that probably has multiple avenues of approach that all link up at the same location. In other words, you want to secure the perimeter of where you want to fight. And then after you do that, and that's very swift, you then begin the reduction. Really there are three, I would say three targets. First, it's the political and military leadership of Hamas. The IDF knows who those folks are. If they have phones, they know where they're located. At least they know where the phones are located. And they're going to do their best to find those guys. I don't know if that's a capture or kill type mission. Probably it's a kill mission. The second thing is, they need to be able to go after the, what I would call the command and control structure. That tunnel complex that allows Hamas to work with impunity and to maneuver, and to keep hostages in multiple locations and never the same location. And for them to conduct the necessary steps of command and control that they've had in place. And this is a tunnel complex that is immense, as we all understand, that is problem. That's the biggest problem that the IDF has to confront, because that's the one that's going to cause the most destruction. And then the third thing is, they need to go after the kit -- the stuff, the mechanisms of war, the ammunition, the vehicles, the communications network, the cyber capability. So those are the three targets and that is an immensely difficult task, because this is urban warfare, which is the most difficult warfare of all. And in our past, we know how hard that is. Comparisons have been made to Fallujah. This is going to be orders of magnitude more difficult, and bloody than Fallujah in Iraq in the early portions of the war, 2004-2005.",

And I guarantee you those nations are now communicating with Israel and say, look, let's give a piece of chance here. We got two Americans out. Let's see if we can get some other folks out, which the clear intent there by Hamas is to pause, put a lid on at least the timing for the ground assault, maybe letting diplomacy come up with some type of a solution before the ground assault.I'm not optimistic that that's the outcome, but at least you could pause it.
