Unless all the polls are wrong, Donald Trump will score a big victory over Nikki Haley and move one step closer to securing the GOP nomination. This despite facing for criminal indictments and personal financial peril. On Friday, a New York state judge finalized a $355 million judgment against Trump and triggered a countdown for when Trump must put up cash or post bond to cover that amount, plus the roughly 100 million in interest that he was ordered to pay. That's a huge sum no matter what Trump's net worth might be, and it doesn't include the combined 88 million that he owes e Jean Carroll after twice losing civil trials to her. You would think the combination of potential jail and financial collapse for the Republican candidate would build confidence among his Democratic detractors and independent never Trumpers. And instead the opposite is true. The political question on the minds of many is about his opponent, President Joe Biden. Is Biden the only Democrat who can beat Trump? Or is Biden the only Democrat Trump can beat? One thing is for sure, there's no way Biden's minimalist mode of campaigning that which might have been appropriate amidst a pandemic in 2020 is going to escape scrutiny in 2024. An incumbent trailing in the national and battleground polls with an approval rating that on Friday, Gallup reported is only 38 percent needs to pursue every opportunity to turn the tide. Instead, this president turned down television time in an election year preceding the Super Bowl the most watched event ever. And many noticed, among them Democratic strategist James Carville, who told me here that it was a sign. And Carville has company, veteran political analyst Jeff Greenfield recently advised in Politico that, quote, \"Biden will have to take the path he has avoided so far and engage with voters and with the press fully embracing the risks of further slips.\" \"The New York Times\" recently ran an editorial saying Biden must do better adding, quote, \"He has had less substantive, unscripted interaction with the public and the press than any other president in recent memory. In fact, since becoming president, Biden has done just 86 interviews. At this point in his predecessors presidencies, Trump had given 300, Barack Obama 422. Although he'll deliver the State of the Union address on March 7, that's going to be with the teleprompter. Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson, who chaired the select committee on January 6, quoted in roll call as saying \"those of us who helped Joe Biden get elected president are not real comfortable at this point with what we're seeing.\" Democratic former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, quote, \"We all have concerns. We want to make sure it's a victorious campaign.\" As recline, New York Times columnist, political analyst recently asserted this on his podcast. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) EZRA KLEIN, OPINION COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": I think Biden, as painful as this is, should find his way to stepping down as a hero, that the party should help him find his way to that, to being the thing that he said he would be in 2020, the bridge to the next generation of Democrats. And then I think Democrats should meet in August at the convention to do what political parties have done a convention so many times before, organize victory. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

Just last month, U.S. Border Patrol reported more than 100,000 encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border. In December, encounters had surpassed 300,000 people.Former President Trump has been vocal on the campaign trail calling for a more aggressive approach to stopping illegal border crossings. \"The Washington Post\" reports that Trump and his allies are planning militarized mass deportations and detention camps. By the way, this article alone drove over 13,000 passionate comments as of the time I was reading it. I pulled my own audience at Smerconish.com. Over 26,000 of you responded, 58 percent agreeing there should be mass deportations. According to a CNN poll, 81 percent of Republicans, 46 percent of independents would be in support of Trump deporting and detaining millions of undocumented immigrants. But as U.S. citizens are becoming more frustrated with the immigration system, the White House is now considering taking executive action. President Biden's plan would restrict migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border illegally. This would conflict with previous policies, allowing anyone who enters the U.S. to ask for safe haven. But Biden is not the first president to attempt this strategy. In 2018, federal courts blocked similar efforts proposed by President Trump to block rising migration to the U.S. This national frustration hit a tipping point earlier this month when the House voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. House Republicans claim Mayorkas ignored immigration laws and has contributed to the worsening crisis at the southern border. Only three Republican lawmakers voted against impeaching Mayorkas. Representatives, Ken Buck, Mike Gallagher, and Tom McClintock questioned whether these criticisms justified an impeachment. Joining me now to further discuss his decision is Congressman Ken Buck. Congressman, thank you for being here. Trump is talking about mass deportation. Biden seems poised to limit asylum by executive order, which is the better necessary approach? REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): Michael, all of the above. Frankly, we've -- we've -- we have 1.3 to 1.5 million people in this country who have already been adjudicated, that they are here illegally. And ICE is not looking for them, and ICE has been ordered not to look for them. And they need to be deported. So that is a mass deportation. I'm not suggesting 12 million people right now, but there are 1.3 to 1.5 million who should be deported. In addition to that, we need to stop the crisis that is occurring in our border and stop people from coming across the border illegally, coming into this country claiming that they deserve asylum when in fact they're coming here for economic reasons. They can't point to a specific harm that they're leaving their country for. So, the Biden plan was the old Trump plan.

And many say they would.I'm going to put on the screen in an essay that was published at \"Slate\" this week from Ben Mathis-Lilley. And he says, \"On the other hand, what if these voters are full of it -- meaning they're lying. For years, the people of the United States have often told pollsters that they think Donald Trump has done terrible things, only to end up voting for him. So, my question to you, because you know so well, the MAGA base. Would members of that base a significant number necessarily ditch Trump because of these legal issues, if they resulted in conviction?

We've seen this after every -- every time the charges get filed, the former president's popularity goes up, especially amongst the base, especially amongst people who feel that he is, that this law affair is unjustly targeting him. So, I think that those polling -- that polling is a little bit off. I don't think that -- look, some people may bail but I don't think those are true Trump voters to begin with.
