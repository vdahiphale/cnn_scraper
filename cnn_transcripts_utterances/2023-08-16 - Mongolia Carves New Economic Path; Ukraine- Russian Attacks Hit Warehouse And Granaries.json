We'll talk about all of that 3:00 AM here, 3:00 PM in New York, the previous day. The markets have still got some time to trade, the last hour of trading. This is the way things are looking on Wall Street at the moment, betwixt and between, as I always say, when we see these sorts of session, really not a huge amount is actually moving, so we will move to our agenda of the day. The EV revolution. Global copper demand is climbing, and so naturally, I visit one of the world's largest copper mines. Mongolia's ambitious expansion plans. It's a mile underground. Another big short: The investor who called the 2008 housing crash is now betting against the US markets, a $1.6 billion bet. We'll talk about it. And the best way to see Mongolia, well, it is on horseback. We get a taste of the culture, and I do stay on the horse, I promise you. Live from Ulaanbaatar, it is Wednesday, it is August 16th.

It is then used for wiring and automobiles, and demand is exploding as EVs take off. EVs use twice, as you can see, there is a regular car, there is a hybrid, and there's an electric -- as twice as much copper and EVs are a growing part of the market more than 10 million sold last year.
