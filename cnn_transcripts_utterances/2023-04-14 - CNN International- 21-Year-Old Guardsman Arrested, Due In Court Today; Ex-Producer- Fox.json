Last week, it was the French President. The month -- last month, it was Spain's Prime Minister, now Brazilian President Lula, who as we can see is there with Xi Jinping outside the Great Hall of the People to inspect the troops. This is a pomp and ceremony at its very best, Beijing style. This is obviously a critical relationship for Brazil. China is its largest trading partner. But, the relationship is, as you say Max, been a little frosty the past four years under the leadership of former Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro who was firmly aligned with former U.S. President Donald Trump.So, this three-day visit is definitely a reset, and from what we can see, warm relations are in the making. China's economic might (ph) is the world's second largest economy is of great importance to Brazil, but so too is Beijing's push to end the dominance of the U.S. dollar for international trade. President Lula is definitely behind China on this. And during his visit yesterday to the New Development Bank in Shanghai, which is also known as the BRICS Bank. Lula called on developing countries to work towards replacing the greenback. Take a listen. OK, no sweat there. But, he went on to say, why should we have to do business through the U.S. dollar? Earlier this year, the two countries announced a deal to trade in their own currencies, ditching the dollar as an intermediary. And just this month, Brazil's Central Bank announced that the yuan had overtaken the euro as the country's second largest international reserve currency. That is very significant. Now, for Lula, who took office in January, this is in fact his third state visit to China. During his first presidency back in the early 2000s, Lula was particularly close to former Chinese President Hu Jintao, and during that partnership, China overtook the U.S. as Brazil's top trading partner, and still remains that to this day, China importing Brazilian soybeans, iron ore and oil. Now, one more than 20 business deals are expected to be signed on this trip. The issue of Ukraine is not on the official agenda. Lula is calling for a peace club of non-aligned countries to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. As we know, China has proposed its own peace deal.

That is what North Korea has claimed that they have done on Thursday here, releasing pictures of that this morning, this Friday. But, the key part is the fuel itself, the fact that it is solid fuel means that it's much easier to handle. It's quick to launch, and of course, that means it's much harder to detect, and if need be, to intercept.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANKIT PANDA, STANTON SR. FELLOW, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTL. PEACE: Solid fuel ICBMs compared to their liquid propellant counterparts are, generally speaking, much more responsive in a crisis. That means that they can be used much quicker.

What we've heard from the South Korean side there, the defense ministry saying that it may well have been a solid fuel technology used, but they do believe that it will take more time and more effort from North Korea to be able to perfect this development. Now, of course, time and effort is the one thing that Kim Jong-un has. And so, certainly, there was an expectation that he will continue to hone in on these particular weapons capabilities.It comes at an interesting time as well. It comes while there is absolutely no communication between North and South Korea. There is no dialogue at the moment. But, they do have hotlines where there is a phone call in the morning and in the afternoon, and that is basically to try and lower tensions if need be, make sure there is no miscalculation. But, for the past week, South Korea has been using that hotline and Pyongyang simply hasn't been picking up the phone. They have done this in the past, usually to show their irritation or displeasure at joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea, or something else they don't agree with.
