      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\" great to have you with us and TGIF still lots to get to before we close outthe week after 13 rises in a row. The DOW breaks its winning streak Intel shows big tech earnings remain chipper and cheap (ph). And in a surprise move the Bank of Japan makes an important policy tweak, call it a BOJ. And -- for me, the Central Bank headed by its brand new chairman has made an unexpected adjustment to its ultra-loose monetary policy officials leaving rates unchanged at rock bottom levels but allowing bond yields to fluctuate within a wider band. You can read this as perhaps opening the door to higher yields and therefore a tightening of policy. Now it's all minor moves for now. But it's also being seen as a potential prelude to at some point a move higher in base rates and that was enough to cause a rally in the Japanese Yen and see pressure on Japanese stocks the NIKKEI off by almost half a percent in the session Friday. Turning to China now too and a strong finish as you can see there Bloomberg reporting Beijing is looking for ways to boost stock performance and at the same time boost investor confidence. It certainly worked today. Turning now to U.S. investor confidence Wall Street looking to end the week higher as you can see there with good earnings from chip giant Intel, as I mentioned, helping propel NASDAQ futures forward Intel back in the black and returning, returning to profitability after two straight quarterly losses. And speaking of losses, the DOW sunk Thursday ending its longest winning streak in more than 30 years. So close yet so far, we've gone from recession risk to no recession to perhaps the risk of a reacceleration in growth and perhaps therefore, more work for the Federal Reserve to do and I think that kicked in for investor sentiment yesterday. Inflation trends however, still heading in the right direction, one of the Fed's preferred measures of inflation, the core PCE rate as it's known easing to 4.1 percent year-over-year that of course, is still firmly above their inflationary targets, but it is a touch weaker than expected and almost the lowest rate in two years. We'll talk about that later. But for now, we do begin in Ukraine where the Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to be escalating. New video appears to show troops recapturing another village in the southeast you can see on this map and this footage also showing a Ukrainian military vehicle reaching Russia's critical defensive line known as \"Dragon's Teeth\". Salma Abdelaziz joins us now. Salma it does follow just a day after a CNN got official word from U.S. officials confirming that they were committing more troops to the south. Tie that in with what we appear to be seeing now and hearing from the Ukrainians themselves.",

Now, further intelligence report reveals how China has become a key ally of Russia. The report compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, stated that China \"Has become an increasingly important buttress for Russia in its war effort\". The report reveals how Chinese state owned defense companies have provided Russia with various war technologies, despite Western sanctions. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon for us. Natasha, can you give us any sense of what technologies and what equipment we're talking about here?",

      "sentences": "Yes Julia, a really significant report here from the Director of National Intelligence, and itis unclassified. But it really provides a window into what the U.S. believes that China is doing. Now, according to this report, China, as of March had provided the Russians with over $12 million worth of drones and drone equipment, they have also provided according to the intelligence assessment Chinese state owned, defense companies have provided Russian defense companies with a lot of dual use technology, and that includes navigation equipment, jamming technology, as well as fighter jet parts. So obviously, things that Russia could really use in its war in Ukraine, especially as sanctions have really dug into Moscow's ability to produce its own equipment for the war. So China really ramping up here, its support in terms of non-lethal equipment to the Russians. The U.S. has not necessarily seen at this point that they are providing weaponry to the Russians. But this kind of technology, as you said, has led to this assessment by the Director of National Intelligence that China \"Has become an increasingly important buttress to Russia's war efforts\". Now, the amount of semiconductors that China is also providing to Russia things like chips that can be used in Russian defense technology that has also soared since 2021 the rates in which the Chinese companies are shipping these to the Russians. The report also says that the U.S. believes that China is helping Russia to evade many of the Western sanctions that have been imposed since the war in Ukraine began. And they cannot tell just how much the Chinese are trying to interfere in the U.S.'s ability to monitor those export control measures that they have placed on the Russians. But they do believe that these Chinese companies are helping the Russians to evade the sanctions that were very purposefully imposed, to try to diminish Russia's war chest. So a really significant report here that seems to belie China's repeated denials that it is providing any kind of support for Russia's war in Ukraine. However, we did receive a statement from the Chinese Embassy in Washington D.C., denying many parts of this intelligence report but notably, denying something that the report also did not necessarily accuse them of which is selling weapons to the Russians. Their response says \"China does not sell weapons to parties involved in the Ukraine crisis and prudently handles the export of dual use items in accordance with laws and regulations\". It continues to say China, Russia, economic and trade cooperation is completely aboveboard. It does not target any third party and shall be free from disruption or coercion by any third party. So the Chinese, not necessarily giving a full throated denial of this, but obviously, this is something that is going to continue to be a major irritant in the U.S. China relationship, Julia.",

The military arsenal included two models of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

In addition, according to state media, two types of drones flew overhead one described as a strategic reconnaissance drone, the other as a multipurpose attack drone. This parade comes as North Korea has hosted delegates from both China and Russia and on the topic of Russia; Russian President Vladimir Putin presented a speech to North Korean officials. According to state media, he acknowledged North Korea's firm support for Russia's war in Ukraine, suggesting it emboldened the two countries determination to deal with the West. As we've reported in the past, U.S. officials have claimed North Korea has given Russia rockets and artillery. Tension in the region has been high in recent days as an American submarine with nuclear capability has been in the waters of South Korea and North Korea test fired its Wasson 18 ICBM for the third time this year.

Even the senior U.S. officials, including Antony Blinken, have said that they've spoken to him and they demand that he returned back to power.

Prosecutors subpoenaed for that footage after the government had already been at Mar-a-Lago. They had subpoenaed, saying please return any documents with classified markings. When they went there to pick them up they noticed that there were these surveillance cameras outside of the storage room that had been searched. So they subpoenaed for that surveillance footage. Then they learned throughout the course of their investigation that there had allegedly been this effort by Trump aides including this new defendant, Carlos de Oliveira to try to delete some of the security footage. It sort of runs through in great detail in this indictment conversations de Oliveira is having with other Trump employees, and at one point, he says the boss wants the server deleted. And he asks what are we going to do? Obviously, the boss here is likely referring to Former President Donald Trump. So this is a new element in this indictment.

CNN is unable to verify the report but drone use is already changing the face of warfare. And our next guest runs a defense startup that's helping Ukrainian forces fight the war. Fortem Technologies is a provider of both software and hardware including an unmanned system called the DroneHunter F-700. As you can see, this device has the ability to capture other drones in flight by firing a net attached to a parachute. Fortem is a private firm backed by Boeing Toshiba and Lockheed Martin ventures among others. And Jon Gruen is the Chairman and CEO. And he joins us now, Jon, fantastic to have you with us. Just give us a flavor of what Fortem technologies actually has and compromises off. And then we'll talk about specific tech. JON GRUEN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO OF FORTEM TECHNOLOGIES: Absolutely great to be with you today. So Fortem was founded in 2016. It was based on a radar technology that had been worked for many decades, but as technological advances were being made on it to make it smaller, more high power and higher fidelity. We were able to spin it out into very small form factor radar, which then put on drones, to see if it could act as its own seeker in the sky. And that started off Fortem on a path to do what is the F-700 today, but really it is become a family of sensors and effectors that are applicable to the counter UAS market right now.",

So you have the seeker in theradar on the drone, plus all the artificial intelligence. So it's able to go and seek out these adversarial drones in the sky, and then go mitigate them. So we do that currently with the net to be low collateral effect. So you're not creating debris, you're not creating a falling drone out of the sky. And so it's a much safer way to interdict these threats.",

So originally, we were deployed to get reconnaissance type drones. And that quickly changed to us needing to get to some of the larger drones that were doing kamikaze style missions. And those were the Shahed 131 to 136 is. So that was our initial advancement was being able to get those larger, faster drones. And then that has quickly morphed into what is not quite on the battlefield in a meaningful way yet, but swarms. And so from our point of view, it really comes down to the type of effector we have under the drone. So we are able to go and put a number of different types, which may or are not going to be nets completely in the future. So the drone itself is becoming learning and becoming better able to read the threat coming at it, whether that's large and fast, or whether that swarm. And so that artificial intelligence keeps building and learning. And now it's a matter of just having the right effector for the type of threat coming at it.",

And it's happening far more quickly than we saw see between land foot soldier war in the First World War in a mechanized vehicle, mechanical war in the in the Second World War. I mean, you're already as a tech company, and a private tech company adapting to that.

So we tend to work with that host country, and that partner to modify the system and little ways to make it applicable to their environments. And so it really is a joint effort at that point.
