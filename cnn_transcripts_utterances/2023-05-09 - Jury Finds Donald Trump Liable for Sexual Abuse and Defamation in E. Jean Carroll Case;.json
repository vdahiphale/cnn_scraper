      "sentences": "Hey, Dana, great to see you. Thanks so much.Good evening, everyone, I'm Alisyn Camerota. Welcome to CNN Tonight on a busy and unprecedented news night. A jury in New York found former President Donald Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation in that E. Jean Carroll case. Carroll allege that in the spring of 1996, Donald Trump raped her in a department store dressing room, then defamed her when he denied her claim and said she was, quote, not his type. In just a moment, I will talk to Natasha Stoynoff, who testified during this trial that she too was assaulted by Trump. And our panel will give us their take on what all of this means. Plus, truth-challenged Congressman George Santos has just been charged by the Justice Department in a federal probe and could appear in court tomorrow. What does this mean for his future in Congress and what will Republicans do now? And Tucker Carlson is waging war against Fox for firing him. He's promising to re-launch his show, but in a place his audience may not expect. Our panel shares their strong thoughts. But let's start with the verdict in the case against Donald Trump. After deliberating for 2.5 hours, the jury found former President Trump liable of sexual abuse and defamation, and awarded E. Jean Carroll $5 million. After the verdict, Carroll released a statement, saying, quote, I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name and to get my life back. Today, the world finally knows the truth. The victory is not just for, me but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed, end quote. Donald Trump says he will file an appeal. So, let's get to our panel. We have our legal experts Joey Jackson and Elie Honig here and CNN's Correspondent Kara Scannell, who has been covering this case. Kara, I start with you because you were in the courthouse and watched this all unfold. What was this like that moment when the verdict was read?",

Jean Carroll? That was a no. Then the next question, does jury find that he sexually abused her, that was a yes. And then from then on, it was all yeses for Carroll. And she was sitting there holding the hand of one of her attorneys as this was being read. You know, she appeared to look very relieved, you know, a smile, they looked at each other a few times smiling as they went through. And the jury ultimately awarded her $5 million. And what I thought was so interesting after the verdict was read and the jury was excused, Trump's attorney, Joe Tacopina, walked over and shook her hand. Given the external kind of fight, this whole case about the defamation claim between Trump and Carroll, her lawyer went over and did that and shook her attorney's hands. We do have a reaction from Trump tonight. He was on his platform, Truth Social. And we should take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  What else can you expect from a Trump-hating, Clinton-appointed judge, who went out of his way to make sure that the result of this trial was as negative as it could possibly be, speaking to and in control of a jury from an anti-Trump area, which is probably the worst place in the United States for me to get a fair trial. We will be appealing this decision. It's a disgrace. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And how many would have believed it was I think they said almost 6 million.And then you get to the issue of what it would cost to repair the reputation, and there was testimony as to almost 3 million. And so this is not an exact science. And, of course, as we noted, it was not about the money to her attorneys. They said that in as much as their closing argument.

It was in that context that the judge decided in this case to make the jury anonymous because of all the attacks that Trump is making.

If it was, we'd have a lot of people locked up.I think it's going to be both of two things. One, if you lie in your election paperwork to the FEC, the Federal Election Commission, that is a lie, and we all remember the story we had all of these different expenditures that were exactly $199.99, I doubt that that actually is the amount. The reason he cut it off there is because if it's $200 or more, then you have to give detailed reporting. So, that could be the basis for one set of charges.

If he resigns, he is giving that up and he does not have that option as part of the prosecution. So, I do not think that he is likely to go willingly.

And Dominion doesn't get any real financial gain from them firing Tucker Carlson.So, I think, first thing I would say is just because Tucker Carlson has accused Fox of doing certain things in a letter doesn't mean that he's done all of them. Now, obviously a lot of people have been speculating about various materials that have gotten into the media since Tucker Carlson's firing including that text message in which he is commenting on this riot and saying, well, this is not how white people fight and that Fox's concern was that people were going to find out that Tucker Carlson was racist and that was why they fired him. So, the idea that Fox was behind those leaks, I do not find that idea crazy given some of the ways that Fox has dealt with departing talent in the past. But, I mean, I think this is all an effort to get out of his Fox contract and that's been clear in the news coverage that Tucker wants to be out there in the arena. He's not allowed to go and do another show unless Fox lets him out of his contract and so far, Fox has been continuing to pay him. They can keep him under contract until after the next election.",

Certainly he's probably going to deal with the fact that to your point a large portion of that 3.6 million that we're tuning in don't have the two factor authentication, don't actually know where they can even download Twitter from, right? But there also is a potential for new audiences, right? I'd make the comparison to somebody who says they are a member or supporter of Planned Parenthood versus somebody who says they are a member or supporter of the NRA even though have necessarily given any money in 10 or 20 years, right? It's that type of synthetic organization of people who support someone and many of them had been getting his information in the digital landscape anyway, whether it was via Facebook, whether it was via Twitter.

I mean, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy has said that we'd still welcome a show with Carlson. And so, I think maybe he'll try out the Twitter thing.

They were underappreciated, they were underpaid, but they certainly were getting people to watch.And my concern is that even if we look at something, you know, as dissimilar but also similar as the NFL, where we've had the Rooney Rule in place, where we're forcing NFL franchises to interview black coaches for senior football positions, the results nearly a decade later, they speak for themselves, it is not working. And so for me, I get tired of people of color, black people, Hispanic people, begging others to do what we have the power to do for ourselves. And when I look at something as recent as Tower Heist which was supposed to be in the words of Eddie Murphy, a black Oceans Eleven and yet again we didn't have the wherewithal to come together or the resources put aside to be able to make something like that come to fruition. So, to me, to heck with the Oscars. Who cares about your cheap trophy, anyway. I think again we have to find better ways to come together as a community of creatives, to make sure that we are represented behind the camera, but also to make sure that we are doing our part to make sure that Tyler Perry is not the only person with a studio, to ensure that we can actually bring those great stories, the first black emperor of Rome, right?
