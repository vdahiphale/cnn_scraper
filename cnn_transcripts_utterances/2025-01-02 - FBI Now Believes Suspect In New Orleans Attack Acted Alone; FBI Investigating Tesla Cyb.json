Obviously, there has been some discussion about the attack that we saw inLas Vegas outside that Trump hotel and whether or not the two were linked, given various similarities. The FBI now saying that the suspect here acted alone. And he also gave a timeline in terms of what happened. He said the suspect rented an F-150 on December 30th and drove from Houston to New Orleans on December 31st on New Year's Eve. That's about a six-hour drive or so. And during that trip, he posted videos online, essentially claiming support for ISIS, saying that he wanted to kill his family, but he was worried that it wouldn't get enough attention in the media, and so opted for this route instead. And he did leave a will and testament. I want to bring in CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller. So, John, whew, we got a lot of information from that press conference. Just the fact that this suspect did act alone. Just give us your take on that, because obviously there was so much debate as to whether or not the fact that the attack that we saw outside that hotel in Las Vegas, just given the similarities, the fact that they both rented vehicles from the Turo app. They were both members of the military. A lot of people were saying that, look, that can't be pure coincidence. It turns out that it actually might have been. JOHN MILLER, CNN'S CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, yes. So, as you stated, we learned a lot in the press conference. We learned that the flash examination and they will go over it and they will do a more slow and meticulous examination, but the quick examination of the three phones and the laptops don't show any communication between him or anyone else but also don't show any communication between the New Orleans suspect and the Las Vegas suspect, so it tends to -- it tends to isolate that picture that the New Orleans suspect is acting on his own, the Las Vegas suspect is acting on their own. The question that will linger now is if they are not connected to each other, are they connected to the same propaganda or the same ISIS channels or the same ISIS communications? Right now, the FBI's position on Jabbar, the New Orleans suspect, is he was 100 percent inspired by ISIS. Now, we have seen in multiple other attacks, including attacks I've investigated here in New York City as a police official where there was no communication with the terrorist group, where their radicalization, their decision to join was simply driven by watching the propaganda adopting the message and then following the instructions. As for the reports yesterday, that you and I talked about in an earlier broadcast about, you know, four people on the ground who might have been part of that, they were able to discount that saying they've identified those people, they have looked at those videotapes again, and while they are looking at the coolers where the -- where the bombs were placed, they have nothing to do with the placement. In fact, they have video of the subject placing those coolers himself. So we have moved forward in terms of our base of knowledge.",

I mean, talk to meabout the sort of level of confusion here just in terms of the mixed sort of messaging we're getting. And, obviously, right when the attack happened, we were initially told that it may have been an act of terrorism. Then we were told, no, no, no, it actually wasn't an act of terrorism. We were told that the suspect may not have acted alone. Now we're learning that he did act alone. Then we were told, obviously, that 15 people died. Now we're being told it's 14 people, but 15, I guess, if you include the suspect. And then this idea of the IEDs and the coolers and the two coolers on Bourbon Street, they had initially thought that the various people that they thought that they saw on surveillance videos stopping to look inside the coolers may have been involved somehow, but it just turned out they were passersby. I mean, give us your take as somebody who has been in law enforcement on the level of mixed messaging here from the FBI that we're getting. How common is it, this early on in an investigation?",

When did it start? They have already gotten enough exploitation so they know his claim that he joined ISIS, you know, during the summer. So this is something that they are already examining. But they're going to be looking for that. They're also going to be looking for who were his most frequent calls to? Who were his least frequent calls to? Who are those people and what did they discuss? They're going to want to -- this is -- this is what Chris Raia said, we are going to look at everything in his life, quote-unquote.

You know, what we've heard about him was that in recent weeks and months, he had been isolating himself. He kept to himself. And he wasn't even seen at his local mosque. So one wonders how much of this was his religious identity, or his believed religious identity, versus his own mental illness that we think he had, his financial troubles, the troubles of his family, and the like.

One might wonder also give more the bombs replaced whether, you know, in a lot of these attacks you set off one bomb, the people are killed. And then as the first responders are coming in, you set off a second bomb to attack the first responders. Maybe that's what he was trying to do as well, force people to move from the bombs he had set off, that he put in place at one hand and then maybe ran into them.

All right?And, you know, I just want to note just the numbers game here, you know. You've been talking about it. Mike Johnson's been talking about it. But I think it's even more extreme than you let on in your intro read there, because, yes, back in 1931, after the 1930 elections, the GOP had this very narrow majority. But then, of course, there were vacancies. And in fact, the first session didn't take place until like December of 1931. And by that point, the Democrats actually had the majority and it was wider than what we're seeing right now. So Mike Johnson's potential major headache, it's the smallest majority at the start of a first session since at least 1917. My goodness gracious. Look at this. Republicans with 219 votes because Matt Gaetz says he's in fact not going to sit in this Congress. The Democrats right nearby with 215 likely to divide tomorrow. And, you know, when we look at that math, you know, you -- Mike Johnson was kind of doing it. So I want to break this down in terms of scenarios in which GOP representatives can sink Mike Johnson's speakers bid on a given ballot, if at least -- all right. Let's take a look at scenario number one. If two Republicans vote against Mike Johnson, of course, assuming there are 434 members who vote and no Democrats vote for Johnson, if just two Republicans vote against him, he does not, in fact, become speaker in a given ballot. How about scenario number two? Because I like two scenarios. If one Republican votes against him and two abstain, that is vote president, Mike Johnson, in fact, does not become speaker. So this is a game that we've played before, right? We were mentioning it earlier on in the segment. Look at this. Ballots it took to elect a speaker. The last two times that we've had this sort of wonderful string of events come together, back in January of 2023, it took 15 ballots. Fifteen ballots, my goodness gracious, for Kevin McCarthy to become the speaker. That was the most since 1859, 1860. That was long ago. I know that we have some old folks in our society right now. I don't think any of them are quite that old. And it was the first multi-ballot race since 1923. And in fact, we've had two of those, two of those in the last two years. Mike Johnson, of course, it took four ballots to get him. If we don't get one on the first ballot to answer your question at the top, well, we'll go to a second ballot. And then if we don't have one, we'll go to a third ballot, if we don't have a majority. And then I think the question is, if not Mike Johnson, then who? How long can he actually stand being put up for speaker and getting denied it, if in fact he is denied on that first ballot? That's a question of which I do not have an answer to at this particular point. But I may have to develop one because the bottom line is starting tomorrow, we could be in for many ballots and I hope you'll join with me in watching those votes.",

So this is the route he chose instead, this ramming attack in New Orleans that ended up killing 14 people.

We already see online in the broader kind of Islamic State ecosystem what we call fan boys or cheerleaders promoting him, praising him. And again, this was a fairly complex and sophisticated attack, multiple layers of redundancy built in here, not just a vehicle, but an assault rifle, improvised explosive devices. That's why I'm kind of waiting to see if he was actually in touch with someone from the Islamic State, if this was what we call cyber coaching or the result of a kind of virtual entrepreneur attack, that would, you know, make sense.

TODD (voice-over): The kind of horror that many cities have experienced in recent years when attackers turned vehicles into weapons. Just a few days before this Christmas, a car slams into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing at least five people, injuring more than 200. The suspect, a doctor originally from Saudi Arabia who'd expressed anti-Muslim, far-right views. Like Magdeburg and New Orleans, other cities have experienced horrific vehicle attacks during holidays. November 2021, a suspect with a long criminal history drives an SUV through the annual Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, killing six, injuring more than 60. Berlin, December 2016, a tractor trailer rams into a crowd at a bustling Christmas market, killing at least 12 people, injuring dozens of others. The suspect, a rejected asylum seeker, was later killed in a shootout with police in Italy. And the deadliest vehicle attack ever, July 14th, 2016, Bastille Day in Nice, France, a Tunisian-born French resident drives a 20-ton truck nearly a mile through a crowded seaside promenade, 86 people killed, more than 200 others wounded. ISIS claimed responsibility. Why do these vehicle attacks often seem more deadly than other tactics?",

Secondly, just like school shooters look at Columbine or other famous school shootings and kind of obsess about them and terrorists examine other terrorists. And they say, well, what worked? Fairly vehicle rammings work. TODD (voice-over): October 2017, an Islamic extremist from Uzbekistan jumps a curb in a rental truck in Manhattan, drives down a bicycle path along the West Side Highway and kills eight people. Authorities found a note near the truck claiming the attack was in the name of ISIS. A couple of months earlier, a domestic extremist, a white nationalist, slammed his vehicle into a crowd of counter protesters at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one woman and injuring almost 20 others. Analyst Peter Bergen says vehicle attacks with their blood-curdling optics have a distinct psychological impact.",
