      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Kaitlan Collins.And tonight, we have two big developments, in the federal investigations, into former President Donald Trump. CNN has now learned that Mark Meadows, Trump's former Chief of Staff, has testified, before a grand jury, in the Special Counsel's investigation. He could be a crucial witness, given he is someone, who has seen and heard more than most, as the former gatekeeper, to the Oval Office. Also, tonight, I've helped break some new reporting, about federal prosecutors, now using a second grand jury. This one in Miami. The other one is in Washington, D.C., as part of that classified documents probe, into the former President. That grand jury has heard testimony, from multiple witnesses, in recent weeks, I'm told, and also is going to hear from another witness, tomorrow. All of this investigative action had been centered, in Washington, D.C. So, a big question tonight, why now in Florida? In a moment, you will hear from a former federal prosecutor, who says she views this as a really big deal. But first, let's get to the very latest, on these developments, in these latest stories, from CNN's Paula Reid. Paula, obviously, when it comes to what's happening, here, with Mark Meadows, that's significant. We knew he had been subpoenaed. We knew they tried to fight it. But now he has gone and testified. What else have we learned?",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Kaitlan.He's not just a witness. He is the witness, in both Special Counsel investigations, potentially, because when it comes to January 6, he was at the center of everything. The House Select Committee that investigated the events, in and around January 6, came to the conclusion that all roads led to Mark Meadows. They did not get the opportunity, to talk to him, in that investigation. We've also learned though, through our reporting, with our colleagues, that he is increasingly significant, potentially, to Jack Smith, and his investigation, into the possible mishandling, of classified documents, down at Mar-a-Lago. Not only would he have been, at the White House, when things were getting packed up, in those final days. But we also learned that that bombshell recording that we reported last week, where Trump can be heard talking about having a classified document? That recording was made by Mark Meadows' autobiographers. So, investigators will clearly have potentially a lot of questions, for Meadows, on both probes. But at this point, it's not clear if he has testified, for both investigations, or just one. But this certainly ends a long-lasting mystery, in the Trump circle, which is hey, what's going on with Mark Meadows? We know, as you said, the former President tried to stop him, from testifying, citing executive privilege. He lost that battle. But since then, as we expected, he would testify, the Trump team was in the dark, on what exactly was going on. There was no communication, between Meadows' legal team, and the former President's legal team, leading to some concerns, about whether he was cooperating. But now that we know he has testified, Kaitlan, it is the clearest sign that especially the classified document investigation, is likely at the very end.",

This is where the Special Counsel is. This is where dozens and dozens of witnesses have traveled, to testify, before the grand jury, here in D.C. Suddenly, they're hearing from witnesses, down in Florida.Specifically, in Miami, we expect another witness, as we're reporting, with the team, tomorrow. And the big question is why Florida? We don't actually know why Florida. But what we do know is that the fact that this has been, here, in D.C., during the entire investigation, they've been asking questions, gathering evidence here. This has been something that Trump team has been focused on. They've made it clear that if their client is charged here, in D.C., they were going to challenge what is called venue, or the location, of these charges. They were going to argue that any alleged criminal conduct didn't really have a sufficient connection, to Washington, D.C. They would argue that yes, the records belong to the government. But that's not enough to try it here. They would much rather see this case, if it's brought in Florida, where they believe the jury pool would be more favorable. So, the Special Counsel knows that they're likely to face a venue fight. It's unclear, though, if that's why they're now bringing witnesses, in Florida, or if they could potentially be charging one, perhaps two people, whose conduct only has a connection, to Florida. And it wouldn't be proper here in D.C. But as you know, we're working the phones, and our sources, trying to get more information on this, because this is definitely an unexpected development.",

They can do it there, and then read the testimony, in D.C. Or, as Paula suggested, maybe there's a couple of minor people, they want to charge, just with obstruction. And they would do that in a separate case, in Miami. Or they could be thinking bigger picture. This case could happen either in D.C., or Florida. But most of the events really did happen, in Florida. And so, they might be thinking about charging just the obstruction part, in Florida, and the classified document kind of substantive case, in D.C., or charging the whole thing, down in Florida, where most of the conduct happened (ph).",

And under that rubric, usually your D.C. venue would be less favorable for prosecutors. But, I think, in this case, just because it is the former President, he's so well-known, people have such strong opinions about him, that they are thinking of it more as, \"We will get a more favorable jury pool in D.C.\" But honestly, I don't think that's driving this.

I don't know that more vengeance and grievance towards Trump helps us look forward. So, the reason I'm in this race, Kaitlan is that I think conservatives have gotten too much into the habit of running from something.

Iowa and New Hampshire exist, as early states, for a reason. I spent a lot of time there. The voters there keep a very open mind. They're actually able to tell who's real from who's a plastic politician. I think after that, I think you're going to see people needed to make decisions, about stepping out between New Hampshire and Super Tuesday. And I'm confident that our path takes us all the way to the nomination, just as Donald Trump did in 2015. I'm the outsider in this race.

And a move from a bilateral international order, to a trilateral one, is actually a net win for Vladimir Putin. But it's an even bigger win for us. It's the reverse maneuver of what Nixon did with Mao in 1972. Mao Zedong was not a hero, then. Putin is not a hero now. But we pulled China away from Russia. Today, Putin is the new Mao. That's my sweeping foreign policy vision, of how we also deter China, from going after Taiwan.

In both cases, Florida paid to transport the migrants, from Texas. Today, Florida officials called the flights, to California, quote, \"Voluntary.\" I'm joined now by the Attorney General, for the State of California, Rob Bonta. Thank you so much, Mr. Attorney General, for joining us tonight. You've said that you believe this is state-sanctioned kidnapping. Obviously, very strong language there. But, who do, specifically, in the Florida government, do you blame for this? And what action do you intend to take as a response to that? ROB BONTA, (D) CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: This conduct requires and has earned strong language, in response. It's cruel and inhumane. And the buck stops at the top. I lay this at the feet of Governor, Ron DeSantis. It's an official State of Florida program. It's funded by state tax dollars from the taxpayers of Florida, $22 million. $10 million, last year. $12 million, this year. It is their official position, their official policy. And mind you, they are not -- with respect to the two movements, of asylum-seekers, to California, not moving any migrants, from the State of Florida, to the State of California. They are moving them from the State of Texas. So, paying a private for-profit corporate vendor, to do this work for them. And, I think, Governor Ron DeSantis has to answer for this. This is his State of Florida. This is his policy. It's petty and small, cruel and inhumane, xenophobic and discriminatory. It's absolutely wrong, morally bankrupt. And what do we intend to do? Hold the State of Florida, its vendors, everyone involved, accountable, for any laws that are violated. And make sure that the asylum-seekers receive the compassion and care, the dignity and respect, the services and programs, that they deserve, to be taken care of, after coming on a three-month journey, here, to the United States, seeking safety and fleeing violence and persecution.",
