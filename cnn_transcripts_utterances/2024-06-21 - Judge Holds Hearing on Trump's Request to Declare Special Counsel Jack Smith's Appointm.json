But Judge Cannon, lifetime appointee, she can do what she wants. She wants to have this hearing. She wanted to hear from outside parties, law professors, both on the liberal and on the conservative side about this.And it boils down to this question, and this is what we're getting out of listening to those arguments today. It boils down where she keeps asking questions of how did this actually work with Merrick Garland appointing Special Counsel Jack Smith and how much oversight is there within the department of this special counsel. Trump's team has argued a bunch of different things here. And some of those conflict at different times, that there's not enough oversight of Smith, that he's too much of an inferior officer, that it's not constitutional, that the money isn't correct for him. There's going to be more arguments on that on Monday. But Judge Cannon has a lot of questions here. And if she does deviate from what other judges have across the country, that's possible. And she could theoretically nullify not just this indictment, but Jack Smith. Of course, that would very likely be appealed by the Department of Justice. But it's a hearing that raises really intriguing questions about the special counsel's office. Donald Trump wants to really dig into how this works within the Justice Department. And Judge Cannon is asking questions of how much oversight, how - has there been actual oversight and what do you really mean about the oversight Merrick Garland has over the special counsel. A lot of stuff in court today, but no ruling.",

There were numerous challenges to Special Counsel Mueller's appointment during that time. They all failed. And quite candidly, and this is, you know, kind of consistent with what Katelyn was just outlining for you, too, this should have and could have easily been dealt with on the papers without need of a hearing. It's been dealt with for years, for decades, actually, going all the way back to the Nixon era.There was no need for this to be a day and a half long hearing. But this is what Judge Cannon, at her own discretion, has chosen to do. And even though I expect she'll deny this motion, it's the delay that matters and that's what Trump's team wanted, and that's what they got.",

They're arguing over the definition of particular words, you know, terms like inferior officer and what is official, what is employee. This gets into really abstract areas of statutory text.It happens all the time when dealing with these kinds of cases. It's certainly not unusual. But a lot of judges don't tend to require this kind of extensive hearing on it, and they certainly don't generally bring in these friends of the court, these various amici, to submit briefs and to argue, as was allowed this afternoon down there in Florida. That's a particular approach Judge Cannon chose to pursue and allow, again, she has that discretion. I don't think most judges would have done that.",

I don't know that you heard some of the arguments in those cases that we're hearing from Trump's lawyers during the hearing. They argued that Smith's position amounted to a, quote, shadow government. They described him as one of the most powerful people in the country.Judge Cannon apparently responded that, quote, \"That sounds very ominous.\" What do you really mean? I'm wondering what you think that means and whether you think that from that statement, Judge Cannon sounds skeptical of the argument.",

We've seen that before on other hearings, and then she's still ruled against Trump.But what the argument coming from the Trump team, as well as the amici that submitted briefs in their support, we saw some of those notes coming out from reporters this afternoon, was basically that the court's gotten it wrong since the '70s, that the special counsels can't be set up the way they've been throughout all those decades, that the Nixon ruling was wrong and everything that came after it was wrong, that even if the original independent counsels from the '80s and '90s were a little different, and those were permitted, that the ones that have come out recently, like Mueller, and Hur and Smith are all unconstitutional and that they should be thrown out. It's not going to go anywhere in the end, even if by some chance Judge Cannon were to rule in Trump's favor on this. I absolutely expect the 11th Circuit would reverse. But again, it's the delay that mattered, and they got a day and a half long hearing out of what should have easily been resolved a month or two ago on the papers.",

And so I think there's a view from the Biden campaign that they believe that it's not sustainable, that that sort of thing is not going to happen every single month going into November. But, of course, only time will tell.With that being said, they have $212 million cash on hand at the end of May. That may mean that they need to make smaller ad buys or have smaller outlays, depending on what the next few months look like. Remember, they had a $50 million ad buy focusing on the criminal conviction of Donald Trump. That is just for the month of June across battleground states. So that is a very big number. But it also, Brianna, raises the stakes for the debate next Thursday, because President Biden is going to want to bring in a lot of donations on the back of his performance there.",

Generally, they start with more informal discussions, going through binders of topics, materials, watching old clips, refining what they believe is going to be asked and discussing punches, counter punches.And to do that, we've learned from sources that the president's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is likely to reprise his role as a stand in for Trump. He has recently written that in 2020, when he served in that role, he was at his Trump worst. He really tried to act the part, study the character and really step into that role and aides expect him to reprise that role in Camp David this weekend. But depending on how it goes, they're also reserving the possibility that the president travels straight to Atlanta from Camp David. So if you see him at White House events next week, that is going to tell you that they're feeling optimistic.",

      "sentences": "That's right. I mean, Donald Trump's campaign and his political operation has really erased or is beginning to erase the ones dominant advantage, cash advantage, I should say, that President Joe Biden's campaign has had over him. And that's really critical because we know that Democrats have really been able to outmatch the Trump campaign and advertising spending and ground game strategy. And over the next four months, that could really change how we see them operate on the campaign trail.Now, I do want to just walk you through the numbers. So in May, Donald Trump raised $141 million. Now, 10s of millions of that figure was raised in the aftermath of his guilty verdict and his Manhattan trial. And really, it's the second month in a row that the Trump campaign has outraised the Biden campaign. Biden campaign only brought in $85 million in May. And so this is definitely a drastic change from what we had seen earlier this year, where Donald Trump's team was trying aggressively to try and catch up what seemed to be Joe Biden's ever growing war chest. And so I can also tell you that just behind the scenes, you know, Donald Trump has really been working on raising money. Throughout his trial, there are a lot of questions about why he wasn't doing more rallies. Instead, he was hosting a lot of fundraisers and attending a lot of fundraisers with wealthy donors, including a ton of billionaires. We also saw many billionaires give to one of Donald Trump's leading super PACs, MAGA Inc. They said they raised $68 million last month, 65 of which came from just three billionaires alone. One of them, Timothy Mellon, donated $50 million to MAGA Inc. He had previously given to RFK Jr., but clearly has switched some of his loyalties here and is now supporting the former president.",

She said that the mainstream media is the one who is - is the group of people trying to lower expectations for this.And look, this is them that have done this. They have really tried to say that Biden can barely stand for the 90 minutes. Now they're a little bit more concerned about what that expectation setting will look like.
