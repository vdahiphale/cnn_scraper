This is the world's first commercial spacewalk by the Polaris Dawn Crew.Plus, Donald Trump allies do damage control after what some viewed as a disappointing debate night for the former president, while Vice President Kamala Harris rides a fresh wave of momentum as she gets back on the campaign trail. And with the high-stakes election less than two months away, America's top diplomat is in Poland today, after reassuring Ukraine that support for the country will endure. All right, history was made just minutes ago, some 700 kilometers above the earth, that is where the crew of a SpaceX Dragon Capsule is making the first ever commercial spacewalk. The four astronauts on board the SpaceX ships are in their third day in space, hatch was open to explore around their vehicle for about two hours. Jared Isaacman, the CEO of a finance company who helped pay for the mission, was the first to exit the spacecraft. Here is what he said upon exiting the spacecraft. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've seen government sponsored space walks in the past. NASA has been doing them for decades now. So why is this one so important and so different?KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: This is part of a trend that's been happening for quite some time, this shift from governments being the only entities that can send people to space to now private companies and now private companies can do it typically faster and eventually for far less money than the government. And so, this is part of the technology that NASA actually has been funding. They want SpaceX to have this capability. But Fred what we saw today was truly remarkable. I mean, when they first announced this, when SpaceX first announced that they were thinking of doing an EVA, a spacewalk in just 2.5 years, people's minds were blown. They just did not think it was possible to get everything ready that fast. And what they have just done, and Fredricka, they just completed the spacewalk moments ago, the hatches closed, the interior of the spacecraft has successfully repressurized. So, this spacewalk was a resounding success. And what they have proven is that they are capable of doing not just space travel, but now a spacewalk and Fred for decades that has been widely considered to be the most dangerous and risky thing that anybody can do in space Fred.",

That's the first time they've ever let all the air out of one of these SpaceX ships and see if everything still works. You know, imagine if in your studio, if suddenly there was zero air pressure, would all the computers keep working? You know, how would everything function? So that was a big step.But the second one was when Jared reached up, and I know, if you watch it or not, but was jiggling, and opened that hatch. Because if that hatch doesn't close again properly, then there's no way to get air back into the cabin. They'd have to do an emergency deorbit back to Earth, with everybody still in their big pressurized suits. So, I was -- you know amongst everything else, I was really pleased to see both those things work perfectly, have the crew safely back inside. And maybe most importantly, we have now a proven new spacewalking suit. It's been a long time since we've had a new one. That's great for the world.",

We've integrated I think maybe the cleverest part is that you don't take a bunch of technologies and put them together to make a suit.They actually started at the beginning and tried to integrate all the manufacturing techniques to make it as sleek and as light and as simple and foolproof for the crew as possible. The way you integrate cooling and how the air gets to the crew properly, laser heads up display so they all the information, a communication system. And it looked like all spacesuits - if bulky to wear, but at the same time, as far as I could tell, everything worked.

And this will be sort of the grandmother suit of the one that people will be wearing when they're walking around in the South Pole of the Moon here fairly shortly.

So, the pressure is certainly mounting. I think some are also seeing that the delivery by Iran, as the U.S. sees it, of ballistic missiles to Russia, is also adding to that pressure, given that we have now heard both Secretary Blinken and the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy use the word escalation to describe that in recent days, that is leading some to speculate that they believe some of the feared escalation around lifting these restrictions on using long range missiles in Russian soil has already happened, so certainly, hopes are being raised in Ukraine at this point.",

So, I think that's what you're seeing happening, whether it's going to be successful in convincing swing state voters, those movable voters that could decide the election, that they didn't see what they actually saw on the debate night, which was that Trump had a very bad night. It seems unlikely that. The interesting thing is that nobody in Trump's orbit, and this is a testament to his power of personality, is able to come out and say, well, we had a bad night, but we'll do better next time, if there is a next time that tells you something about the whole Trump has over the Republican Party.",

She follows up her trip to North Carolina with several stops in Pennsylvania, which is absolutely a must win state if she's going to get to the White House. So, I think you'll see a greater intensity. The question is, after that debate where she did well, is she going to start doing more major media interviews where she could get into situations where she actually gets more scrutiny than Trump was able to bring to bear in his underperforming debate on Tuesday night? That is something to watch. I think they'll still be very careful to make sure that the message is sharp and perhaps a little constrained.

I would look, I think, to lots of events in universities as we get closer to the election, I think it's still unclear how directly Taylor Swift will get involved in this, but it clearly is something that the campaign would welcome. One thing which they really do not want to happen is a resurgence of those demonstrations that we saw at a lot of campuses in the early summer by pro-Palestinian supporters who are angry about the Israeli operation in Gaza. If that happens, that could really offer an opening to the Trump campaign and complicate the outreach to students who are -- generally they vote Democratic, but they're quite difficult to get to the polls.",

Veronica Miracle has the story as part of our \"Bold Pursuits Series\".(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the Omics Center of Excellence, a biological repository where DNA samples are selected, stored and analyzed with the help of advanced artificial intelligence. It's the work of M42 a global health tech company based in Abu Dhabi. ALBARAH EL KHANI, SVP OPERATIONS, M42: This is our biobank that we store our DNA samples for our population genome program. MIRACLE (voice-over): It's here where Albara El Khani is leading an ambitious project to map the genome of every single willing UAE citizen. Since 2019, they've successfully collected and sequenced the DNA of 600,000 Emiratis that's 62 percent of the local population.",
