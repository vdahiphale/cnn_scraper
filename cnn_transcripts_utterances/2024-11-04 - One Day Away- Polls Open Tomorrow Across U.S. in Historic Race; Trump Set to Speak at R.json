And in talking to campaign officials, they tell me that what they are banking on is their ground game. They've talked about this frequently, especially in Pennsylvania, having those field offices in multiple counties, including the blue ones and the red ones. And they say that their door knocking has been positive and they're hopeful that that helps them get out the vote.Now the Vice President, we're learning, will be spending tomorrow in Washington, D.C., where she is going to be calling into radio shows and yet another appeal to voters. And that is what this moment is really about. And talking to any campaign official on the Harris campaign, they are solely focused on mobilizing voters. They wanted to capitalize on early voting when that was possible in states. And now they want to make sure that people get out to the polls tomorrow, especially in crucial states like this one, Pennsylvania. Boris, Brianna?",

Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us. You've been very gracious with your time this election cycle and you've joined us multiple times. And from the beginning, you were saying that it's not clear yet who would have the advantage in Michigan. A few weeks ago, you said the same thing. We're now one day out before Election Day, I wonder where you think things stand and which candidate you think has the momentum there. REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): So Boris, it's good to be with you and 24 hours left and a little more. I do believe it continues to be very tight. The tightness we're seeing around the country, but I have moved myself to a new phrase that you're now nauseously optimistic. So, it's a great phrase. I didn't know. One of my friends that got a sports team told me that's a term they use. But I - it - I've been on the ground, you know this, I've already done six campus kickoffs today. As soon as I'm done with you, I'm right back out there. There is movement in from a month ago. There is movement in the union halls as union workers realize that Donald Trump has said that they should be fired for walking a picket line. There's certainly movement on young - amongst young African-American men and the college students are really recognizing what's at stake. It's still very tight. I'm not going to - we're doing our work. We're not going to stop till those polls close. And I hope young people are in line again till 2 AM tomorrow because they just didn't listen to us and do their early voting, so it's tight.",

And similarly, over the weekend at her most recent rally, she didn't specify who she was talking about when she was attacking the other side, the other guy, et cetera.I wonder what you make of the contrast from just a few days ago when she was explicitly laying out her view of the danger she believes that Trump poses to the country.

And it wasn't, because Donald Trump is somebody who has - he goes after political enemies. He names them by name. I remind people that no one should ever say someone should point eight barrels at somebody's face.And he's threatened - he talks about the enemy from within. He threatens to use our military forces. You need to remind people, and some of the things he's saying right now, I don't want you to be shot, Boris. I don't want any member of the media to be shot. He's saying some pretty outrageous things this weekend. But I think I'm feeling cautiously optimistic. I just want everybody to know that their vote wins. We got to come together. We can disagree with each other agreeably. But this has been the toughest, most vitriolic, violent, bitter election I've seen in my lifetime - Not old, but I'm seasoned - and we need for the sake of this country to remember we're the United States of America.",

That's new. There are also going to be police officers at Fulton County at their 177 polling precincts. That is the same in 2020. Again, they're there to address any issues.

And there are going to be these cameras inside. They were showing them to us earlier, that are filming 24/7 on the process of tabulating the votes.

I believe that there's a very effective effort to challenge every one of these accusations, and then I'm glad that we're not talking about the polling because the polling is now done. It's now just about the voting and the counting of the voting and the verification of that count, and so far it doesn't appear like any of these are grounded in any kind of fact.

I think Harris, on the other hand, she's ahead pretty clearly in Wisconsin. And for her, she just needs to sweep both Pennsylvania and Michigan, and then it will not matter what happens in those two southern states or those two western states. So both of them can lose a key state and still make up the difference, but my God, we've never seen it this time (INAUDIBLE) turnout (INAUDIBLE) older union voters, in his perspective, these are the key voter blocs that will determine the election.",

For Trump, that's older men who don't normally participate in elections, but I feel that this one really matters.
