Investigators are already collecting evidence. Excuse me. It's from the drone, yes? Where did you find it? So, they're saying that's the tail fin from the drone that hit. The target according to Ukrainian authorities, Kyiv's energy infrastructure, but one hits a residential building nearby with devastating results. You can see at least one person has been killed, they're taking her body away. Rescue workers comb through the smoldering rubble. There have been reports of voices still alive inside.

If these were Russian drones, which they had at the start of this campaign, you'd say they're continuing their assault.But what Russia has had to do is go to other countries to ask for munitions, not just for drone systems, which the Iranians have a plethora of drones that they can use both ones with visual cues and with loitering capability and with the ability to seek out and research targets. But these are especially particular, because they hit specific targets. They were designed by Iran with about 120 pounds or a 200 kilogram pound worth of payload. And it is actually smaller than what you would see dropped from an aircraft, the smallest possible bomb that's dropped from an aircraft. But it's geared toward hitting a point target, a stationary target from a long distance away. So, what Russia is doing by buying these drones is basically admitted, they're out of precision weapons, or they're running low of precision weapons. Russia has turned into somewhat of a hollow army, they came into this with very poor operational objectives that they could not meet. And now they're finding themselves after having used a lot of precision weapons against civilian targets that they've run out of systems to launch. So, they're now launching these purchase drones from Iran.",

We're going to see Russia probably trying to get literally thousands of these kinds of drones. And it's certainly going to be problematic for Ukraine, because truthfully, it's very difficult to defend against these weapons. They have a very low radar signature, so you can't pick them up as they're coming in at target. They have a very small payload. And Russia has, as I've said before, they're gearing these to hit civilian targets, which is an indicator of just the amount of war crimes they're committing by targeting civilians and infrastructure of Ukrainian government.",

This base only two years ago was on the front line in the fight against ISIS after PAC received U.S. training. It isn't far from U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM forces. Just one day after the attack on the PAC base, CENTCOM shut down another Iranian drone, which appeared they say as a threat to CENTCOM forces stationed in the area. And as the U.S. anti-ISIS presence in Iraq is set to continue, so is the threat Iran poses. These female fighters have vowed to fight until there is a regime change in Iran.

And the only person that's on the outside here is Rishi Sunak. So, the fact that she's been able, at the moment, at least to hold on to that position simply has to deal with the fact that the Conservative Party is trying to calculate whether or not it can afford a new leadership appointment before they have to face the general public and what the reaction will be.

On Monday, police had to shut down a major bridge, because protesters were scaling it. Over the weekend, protesters blocked traffic by laying in the road. And at least one activist spray-painted an Aston Martin show room. U.K. Home Secretary Suella Braverman says protests like these drain police resources and says she's bringing forward a public order bill that will give authorities more powers to prevent these types of disruptions that are favored by some environmental groups.
