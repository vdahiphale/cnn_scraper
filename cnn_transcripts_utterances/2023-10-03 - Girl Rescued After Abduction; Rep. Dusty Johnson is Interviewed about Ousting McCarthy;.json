Obviously, they were so distraught and overwhelmed with the disappearance of their daughter. And on - on -- to his point on the whether this was a targeted kidnapping or not, I think that right now they've - they've been able to pinpoint the suspect being in that park, in that area on the day of the kidnapping due to probably cellphone records, possibly license plate readers. But those cellphone records, they can go back in time and figure out how long he was in that park and whether he had been monitoring that family either overnight or through the day, or only for minutes.

He's also somebody who, whether it's on the spending agreements or this particular issue, has always been in the room at the table trying to figure out a path forward to some degree. Congressman, I appreciate your time this morning. I want to start with kind of where things stand right now. There are clearly enough Republicans that are willing to join Congressman Gaetz. You are a member who also has relationships across the aisle. Do you have any sense of whether or not Democrats will help Speaker McCarthy here? REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): First off, let's make sure we're clear about the math. There are ten times more Republicans backing Kevin McCarthy than are backing Matt Gaetz. At least ten times more. Maybe 15 or 20 times more. Yes, Matt Gaetz is going to try an unauthorized coup. He is trying to get some of the most liberal voices on the Democratic side to help. I know Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been a vocal supporter of his efforts. To answer your question though, I do think there are going to be a number of Democrats who understand that this kind of chaos does not serve our country well. And we've got a southern border in crisis and we only have the government funded for 40 more days. Maybe we should actually focus on solving a few problems than these kind of D.C. parlor games.",

It is hard to build anything in this really toxic, politicalenvironment. So, when you have dedicated people who actually want to find legislative accomplishments, I think it's frustrating to them that you've got somebody who just -- their only purpose in seven years has been going around and kicking everybody else's sandcastle. Listen, the time for the chaos agents like Matt Gaetz to be getting publicity needs to be in the rearview mirror. We got to focus on work.

This is the first of what will be many barges that can bring about a half million gallons of fresh water at a time downstream. They use it to dilute the brackish stuff as it goes into a small water plant here in Plaquemines Parish. The Corps says they can move 36 million gallons a day. But even that wouldn't be enough to save the New Orleans water supply. So they're already talking about maybe building pipelines to prop up that water system. In the meantime, the Corps is also building a big sill, like an underwater speed bump, to try to slow the wedge as it moves inland. But these are all temporary fixes.
