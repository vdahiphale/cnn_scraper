May be the slightest edge to Kamala Harris, but I've seen averages that looks lightly different and then they have Donald Trump slightly ahead. I think Trump is doing a little bit better in states like Arizona and Georgia, but for the most part, no matter how you break this down, whether you look at the national polls, like we just conducted and I will also note \"The New York Times\" also had a tie out this morning or whether you look at the state-level polls, there ain't no difference. This is the same freaking thing that we've seen throughout this campaign between Harris and Trump, and that is, no clear leader, though I will note when you're tied 47 to 47, I am not quite sure you need the banner up there.

Now if you take an average across the polls, its only about a point. It is the same thing in the swing states, right? I mentioned earlier around Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, she had an advantage there about two to three points last month. Now those races are all within a point and more than that, her favorable ratings have declined. She had a positive net favorability rating. That is her favorable was above her unfavorable.
