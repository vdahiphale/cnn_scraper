We'll update you on the story as it happens. It is 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Eleni Giokos. This is \"Connect the World\". And we'll be covering the other major stories from the region including further tension after a drone attack killing three U.S. troops in Jordan. And the fallout from funding cuts to UNRWA in response to allegations that a dozen staff members were involved in the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th. All right, with those regional tensions investors will be keeping a close eye on oil prices. The markets in New York will be open in around 30 minutes from now, as you can see, we're basically flat across the board, a lot of nervousness getting into this trading week. And then importantly looking forward to that Federal Reserve decision next week on interest rates that were very telling about the inflation prognosis going forward and what they anticipate and oil of course, very much at the crux of that. And a lot of this, of course has to do in terms of what we see in the Middle East in terms of any kind of escalation, any spillover that will be a cause of concern. In the meantime, U.S. President Joe Biden vowing to respond to a deadly drone attack in Jordan that killed three American troops now it happened at a remote outpost not far from Jordan's border with Syria. The U.S. blames Iranian-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq. Iran is distancing itself from the attack calling U.S. accusations of its involvement baseless. Now, this latest deadly incident furthering escalating tensions in the region, nearly four months into the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. We've got Paula Hancocks in studio with us today to give us a breakdown of what we've been seeing. Look, we know President Biden saying that he will respond. We don't know where? We don't know how? We don't know how intense it'll be? We don't know what the makeup will be? But this was definitely escalatory the strike that we saw.",

This would have been potentially predicted or certainly worried about because the fact is U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have had almost 160 attacks against them since October 17th since just after that. So there will be a number of different options. It depends on how far he wants to go? Certainly he is under pressure to go a little further. What we did hear from John Kirby just a couple of hours ago about what those potential options could be. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: I certainly can't deny the fact that there have been a series of attacks now increasingly lethal, over weeks and months, which is why the President is going to be reviewing with the appropriate responses going forward. We don't want to see these attacks continue. And we want to make it clear that they're unacceptable. We also want to make it clear that we'll do what we have to do to protect our troops, our facilities, our national security interests in the region. Those are the options that the president is weighing right now. We're going to take this very, very seriously. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

On Monday, a judge here in Hong Kong,ruled to liquidate the Chinese company after years of failed attempts to restructure it. Our Hong Kong judge Linda Chan said, \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough\". And before the hearing Evergrande shares are trading down as much as 20 percent, trading was halted in China Evergrande and its listed subsidiaries. For years now Evergrande has been the poster child of China's property debt crisis. It is the world's most indebted property developer with more than $328 billion of liabilities and $240 billion of assets. And last year in September, it's Founder and Chairman Xu Jiayin was suspected of crimes and detained by the police. Analysts say that the decision to liquidate this company is good news for China's economy in the long run, but it will be painful. Now according to Andrew Collier of orient Capital Research, he says this quote, Evergrande's liquidation is a sign that China is willing to go to extreme ends to quell the property bubble. This is good for the economy in the long term, but very difficult in the short term. Now Gary Ng, Senior Economist of Natixis adds this quote, it is not an end, but the beginning of the prolonged process of liquidation which will make Evergrande's daily operations even harder. Investors will be concerned about whether there will be a snowball effect on other developers as the queue to liquidation is long. And in 2021 Evergrande triggered a market panic when it couldn't make its debt payment and China's real estate market has yet to recover. It accounts for as much as 30 percent of the country's economic activity. And more than two thirds of Chinese household wealth is tied up in real estate. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.",
