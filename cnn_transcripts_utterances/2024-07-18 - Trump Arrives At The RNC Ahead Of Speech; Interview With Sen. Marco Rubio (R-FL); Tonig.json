I think it's fair to say then what's going on, on the other side of the aisle with the Democratic Party. CNN is reporting the top White House and campaign officials now privately believe that President Biden must abandon his reelection bid amid high level calls for him to exit. With the next 72 hours being pivotal to his decision-making, we're following it all. As we count down to the big finish of the Republican Convention featuring remarks by Trump' s second oldest son, Eric Trump, leading up to Donald Trump's climatic speech himself. His wife, Melania, is here. His daughter, Ivanka, expected to also be in the hall. They will be making their first appearances at this convention. Let's go right now to Kaitlan Collins on the convention floor. Trump is in the room, Kaitlan. Tell us what the mood is like where you are.",

You saw him just enter a few moments ago. But he'll leave that box and not too long from now, to go backstage, as he prepares to deliver what we are told is going to be about an hour -- an hour-and-ten minutes of remarks from the former President. I should just note that as we're in the room, there have been signs every night to kind of fit the themes where it was safety, immigration. Tonight, there are signs that say, \"Bring back common sense,\" \"Fire Joe Biden,\" is really popular one that we've seen tonight and of course, no surprise, \"Make America Great Again.\" Not a ton of Trump-Vance signs. I saw a few of them earlier, but it just speaks to obviously the message of this room is trying to send and what is happening here. Though this is also being scripted for those who are at home. And Jake, we saw Donald Trump go into his box. Two things I do want to note, sitting right behind him, among the lawmakers who are here is Oklahoma Senator James Lankford. Now that's notable because it wasn't all that long ago that James Lankford and some other lawmakers painstakingly crafted an immigration bill. One that was ultimately sunk by Donald Trump, when he came out against it. And then, that gave that permission structure for other Republicans to then subsequently come out against it. It did not actually pass, that was because they wanted him be able to run on immigration in this campaign, which they have been having a slew of speeches revolve around that. Also, another person who is in the box is one of his campaign aides, but also on his legal tea, Boris Epshteyn, who is an aide, who as we know, was indicted in Arizona recently on efforts to overturn the election there and those allegations along with a slew of other aides. So, obviously, watching all that closely, Jake, as Trump is preparing to take the stage not very long from now.",

It's hard to imagine that he's not going to do any sort of a flick to that, but it's going to be interesting to see how much he leans into that. I ran into Eric Trump, his son, earlier today, who's going to be introducing the former president, his father, who said that he is going to give kind of a similar frame that we heard his wife, Lara, last night, and that we heard from Donald Trump, Jr., maybe even more personal than Donald Trump, Jr. As he introduces his father, he's been working on the speech very, very carefully and that we might be a little bit surprised in what he says.

I think we also can expect to see a source tells me, that he may walk through his experience on Saturday in some detail, more detail than we have heard him walk through it before. Which again, I think may underscore the broader seems that we are talking about here. Yes, of course, unity among -- with the Republican Party, but also this idea that he seems to, and the thing that I'm -- I think going to be listening for tonight is how he describes whether this was some sort of spiritual experience for him. Because we have seen him reference that in some of the interviews that he did right afterward. We saw his face look quite different on that Monday night, whether it lasts, whether it has changed a man who has been on our American stage for however many decades. You know, we're still kind of learning as we go along. But I am told to expect something dramatically different than anything we've seen from him in public before.",

Because this is a man who has a long history in public. I think what he says on that stage is going to be important in -- that it tells us how the campaign wants the country to see him. But there's a lot of other data points that matter too, including what he has done and what he plans to do. So, just to put that on the table, but I do think the real question will be talk about unity. It is going to be, what does he say to the American people? Not just to people in this room, but to the rest of the country. There's more than half of the country that believes he's a divisive figure, that is concerned about what he might mean for American democracy. What does he say to those people and does he backtrack on some of his own previous incendiary language? Depicting the other ideological side of the aisle as the enemy of his supporters. So, these are all -- look, I think that with Trump, what he says on a teleprompter is always worth taking into consideration, but it would be foolish of us not to take the fact that when he is off the teleprompter, he often says something completely different. And, the pictures that they are painting this whole week has to be added to all the things that have come before it and all the things that will come after.",

That at the end of the day, besides all the noise, people that don't like him people that obviously do like him, but he ran for president because he felt that there were millions of Americans whose government was not responsive to what they were saying.

My perception of this from the calls we've had with the FBI and otherwise, is that clearly there was a massive error committed, irrespective of -- the Secret Service is in charge of the protection in that region, okay. They may outsource some piece of it, but ultimately, they are responsible for it. There is no way that some 20-year-old guy should be able to walk around, crawl on a roof, and get off, how many, three or four shots. That literally came within a millimeter of a live execution of the leading candidate for president at this moment. It should never have happened. My question is, is this part of a systemic internal organizational problem or was this an example of somebody made a big, big mistake in advancing the event? But I will say this, the Secret Service has handled this about as bad as you can handle it. They should be doing press conferences every day. The absence of consistent and clear information is what opens the door for conspiracy theories and all kinds of other things to take off. It's already hard enough to fight against those things.

I've been working with JD since 2018 on public policy before he was elected to anything.So, even four years before he ran, I was already interacting with him. And because I'm very impressed, he is very curious guy. I mean, he really loves to learn about it, probes and asked a lot of questions. He has that in common with Trump, by the way. If you ever sit down with Trump just off, he will ask you nine questions before he gives you one statement. He's very probing. He likes to talk to people and makes decisions on the basis of this ongoing dialogue that he has with people. And JD has that similar quality. He likes to learn a lot about things. Obviously, very smart, comes from a very unique background. It's amazing the road he's traveled to get to this point. I'm a huge fan of his and always will really work very well together very closely in the Senate. And, I think he's a very good choice for him. I really do. They have a lot of chemistry between them as well. So, I think he's going to be a really good vice president as well for the president. I mean, you guys should not make -- just think back where we are today six weeks ago, it's such a different race. Think of what has happened the last six years or 10 years. So, to predict anything beyond that at this point is folly, other than to say that JD was going to be in the mix no matter what because of how talented he is.",

So a variety of people, both inside and outside the campaign, acknowledge the President has been consuming all of this information, of course, hearing calls from Democratic lawmakers to reassess his candidacy. Why? They believe that he simply cannot win in November. Of course, that's an open question, but they are worried about their seats as well. They are worried about being branded as dishonest by trying to keep rationalizing his argument. So, Anderson, the next three days will be significant. We'll be watching them, of course. But the President in Delaware is increasingly isolated, and he's also isolated from his Democratic Party. Of course, he's recovering from COVID-19. But Vice President Kamala Harris was in North Carolina today. She picked up the mantle, really trying to draw a contrast with the Trump-Vance ticket, but all that's been taken away and overshadowed by President Biden's indecision.

The donors are upping their pressure. They are frustrated. They're angry. They feel misled. They are telling individual races and the party committees that they don't want to spend any more money. But. President Biden, I'm told, feels like that is donor pressure. He's looking at the grassroots of his party and he's saying, they're still with me. He's saying, my delegates are still with me and nobody can take my delegates away from me. So they are in a bind right now.

And it's not just walking through these events step by step and this assassination attempt, but it's also focusing on the fact that he feels lucky to be alive. That he believes that there's some form of divine intervention. Donald Trump is not a religious man. He is not even a spiritual man. But we are told by people around him that he has said over and over again that the only reason he believes that he survived something like this was because he turned his head. He was looking at a chart and he believes that that was because something, some higher spirit encouraged him to do so. Now, again, this is what we are told he is going to really double down on in the speech tonight.

But Joe Biden refuses to get the message. And so the fact that you're beginning to see more and more people, Adam Schiff yesterday, very important Democrat in the House and a close ally of Nancy Pelosi, Jon Tester in a key race this November. My guess is that once this convention ends, if the word from Delaware is that Joe Biden is still digging in his heels, you're going to start to see a murmur, and then a chorus, and then a flood of people going out in public and saying, Joe must go, which is, of course, one of the lines here at this convention.

And I have talked to many of them in various states where they were going out for him and are still going out for him, they genuinely believe that he was sent here by God.
