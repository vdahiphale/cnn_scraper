The justices could take up several cases that could decide the fate of Republican front runner Donald Trump, including if Trump is even eligible for the White House. Trump's team is expected to file an appeal with the high court next week over Colorado's decision to boot him off the primary ballot. The other big issue, is he immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed while in office?Special Counsel Jack Smith was hoping to skip straight to the Supreme Court to answer that question. So, we can keep the march start date for the Federal Election subversion trial. But Trump's legal team is asking the court to stay out of the dispute, at least for now. So, let's kick things off with CNN's Katelyn Polantz is in D.C. Katelyn, we just through a lot of everybody, but that's why we've got you here. Let's start with when could the Supreme Court actually announced whether it will take up this question of immunity. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Omar, it could be at any moment. It is now before them. They have heard from both the Justice Department and Trump's side. There is the special counsel that is hoping that the Supreme Court will take the case at this time. Donald Trump obviously doesn't want to do that, he wants to drag things out as long as possible related to his criminal case. And his trial, which is set for March. He doesn't want it to happen at that time. But Jack Smith, the Special Counsel, the Justice Department, they have made a lot of arguments about why the Supreme Court should look at this immunity question now. They say it's in the public interest. And they've, they've essentially told the Supreme Court, you're going to have to deal with this at some point or another. Right now, there's an intermediary court and appeals court in D.C. that is scheduling arguments, they're ready to look at this immunity question. Does Donald Trump have immunity because he was president at the time after the election? Does he have -- can he go to trial because he was already tried in Congress related to his impeachment? Can he be trialed in court to as a criminal defendant? There is an appeals court looking at that in January with oral arguments. And so, the question on the table for the Supreme Court is do they wait to see what that lower court says? Or are they ready to go now? Trump's team in their filing yesterday warned, don't do anything with reckless abandon. We don't want any rushes to judgment. And so, the Supreme Court is going to be thinking about that as well as they decide what to do next.",

But he, Bill Barr not only disagreed on the legal basis of the ruling, but also says that he expects it to help Trump politically.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BARR, FMR U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think this kind of action of stretching the law taking these hyper aggressive positions to try to knock Trump out of the race are counterproductive.

And they're going to use that exact same playbook, it to respond to this ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court. And essentially, it's to attack this decision as a political interference that because Donald Trump is currently the Republican front runner, they're trying to hurt his candidacy, his candidacy.They're also going after the judges on the bench, specifically something we've seen them do time and time again, with his other legal challenges. They're arguing that they are biased against the former president. And then, of course, as he's done time and time again, as well, they are trying to fundraise off of his legal misfortune. Now, I think as you look to the bigger picture and how the Republican Party is responding, as you mentioned, Kate, they are all rallying around him. Many of Donald Trump's rivals and primary challengers have really argued that they do not think it's a judge's place to decide who is on the ballot in 2024. And we did hear from one candidate Nikki Haley, in Iowa yesterday, who essentially argued that she wants to try and beat Donald Trump on the merits. Take a listen to what you had to say.

We're seeing these candidates crisscross Iowa, New Hampshire trying to make the argument that they are a better candidate, trying to distinguish themselves from Donald Trump.But as we've seen over the past year, time and time again, they are being forced to respond to some of his legal troubles, and in many times defend him because most of the Republican Party does view a lot of these court battles as political persecution for Donald Trump.",

The question is, in part, among many other issues, is it has already been favorable to, to Smith and his team, is he in a position to make that demand and make that request? We know there have been times roughly 20 since 2019, that this does happen.But you know, Trump's team is delay and you can say that as much as you want, delay, delay, delay, not necessarily the substance of it through looking at the procedural process of it.",

So, it's a typical, typical, you know, it's certainly less common, but it makes sense for the prosecution to do this, because we want as a prosecutor to have this trial before March 4th, because if this goes on to the circuit court, it's going to delay.But keep in mind, the circuit court, I believe, I want to say January 2nd, I think they said this is when you have that filings, and then by the 9th is oral arguments.
