We are live in Kyiv for you.And when it comes to the presidential race and the big presidential debate one week from today, there are two very different strategies emerging from the candidates as they're preparing to face off. And Ticketmaster is about to face tough questions from the U.K. government over its dynamic pricing it put in place for Oasis tickets after thousands of people were essentially locked out from buying tickets. I'm Kate Bolduan, with Sara Sidner and John Berman. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Let's start off getting to that breaking news out of Ukraine. Forty- one people killed, nearly 200 wounded in a Russian attack on what's described as a military educational facility in central Ukraine. Let's get right over to CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who's on the ground in Kyiv for us. What are you learning, Fred?",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Kate.Obviously, a lot of this information still just coming into us, very fresh, and the Ukrainians sort of coming out with it bit by bit. But the one thing that they have confirmed very early ones is at least 41 people have been confirmed to be killed. It's unclear whether or not that number is still going to rise as the rescue crews still very much on the scene. The Ukrainians are also saying that around 180 people were injured in the strikes that took place. They have offered some details as to what appears to have happened there. We've already mentioned this is a military educational facility. They say that the strike partially destroyed the communications institute building of that facility. And the Ukrainians are saying that there was actually an air alert, as air raid alert, that went off shortly before the strike took place. But they also say that the time from which the air raid sirens went off to when the missiles impacted was so short that those who were in that area were still in the process of getting to air raid shelters when the impacts happened. And, obviously, a lot of them caught off guard. The Ukrainians are, right now, speaking of two ballistic missiles. Search and rescue crews apparently on the scene very quickly in that central city of Poltava. The Ukrainians are saying they managed to save 25 people in the debris and have to pull 11 of them out of the actual debris. As you can imagine, the hospitals there are right now filled up with people that they are trying to treat. And the foreign minister of this country, Dmytro Kuleba, he came out a couple of minutes ago on CNN and said that this once again shows that Ukraine needs more air defense systems. Obviously, the Ukrainians ripping already into the Russians over this. Officially, the Russian military and the Russian government have not commented on this yet. However, there are some very prominent Russian military bloggers who have, in fact, said that Russia did attack this military educational facility. Obviously, a huge blow for the Ukrainians. And this is definitely one of the largest single mass casualty strikes that we've seen here in Ukraine, at least over the past couple of months, Kate.",

One week from today, the first face-to-face showdown takes place, meaning right now is the time for each candidate to get their debate ducks in a row. For team Harris, the next 48 hours is nearly all about the economy. She will unveil new policy details tomorrow, as her campaign today drops a brand new TV ad targeting the middle class, something she just reiterated on the trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. Who you lift up. Do you fight for workers? Do you fight for families? Do you fight for those who must be seen and heard and deserve the dignity that comes with hard work? That's what we fight for.

Of course, this is an issue where the vice president typically lags behind former President Donald Trump in the polls. So, they're trying to seize it again and really make the case that the vice president is focused on affordability, lowering housing prices, for example, or drug costs. And so that is what we have seen on the campaign trail yesterday.Now, notably, she was joined by President Joe Biden. He, of course, won the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by less than two percentage points in 2020. And the campaign sees him as particularly being useful and utilized in the blue wall states, given that he has been boosted by labor groups and union workers. And so, bringing the two together yesterday gives you just a better glimpse of how they plan to strategize over the next few months on this particular issue. Now, of course, despite all of this, the vice president repeatedly on the trail has said that they are the underdog in the race, and that is a message that she gave to those in the crowd yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's going to be a tight race to the very end. So, let's not pay too much attention to those polls because, as unions and labor knows best, we know what it's like to be the underdog. And we are the underdogs in this race. And we have some hard work then ahead of us. But here's the beauty of us in this room, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, even if a woman's life is in danger, the legislature - the state legislature here under Ron DeSantis, a MAGA extremist copy, banned abortion in the cases of rape, incest, and whether the mother's life is in jeopardy, except only in the extreme - most extreme circumstances. This is not where the mainstream of Americans are, or the mainstream of Floridians are. And we want to make sure that we can continue the policies that have - that have been administrating by the Biden-Harris administration of reducing prescription drug costs, creating jobs, bringing costs down.
