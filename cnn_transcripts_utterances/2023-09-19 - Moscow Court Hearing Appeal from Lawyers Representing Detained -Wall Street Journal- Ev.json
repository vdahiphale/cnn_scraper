Many of these leaders were already at the G20 in India just a few weeks ago.But in just a couple of hours, President Biden is going to take the lectern here at the United Nations for the third speech to the General Assembly of his presidency. And White House officials say that he is going to be raising a few themes. You mentioned the fact that he is going to be talking about the need to deliver more aid to Ukraine. He'll also talk about the importance of democratic values in a world where authoritarian regions are on the rise. He'll also talk about the need to marshal resources for sustainable development, climate infrastructure projects around the world. And that address is going to set the table of sorts for some high- profile meetings that the president will have throughout this week. He will be meeting with the U.N. secretary general today, also the leaders of five central Asian nations where the conversation will focus on how to counter China in that region before meeting with Brazil's president and the prime minister of Israel tomorrow. But just as much focus, guys, is going to be on who is not here in New York, namely, the leaders of China, Russia, U.K., and France, the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which is the forum, where the U.S. has been condemning the war in Ukraine for nearly two years at this point. And so it raises real questions about the effectiveness of the U.N., and specifically the Security Council as a forum for condemnation and to discuss these critical issues. Senior administration officials say it remains essential and important and, in their words, the president understands the value of showing up. And that's what he is going to do today in hopes of boosting his global agenda and also his image here at home. Poppy, Phil?",

And I take full responsibility for the leadership of my party because I truly believe if we don't stand up and fight for the people, there is no one left there. So I never vote for leadership in other party. I never supported it. But the leadership of my party should be accountable to the American people, and we should never be in a situation like that at the end of September, not be able to deal with authorization, with budgeting. This is the number one issue that Congress should have dealt for most of their time. And unfortunately, we spend very little time dealing with our main functions, and everyone does a lot of entertainment. But we have people's lives at stake, and we cannot do politics and circuses. And I call on leadership to take full responsibility, and should take responsibility for his failure to lead on this. And I offered my -- listen this is my issue that I actually have expertise.
