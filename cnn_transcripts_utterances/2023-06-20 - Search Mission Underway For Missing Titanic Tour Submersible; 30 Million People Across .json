      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead on CNN Newsroom, a race against time, rescuers work desperately to track down a civilian sub that went missing during a voyage to the Titanic wreckage.High winds, hail and tornadoes rip across the southern United States with more storms in the forecast on Tuesday, and the U.S. and China trying to get their relationship back on track in Beijing, but fall short of at least one key goal. And we begin with a search and rescue mission happening right now in the North Atlantic Ocean for a missing submersible, carrying five people to see the wreckage of the Titanic. The sub belongs to the commercial underwater exploration company OceanGate, which lost contact with a vessel an hour and 45 minutes into its descent on Sunday. According to an archived version of OceanGate's website, the Titan submersible has room for five people, a pilot, a content expert and three paying passengers. Now one of the people on board the sub for this expedition is Hamish Harding, the founder and chair of Action Aviation. In an Instagram post on Saturday, he said this mission would likely be the only manned mission to the Titanic this year, and that there were a lot of preparations to do before the dive. More now on the search from CNN's Paula Newton. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The U.S. Coast Guard is taking the lead on the search and rescue mission. And they confirm in fact that this is a very challenging mission. The reason is that they say this area in the North Atlantic is very remote if you can imagine, not only do they have to search such a large area and perhaps challenging weather we do know now that fog has rolled in. But the fact that they have to search perhaps an area of the seabed as far as nearly two and a half miles down. That is where the Titanic wreck is. And that is when presumably they lost contact with this submersible. It's only 21 feet long. And so this will continue to be a challenge as the hours roll on here. I want you to listen now to the U.S. Coast Guard. REAR ADM. JOHN MAUGER, COMMANDER, U.S. COAST GUARD FIRST DISTRICT: To make sure that we're looking on both the surface using aerial and surface vessels, but then expanding into underwater search as well. Right now our capability is limited to sonar buoys and listening for sounds. But you know, we're working very hard to increase the capability.",

They continue to ask for more resources to go to the region. The Canadian Armed Forces tells me that they will continue to cycle fixed wing aircraft through that area in order to help with the search but they're also calling on commercial vessels to go to the area as they continue to try and locate the submersible really when they lost contact with it on Sunday afternoon.They still have had zero communication and therefore it makes it much more difficult to even pinpoint a search location.

He will however, be stripped of his access to the Palace of Westminster.

      "sentences": "What was supposed to be an arrest operation to arrest two wanted suspects by Israeli forces turned into a much bigger situation that turned actually into an 11- hour operation that is taking place in Jenin in the occupied West Bank, which has long been a flash point (INAUDIBLE) for both militant activity and Israeli military raids.But what happened showed new tactics and different levels of force than we have seen here in recent months in the two years or so since we have seen escalating levels of violence. Now, the militants we saw then using a very powerful IED, a roadside bombs that exploded while a convoy of Israeli military vehicles were going through, the Israeli military one of their Panther command vehicles was hit by this roadside bomb. We see some rather dramatic video of that explosion taking place, and the Israeli military saying it essentially took out the underside of this Panther command vehicle and some of the Israeli forces who were injured were in that vehicle. In fact, five other Israeli military vehicles were rendered inoperable as a result of the heavy fire fights. And it took several hours to extract some Israeli soldiers out of Jenin. Now, while the Israeli military was trying to extract some of the injuries and some of the soldiers out of the situation, they used something -- Israeli military used something that has not been seen since the days of the Second Intifada, since the early 2000s. And that is the use of an Apache helicopter firing over Jenin to provide cover for the soldiers as they're trying to leave. The Israeli military saying they fired towards open areas as far as we understand there had been no injuries specifically ascribed to the helicopter firing. But to see the use of an Apache helicopter over a dense urban area, again this is not something that we have seen in decades. Now, five Palestinians were killed as a result of this operation, three of them have been claimed by the Islamic Jihad militant group as their members. 90 others were injured as a result of these fierce clashes, but among the dead we do know is a 15 year old boy and among the injured is a freelancer photojournalist who was covering the raid as it happened.
