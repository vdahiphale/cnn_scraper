I'm Laila Harrak.Millions of people at risk from heat in the United States and much of Europe. What you need to watch out for to stay safe during dangerous heat waves. Deadly floods in South Korea and the race to find survivors who may have been trapped after an underpass flooded. We will have a live report from the region. And a massive manhunt leads to the recapture of an escaped inmate in the state of Pennsylvania. We begin this hour with millions of people sweltering under oppressive heat waves in Europe and the United States. Millions are under heat alerts in the United States from Florida to the Pacific Northwest. Death Valley, California could top 130 degrees Fahrenheit later today. That is about 54 degrees Celsius. Right now at midnight in Phoenix, it is 105 degrees. The hottest temperatures ever recorded in Europe could happen in Sicily and Sardinia, potentially reaching a scorching 118 degrees Fahrenheit. That is 48 degrees Celsius. On Saturday, Greece shut the famed Acropolis in Athens for a second straight day because of the heat. And authorities in Spain say the heat wave is affecting the country's typically cooler north, not just areas in south. Well, temperatures worse, especially in the southwest U.S. CNN's Rafael Romo has more on the story from Las Vegas.",

More than 85 million people are under heat alerts from the National Weather Service and at least 15 states from Florida to California. Phoenix has topped 110 degrees for 14 consecutive days and is forecast to make that at least 19 by Tuesday, which will be the longest stretch in that city's history.

And if it is not the case, if you do not want to live in such a world, you need to be putting pressure on your elected officials and making sure that they have a plan to ramp down fossil fuel use as well as to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for the harms it has caused after decades of climate obstruction and deception.",

He has, of course, been defense secretary for the last four years, a consistent figure in a time of real turmoil for the conservative party and leadership over the last couple of years. But, of course, his profile has really risen significantly over the course of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He has been a leading figure in terms of the U.K.'s engagement in that war and its support of the Ukrainian armed forces on the military front.So, this certainly is a significant development in terms of the British government's makeup. We understand that he will leave government in the next cabinet reshuffle, which is anticipated to take place in the next few months. And he will step down as a member of parliament for the next national election, leaving British politics. But, of course, this comes at an interesting timing as well. We know that Ben Wallace has spoken before about his ambitions, potentially looking at the role of NATO secretary-general. And that role is confirmed to remain now with Jens Stoltenberg.

The man's name, Michael Burham, he was recaptured without incidents in a wooded area in Warren County, Pennsylvania. The 34-year-old former reservist and survivalist was also a prime suspect in a New York homicide case as well as a related arson case in Western New York.It was back on July 6th that Burham reportedly used a rope fashioned from bedding to escape out a window in the recreation room at the facility that he was being held in, in Northwestern Pennsylvani. During the search for the last few days, search almost conducted by hundreds of states, local, federal officers, they were able to locate some campsites in various stockpiles that they believe were directly linked to Burham. However, then Saturday came. I want you to hear directly from Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens describing how a private citizen managed to call in a tip that led to the arrest of this runaway inmate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  He was being pursued by the officers along with canines. New York State Police had a bloodhound and Customs and Border Patrol had a certain patrol dog immediately behind the bloodhound. And so he was being tracked and pushed by a line of tactical members.

Former President and current Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump spoke at a conservative conference in Florida Saturday night. He enlisted many familiar grievances and took aim at his closest Republican rival, State Governor Ron DeSantis. CNN's Kristen Holmes was there and has this report. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  After missing events in Iowa earlier in the week, former President Trump delivered nearly two hours of remarks to a packed house at this Turning Point event in West Palm Beach, Florida. He aired a lot of grievances, talked about many of his legal battles, his legal struggles, as well as talked about his vision for 2024, talking about how he wanted to obliterate the deep state. Now, when it came to his opponents, other candidates in 2024, there was one person who obviously he really hit over and over again despite not turning up at other events in Iowa with many of these candidates. He hit Ron DeSantis for not being here at this Turning Point event. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  And a gentle man named Ron DeSanctimonious at 14 percent. Is it 14 percent? And I don't know why he is not here this couple of days, but he should be here. He should be here representing himself. (END VIDEO CLIP) K. HOLMES:  Now, the crowd at the Turning Point event was very Trump- friendly. It was interesting that DeSantis was not here. We're not entirely sure why he did not show. But there were a number of candidates here likely because this is a very Trump-friendly crowd, a group of people who are here to see the former president. But, again, it is very interesting to see him in his element getting cheered on when we know he is in the middle of so many different various legal battles.
