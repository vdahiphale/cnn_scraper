HERTLINGBut in fact, what we're seeing right now in Congress is just the opposite. Where there is an increasing number of relatively small number of Representatives in our Congress, who are saying let's not give aid to these people who, in effect, as I just said, are being murdered, who are being executed and are targeted by Russian military when they're civilians.",

That months after he left the White House, former President Donald Trump allegedly shared sensitive information about U.S. nuclear Subs with an Australian billionaire at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Allegedly the former president, sharing details like how many warheads are typically on these submarines and how close they can get to Russian submarines without being detected. What are the implications of that kind of information being out there?",

And the president when they're in office certainly need to know a lot of things in order to help them make decisions. But when you're out of office and sharing this kind of information, which I would, you know, suspect, is it given it's a nuclear submarine, is at the highest level of classification, top secret, and perhaps even some code word kind of information.Sharing that just haphazardly at the resort at Mar-a-Lago or perhaps even other information that one of his golf courses to civilians that don't have a need to know is extremely dangerous. Puts our country at risk and also puts certainly those members that are serving in the submarine force at risk. Because it's basically giving away information that they like to keep secret and is required for their operations. So to me it's just another indicator that there is a lack of security in the in the past administration in terms of dealing with our nation's secrets. And that's extremely dangerous.",

The accident happened before they were married and is mentioned in the federal bribery indictment against them -- that car was. CNN has obtained surveillance footage from the crash in which a pedestrian was struck and killed. Police questioned Nadine Menendez at the scene and concluded she was not at fault, though she was not tested for drugs or alcohol. CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller is here with us, with more. So, John, what more do we know about this new inquiry from the New Jersey AG and what will investigators be looking for?",

That's important because as the individual, Mr. Koop, is being struck by the car and he falls off the car, the car sits there for a full minute, stock still. Nadine Arslanian doesn't get out of the car. After a minute, the car goes about 100 feet forward and pulls over to the side. There is no apparent effort to get out of the car to check on the man who's down in the street to see if he's OK or if he can talk.So the questions we had is, was she using the phone at the time of the accident? Texting, looking at something on the screen, talking to someone? Second question, did she use that phone to call 911 after the accident? Or did that call come from someone else? Third question was did she use that phone to call anyone else up to, including her boyfriend at the time, Senator Menendez, to ask what to do. All of those questions were in our list for the prosecutor's office, and they basically said submit a records request -- which is ironic because at the same time we were asking for those records, members of the state Attorney General's office were there seizing all the records from the prosecutor's office and the Sheriff's Department regarding this accident so they can review it. So there's a little bit of a circling of the wagons here and some kind of probe beginning to unfold into how all that went that night and in the days after.",

Into CNN, sources tell my colleague Melanie Zanona and me that former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is expected to step down from Congress before the end of his term. We're going to go first to her report, let's get back to Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. So Melanie, we're both hearing that McCarthy plans to stick around through the vote for the speakership, right? But then his future in the House is uncertain, right?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right. And in talking to sources who are close to Kevin McCarthy, they are expecting him to leave before the end of his term. This is something that he has been toying with. And he even said in a closed-door conference meeting after he was removed as speaker that he wants to go home and spend time with his family.But he does want to stick around at least through the rest of this speakership election. He really wants to make sure that the conference, which has been so chaotic over the last few days especially, is calm and steady before he leaves. Now he doesn't plan to get involved in the speakers race. We're told he's not expected to endorse any candidate, but he does want to be around to really see this through. And keep in mind, this is a huge seismic shift for the party. Kevin McCarthy came to Congress in 2007. He was a state lawmaker in California before that. He has spent his entire adult career in politics. He came to Congress. He worked his way through the leadership ranks. He's held multiple leadership roles over the years. And he tried to become speaker back in 2015. And at that time, the House Freedom Caucus denied him the gavel, but he kept fighting. He eventually became the leader of his party. And when they took the majority last year, you remember that January vote. It took him 15 rounds to become speaker, and he did finally get there. But Kevin McCarthy says he has no regrets about how he acted during speaker. Whether it was the bipartisan debt ceiling deal that we saw earlier this summer or his decision, his consequential decision on Saturday to put a stopgap funding bill on the floor to fund the government, which ultimately led to his ouster earlier this week. But again, just so much uncertainty in the Republican Party because we still don't know who is going to replace Kevin McCarthy. At the moment we have an acting speaker and interim speaker. That's Patrick McHenry of North Carolina. But two men are vying to replace Kevin McCarthy. That is Jim Jordan of the House Judiciary Chair and Steve Scalise, the number two Republican who has also been in leadership right behind Kevin McCarthy for many, many years. So we're going to have to see how this all plays out next week. But as of right now, it looks like Kevin McCarthy might not be sticking around in Congress, though he could still be involved politically as someone who is, he has strong fundraiser and someone who's very plugged in to Republican politics -- Pam.",

I mean we did see Nancy Pelosi though. I think, you know, she was former speaker and when she stepped down, she decided to stay in Congress. So not entirely out of the realm of possibility for Kevin McCarthy. But at this point, the expectation is he will resign from Congress at some point.",
