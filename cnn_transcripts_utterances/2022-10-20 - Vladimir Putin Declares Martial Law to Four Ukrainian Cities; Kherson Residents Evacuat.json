It doesn't really change much on the day-to- day for the people living there.They are already living in a war zone and many of the rules that are enshrined in Russia's law on martial law are already in place. We know that Ukraine has accused Russia, for example, of already mobilizing Ukrainian citizens in these territories. We know that civilians are being moved. Ukraine says sometimes against their will. Seizure of property, things like that all are happening. So, while this is a sort of move by Putin to try to do through what he sees as legal means, what he can't do military, it doesn't change life really for the people living there. I think, perhaps more impactful is what is happening in Russia. The announcement of what looks like a martial law light in those regions bordering Ukraine. Freedom of movement restricted, things like that. That is essentially amounting to the slow creep of authoritarianism accelerating. We've seen repression on things like free speech, free media mounting throughout this conflict in Russia, this likely to accelerate that. And very concerning to Russians because of course the decree on martial law leaves itself open to potential expansion in the future, Rosemary.",

      "sentences": "You know, Rosemary, yesterday when the day began, we figured that prime minister's questions and questions from the opposition and from her own party would certainly be the main event and the main test of Liz Truss's control of her own government. But then the drama just kept on coming.Shortly after that performance and prime minister's questions, Liz Truss faced the resignation of her home secretary, one of the main cabinet offices in this country. And Suella Braverman as you mentioned ostensibly, this was over an e-mail issue, a rather minor issue it seems like, but she also took a swipe at Liz Truss's government on the way out, questioning its commitments to campaign promises like the one to lower the overall rate of immigration. And then she took, took another, you called it thinly veiled. It seems not veiled at all to me, swipe at Liz Truss. Saying that -- I'll read you part of it. The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes, pretending we haven't made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can't see that we've made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics. I've made a mistake. I accept responsibility. I resign. Now, it's interesting to know that the replacement for Suella Braverman that was chosen, Grant Shapps is not a supporter of Liz Truss, at least he didn't support her during the leadership race. He, just like the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, supported her opponent, Rishi Sunak who comes from the more moderate wing of the party. But the chaos didn't even end there. You also had literally chaotic scenes playing out inside of parliament. I should mention voting in this country takes place, it's called division. M.P.s actually go into separate lobbies if they want to vote for or against a piece of legislation. And yesterday, there was a piece of labor legislation on keeping in place the nationwide ban on fracking. And there were plenty of conservative M.P.s who reportedly would've liked to vote with the opposition Labour Party. They were told by their own government though, that they needed to vote with the government or risk being booted out from the party. And so, the scenes that played out outside of the no lobby, as they call it, were pretty remarkable. Here's how one Labour M.P. describe them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS BRYANT, BRITISH LABOUR PARTY M.P.:  Madame Deputy Speaker, I -- I would urge you to launch an investigation into the scenes outside the entrance to the no lobby earlier.

And now we're learning through the British Press Association that Downing Street says that those M.P.'s will be spoken by the whips, the M.P.s who ensure that everyone votes with the government.

I think the problem she has right now is a deeper one, is that in her desperate push to still have a growth strategy in place, she looks like she's going to break some manifesto commitments and she'll be making -- breaking these manifesto commitments without having been elected herself by the people, if you want to put it that way, to be a prime minister. And in particular, if I can mention this one, the reason Suella Braverman issue became so toxic was the desire to raise immigration, raise levels of immigration in the U.K. to try to spur growth. This was precisely what Brexit was about. Brexit was so that the U.K. could reduce levels of immigration and not -- do a race to the bottom in the pursuit of fake growth.

According to the Israeli defense forces, these settlers had come towards a Palestinian town, started throwing rocks at Palestinian cars, and when the Israeli soldiers came to break that up to stop them from doing it, they were attacked themselves there. And in another incident, they were also pepper sprayed by these Israeli settlers.
