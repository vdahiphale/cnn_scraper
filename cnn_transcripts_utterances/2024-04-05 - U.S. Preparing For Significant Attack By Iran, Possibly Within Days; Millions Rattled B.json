We're getting new information about the very high alert.Also tonight, the northeast is rattled by a rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake. We're tracking the quake threat in New York City and beyond as millions who felt the tremors are now bracing for aftershocks. And it's a historic night for college basketball. The women's Final Four is generating unprecedented excitement fueled by record breaking Iowa Superstar Caitlin Clark. NBA Legend Charles Barkley will give us his take on this sport's phenomena. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get right to the breaking news, the United States now actively planning for a potentially imminent revenge attack by Iran in the region. Let's go to our Senior White House Correspondent M.J. Lee. M.J., what are you learning? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, we are alerting tonight that the U.S. is on high alert and actively planning for what could be a significant attack by Iran that could come as soon as within the next week. We are told that this Iranian attack, of course, would be in response to the Israeli airstrike that happened in Damascus and ended up killing several top Iranian officials. U.S. and Israeli officials, we are told, believe that this attack by Iran is inevitable. And the two governments, we are told, have been working furiously together to prepare for what could be to come. They believe this attack could come in multiple forms, but at this moment, they do not know exactly how that attack will unfold, but that U.S. and Israeli assets both are at risk of being targeted. Now, a direct attack on Israel, Wolf, would, of course, be one of the worst-case scenarios, given that it is guaranteed to rapidly de- escalate what is already a tumultuous situation in the region, and it could end up with the Israel-Hamas War spilling out into a broader regional conflict, which is something that the Biden administration has very much wanted to avoid. We are also learning tonight that the U.S. has directly communicated to Iran, warning the country from targeting and attacking U.S. personnel and U.S. assets. Now, as you'll recall, this is an issue that came up between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when the two leaders spoke yesterday. That phone call, of course, was prompted by the deaths of those seven aid workers. And Prime Minister Netanyahu in this phone call, of course, promising President Biden that there are going to be improvements to ensure that that kind of tragedy doesn't happen again. Wolf?",

And they are not going to comfortably feel like they can do what they need to do to protect suffering people based on an investigation of an IDF attack that killed aid workers done by the IDF. So, there needs to be an international and independent investigation.

Some are connected with the U.N., some are connected with NGOs that are U.S.-based, but some are from other countries. And we need to rely on all of them because the innocent Gazans who are not part of Hamas, who are suffering, need a lot of people trying to help them out.And that's why I think the right thing to do is to do what Jose Andres said, which is to have an independent and international investigation with representatives from the different countries that are connected to the aid groups that are performing. So, I don't think this is just a U.S.-only effort because I'm not sure that would have the credibility it needs.

Mitch, thanks very much for joining us. As you know, despite these very, very positive signs, that recent Wall Street Journal poll of seven key battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the election showed this, voters in all seven of those states said they believe Donald Trump is best able to handle the economy. So, if we're in the middle of an economic comeback here in the United States, as the president says, why do voters seem to prefer Trump on this issue of the economy?

Secondly, please don't ever let me follow Sir Charles Barkley, who is a genius and smart and knows more about basketball than anybody will ever know. And be careful about watching the Final Four because Kaitlan Collins of CNN fame, as you know, is an Alabama fan, so we'll all be watching it. Secondly, let me say this. Let's not skate over what the top line is here. President Biden took office with one of the great economic calamities in the history of the country, and in three short years, has now turned the country around and created one of the strongest economic recoveries that we've seen, 15 million jobs. As people may recall, because some people seem to have forgotten, Donald Trump lost 2.5 million jobs. As you noted, we've now had the lowest unemployment in America since 1960s, 3.8 percent. Wages have gone up, jobs have gone up. I'm in Arizona today talking about these investments and the thousands of high-paying jobs that they're creating. Listen, we've always said this was going to be a tough election. We are still some significant away from Election Day. We're going to keep pushing really, really hard to make sure people know where these jobs came from and we're going to continue to talk about it.

Second, Trump's team notes that the judge's daughter works for a Democratic consulting organization that does work for several Democratic candidates. Now, Trump originally made this motion last summer, Judge Marshawn consulted with an ethics group that told him you do not have to recuse and hence, Judge Marshawn rejected that motion. Now, Trump is reopening this motion and he's arguing that the circumstances have changed because last summer he says he was one of several Republican candidates, and now he's essentially the presumptive nominee.
