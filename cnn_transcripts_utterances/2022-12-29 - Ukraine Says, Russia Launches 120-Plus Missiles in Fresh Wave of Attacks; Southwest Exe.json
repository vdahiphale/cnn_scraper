And if there really aren't significant audit notes or work files, that also could suggest that the IRS wasn't really looking that closely at former President Trump's tax returns. So, that's significant as well. We know a little bit of information about what is in the tax returns, and that is because the joint committee on taxation put out a report last week where they raised some questions. They didn't cast any judgments but they raised questions about some of the findings. And a couple of numbers stood out. Between the years of 2016 and 2017, we know that former President Trump paid just $750 in each of those years in federal income taxes. We also know that in 2020, he paid nothing. Now, in 2018 and 2019, he paid a little over a million dollars, but one of the questions that the joint committee on taxation was asking is what kind of losses was he projecting forward and were there any questions that the IRS might have had about that.
