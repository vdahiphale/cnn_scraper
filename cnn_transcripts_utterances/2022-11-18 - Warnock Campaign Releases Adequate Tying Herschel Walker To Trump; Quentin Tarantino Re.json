(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We must all work very hard for a gentleman and a great person named Herschel Walker, a fabulous human being who loves our country and will be a great United States senator. Herschel Walker. Get out and vote for Herschel, and he deserves. He was an incredible athlete. He'll be an even better senator. Get out and vote for Herschel Walker. SEN.

It is just playing Trump's endorsement of Walker.And clearly, the Warnock campaign feels this is a, as you say, an albatross. This is a liability for Walker and not applause. And the Republicans had pleaded with the former president not to announce before the December 6 runoff, because they didn't want this to be in any way a referendum on Trump. The President, of course, ignored that. And remember, Georgia is a state where the Governor Brian Kemp was just elected after in the Republican primary beating a Trump election denier, and Brad Raffensperger, the Secretary of State was just elected, after the Republican primary beating a Trump election denier. So clearly, the Democrats think that Donald Trump is a liability in Georgia, not applause.",
