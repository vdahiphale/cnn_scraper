The final edits are being made in Kamala Harris's speech of a lifetime. Tonight, the vice president officially accepts the Democratic Party's nomination for president, making history as the first Black woman and first Asian-American at the top of a major ticket. It will likely be her biggest audience ever. The political stakes are certainly high. Harris is surging in polls, closing the gap and even in some cases, running ahead former President Donald Trump, just three weeks after assuming leadership of her party, but still a lot of Americans don't know Harris very well. This will be her chance to sell her story and her political vision. Last night, her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, frame the race through his own life story coaching high school football. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's the fourth quarter. We're down a field goal, but we're on offense and we've got the ball. We're driving down the field. And boy, do we have the right team. We got 76 days. That's nothing. There'll be time to sleep when you're dead. We're going to leave it on the field. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)",

A poll out this week showed a third of voters don't know what she stands for. So I wonder, knowing what she has done for these last several years, how do you think she does that tonight? SHAFER:  Well, she really wants to fill in a lot of the blanks that are left and do it to before the Republicans do, of course. I think she's going to lean into her family history. You know, both of her parents were immigrants. Her mom came to California from India when she was a young woman. Their dad came from Jamaica. They are both researchers. Her mom was a cancer researcher. She was very close to her mother. Her parents split up when she was about seven. But I think well hear her talk about her values, what she learned going up the up the ladder of politics. You know, when she first ran for district attorney in San Francisco, she ran is not as a liberal, but as the moderate candidate. She knocked off a more liberal district attorney. And so, she's always been very passionate about issues, especially those involving justice, civil rights, kids, young women, especially women being trafficked, that kind of thing. But she's also very pragmatic. She's not somebody who's going to stake out a very far left position. She didn't do that in the Senate. She didn't do it as attorney general and I doubt were going to hear her talking about that tonight. She'll be I think leaning into things that are kind of kitchen table issues. We've heard a little bit of this week, bringing down the cost of prescription drugs, child credits, childcare credits that will make life a little easier for working parents, that sort of thing. But I think that really she needs to make that, you know, fill in the biography because as you said, a lot of people really don't know who she is.",

Kamala Harris has a blended family, as do many Americans with her husband, Doug Emhoff, two step kids. There were huge emotional moments with Tim Walz's family last night, that moment with his son mouthing, shouting, \"I love you, dad\", really electrified the audience there.

I'm sure her sister, Maya, and her husband, Tony West, who has in the Obama Justice Department, will be there as well.And so, I think that is really very much part of her story.

Today, he's in Arizona seeking to highlight one of his campaign's key issues and that is border security. CNN's Kristen Holmes, she is there and she joins me. Kristen, when you look at him down at the border, for instance since encounters at the border are down from their peak, I wonder how he is attempting to message the border in light of that and wonder as they watch the DNC and certainly Trump himself, very conscious of television ratings. These ratings are better than his convention. Is he worried?",

He's going to link immigration to crime. He's going to say that people crossing the border are committing crimes. And obviously as we know and as we have reported, while there have been some high profile crimes, I people who have come into the country illegally, that is by no means than the norm. But Donald Trump is obviously going to try and do whatever he can to make immigration as an issue. And it is an issue for so many voters and he's going to continue to talk about that today when he takes the stage or when he takes this podium behind me, I'm not sure what you can actually see behind me. We're kind of far from where he is. He's just doing a tour of the border. But remember, this is exactly where Donald Trump feels the most in his element because he believes he is stronger on immigration and polling had shown that he was strong on immigration when it comes to President Joe Biden. They believe they can make that same case for Kamala Harris. That, of course, remains to be seen as this race really progresses. Now, in terms of ratings, of course, Donald Trump is paying attention, and he's also watching the DNC. We know most of his events have been wrapping. He's been on the plane while he's been heading home back to Mar-a-Lago while some of these speeches are ramping up, they've had the coverage on the plane. He has been shown clips of various speeches and he's reacted already. Yesterday, he was talking about the Obamas speech going after them. Then he did a separate interview after that and continued to rail against the Obamas. You're going to continue to see that because he does not like when people are talking negatively about him and that's what we've seen a lot of at the DNC. Now, when you hear going in to the DNC that he was going to be watching the ratings. Of course he is. We'll have to just see now because we talked to his campaign. They believe that this is the end of Kamala Harris's bounce, that this is -- she's going to see a little bit more energy after this. And then the race is really going to shake out. But, Jim, you know, we've talked about this a lot. We're really an unprecedented times what actually happens in the next few months remains unknown where the voters land, where Kamala Harris lands, what this race actually look like. We are all still trying to figure that out. And that includes Donald Trump's team.",

Now, in terms of the disagreement between Netanyahu and Biden, like you said, nothing new. We've seen that for, but it comes at such a critical stage right now where the U.S. and Israel, you know, we saw Blinken earlier in the week, say that Israel had agreed to this bridging proposal and, then last night it sounds like Biden needed to get on the phone with Netanyahu and say, hey, we need more.

But they have been clear, they want to see a deal that reflects the proposal put forward by Biden in late May, a deal which they say they agree to in early July. So they are continuing to work with mediators on that, but they have accused the U.S. government of in their words, vowing and forming two Israeli demanded of accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are putting forward new conditions, new demands. They say are designed to store these ongoing negotiations, conditions which in the eyes of Hamas are not acceptable.

Russia says it repelled this attack, but we do also know that there was cross attacks into Russia via drone, a military airfield in Volgograd was struck by Ukrainian drones.

China's thinking about this saying, well, maybe Taiwan is not going to be that easy. These Ukrainians have a lot of fight. It also has an impact on the United States.

When they do, I think things change in the region. So maybe for Israel's military purposes, maybe there are some who would say, let's finish off Hezbollah right now. Let's go after Iran right now. And so, this would be a political decision inside the Israeli government.
