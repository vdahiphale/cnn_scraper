      "sentences": "It is just past 9 PM, here in New York.Today, the defense, in the former President's hush money trial exploded the tightly-crafted narrative of the prosecution, and scored a hit against a key witness, whose credibility has been an issue from the start, Michael Cohen. We were -- a lot of us were sitting in the courtroom, along with a room full of people who were watching the cross-examination very closely. It turned into a methodical dissection of Cohen, by defense attorney, Todd Blanche. Blanche presented text messages, between Cohen, and Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, from October 24th, 2016. Now, on Monday, Cohen had characterized these exchanges with Schiller, as a way to just to get to then-candidate Trump, to get Trump on the phone, and get final approval for the Stormy Daniels payment scheme. Instead, the texts do not speak of that. Rather, they show that Cohen wanted Schiller's help with a 14-year-old prank-caller, who had apparently been antagonizing Michael -- Cohen for days. A short time ago, Cohen's texts with the 14-year-old were shown -- that were shown in court were released. Cohen texts, this number has just been sent to Secret Service for your ongoing and continuous harassment to both my cell as well as to the organization's main line. The person then responds, it wasn't me. My friend told me to call. I'm sorry for this. I won't do it again. Cohen then replies, you will need to explain this to Secret Service as we have been receiving dozens of these harassing calls over the past three days. If you are a minor, I suggest you notify your parent or guardian. The person responds in all caps. I DIDN'T DO IT. And then texts I'm 14. Why it is -- so bizarre. I mean. Sorry. We're joined now by former federal -- former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. And Michael Cohen's former attorney and current legal adviser, Lanny Davis. So Lanny, were you -- were you surprised the defense appeared effective in undermining Cohen's credibility, about that phone call to Keith Schiller? I mean, when he testified, earlier in the week, that call was portrayed as it was a call to Keith Schiller, to get to Trump. There was no mention of this 14-year-old, and wanting to talk to Keith Schiller, to trace the number, and figure out some way to get back at this person. LANNY J. DAVIS, FORMER ATTORNEY FOR MICHAEL COHEN: So, no, I wasn't surprised. And I don't think the jury is going to be persuaded by those kinds of mistakes, who are making Michael Cohen the accused, and everybody having fun, calling him a liar on television. This case is about, as I first was introduced to it, by the prosecutors, my first day, this case is about documents, testimony and corroboration. Michael Cohen is a confirming witness. Donald Trump loves to change the subject, and his lawyers love to change the subject. They want Michael Cohen to be the one, who's indicted and accused. So let me just remind you what we've seen in evidence so far. I'm not going to speculate or downgrade a jury's focus on facts. I don't disparage juries. But I'm also not a trial lawyer. So maybe trial lawyers, who do disparage jury -- juries are correct. But I think that you have to remember, the first element of this crime was corroborated. You don't need Michael Cohen. You had David Pecker. You had Hope Hicks. Everybody knew that the money being paid to Stormy Daniels was for the campaign. It wasn't to protect him from being embarrassed, in front of his wife. That's what the testimony has been so far.",

One was $130,000, written down in his handwriting, times two, and the three categories added up $420,000 divided by 12.",

I know it doesn't go well for Michael Cohen, if he's shown to be lying. I mean, you're not -- doesn't it seem like today, at the very least, in the end of this morning session, he seemed to be caught, in the very least, a mistake in memory, about this phone call that he had just testified? Not some old lie, but this testimony from in front of this jury. Isn't that a big deal? J. DAVIS: I can't predict. I don't think jurors will find it a big deal compared to the corroborating evidence of Allen Weisselberg's document that proves that if -- I was going to say to you is $420,000 divided by 12 equals $35,000. Those are the checks that a sitting president, each month, wrote to Michael Cohen. It's the math, stupid. I was going to do a joke before, Anderson, about James Carville's, the economy, stupid. It's the math that Allen Weisselberg, that document proves these could not have been legal fees. He divided for $420,000 by 12. He came up with $35,000. And the sitting President, in the Oval Office, wrote Michael Cohen $35,000 checks.",

I wasn't with the federal prosecutors. I was with these prosecutors, right? I can't answer that question. Let me just say that the story that Keith Schiller is saying, now? Let's see if he testifies. And then, we'll see who's believable. And that's up to the jury. But I also am expecting Donald Trump to testify, because he said I would testify. He's never taken it back.

Now, they attack the narrator, they change the topic, and they make it about the narrator confirming. And of course, the drama of the case is made by Michael Cohen.

Why are these defense lawyers saying who's got a better story? It's not, who's got a better story. The prosecutors have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. If the jury decides Michael Cohen lied, they have every right to reject his testimony. This case is over. There's only two possibilities for what happened today. Michael Cohen lied, about this meeting, which seems to be a conclusion that a lot of people who were in the courtroom are drawing. Or he made a massive mistake. But you know what?

Within a few seconds, he said OK. And then Cohen says yes, sir. Blanche says the very next morning, at 7:58, you say, did you reach the family? Cohen says yes sir. Blanche says take it down. Now, here's the question here. When you testified on Tuesday that you had a specific recollection that that one minute and 36 second phone call, on October 24th was not with Keith Schiller, that you called Keith Schiller and he passed the phone to President Trump, you finalized the deal with Stormy Daniels. And you said we're going to move forward. And he said yes, because you kept him informed all the time. That was your testimony, right? Michael Cohen says that's correct. Blanche says that was a lie. You were actually talking to Mr. Schiller about the fact you were getting harassing phone calls from a 14-year- old, correct? Cohen says part of it was the 14-year-old. But I know that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time, and there was more than potentially just this. That's what I recall, based upon the documents I reviewed. It goes on. I mean, Blanche says, five minutes ago, I asked you if you remembered harassing phone calls, and you said no. And then I refreshed your recollection. It's totally fair, if you don't remember. But now your testimony is that you are testifying truthfully on Tuesday, to a one minute and 36 second phone call, and you had enough time in that one minute and 36 seconds, to update Mr. Schiller, about all the problems you're having with those harassing phone calls, and also update President Trump, on the status of the Stormy Daniels situation.

When you have a new client, you must express in a, either you call it an engagement letter or a fee agreement or a retainer agreement, the terms and scope of your representation.
