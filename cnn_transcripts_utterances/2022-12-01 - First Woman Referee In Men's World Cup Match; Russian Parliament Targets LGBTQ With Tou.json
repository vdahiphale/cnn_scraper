They were beaten by Mexico but it was enough to send Poland through on goal difference.But really a brutal evening at the office for Mexico, missing out on the round of 16 for the first time since 1978. And the fans and the federation not happy. Their coach, Tata Martino, is out of a job as of post-match last night. Plenty to look forward to here in Qatar on this Thursday, though. Second-rank side in the world -- Belgium -- no. They have to win against Croatia if they want any hope of making it through. Twenty-ten winner Spain -- they need just a point in their encounter. And a real crunch match for 4-time winners Germany if they want to avoid the same humiliation they faced in Russia four years ago going out at this stage. They take on Costa Rica. And a really spicey one that -- who will be the first female referee to take charge of a game at the men's World Cup -- Stephanie Frappart. She is used to leading the way as a female referee. She was the first female to take charge of a men's game in the league and the first female referee to take charge of a UEFA Champions League game.

It means it's up 20 percent from its 52-week low. As we turn the page on a new month, stocks finished November higher again. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 gaining about five percent in November. The Nasdaq up more than four percent. Still on track though, guys, for the first down year since 2018 and the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 since 2008. Gas prices, though, falling overnight. That's a relief for consumers -- $3.47 a gallon. And jobless claims numbers are due out later today. All right, 24 shopping days until Christmas.

Televisions are even down 17 percent from last year. Computers down three percent.I think what's really interesting about this time of year is that it's so different from the last holiday season where supply shortages, supply bottlenecks were really feared to be what would keep Americans from celebrating the holidays.

We'll say that.Back in September, the college football playoff board of managers voted to begin the expanded 12-team playoffs starting in 2026 when a new T.V. deal would be in place. But they'd hoped to start it in 2024 and to do that they would need approval from the quote \"New Year's six bowl games that would host those playoff games.\" The only holdout was the Rose Bowl, which had requested the game be played at its traditional time slot of 5:00 p.m. eastern on New Year's Day, even if it had an impact on the playoff schedule. But ESPN reported yesterday, citing an unnamed source, that the Rose Bowl finally relented and agreed to be part of the playoff format without any special favors. The plan is to begin an expanded playoff in 2024 to be finalized in the coming days, several outlets have reported. Here is what a 12-team playoff would look like if it were being held this year. Georgia, Michigan, TCU, and USC would all have byes. Washington would be the 12th and final team in. They would face Ohio State in the first round. Very interesting. All right, Celtics-Heat. These highlights are not royalty-free. Prince William and Princess Kate sitting courtside in Boston. Jayson Tatum says put up your dukes, taking it to the Heat. The Celtics' 24-year-old crowned jewel goes supernova from the get-go -- 12 points in the first three minutes and three 3-pointers. In the second half, he's still hot. Third quarter, draining another three. He becomes the first player in NBA history in this game to have multiple games with at least eight 3-pointers, 45 points overall, and 10 rebounds. The royal couple royally enthused. The Celtics win by 13. Devin Booker, of the Suns, was hotter than one. He beat the Bulls so bad it was like they were talking bad about his mama. He went 20 for 25 from the field last night, scoring 51 points -- and he didn't even play, Christine, in the fourth quarter. Fans in Phoenix started chanting \"MVP\" and for good reason. Booker's average career-highs in points and rebounds. Phoenix wins 132-113. Russell Westbrook, meanwhile, putting on a show for the hometown Lakers fans in their win over the Blazers. Not only did he drain a buzzer-beating 3-pointer just before the half, he comes out, Christine, in the second half and says that was so nice let's do it twice -- this time from half-court. He beat the buzzer in the third. Westbrook scoring just 10 points but they were fun ones -- half of them coming with zeroes on the clock. But what tops a player beating a buzzer from half-court? I'll tell you what -- a fan hitting a half-court shot, especially when that shot is worth $25,000. Oh my goodness. You remember Monday, Christine, another Lakers fan had hit a half-court shot worth 75 grand. They have something going on really nice there in that arena.",
