The countdown is underway for a pivotal moment in the 2024 presidential election. We are four days away from the CNN presidential debate, the first between President Biden and former President Trump of the 2024 race. And the two candidates are preparing for this high- stakes event in very different ways, we're told. President Biden hunkering down at Camp David all weekend reportedly holding intensive prep work and mock debates with a team of advisers. Donald Trump has spent the weekend on the campaign trail and says he has decided on his VP pick, and that person will join him at Thursday's debate, he says. Today, Trump's supporters hit the Sunday political talk shows to give their advice on what he should focus on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: It'll be a great opportunity for President Trump to talk about his policies and how his policies when he served as president of this country were good for every single family that lived here. They had more money in their pockets. The grocery prices were down, gas prices were down. There was a lot more opportunities. You know, I don't think that he has to talk about -- get personal in this debate at all because he's going to have so many good things to talk about in contrast with Joe Biden's policies. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAMEROTA: President Biden's allies are also dropping hints about what to expect from the president at the debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS COONS (R-DE): As folks look about who's better positioned to keep us safe going forward, I hope folks won't overlook that former President Trump incited a riot at the Capitol on January 6th, or law enforcement officers to protect all of us in the Capitol every day were assaulted and he is a convicted felon. I think that stands in sharp contrast to President Biden's defense of the rule of law and the agenda he's putting forward to strengthen our law enforcement and our border security. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The key targets seems to have been religious sites.Russian official sources are talking about a synagogue and a church in the city of Derbent being attacked. And we're hearing about a shootout at a church in Makhachkala, where according to Russian state media, quoting the Dagestani Interior Ministry 19 people who had been taking shelter in that church are now safe. The Israeli Foreign Ministry has also put out a statement saying that two synagogues were involved, one in each city. So the situation right now extremely fluid. There are videos and accounts coming through on the social media channel of Dagestani Interior Ministry showing that fighting on the streets of both cities is still ongoing. A major police operation. The death and injury toll has been updated by the muftiate, this is the religious Islamic administrative organization in Dagestan. They're now saying that nine have been killed of which seven law enforcement officers. But we believe the other was a priest at a church in Derbent who, according to the public monitoring commission there, he had his throat slit. So some gruesome details coming through that.

And the thing that you really need to remember is that the Hajj is almost entirely outdoors in some very open areas in the desert. There's not a lot of trees or shade or anything like that. It's also quite physical. It involves a substantial amount of walking between the various sites that these pilgrims are expected to go to. And the pilgrims that we spoke to also described what seemed like a bit of a two-tier system. On the one hand, you had the officially registered Hajj pilgrims, who had a proper Hajj visa. They had proper air-conditioned accommodation and some transportation options as well. And then, you had this unofficial unregistered group of people who may have come on a tourist visa or business visa. They didn't maybe have transportation between the sites and didn't have air-conditioned accommodation. And so, some of them were even setting up these sort of make-shift tent camps to find or make any shade that they -- that they could. And the Saudi government says that 83 percent of those who died at this year's Hajj were in that category, in this unauthorized category. And so, you -- as you pointed out, the Egyptians, also the Jordanians, are trying to crack down, or at least investigate these companies who facilitated this unauthorized travel. We also heard yesterday from an American couple from Maryland. Their daughter says that they spent more than $20,000 to go to the Hajj. Only to get there and find out that the tour company that they had paid didn't have all the proper transportation that they needed. And so, on the day that they died, they said that they waited several hours for transportation that never came. They ended up walking and that's when they went missing and were later confirmed to be dead. And then, to add insult to injury, Alisyn, well, their daughter says that they had requested the Saudi government hold the bodies, so that they could at least go and say goodbye and identify their parents. And it turns out, though, the bodies had already been buried and they don't know where -- Alisyn.",

The rise in antisemitism and Biden's decision to send fewer weapons to Israel could impact how Jewish voters turn out this November.Joining me now is CNN Reporter Isaac Dovere. So, Isaac, what are the warning signs? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN REPORTER: Well, look, Alisyn, there are -- there's a lot of frustration all across the spectrum for where things are with the situation in Israel and Gaza and Joe Biden's handling of it. There's also a lot of pain and frustration with what is a clear rise in antisemitic incidents. And for Jewish voters around the country, it's not just a question of Israel or where they are on that. It's question of what they're seeing pop up on the right and on the left. This spike in antisemitism and spike in antisemitic rhetoric, it's making them feel very uncomfortable. [16:50:00]",
