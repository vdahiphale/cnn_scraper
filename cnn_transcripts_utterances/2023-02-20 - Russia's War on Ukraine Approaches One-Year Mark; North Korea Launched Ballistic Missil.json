It comes 11 months after we saw President Biden in Poland giving that major speech where he said, I think, for God's sake, cannot stay in power, which was met with some controversy, of course, in Russia.But this is about the transatlantic alliance, reaffirming the sort of commitment to Ukraine and in particular the U.S. leadership, which is not just about messaging, it is material. We have seen the impact of Germany having to be pressured to send tanks and would only do so when the U.S. did the same. So, the U.S. is by far the biggest donor in absolute terms, continues to be. I think its position there is also a catalyst for other donors. So, that is important to Ukraine right now when it wants more support and it wants it really quickly. I think there is regional issue as well. We've had a lot of talk about Moldova. President Zelenskyy is saying he doesn't think Ukraine will be Russia's last stop. And it is interesting that Biden will also be meeting with the Bucharest Nine, which are the NATO countries along the eastern flank of NATO, along Russia's border, really sort of showing NATO and U.S. commitment to defense -- to the defensive posture there. I think as for Russia, this will be met with more of the same rhetoric that we've seen, that they believe they are now fighting a war against the U.S. and NATO and use this as evidence, as they say, of U.S. involvement.",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, first of all, China just formerly and very strongly pushed back on Blinken's public assertion and with the foreign ministry officials saying that China does not accept the U.S. finger-pointing and coercion on this issue because they try to turn the tables on the U.S., saying it is the U.S. that has been sending weapons to the war and throwing fire -- throwing fuel to the fire and trying to profit from the war.Now, the language may sound familiar, but the timing of this back and forth is very notable because, as you mentioned, Wang Yi is visiting Moscow after that Munich trip on the eve of this anniversary, seeing senior Russian officials and likely Putin himself and paving the way, according to Russian media, for a visit by Xi Jinping in Moscow later this year. So, the U.S. is clearly increasingly frustrated with China on its role in this war despite Beijing's public pledge of -- quote, unquote -- \"neutrality.\" What has been happening in the past year or what we have seen is, of course, China and Russia going closer politically but especially economically with bilateral trade, for example, soaring to a new high. That is part of the reason why Blinken said from day one they are having a lot of concern in terms of China helping Russia mitigate or even minimize the impact of western sanctions even before the latest assessment. Now, this assessment, of course, also comes on the heel of the whole spy balloon saga and the fallout from that makes it even more difficult for China to be willing to work with the U.S. on the Ukraine issue. Now, what is interesting is Wang Yi actually met with his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich, obviously publicly saying how China respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but the reality is China state media is still refusing to call the Russian ministry campaign an invasion, not to mention Putin and Xi have talked on the phone and met in person multiple times in the past year, but Xi has yet to talk to Zelenskyy even once. So that is why advocates say despite all the public posturing, Xi Jinping is very much sticking to Putin because of the two men's very much shared resentment and hostility towards the U.S. That is also why China's assertion that it is the only peacemaker in the room just rings very hollow to many people.

It happened Saturday morning. On Sunday morning, Pyongyang said that it was an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now, these are the types that they claim can hit mainland United States, the longer range that are more of a concern to Washington.What we heard also from Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong, she gave a statement saying that they were testing and have now mastered the missile reentry technology, which they would need in order to be able to use these ICBMs correctly. Now, of course, it is very difficult to know whether or not that is the case, but this is what Pyongyang is saying. And so, on Sunday, we saw a reaction from the U.S. and South Korean air forces. They had a flyover across the Korean Peninsula with a B-1 bomber, escorted by some South Korean fighter jets, and that irritated Pyongyang. Those B-1 bombers flying near the peninsula are always likely to get a response from North Korea and that is what we saw this morning, this Monday morning, which is what North Korea said was firing of a super large multiple rocket launcher. So, we are seeing somewhat of a tit-for-tat retaliation by both sides from North Korea and then from the U.S. and South Korea. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear as though that is going to be (INAUDIBLE) any time soon because there are more military drills coming between the U.S. and South Korea which always gets a response from Pyongyang. This week at the Pentagon, there is expected to be a nuclear desktop tabletop drill between the U.S. and South Korea. Next month, there will be a bigger drill between the U.S. and South Korea militaries, the springtime exercises, which historically have solicited some kind of response from Pyongyang.",

Of course, those rescues are growing few and far between.In fact, the Turkish authorities now say that search and rescue operations are only ongoing in two out of 11 affected provinces. This is really shifting now from a rescue operation to more of a focus on the humanitarian response effort for those survivors and all of those people impacted across the southeast region of this country. Thousands and thousands of people are impacted, left homeless, many facing very difficult conditions right now. Of course, we have seen an outpouring of support from the national community and indeed from across Turkey. There have been tents set up for some of those left homeless. We've even seen families being evacuated to other parts of the country. There has been that international support. As you said there, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged further U.S. support for the Turkish response effort, $15 million to support the refugee and migration effort, another $15 million focused on the humanitarian assistance. This comes in addition to an already $85 million pledge to support both Turkey and Northwest Syria. In his press conference along his Turkish counterpart, Blinken is very clear that the U.S. government will be stand behind Turkey as long as it takes. In fact, we saw Blinken visiting some of those U.S. rescue teams who flew into Turkey to support that effort. He was clear in his message to them that this will be a long process, this could take months, if not years, for Turkey to fully recover from the devastation by the earthquake. It has to be said that this is difficult to grasp not only for the country but for the people impacted by this. Many of them have lost absolutely everything in addition to losing their loved ones. The Turkish government for its part has committed to rebuilding those affected areas within a year. This is a huge challenge, a significant feat for the Turkish government. They claim they will begin construction around 30,000 apartments in affected areas by March. This will be the first step in a long, long process. There are more than 100,000 buildings that have been destroyed or collapsed, some deemed unsafe and about to collapse, some requiring demolition process. There are still hundreds of thousands of buildings left to be assessed and evaluated. Of course, there is the question of accountability. There is a sense of frustration, sort of anger among some here in Turkey, questions as to whether the government did enough to prepare for potential earthquake of this scale, whether aid go to those in need quick enough. The government says it is carrying out investigations into the allegations of construction negligence in parts of the country. Some 400 people identified as potential suspects already. According to state media, at least 120 people were already arrested. Again, like all of this, that is going to be a long process. Of course, with elections coming up, there is a sense of backlash against President Erdogan. Secretary Blinken meeting, of course, with the Turkish president later today. There is a whole host of issues on the agenda but, of course, the response effort to the earthquake will be the main focus of today's discussions. Bianca, Max?",

Pain, shortness of breath, other physical symptoms, but also focusing on managing your emotional and spiritual needs. What folks find when they enter hospice is that they do have a health care provider who is dedicated to managing medications. They also may have access to physical therapy or occupational therapy to home health aides, people who are dedicated to making sure that they get to spend the last weeks or months of their life the way that they want. One additional detail about hospice that most people don't know is that it is not necessarily permanent. If you decide that you do want to go back and try to get curative treatment, if there are new treatments available or something changes in your personal or family situation, you're not stuck with it forever.
