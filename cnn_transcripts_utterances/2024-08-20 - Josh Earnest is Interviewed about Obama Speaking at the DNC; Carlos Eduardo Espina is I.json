And his ability to motivate them, to inspire them, I mean, nobody is better at giving these big speeches and really summoning a big, emotional moment than Barack Obama.

The history of the United States has always embodied immigration. and not just as a Democrat value but as a Republican value as well. I mean, look at Ronald Reagan's last speech as president.

The main reason being economic issues and then some social issues as well that maybe Latinos feel like the Democrats haven't addressed properly. And I think that the Democrats have kind of picked up on that. If you see the economic plan that Kamala Harris announced earlier this week, a lot of it does address these issues, these unconformities. I think for too long there's been a misconception that Latinos, you know, are going to vote Democrat regardless, or they're only one issue voters on immigration. But I think we started to realize that they care about a lot of those things.And then there's also the role of, you know, campaign strategies, maybe Latinos haven't been targeted as they should. Like I said, I've also gotten in the sense that they've started to pick up on that. And then just the reality is that there is a large section of the Latino community who is conservative in many aspects. I mean if all Latinos were liberal progressive, you wouldn't have conservative presidents in Latin America. So, the reality is, we are in a monolith. There are a lot of different ways of thinking within the Latino community. And I think those gains have been real. But I also think that Democrats have finally figured out a better strategy to counteract them and hopefully make some gains as well.",

She was given, like you said, the role to address root causes of migration, which, by the way, I think she did a relatively good job if you look at the record and how things have happened because nowadays she was tasked with the northern triangle, El Salvador, Guatemala  and Honduras, counties which, if you look right now, aren't really the main drivers of immigration. It's mostly Venezuela, Colombia, other countries.Now, the issue on the boarder, I think, for a long time, Democrats made the mistake of kind of ignoring it, or not focusing on it fully, kind of thinking it would solve itself.
