President Biden has arrived in Europe, just as Turkey has thrown NATO into crisis, tying Sweden's membership to Turkey's EU accession. The former AT&amp;T CEO, Randall Stephenson has cut ties with the PGA Tour in protest against the LIV Golf deal. And Norse Atlantic marks its first anniversary. The chief executive will be with us to tell me how he is making low cost long haul work in an era of higher fares. Well, I'm in New York. New week begins, Monday, July the 10th. I'm Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. President Biden has landed in Lithuania, as he prepares for a high-stakes NATO Summit. The US president spent most of the day in the United Kingdom, where he agreed to strengthen relations with the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak. The two men discussed the need to support Ukraine and went over the preparations for NATO Summit, which starts tomorrow. After the meeting, the president met with King Charles at Windsor Castle. It is the first time the two had met since Charles ascended the throne. President Biden told the UK prime minister that as far as he was concerned, the US-UK partnership is unshakable.

Out of nowhere, out of the blue, Turkey has threatened to stand in the way unless it is given a path to join the European Union. This was an extraordinary surprise move from the Turkish president who linked the two issues before he arrived in Vilnius. Turkey and the EU launched membership talks in 2005, during President Erdogan's first term as prime minister. They soured 11 years later, in '16, after he clamped down on a failed coup. The Turkish president now says Turkey has been waiting at the gates of Europe for 50 years. Nic Robertson is in London. Nic is with me. Now, the German chancellor has already said, not on your life. No way is this happening. The two are completely irrelevant, though. They're independent of each other. So extraordinary business.",

So this was -- this was sort of how he was viewed back then, and I think he is still viewed as a leader that will enter into a situation and try to treat it as bizarre in the Middle East, if you will, where you can negotiate whatever terms and outcomes you want, leverage the power and strength of your position to get what you want. I mean, it is super interesting, because just yesterday, President Biden had a phone call with him, and he was talking about the F-16 fighter jets that Erdogan has that he wants upgraded, and thereto, Sweden's membership of NATO seem to be kind of linked to this position. We don't know all the details of that phone conversation. Was President Biden aware that this EU issue is now a thing for Erdogan? It just doesn't make, as you are saying, a lot of rational sense.

This is an extraordinary stunning development. Look at the timeline and you'll see why. On the 23rd and 24th, Prigozhin leads his Wagner forces in a short-lived attempted rebellion. It ends abruptly on the 24th. On that day, President Putin addressed the nation calling the act of Prigozhin and his forces treasonous. Three days later, the Belarusian President Lukashenko tells us Prigozhin is taking shelter in Belarus. Two days after that, Prigozhin meets with President Putin in Russia. On July the 5th, the police raided the Wagner leader's opulent home in St. Petersburg, and yet the next day, Lukashenko in Belarus says, Prigozhin is probably in St. Petersburg. This is all very strange. Fred Pleitgen joins me. Why did Putin meet Yevgeny Prigozhin supposedly only two or three days after he had been calling him all treasonous?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, Richard, that's a question that many people internationally are asking, andI can tell you, many people in Russia are asking as well, to see what exactly is behind that and why Vladimir Putin would have done that. One of the possible reasons is that the Wagner mercenary group, the Wagner fighters were definitely some of, at least the most successful that the Russians had on the ground in Ukraine. I mean, recall the battle for Bakhmut where the Russians were making some progress when those Wagner fighters were still on the ground there. Since those Wagner fighters have pulled out of the Bakhmut area and pulled out of Ukraine, the Russian military has been going backwards. The Ukrainians have been making much of the way of headway, but certainly, it has been fairly significant progress that Ukrainians have been making. So is that behind it? Very difficult to tell. But, you know, some of the things that we heard from that meeting today from the Kremlin spokesman itself have been very interesting, because you're absolutely right. The Kremlin itself called this a betrayal. The Kremlin itself went ahead and said, Yevgeny Prigozhin was going to have to go to Belarus. And today, we are hearing that Vladimir Putin apparently at that meeting, which lasted three hours told commanders and also, Yevgeny Prigozhin as well, that they would look for possible new areas and new places of deployment also for these forces. So could that indicate that Wagner might be making some sort of comeback to the battlefields of Ukraine? We don't know at this point. We don't know what role Yevgeny Prigozhin, if any could play in that, but we do know that only about five days after the mutiny, which certainly was at least in defiance of Vladimir Putin was a threat to the Russian military leadership, he was inside the Kremlin and had three hours of face time with Vladimir Putin -- Richard.",

      "sentences": "It is. It is certainly bizarre, and if we think it's bizarre, I can tell you that Kremlin-controlled media thinks it's even more bizarrebecause Kremlin-controlled media, which, of course, is very important for the Russian narrative, they had been saying that the Wagner fighters are heroes. They had been saying that Yevgeny Prigozhin is obviously a very popular, very important man in Russia. And then after that mutiny took place, they did a complete 180 and started trashing Yevgeny Prigozhin. The last time was actually last night. So it seems as though, if there is some sort of message control behind all of this, it seems to be one that at the very least, seems to be evolving. One of the things I will say is that Vladimir Putin, you know, when faced with very tough decisions, something like that, he is someone who in the past has shown himself to be capable to look beyond things that have happened, to look beyond maybe people that he dislikes, and make a decision that he feels is best for his own power, and then possibly also for the power of Russia. If you remember that, for instance, when the Turks shot down a Russian jet fighter over Syria, Vladimir Putin, in the end, a couple of months later was one of the first people to stand behind Recep Tayyip Erdogan when he was under pressure with a coup at home. So Vladimir Putin is definitely someone who can be quite nimble with that, but in this case, I can tell you, there are a lot of people inside Russia who are also guessing and wondering what exactly was behind this and what the reason behind this was -- Richard.",

In the resignation letter, this quote, the highly significant one coming in on Monday from Randall Stephenson, the former AT&amp;T CEO, in his resignation letter Stephenson writing, he had serious concerns with the PGA Tour's deal with LIV Golf saying, \"It's not one that I could objectively evaluate or in good conscience support, particularly in light of the US intelligence report concerning Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\" Look, it's been one really, really high-profile issue, Richard, and to your point about people caring, this is significant, because he has taken that step. He is the first one to actually take an action and make this very public. It may have been weeks in the planning, we don't know, but it is out there now and it is really, really important as well, because we've got the game's top golfers gathering this week in Scotland ahead of the Scottish open. Next week, of course, it's all eyes on Royal Liverpool and the British Open. We'll be looking to hear people and golfers reacting on this. And of course, those hearings slated for Tuesday. There is going to be an awful lot coming out of that, we would suspect -- Richard.",

We'll bring you the latest. And the chief executive of North Airways joins me to talk about transatlantic travel. All of that in a moment only after I've updated you with the headlines because this is CNN and here the news always comes first. The Israeli parliament is expected to vote soon on a key part of the government's judicial overall plans. It's triggered months of nationwide protests. The bill would limit the supreme court oversight of the legislative branch and the executive branch. It requires three readings or votes before it can become law. Sources are telling CNN the USA gymnastics doctor who was convicted of sexually abusing young female athletes was stabbed 10 times in prison. Authorities say Larry Nassar is in stable condition. In 2018, he was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison having been found guilty of sexually abusing more than 150 female athletes, most of whom were minors at the time. Police in China now say six people were killed during an attack outside of kindergarten in southern China. State media is reporting the attacker use a knife that the victims includes three children, two parents and a teacher. The police have arrested a 25-year-old suspect. Ukrainian officials say a Russian strike killed seven people in the Zaporizhzhia region on Sunday. The regional governor reported a bomb landed on a school building that's been used to distribute aid to civilians. 11 people were hurt in the attack, which is being investigated as a war crime. Breaking news to bring you. According to NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg, Turkey has agreed to back Sweden's NATO bid. Now this is all a bit strange, because only a few moments ago you and I were talking about the fact that the Turkish president was previously refusing to back the bid and as his country was gradually considered for E.U. membership. Well, the NATO Secretary General has just spoken in. Let's have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But here he's got something for something else. It seems what is got from Sweden and we're just getting details on it from NATO. So, I think -- so just looking at it, seven points here on that meeting between President Erdogan and Ulf Kristersson, the Prime Minister of Sweden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that there is an agreement by Sweden to hold bilateral security meetings with -- it appears Turkey on an annual basis, at least perhaps in the margins of these NATO leaders summit that a term that Sweden gives commitments, that it won't harbor and give sanctuary to the YPG, the Syrian Kurdish group. Another Kurdish group that the -- that the Turks believe are terrorists and are trying to undermine -- and trying to undermine turkey. So, this is an additional, it seems before I'm able to sort of go through all the bullet points that are put down by NATO. But it appears that there are additional security guarantees that Sweden is -- the Swedish Prime Minister has given the Turkish president -- that has given the Turkish president to arrive at the position where he has now said. And on this basis and given the imperatives of deterrence and defense for the Euro-Atlantic area, Turkey will transmit the session protocol for Sweden to the Grand National Assembly and worked closely with the assembly to ensure its ratification now, how quickly can they do that. It seems unrealistic that it will happen in the lifespan of this two-day leaders NATO Summit in Vilnius. Those getting underway tomorrow. That seems to be a bit speedy. But look, we've just been surprised by President Erdogan saying one thing and doing another. It's I think, important to reflect here that that Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General said he still saw the opportunity for positive outcomes on this issue. And perhaps a reference also to President Biden's call with President Erdogan yesterday about the F-16 upgrades that President Erdogan wants.",

But this is a very typical of the brinksmanship in negotiations that President Erdogan hasbecome very skilled and adapted during his many, many, many years in leadership.

All these sorts of things that are fundamental to what President Erdogan had originally said that he wanted. And Sweden had gone above and beyond it appeared until that moment to meet those requirements. I -- look, this comes to me, comes back to what I've heard from officials inside those closed rooms at NATO over the years that when President Erdogan walks in the room, everyone gets a little nervous because they don't quite know what they're going to get. He is a consummate negotiator. Whatever his methods, he appears to have gotten a good degree of what he wanted in terms of security guarantees, if not E.U. membership.",
