According to police, the suspect broke into Pelosi's San Francisco home just before 2:30 a.m. The source tells CNN that the intruder yelled where is Nancy before the attack.

Now, sources say this is why her security detail was not at her home in San Francisco. Let's bring it now to CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez, CNN's special correspondent Jamie Gangel, and CNN's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju.Evan, let's start with you. We got about 45 seconds to a minute of new information from the chief there, but combining what we learned from the chief and from your sources, what do we know about this suspect? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Victor. The police gave us precious little. They did identify the suspect as David DePape. We have been -- our investigative team has been looking at some of his social media postings. These are things that we know federal law enforcement and San Francisco police are now going through. They're trying to figure out obviously, they're trying to identify the motivation, which you know, obviously, we now know from some of Jamie Gangel's excellent reporting. We know that he entered the home looking for the Speaker of the House of Representatives, she was not there. This happened at about 230 in the morning. According to the police, he broke in and attacked the speaker's husband with a hammer. When the police arrived -- they had some kind of alarm or something that drew them to the house when they arrived. They saw at least part of the attack going on, including the fact that he was using a hammer to attack Mr. Pelosi. He's now charged with attempted homicide -- a number of charges including attempted homicide, elder abuse, burglary, it's obviously an ongoing investigation. The FBI is now involved. And we're looking at just some of the disturbing social media posts. Again, the investigators are also going through and you get a very -- obviously, a picture of a disturbed person, somebody who has been posting things on Facebook, including links to the My Pillow CEO, Mike Lindell's false claims about election fraud in the 2020 election. There's some transphobic images. We've also seen stuff on there about the COVID vaccines and about the Derek Chauvin trial. This is the police officer at Minnesota who was convicted of killing George Floyd. There's also some references on his social media postings about the January 6 committee. He calls it the Democrat farce Commission or the committee. Again, these are part of the -- this is part of the reason why the FBI is assisting in this investigation. And it really gives you a sense that in addition to some of the stuff we've heard from Jaime Gangel's sources, that he was looking for the Speaker of the House, it gives you a sense that this was at least partially a politically motivated attack, part of the larger problem that the FBI and federal law enforcement has been very, very much concerned about, Bianna and Victor.",

We do know that the president, President Biden reached out to the speaker today -- spoke to the speaker this morning in the aftermath of the news on Paul Pelosi -- the attack on Paul Pelosi. We do know that the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York also spoke with the speaker. The Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has yet to issue a statement himself. But a spokesman has conveyed his concerns as -- the Republican leader is concerned that he \"reached out to the speaker today.\" Unclear if they also connected.And then we're hearing some other Republicans also raising concerns on social media, Ted Cruz, among others about the political violence that we're seeing here in this country, some even urging Republicans to go further. Adam Kinzinger who's a member of the January 6 committee and was someone who has been on the outs of his party for some time tweeted that he's -- when you convince people that politicians are rigging elections, drink baby's blood, etcetera, you will get violence. This must be rejected. And calling for all leaders of political stripes it'd be very forceful in condemning the -- what we've seen here -- this development that occurred early this morning at the Pelosi household. So both sides of the aisle are horrified about this. And also recognizing that this is an issue that confronts members when they're out in public is personal safety, political violence, threats have been on the rise for many years, specifically -- particularly in the last several years, and members have had to beef up their own personal security, even though only the leadership and both the House and the Senate are the ones who are afforded taxpayer-funded security. So a lot of concern about what happened here, and a lot of reactions from both sides, guys.",

All those things raised the specter that this individual may have been motivated by politics or ideology. That's really what draws the attention of the FBI to this investigation.So right now, Victor, they are coursing through everything they can find and attribute back to this individual. They're looking at the social media. They're looking at any devices, telephones, iPods, any sort of electronics they can associate with him. They likely have already executed search warrants on his residence, and or his vehicle, if they've identified those. They're talking to associates to understand what e-mail accounts and telephone numbers he's used. And they will go through all of that material with court-authorized subpoenas and search warrants to understand as much as they possibly can about not just what he was thinking, but what he's been doing over the last, you know, 24, 48, 72 hours. Who is he been talking to? And the biggest thing in their mind right now, is there anyone else out there who harbors the same sort of intent as this gentleman and may be planning a similar attack or an attack on someone else. The FBI wants to stop that next attack before it happens if, in fact, there is one that's been contemplated.",

Most indicators in the aftermath of January 6 point towards the FBI taking a much more active look at some of these extreme social media platforms and open -- you know, open to the public places where a lot of this sort of really heated rhetoric and potential violent planning takes place. That's, of course, the sort of work that they should have been doing before January 6. And as I said, those questions still need to be answered.But absolutely, the Bureau is being pulled in new directions, having to dedicate additional resources to domestic terrorism issues, in the same way, that the Capitol police and state and local police officers are as well.

We see several states down 10, 20 cents in just the last week.The average gas price -- the most frequent gas price at a gas station today in the United States is either $3.29 or $3.49.
