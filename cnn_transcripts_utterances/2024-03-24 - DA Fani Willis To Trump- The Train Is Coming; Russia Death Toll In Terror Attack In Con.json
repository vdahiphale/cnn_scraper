      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, the clock is ticking for Donald Trump, the former president is just hours away from two major legal threats colliding in New York. Tomorrow is the deadline for him to post nearly half billion-dollar bond in his New York civil fraud case. His attorneys have asked an Appeals Court to allow him to post a smaller bond or none at all, but the court has not reached a decision yet. On Friday, Trump claimed he has the cash to cover the bill, but his lawyer later told CNN that Trump does not actually have that cash on hand. Meanwhile, New York's attorney general has already filed judgments in Westchester County and New York City, where Trump owns properties, the first indication the state is prepared to seize his assets if he can't pay up. It is all playing out as Trump is expected to appear in a New York courtroom tomorrow, where a judge may set a date for his hush money trial involving a $130,000.00 payment to adult film star, Stormy Daniels. All right, and now to a CNN exclusive reporting on yet another Trump case, the Georgia election subversion matter. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is speaking to CNN about the timeline in that major trial and efforts by the former president to get it delayed. CNN's Zach Cohen joining us right now. Zach, what is Willis saying?",

We caught up with her at an Easter event just south of Atlanta, and she called the last two months and the allegations against her and her top prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who has since resigned, a distraction and she says that despite that, the case itself has not been slowed down.

I reported last week that Fani Willis is still trying to push for a trial date to be set and set before the 2024 election. She could ask the judge again to set a trial date for as soon as this summer and in the meantime, though, the work continues as Willis said and as Judge Scott McAfee has also indicated that the work is still progressing and that he intends to continue moving forward. One source told me last week that McAfee has seemed to roll up his sleeves, trying to address these outstanding issues that have to be addressed before this case can go to trial. Ultimately, we are going to see that there is a lot of different factors that play, a lot of legal challenges still facing Willis and her team. There is also some scheduling matters as to how the scheduling could be impacted by some of the other criminal cases. So we are going to wait and see, it is a long road from asking for a trial date to actually getting to a trial.",

I am joined now by Harry Litman, he is a former federal prosecutor and a former deputy assistant attorney general. Harry, great to see you.

Trump's attorneys have said they want to appeal the decision, his decision to not remove Fani Willis from the case, but for the sake of keeping things on track, as Willis puts it, would he set a date anyway or adhere to the August requested trial date?",

I think that's appeal proof just because it was so plainly the case.There was no possible scenario that she was actually doing this case in order to get commercial plane travel from Wade paid for in cash, that never really had any purchase. And the other half of it actually where he found more or less against her. She is not appealing. So in that sense, I don't see any reversal. The more controversial part of it, in other words, was the appearance of conflict and Wade being forced to step off and they are not appealing that. So I don't see a different result here.",

But he may be able to do it temporarily enough to secure. He would still need a guardian angel to accept it as collateral and that is of course something we need to worry about because why would a billionaire step in in that instance? But that I think is a likely scenario and the others, I think the most likely is anything at all before letting AG James basically seize his properties.

The building itself has been sealed off because investigators and emergency teams are still in there.It was set on fire by the attackers with incendiary bombs, petrol bombs, or something like that. And so it essentially burned to the ground. But what that means is that investigators are now having to pick through the debris, make their way towards the sort of areas that have been most devastated where they say they are finding more bodies, which is why the death toll has been increasing since Friday. Also, there are more than 140 people who are injured in hospital and some of those people are in a critical condition as well. In terms of the investigation, look, I mean, the Russians have said they've already detained 11 people associated with this attack, including the four suspected gunmen who went on that shooting rampage on Friday night through that concert venue, which is just outside the city limits of the Russian capital. Russian television has shown some pretty grisly images of the suspects being interrogated. They're cuffed, they are bloodied, they are looking pretty bad shape. One of them is shown sort of confessing to carrying out the attack, saying he did it for money, but of course, as we all know, it is ISIS or a branch of ISIS that has said that its people, its members carried out this attack. Part of what it says is its war against countries who fight Islam. Russia has been engaged in numerous confrontations with ISIS, including in Syria, where Russian forces continued to back Bashar Al- Assad in a civil war there, which is in some ways opposed to ISIS, and so it may be related to that. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president though has tried to connect this attack to Ukraine, because obviously Russia is fighting that war in Ukraine as well. And he said that the perpetrators of this were trying to head towards Ukraine when they were detained by the Russian Security Services. Now, the implication that they were involved is something that the Ukrainian government have categorically denied. They are saying literally this has nothing to do with us -- Fredricka.",

So Andy, I mean, this is a big mystery, while the MLB is investigating, while Ohtani is going to play this evening, right? For the LA Dodgers and the interpreter has lost his job. We also understand that the IRS is investigating. So what is going on? ANDY MCCULLOUGH, SENIOR BASEBALL WRITER, \"THE ATHLETIC\": That is a wonderful question I think a lot of people are trying to get to the bottom of. I mean, right now, right, the central issue is the two sort of competing narratives. The one put forth by Ippei Mizuhara in his initial so interview with ESPN, I believe was conducted on Tuesday and then the subsequent recanting from Mizuhara on Wednesday at which point, Ohtani's representatives accused him of massive theft of the four-and-a-half million dollars. And so from there, it has now kind of have been turned over to Ohtani's camp has said they will be sort of pressing forward to press charges, I guess, against Mizuhara. Major League Baseball is entering an investigation, although it is kind of unclear how much they will be able to get to because they're not going to try and like trip over federal investigators. So yes, I mean, there is just still so many questions that need to be answered.",

I think if that comes into play, if there is a way to prove that, then the severity of the sort of punishment or potential investigation becomes that much more significant.But it also -- you know, just the appearance of impropriety is sort of kind of part of the slippery slope as sports leagues, not just baseball, but all across America have further and further deepened their relationship with gambling companies. You can't turn on a television and watch anything without getting hit by Draft Kings or whomever convincing you to try and bet. And so it is an obvious source of revenue for these leagues. It is a source of revenue in the media world, and it is pretty prevalent. And so the landscape is just very different than it was back, for example, in the 80s with Pete Rose. I mean it was such a clear like you can't bet on sports except for in certain jurisdictions. And now, it is much more spread out. It is much more prevalent. So, yes, it becomes -- it demonstrates sort of risk as sort of the sports world gets deeper and deeper into this.",
