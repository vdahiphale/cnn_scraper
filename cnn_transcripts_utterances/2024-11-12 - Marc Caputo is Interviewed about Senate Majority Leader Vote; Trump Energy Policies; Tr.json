I have to say, look, I've covered The Hill for a long time. Typically, this kind of outside pressure is not received terribly warmly by senators who like to do their own thing, don't like to be told what to do. And quite candidly, Rick Scott is not terribly well liked with a lot his colleagues. What else are you hearing? MARC CAPUTO, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE BULWARK\": That's about right. When you campaign, govern, act in a senatorial capacity, as the anti-establishment outsider, well, the insiders don't like you. And that's probably the biggest problem that Rick Scott has for - on a personal basis, and then sort of more broadly to your point, senators don't like being told what to do. As one person whom I spoke with for the story told me, they basically all think they're a little president and there's a little bit of resistance to having Donald Trump be their sort of boss in everything and calling all of the shots. They probably want a little bit of independence. It is a secret ballot, so that makes it really difficult for Trump to be able to sort of single out senators and put pressure on them to get them to vote his way.",

I think to sort of underscore why Trump world seems to like him right now as opposed to John Cornyn and John Thune, the other two top candidates, we can look back at some of the things that Cornyn and Thune had to say in the midst of the Republican primary campaign, the presidential primary in 2023.Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): You have to appeal to a broader segment of the population in a general election. And President Trump seems to have a - have a loyal support in the primary, but not so much in a general election. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): I think people in this country are ready for generational change, and I think change in tone in our politics. There's an exhaustion factor, there's a fatigue factor with the American people and always a lot of drama around the former president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And there are a number of different people from different walks of life in it. And Rick Scott's one of them. He has been with Donald Trump almost since day one. Rick Scott has had a no endorsement policy, or used to have one in a Republican primary. And when he was governor in 2016, he basically broke it by issuing a non- endorsement endorsement of Donald Trump in January of 2016 in an op-ed in \"USA Today.\" And he made it pretty clear he was on President Trump's, or then candidate Trump's, side. And he's been by his side the entire time.So, yes, what they want in MAGA-ville, in Trump world, is someone who's really going to sign off on President Trump's agenda. And these two other guys, more than likely, if past is prologue, and if their prior words mean anything, just aren't fully sold on it. It is kind of striking that these two senators, at that point, this late in the game, had still underestimated Donald Trump because the reality is, is those who are truly with him thought he was going to win all along. Now, maybe they were just being hopeful. But it turned out that they were right. And, in their view, there is a price for being wrong, and they hope to exact that. But again, as now it doesn't look like the numbers are there for Rick Scott anymore.",
