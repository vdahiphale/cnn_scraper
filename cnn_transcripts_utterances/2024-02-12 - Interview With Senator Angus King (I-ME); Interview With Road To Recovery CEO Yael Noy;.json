The GOP presidential frontrunner raised alarms in Washington and around the world after saying this.

The President is also growing publicly more frustrated with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling operations in Gaza over the top. Independent Senator Angus King spent the weekend with colleagues working on this foreign aid bill, just days after making an impassioned speech on the Senate floor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ANGUS KING (I-ME): Whenever people write to my office, they say, why are we supporting Ukraine? I answer, Google Sudetenland 1938. We could have stopped a murderous dictator who was bent on geographic expansion at that time. I say we, the West, at a relatively low cost. The result of not doing so was 55 million deaths. That chapter has haunted me because it echoes so strongly in what's happening now in Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The essence of our national security strategy for 80 years has been deterrence. The best war is the one that's never fought. And the way to avoid fighting a war is your adversaries know that they will face overwhelming results and consequences if they commit aggression. To have said something like that, which basically he said to Putin, I don't care what the hell you do if they haven't chipped in adequately, according to his standards, is unbelievable. I mean, it just sort of -- it completely undermines the concept of deterrence because it's not only deterrence, it's an invitation. And by the way, on -- in terms of support for Ukraine, I often hear around here, well, we're doing too much. The Europeans aren't doing enough. Christiane, as a percent of GDP, we are 15th in the world in terms of our support for Ukraine. Number 15. Virtually, all the European countries are ahead of us. I think Estonia is contributing something like five times as a percent of their GDP than we are.

You know, the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, doesn't usually quickly rush out to talk about internal, you know, U.S. policy or statements by -- you know, by candidates, but he did immediately step out and in a prepared statement said that any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U.S. and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk. So, that's that point. I want to ask you whether like some of Trump's defenders, do you think that was just a Trumpian crazy comment on a campaign or do you believe that Trump should be taken at his word given that he is the frontrunner, you know, for the GOP?",

He told us who he was. He told us what his policy would be. He's been threatening one way, shape or form to get out of NATO since he was in the presidency. So, this comment was shocking. And as I say, pretty much unbelievable. But it's consistent with the direction that he's been moving ever since. It goes this whole idea of America first. You know, that has echoes from the 1930s. And that means we don't keep our commitments. We don't side with our allies. But NATO has worked. It held the Soviet Union in check for 70 -- 60, 70 years. And to undermine the confidence that our allies have, and also to invite aggression from Vladimir Putin is the sheerest folly. I -- as you can see, I'm -- for a U.S. senator, I'm sort of speechless.

I think we could be headed toward even a more lopsided vote in the next few days. I certainly hope so. But are we going to get it done? I think so. Here's what's going on now. And as is typical in many pieces of major legislation, both sides have amendments that they'd like to raise. In order to process amendments, you have to have a time agreement. Because under the arcane rules of the Senate, each amendment theoretically could take hours and, in fact, even days before you would get to a vote on the amendment. So, it involves a little bit of comedy, a little bit of cooperation to say, OK, we're going to do the amendments, but we're going to collapse the time. Right now, several of the members are saying, we're not going to cooperate. We're not going to collapse the time. We're going to require this, you know, for -- to go for weeks. And I think once that happens, if indeed that's what happens, we may end up moving to this bill without amendments, which would be a shame.

How that would happen is difficult to say. But, you know, even the British foreign secretary has said, you know, that they are very, very concerned.

One of the points I made was the bombing that you're now doing is harming Israel and civilians more than Hamas. It's counterproductive. And the same goes with their sort of half-baked lack of cooperation with humanitarian aid. Now, we're talking about an attack on Rafah. You've got to remember that a month and a half, two months ago, the Israelis were saying, move out of Gaza City, move south to the civilians, move to the south of Gaza, because we're going to concentrate and get Hamas. The civilians did that. And now, they're talking about attacking the very regions where the civilians went in order to seek safety. I understand the president's frustration. Benjamin Netanyahu, if he were here, he would say the Israeli people are shocked and horrified by what happened on October 7th, the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust in Israel, and you've probably been there, Christiane, in Israel, it's still October 7th. That horrendous act is still reverberating. However, what the Israelis -- the Israelis need to go after Hamas, but the question is how to do it and how to minimize civilian casualties because -- and this is what I said to Netanyahu, I said, you may be winning on the ground -- and I'm not even sure that's happening now, you may be winning on the ground, but you're losing the information war. And this bombing of civilians, finagling with aid and those kinds of things are not doing Israel any good. I said this as a friend of Israel and as a supporter of Israel, but this is a very difficult situation. One idea that I've suggested to the White House is that we move one or two hospital ships to the Mediterranean on the side of Gaza. Gaza borders the Mediterranean. Let's move those hospital ships there so important health care can be provided without Hamas being in the basement. And I think that's a way that the United States could make a really significant contribution.",

I think what Joe Biden has to do, between now and November, is demonstrate to the American people that he hasn't lost a step. That he's able to give and take and work in an open and unrehearsed setting and convince them -- the American people that he's still got it. That's going to be -- it's going to be an issue in the campaign. There's no reason to deny it. And we'll just have to see how and in what way the president steps up.",

The two men are dual Israel- Argentine nationals, and Argentina's new president thanked Israel. The operation also killed dozens of Palestinians in Rafah. And access to food, water, and medicine is growing increasingly limited. Before October 7th, Israeli charity Road to Recovery worked tirelessly to help take sick Palestinians, mostly children, from Gaza to Israeli hospitals. On October 7th, Hamas killed some of the volunteers. Amid the 1,200 Israelis who were slaughtered were women like Vivian Silva, who worked for this charity. But despite such horror, the charity is vowing to continue its work. Why? Well, CEO Yael Noy says that, I'm fighting to be good. I'm fighting to stay moral when both sides are in such terrible pain, I'm fighting to be the same person I was before. And she's joining us now from Tel Aviv.

So, what has been happening over the last -- since October is that the Israeli army has pushed people south. And their obvious intention, in my view, has -- and in many people's views, has been to gather everyone by the Rafah Border in such a situation where they create such a horrific nightmare of crowds, million -- more than a million people pushed up against the border fence, very little access to humanitarian aid, and they will create a sense of desperation and hysteria that Egypt will have no choice but to open its border, and they will end up going through that.",

And she was -- her mother and her two sisters and their husbands and their small babies are all in Gaza. They lived in the middle area. She gave me a very different picture, not in any big sense, but just kind of a texture. So, they had fled from their house in the middle area, as everybody else had, to Rafah, and they'd set up their tent, and they'd made their tent with old blankets and old towels, and the babies had no nappies.

Now, what I'm told is that if you're wandering around and this -- you know, these people have huge connections. All the different groups of Palestinians in Gaza have set up their own, sort of, if you like, WhatsApp groups. So, there's the Nusrat WhatsApp group. But it's not WhatsApp, it's their own version of it. Rafah, Gaza, et cetera. So, apparently, if you're in the north and if you're in Gaza City, you will probably find about three families living in each street, that kind of thing. Most of it is gone. Most of it is destroyed. But a lot of them are just going back and living in the rubble. So, I have asked people, so how are you feeding yourselves, particularly in the north? They are incredibly inventive, the Palestinians, and the Gazans particularly, because they've had to be. And they've -- you know, they're described as the greatest patcher uppers in the world, because that's all they've ever done. And so, what they're now doing, which I hadn't heard before, is they're going -- a lot of shops and a lot of stores were destroyed, and supermarkets even in Gaza City, by the rubble. They're going into the rubble of the stores and getting food out. Tins, pasta, rye, stuff that was in the stores that just went under the rubble. So, they're doing that. And my friend who's in America at the moment, her little brother, is -- have been -- they've got home now. He is deputed to go out and find food. And so -- and which he enjoys, because it's kind of something he can contribute to the family's survival. But, you know, they are living -- there are drones over them all the time, and bombs dropping sporadically still now.

And each chapter looks at a different ex-president and the specific model that they followed. And what I describe Thomas Jefferson as is he's kind of the quintessential serial entrepreneur or serial founder. He has three things etched on his epitaph that he personally authored, two of which happened before he was president, including the Declaration of Independence and one that he accomplished at 82 years old, which was the father and founder of the University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson never wanted to be president. He tried to retire three times. But as a co-founder of the Republic, he had a founder's obligation to continue to serve in the republic. And all that did was make him lose time and get closer to mortality. He believed very strongly that the republic that they had founded was imperfect, and if you didn't create a proper institution, an arts and sciences institution to train the next generation, you wouldn't be able to pass the torch to a new cadre of revolutionary minded people who could fix and perfect the mistakes that they made in the Constitution. And so, UVA was meant to be that university. And poor Thomas Jefferson, when he opens the doors at 82 years old to the university that he had literally personally architected, you know, six months in, you have a group of young students, you know, covering their faces with mass chanting down with university professors, throwing bags of urine at professors, beating one with their cane, throwing. And all it takes is Thomas Jefferson at 82 years old to call an all-school assembly before the disciplinary committee that included Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, by the way, the most intimidating disciplinary committee, past, present, and future. And for him to exude such a status with these students, one by one, they confessed. And Jefferson remains the only ex-president to create an institution that's now lasted more than 200 years, although every president with their center and their library and their institution hopes to achieve the same thing.",

He had a tremendous self-awareness about the imperfections of his own life and what he and his fellow founders had actually architected at the dawn of the republic. And he had a lot of faith and hope that the next generation would fix those problems. And this is why, you know, when his beloved University of Virginia is engulfed in a student riot where they're chanting down with university professors, it's so appalling to him because at 82 years old, there's not a lot of time left, and he wanted to make sure that that institution would survive long enough that he could kind of go out gracefully and be rest assured that the next generation would carry the torch forward.",

And some of that is a function that in between the Missouri Compromise and the time that John Quincy Adams goes into the House in the early 1830s, it's just not a hotly debated topic, which, again, is why the abolition abolitionist movement around that time is more fringy and seen as more radical. And so, he found slavery abhorrent, but it was not a dominant issue during that kind of interregnum. And so, this is what I find so prescriptive about John Quincy Adams. We always assume for that great second act, you have to know exactly what you wanted to do. Thomas Jefferson knew he wanted to go found a great university.

Jimmy Carter was a differentversion of that because he too left office in 1981 deeply unpopular. He made a decision that Herbert Hoover did not make, which was, you know, the moment he got out of office, he knew he wasn't going to make another run at the presidency. And so, as he began what he described as his involuntary retirement. You know, he was a man commanded by deep faith and incredibly principled about this idea that my faith commands me to do whatever I can for as long as I can, whenever I can. And, you know, unshackled from the presidency, he decided to create the former presidency. And he basically built a post presidential administration that unlike his presidency would never end. And he was the first former president to build infrastructure around this idea of being a former and make it a platform in and of itself. And he becomes both a great partner to his successors and a tremendous nuisance to his successors, right? So, the two examples of a nuisance are, you know, when George H. W. Bush is getting ready to launch Operation Desert Storm to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Jimmy Carter secretly writes to several permanent members of the Security Council, you know, trying to advocate them going against the U.S. position. This was, you know, one of the most successful, you know, U.N. Security Council moments of collective action, not really seen before or after, and Carter is kind of secretly opposing it. Or in 1994 when Bill Clinton sends Jimmy Carter to Pyong Yang to meet with the leader there, he knows exactly what Carter's capable of. And so, he tells him, you're a messenger. You're not authorized to make policy. And then Bill Clinton turns on CNN and finds Jimmy Carter announcing that he's negotiated a nuclear breakthrough on nonproliferation with the North Koreans. So, look, Jimmy Carter, you know, represents that Alexander Hamilton -- you know, the answer to Hamilton's question of being a formidable adversary or nuisance to your successor being a partner. And at 42 plus years, he's had the longest active, you know, post presidency. And I think it's ended up being instructive for every successive presidents that's followed.",

      "sentences": "Look, the number one lesson from the book is anybody making a transition, whether it's to retirement or a micro transition in your life,the sooner you figure out what your core principles are and let those principles guide you, the sooner you're able to extricate yourself from ego and vanity and lust for power. And so, I think it's -- if you're looking at sort of dangerous power or, you know, discontented ghosts wandering around us, those that feel like they lack principles, those that feel like they're meandering without principle are oftentimes the most dangerous people to have aggregated power. And so, you know, I think what we're seeing right now is, you know, in addition to this being the only time since 1892 where you have a presidential rematch, you also have the two oldest candidates in history eclipsed only by the last time, these two same candidates ran against each other four years prior. And you have to ask yourself the question, perhaps we're in this situation that we're in where you have the two oldest candidates, they're less popular than they were four years ago. It's only once repeated rematch. Maybe we're in this situation because you have two presidents that don't want to give up power.",
