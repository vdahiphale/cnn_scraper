Plus, control of the House comes down to several key races, as more Republicans are blaming Donald Trump for the different disappointing results so far. And a manhunt for a student is underway after a deadly shooting on the campus of the University of Virginia.This is what we're watching AT THIS HOUR. Thank you so much for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan. President Biden, he's holding high stakes meeting with China's leader. The two men meeting for more than three hours on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Indonesia, this is their first in person face to face meetings since Biden took office. This also comes at a moment when relations between the two countries are seen as really being at an all-time low fundamental differences on major issues like human rights to Taiwan, trade, and of course in the war in Ukraine. But in a press conference just this morning, President Biden did express hope that they can repair ties. Let's begin right there with MJ Lee who's live in Indonesia for us. MJ, what did President Biden say about this meeting with Xi?",

And he said that the U.S. laid out some of the concerns they have when it comes to China on everything from human rights to some of China's economic practices to U.S. citizens who are currently detained in China. But there was probably no other issue that was more highly anticipated as a topic of discussion than Taiwan because that is, in fact, the reason that U.S. Chinese relations have deteriorated so much in recent months, particularly following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island.The President suggesting in the press conference after the summit, that he was perhaps able to take down the temperature a little bit on this front, take a listen.

      "sentences": "All right, so a major development you saw just playing out in the midst of this press conference, they begin this press conference over this shooting at UVA, with the police and the president of the university, calling for help and assistance to locate a suspect. And then in the middle of this press conference, the chief of police receiving word from his deputy, that the suspect is now in custody. As we now know that all of the people who were killed in this incident and wounded students involved in this mass shooting at UVA overnight.John Miller is here with me, John, important, the suspect is in custody, they clearly are unprepared to give more on that because the chief of police himself just found it out in the middle of the press conference. But there was a lot that we learned about previous interactions, and just what happened and how this played out just now. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: So what we learned was that this is someone who was flagged to the Threat Assessment Center at UVA. This is a pretty advanced process where they have people from student affairs, representatives from the police departments, psychologists to assess threats. The threat involved somebody reporting, Chris Jones, had made a statement that he had a gun. They interviewed his roommate, who said he had never seen a gun. They interviewed the complainant who said, well, there was no threat that came with the idea that he made a statement about having a gun. But as we peel back the layers, we see he also seems to have an arrest outside of campus for an illegal weapon the year before. So we're starting to peel back the layers of early signs that this individual was headed for trouble. What's remarkable to me is that all of this came out in the first press conference. In other words, rather than wait for two days later, you know, early signs were missed police did this or that. For Tim Longo, the chief of police for UVA, to put that out front and say I'm telling you everything we have right now, there's a big difference from what we usually say, what we usually see. It's a high level of transparency. And I think they have to get credit for that.",

I think they went on lockdown at 10But they also had the emergency notification app that went out to students that started the lockdown. They were very active, both the president, the police department, and their emergency management system over Twitter all night long and through this morning. And when we look at things like the Virginia Tech shooting from, you know, the mid 2000s. And we see how far colleges and universities have advanced in early warning systems in rapid response, even while the lockdown was going on. They were offering psychological services through people standing by on the phone to students who were -- who needed to talk.

Now just to go back over some of those facts, which are just so disturbing, three members of the football team here at UVA, shot dead, two others, one in good condition, apparently, another and critical condition, so a lot for the school to think about right now.
