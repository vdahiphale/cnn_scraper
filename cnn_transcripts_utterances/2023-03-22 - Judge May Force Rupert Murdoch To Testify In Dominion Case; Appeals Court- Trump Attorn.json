I'd like to think it was likely, but I agree that you're probably correct and more realistic in your assessment.But the Fed also still does have a decent amount of discretion. And you saw under the last administration, the Fed decided to take a less active role in supervising banks. We now see what the consequences are, if you're not paying as much attention. And I think they can pay a lot more attention now, even under the existing laws. And that's something that I believe they're actively exploring, and we're going to hear more about when they come out with a report by May 1st on all the events that have happened.",

      "sentences": "Now that the hearing is wrapped up, Boris, the ruling really could come at any time from this Delaware judge. So he's state court judge, Eric Davis. He was appointed by a Democratic governor in 2010. He's deciding right now, whether the facts that have been presented, so far, both in his courtroom and in court filings, whether those facts are sufficient for him to rule in favor of either Dominion or Fox News without this case going to trial. That is a very high bar, though. And the likelihood is that this case will go to trial, unless Fox News and Dominion settle before then.And, you know, in the hearing this morning, there were these questions about how a trial would proceed. And notably here, Judge Davis said that he could possibly compel Fox Corporation chairman, Rupert Murdoch, to testify at a trial because as this judge put it, Rupert Murdoch does have this special role at Fox Corporation and he was aware of the guests appearing on Fox News air. In fact, Rupert Murdoch even acknowledged in his deposition that he could have stopped Trump's legal team from appearing on the network's air, but he didn't. So Fox News attorneys, they're saying that any appearance by Rupert Murdoch on the witness stand or his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, they say it would just create an undue burden. It will create a media circus. And in response to that, guys, the judge did say this morning that he would consider if they were brought in to put them either via Zoom or other teleconferencing platform. But, you know, this case, very high stakes. It's not only a $1.6 billion defamation case, but this is also a very important case when it comes to the implications of the First Amendment. Fox News is saying that they are fully protected by the First Amendment here. So this could be a big case about that issue as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, I would expect that Rupert Murdoch would have to testify, and we're seeing indications like Jessica said that the judge will compel that testimony. And that's because of all the evidence that's come out in discovery that shows that people like Rupert Murdoch knew the election lies that were being pushed on Fox's air were not true.And they acknowledged, and Rupert Murdoch himself acknowledged that some of his top hosts, people like Sean Hannity, they endorsed those lies on air. If this does go to trial, I expect it not to be good for Fox News. Outside the legal case that's being presented in court, it's going to be a reputational problem for Fox. I mean, you could potentially have people like Murdoch, top hosts like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, called to the stand. And I really have a hard time thinking that that's going to be good for Fox from a reputational standpoint, seeing -- or really shedding light on how that sausage is made over at that network. So, you know, we'll see what happens going forward, whether the judge averts this trial, but it seems right now everything is headed that way. And we'll see some of these prominent officials on the stand sometime next month.",

And it appears that Trump attorney, Evan Corcoran, must testify against his client, Donald Trump, in the ongoing investigation into classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. This is a very big decision coming down from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals this afternoon, just a few days after a trial level judge did say that Corcoran would have to testify to the grand jury to speak about his interactions with Trump directly, and also turn over documents he had, of notes that he had. So Kaitlan Collins and I were able to confirm and looking at this court order that just was popped up in the docket of this case. It does say that a three-judge panel, all three judges together are denying requests for Donald Trump's team and Evan Corcoran to put a stay on the case. So that's putting a pause on the case.That means that the subpoena of the Justice Department, the Special Counsel's office, is valid, is going forward. And time is really running out for Donald Trump and Evan Corcoran as they have been trying to keep the grand jury off of them as they've tried to avoid answering these questions.",

And specifically, what we have learned is that it was Donald Trump that the Justice Department believes was trying to commit a crime of some sort or advance a crime as he was using his lawyer, Evan Corcoran, to defend him in this classified documents probe.Now, Evan Corcoran was a pretty central player for a very long time, including before the FBI search found all of those documents at Mar-a- Lago last year. He was one of the people drafting a statement, saying that they had done searches and that they had turned over all of the classified records in their possession. Obviously, that turned out to be wrong. And so the Justice Department really has wanted to ask more of Evan Corcoran, what were those conversations like between he and Donald Trump? And when you look at this, this is the sort of thing that could make or break a case if they get it. Trump still has the opportunity to appeal, but he's really running out of opportunities here.",
