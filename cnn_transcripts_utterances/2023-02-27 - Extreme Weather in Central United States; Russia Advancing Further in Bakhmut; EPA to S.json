Just ahead, powerful storms sweeping across parts of the U.S. with reports of multiple tornadoes, large hail, and damaging wind. We will speak to a professional storm chaser.And the U.S. is warning China it could face real cost if it provides lethal aid to Russia for the war on Ukraine. Plus, the ex-husband and in-laws are being charged with murder in the gruesome killing of Hong Kong model and influencer Abby Choi. We will have a live report with the very latest. Good to have you with us. And we begin this hour with a dangerous storm system battering the central U.S. right now, bringing tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail to parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas. At least two tornadoes have been confirmed so far in Oklahoma. There are reports of widespread damage, downed power lines, and debris blocking roads in the city of Norman, home to Oklahoma's largest university. Tens of thousands of people statewide are without power. The system is so strong a wind gust of 114 miles per hour is reported in northern Texas in the town of Memphis. More than 100 storms have now been reported across the Southern Plains. And more than 65 million people are under high wind alerts. On the phone now, Zachary Hall, a professional storm chaser who has been following the storms across Oklahoma since Sunday afternoon. Zachary, hope you can hear me. Thank you so much for joining us. So, what have you been seeing in the last few hours? ZACHARY HALL, PROFESSIONAL STORM CHASER (via telephone):  Thank you for having me. Yeah, it's been pretty crazy. We've been on the roads since about noon today. We have currently tracked severe weather from the Texas panhandle back through the state of Oklahoma and we've made it back to western Arkansas.

But officials say troops are launching counterattacks to try to preserve their access to Bakhmut from the west. The United States is warning China that if it provides Russia with lethal aid to use in Ukraine, it would, quote, \"come at real cost to Beijing.\" This after Washington said it was confident China is considering sending drones and ammunition to Moscow.

The U.S. is clearly hoping that this deterrent will work. That's the threat to potentially against national ostracization will have more of an effect, for example, in China than it did on Iran, which was already isolated internationally and continues to provide Russia with drones because China, you know, its economy just opening up after COVID and potentially has a lot to lose so they continue to keep the pressure up diplomatically and by talking publicly about this, Rosemary.",

I think Donald Trump won over 70 percent of that county. I think that is a much harder case to make. Biden has made clear, I think. If you're looking at pure politics, he puts no higher priority on anything than improving the Democratic position among white working -- among working class voters of all races. And this kind of ginned up outrage that he went to Ukraine instead of Ohio really seems to be off point.

I think at the moment, the way this issue is evolving, it's evolving in a way that is going to put more pressure inside the Republican coalition that necessarily put pressure on Biden.I think the Biden administration feels very comfortable that among voters, that they realistically have chance of winning in the first place. That there is still broad support for maintaining a robust U.S. commitment to Ukraine and to standing up to Putin. I think what's happening in the first instance is going to be this division between Mitch McConnell, Nikki Haley, Mike Pence on the one hand who are treating this as almost, you know, a kind of extension of a Reagan view that we have to stand up to Russia. And then the forces on the other side like Marjorie Taylor Greene, many of the Fox hosts, and even Ron DeSantis has been pulled in this direction in his comments, that are being kind of pulled toward that Trump position of skepticism, of too much engagement with Ukraine. And then, look, the polling shows that among Republican voters, this kind of feedback loop is already operating where you see more leaders in the party questioning it and therefore more voters in the party saying in polls, they're not sure they should be doing this, and that becomes the justification for more leaders to pull away. So, there is going to be, I think, a battle royal in the Republican Party first before they decide whether it's going to be confrontation with Biden. Probably, by the way, the contrast will be the House will move in a more skeptical position. I think the Senate Republicans will stay more supportive.",
