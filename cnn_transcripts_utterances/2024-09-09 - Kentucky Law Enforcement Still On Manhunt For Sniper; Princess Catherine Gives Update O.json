William and I are so grateful for the support we've received and have drawn great strength from all those who are helping us at this time. Everyone's kindness, empathy and compassion has been truly humbling. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR: Objectively cute kids there, I have to say. Very cute. Joining us now is CNN royal historian Kate Williams. And Kate, the Princess has been very private, of course, about her health issues. Low on specifics, although you could argue she shared more than is kind of normal for royals in the past. In this video, though, she did give this rare inside look where you see her interacting so much with her kids and William.",

She talks about her vulnerabilities, how during the last nine months of the cancer treatment that we know started in late February. They've been through incredibly tough times as a family that its been -- cancer brings you face to face with your own vulnerabilities.And this was full of honesty and transparency and it came from the heart. And with the -- this beautiful video, this three minute long video of the children filmed last -- filmed just a month ago in Norfolk near their country house. It couldn't be more of a contrast, could it, to that video that we saw in March, where she told us she had cancer. She was alone on a bench in Windsor. It was so sad, and this one is so full of joy. And she says it's a long road ahead. I'm focusing on healing. I'm taking each day as it comes. I'm only going to do a small amount of engagements if I do do those, but really this is a message that so hopeful and just so different to what we've seen from royals in the past. This is really Kate speaking directly to us and to all people going through cancer treatment and caring for those who are going through cancer treatment themselves.",

She was saying, Kensington Palace have also said that we hope to see her doing a few engagements, small engagements for her charities over the next few months.But they're only really saying that in terms of the big royal engagements, we should expect to see her in November at Remembrance Sunday, that big royal event by The Cenotaph, and also for her beloved carol service in December. Otherwise, it may be that she's still focusing on recovery and her loss. So, not being here has been a big hole in the royal family. She's the royal superstar. We haven't really seen her since Christmas. She was at the trooping of the color in early summer. She was at Wimbledon. But really, she hasn't been on the public eye. And she is so crucial to the monarchy. She's such a superstar. So, people have really missed her. And when they do see her back at these public engagements, I think there'll be such a sense of joy and support for what she's going through and, you know, her movement towards healing in the future.",
