General area where he is believed to have ditched a van on Saturday night. Here are the contents of the reverse 911 call that the Pennsylvania State Police issued to local residents on Monday evening. QuoteThe Pennsylvania State Police are receiving reports of escaped convicts and Danelo Cavalcante in the area of Ridge Road, Coventryville Road, and Daisy Point Road in South Coventry Township, possibly armed with a weapon. Residents in the area are asked to lock all external doors and windows, secure vehicles and remain in doors. Please review your surveillance cameras and contact police if you observe anything suspicious. If you see this individual, do not approach him, call 911 immediately. End quote. That is the contents of reverse 911 calls being issued to people in the area of South Coventry Township. What's significant there is that the Pennsylvania State Police for the first time are saying that Danelo Cavalcante is possibly armed with a weapon. Up until now, they have not had any indication, they said, that he has a weapon on him. Now they're saying he could be armed with a weapon and possibly in that area where he ditched a van, a stolen van on Saturday night. This would be the third confirmed sighting of him within the last 48 hours between Saturday and Monday evening. He was previously seen at two ring door cameras where he sought help from former work associates. Brian Todd, CNN Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It looks like it could also serve to make both sides more dangerous, right? To give Russia the weapons it needs to sustain the fight in Ukraine. And of course, to help bolster North Korea's nuclear program.Because even if Russia doesn't supply technology or knowledge in this. They will potentially pay for weapons. That money could be funneled into the nuclear program and they have still got their seat on the UN Security Council. So it could stand in the way of any future sanctions.

But Meadows's attorneys are intervening, asking that judge to put his decision on hold essentially, while Mark Meadows can appeal it to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.Meadows's attorneys are arguing that if this proceeds in state court and Meadows is convicted, that this would be, of course, offensive to his rights, then they should let the full appeal play out there. They're especially arguing this because the Fulton County District Attorney's Office has said she wants to see all 19 defendants in this case, including Donald Trump, including Mark Meadows, go to trial in October 2023. Now the state court judge has been pretty skeptical of that timeline. He's expected to make some decisions this week about when all of these defendants, including potentially Mark Meadows, could go to trial in state court.
