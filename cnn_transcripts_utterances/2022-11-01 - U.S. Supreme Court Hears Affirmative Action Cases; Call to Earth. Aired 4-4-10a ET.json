      "sentences": "Caves are really unique places that are very well-connected tothe surface but also well-protected from the surface. So, this means they can store records of how the climate has changed in the past over, over millions of years. I think for me, the best part of being in a cave is getting to see this unique world that most people don`t get to see. I`m Gina Moseley and I`m a professor of paleoclimatology at the University of Innsbruck. I first started caving when I was about 12 years old. I just thought this was such a cool sport, and then we went underground into this cave. I was just absolutely hooked from that first moment, the adventure of like crawling through a little tight passage and finding out what`s around the next corner. But also, as time went by, I learned that you could do science in caves. I learned that you could be the first person to see a part of this planet that nobody has ever seen. Paleoclimatology is the study of climate change in the past. I`m looking for samples of calcite in the cave. So, this is a mineral deposit that forms from water that enters the cave and this brings with a chemical signature of what the climate and the environment are doing on the surface. And this water deposits layer by layer these layers of calcite and a thin sheet of water like this will lead to a formation that we find in a cave called flowstone and this is a very nice example of a flowstone here on the floor. And then I take a sample of that to find out when in the past the climate has been warmer and wetter there, and that can inform us about what we could expect to happen in the future. I`ve led three expeditions to Greenland so far. We go in the summer, so that means there`s 24-hour daylight. The conditions are fairly rudimentary. It`s like being on Mars in some ways because this is a polar desert. Each expedition takes several years to prepare for. The next expedition to Greenland is in 2023. I`m taking a team to the very north of Greenland, but we don`t know what we`ll find which makes it kind of high risk, but high gain, also makes that exciting. I collected a whole bunch of flowstones from northeast Greenland, and these all formed at times in the past when it was warmer and wetter than today. I`ve got some dates that are like one and a half million years old on some samples, and I can analyze the chemistry in each layer. It`s a bit like looking at tree rings, each layer tells a different a story and a different history about what the climate and the environment was doing at the time. So climate modelers might take our results from Greenland and implement that into a part of their climate model so we can start to build up a picture of what we could expect to happen in the future.
