Where is it headed next? Military officers in Gabon seize power of the Central African nation, placing the president under house arrest. We'll have a live update. And Russia experiences the biggest drone attack on its territory since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine which began last year. Well, Hurricane Idalia now bringing the threat of catastrophic flooding to the state of Georgia after leaving a path of destruction in northern Florida. It made landfall in Florida's Big Bend area hours ago as a Category 3 hurricane. It's the first major storm to hit the state this hurricane season with the water levels right on the gulf coast reaching record highs due to that storm surge. Idalia is now tracking across Georgia as a Category 1 hurricane, packing winds of up to 135 kilometers per hour. Its center is expected to cross into South Carolina soon. And here's what the Georgia governor said a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): People need to prepare, they need to be ready when it's coming through. They need to, you know, move a county or two up if they have the ability to do that. If not, make sure they are in a secure location. Watch out for downed power lines and other things of that nature, and just, you know, if they've got hour or two or a couple of hours before the storm gets there, get a little extra bottled water if you get cut off or lose power. Do smart things like that. We've got a lot of information on the website and obviously the phone number people you can call. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As you noted, there are several bridges that connect the Tampa Bay area to Pinellas County, which is just to the west of Tampa Bay. They've been closed for the better part of the day now. Earlier today, the one bridge did reopen, which means that folks that live in the Tampa Bay area can cross over to Pinellas County, and the folks that live in Pinellas County can also make their way over to the Tampa Bay area. This is how things look like here in Gulfport. This is some of the worst flooding that we have seen in our time here. Again, we were able to get here earlier today because of that one bridge that reopened. The city's mayor out here tells me that the city did not see a lot of wind damage. It seems that a lot of the damage out here was contained to the flooding that was brought on by all of this water that made its way from the storm surge associated with this hurricane. All of that was just pushed into the Tampa Bay area. You then add to that, the rainfall totals anywhere between 2 to 4 to 6 inches of rain, and then, you mix in a high tide, which right now in this part of Pinellas County is already underway. And that is why you're seeing all of this flooding, we do not expect low tide out here until about 8 O'clock tonight. So we're talking about several more hours of all of this water pretty much standing still out here. It has not receded and officials really are trying to get folks to essentially stay away from this part of Pinellas County, because we're right up along the shore. This water really is not going anywhere, and the last thing emergency officials want are for folks to be out here, essentially, not taking the precautions they -- that they've been stressing for the last couple of days. Which is really, there's no point of you being out here, you should -- you could enjoy the walk if you like, but you can't get your car out here, and it's just overall, probably not the safest thing for you to do.",

And so, there are of course, health concerns for folks that are coming out here aside from what you mentioned, right, the possibility that there might be fish out here, there might be some sort of, you know, other type of animals that may have made their way a little bit more inland. And so, officials overall, that's why they're stressing, right, if you don't really have to be out here, don't -- you don't really know what's in this water, you probably don't want to know what's in it any way, and more importantly, you don't want to come across anything that will surprise you including any possible fish.",

He spoke after six regions across Russia came under attack in what was the biggest drone assault on Russian soil since the invasion of Ukraine began. One attack target at the airport and a region in NATO members, Estonia and Latvia, that is hundreds of kilometers away from the frontlines in Ukraine. A Russian state news agency says four military aircrafts were damaged, no casualties are reported. Russia is also intensifying its own air attacks, hitting Kyiv with drones and missiles in a massive bombardment. Officials say two people were killed, calling it the most powerful attack on the capital since the Spring. Military officers in Gabon say they have seized power of their Central African nation from President Ali Bongo. They announced on state television that Mr. Bongo was under house arrest, and they are avoiding the results of that election in which he declared himself the winner of a third term. They're also dissolving the government and closing the country's borders until further notice. The coup threatens the Bongo's family's 56-year rule over Gabon.

      "sentences": "Well, this is something that's been going on for some time. You mentioned what the presidential adviser here inUkraine had spoken of, this war being brought increasingly to Russian soil. That's been a very deliberate strategy. It's about a number of different things, and whilst Ukrainians don't recognize, neither confirming nor denying specific attacks, increasingly officials including President Zelenskyy fairly recently have spoken about the strategy. Bringing the war to Russian soil is first of all, reminding the Russian people that Vladimir Putin is not keeping them safe. It is as President Zelenskyy explained, recently, only just and fair. They're just as the Ukrainian people have to suffer, so too should the Russians. But it is also specifically Lynda, about targeting infrastructure and specifically, infrastructure that allows Russia to keep feeding its forces here in Ukraine. So when you take the attacks of last night, across six regions, Russian air defenses fairly effective, and most of them, specifically for instance surround Moscow, the four airports were closed for a while, a number of planes and flights redirected, but the drones themselves were intercepted. The ones that hit the airfield however spoilt, made it. And what they were targeting and what they hit were transport planes. Planes that could be used to carry troops and weaponry and equipment to the frontlines of Ukraine. And we've always seen over the last few weeks is oil depots being targeted, airfields, military bases. Things that allow Russia to keep feeding this war. And so, it is a deliberate strategy, and I think what is interesting about last night, even if the air defenses were relatively successful across most parts of Russia, that they should have managed to launch as many drones such a large attack. And bear in mind that the airfield that we're talking about where the airplanes were hit, is very close to the Estonian border. But some 600 kilometers from the Ukrainian, they were deep inside Ukrainian territory. In fact, the spokesman for this -- the Kremlin was asked this morning about whether the drones might have been launched from elsewhere, from Estonia or Latvian territory. And the reply came that this would be thoroughly investigated. Another message from Moscow this morning that this massive drone attack would not be without retaliation, Lynda.",

But this massive attack into Russia is a first. How do you assess what's happening?

In part, it's for domestic audiences. In Ukraine, and also in the audience of western allies who were standing by and supporting Ukraine to show that, you know, Ukraine has urgency in this war. This is not just a one-sided conflict in which Russia was relentlessly attacking Ukrainian territory and trying to keep on to -- hold on to the territory that is already taken. But Ukraine has some capability of reminding people in Russia that there is a war. And it is not without consequences in Russia itself. I don't think that the Ukrainians have fully taken the conflict into Russia. There were also constraints around that in part because of course, Ukraine is trying to make the case, that is, defending its own territory. This is not a dispute with Russia over territory or an effort by Ukraine to expand its gains. This is Ukraine's effort to bring its territory back, but by telling Russia and the Russian population that there costs to continuing this war. It's a signal to the Russian population, as long as it is to the domestic population in Kyiv in Ukraine were large, that Ukraine has the ability to make its presence felt inside of Russia.",

I mean, we see for example that Russia's bombardment of Ukraine has in fact strengthened the resolve of Ukrainians.   And you know, throughout history, we've seen that aerial bombardments very rarely have the effect that the aggressor wants it to have, which is to, you know, break the spirits of the people who were under aerial attack. And in the case of, again, Ukrainian drone attacks on Moscow, it's meant more to signal that Ukraine can put certain -- basically, physical objects, have some kind of jeopardy in Russia. But the -- you know, the risk is of course, that the Russians react to this. They rally around Putin and his accusations -- and Peskov, other accusations of terrorism, and it has an unfortunate, unintended consequence of hardening the attitudes of the Russians. I mean, basically, what the Ukrainians are trying to do with this, is to also encourage the idea of Russia eventually, engaging in some kind of diplomacy down the line, by basically saying look, this war is a self- defeating exercise for Russia as well. I mean, I think you know, we have to watch this very carefully because, of course, Putin will try to play this to his advantage. And I think, you know, the Ukrainians themselves are trying to calibrate this accordingly. There are some downsides and upsides to doing, you know, this kind of drone assault on Moscow, Peskov and on other cities within Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The reason why is because of the heavy winds that will come through the area. They want to make sure everyone is safe. On top of that this is the Savannah port, one of the busiest ports in America. That will shut down today. And as you look in this direction, you can actually see the rain and some of the swells coming this direction.

But it was causing, there was a lot of wind gusting about 100 miles an hour. That is when all of the wind damage occurred. Then the eye came over; it was completely calm, no wind to all, actually flew the drone. Some of the shots that I got were flying the drone in the eye. In the second half of the eyewall, it was onshore flow. That is what pushed all of the water that had been pushed away from the shore, pushed it on very rapidly. In just a matter of minutes, it went from a calm eye to strong 75 mile an hour winds, pushing water under homes. Most of the homes there are on stilts. So it really did not cause too much destruction with the storm surge.",

There really wasn't a whole lot that was as bad as that house, maybe just had a weak roof or something like that. There was a lot of homes that had roof damage. They might have had holes in the roof or shingles and things like that. But that was by far the worst home as far as damage goes. Most people are going to come back home and they were already streaming in when I left a few minutes ago. The storm surge just finally starting going away so you can actually travel around.

That is how much these floodwaters have receded. Just look over here. You can still see some houses are still cut off. This would be a field for growing rice and they are still under several feet of water. Those homes are where people had to be rescued. During the storm, rescue workers coming in boats because dozens of people were trapped in their homes. They were in danger of being swept away by the floodwaters, which are still receding here, 12, 20 hours since the storm really left this part of Cuba. It's much still underwater just, tells a story because people on this island do not have resources as many other countries. If your house gets absolutely soaked like it is now, you lose your house. If you lose belongings, it is really very difficult for recovery. So people here are beginning to clean up. We see rescue workers still out doing rounds. We've seen other workers trying to reestablish electrical connections. Phones have been going in and out. But the sun is out and it's a beautiful day.

And it's really for the people behind me, whose homes were underwater for hours. That is where you basically lost everything. And again for Cubans, it is so hard. You need relatives to bring those items again. You just don't find these in stores here so when you lose something, perhaps in another part of the world, you just get on Amazon or go to the store.
