And in just moments, prosecutors will begin their closing arguments in the first criminal trial of a former president, Donald Trump. Before the lunch break, jurors heard from Trump's attorney making their final case. The defense insisting that Trump was not part of a scheme to cover up a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. And that was according to the prosecutors, to influence a 2016 election, something the defense has denied. They also claim that efforts to suppress unflattering media stories were, quote, standard procedure for someone running for office. Now, attorney Todd Blanche said, quote, this is a campaign. This is an election. This is not a crime. Wolf.",

He was asking both parties how he should deal with. He ultimately decided that he was not going to give the jury instructions about what the law is regarding how an attorney can be retained by a client.

Essentially saying that none of these were fraudulent payments, that none of this is to cover anything up, that Michael Cohen was actually doing work for Donald Trump. Now, Michael Cohen testified himself that he wasn't really working, doing any legal work for Donald Trump. But what you saw the defense do is point out a couple of instances that he was actually doing some work, not just for former president, but also for his family. At one point, you saw them point out the fact that he had helped negotiate Melania Trump's contract with Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. At another point, he had Michael Cohen list out all of the members of the family that he had done some work for. And again, in passing a note or showing a note to Allen Weisselberg, Michael Cohen writing in it, call me about the Trump organization issue that I want to talk to you about. So what they've tried to do is say that this was essentially a, quote, unquote, retainer, even though there was no actual retainer in writing to say that these payments were legitimate.

Let's discuss with our panel of legal and political experts. And Laura Coates, you're our chief legal correspondent, our CNN anchor. As you know, Judge Merchan, and he's very well, highly respected, admonished the Trump defense attorney, Todd Blanche, just a little while ago as he was wrapping up, saying a comment about Trump being sent to prison was outrageous, direct quote, and highly inappropriate. What's your reaction to that? It is, in fact, both of those things.LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Remember, the job of the jurors are as, quote unquote, fact finders. Their job is to determine acquittal or a conviction. It is the job of the jurors to determine acquittal or a conviction. Judge to actually sentence someone. Imagine, if you will, this was not a felony case that resulted in a maximum 20 year penalty or one and a half to four years per charge. This is a death penalty case. If you have a juror going back thinking to themselves, gosh, do I want to be responsible for this person's life to end or this person to have this particular penalty? It could cloud their judgment, no longer having to meet the burden of proof for the prosecution, but instead one's feelings and emotional emotions towards the person. You can't have that happen. And as a former prosecutor, Todd Blanche knows this quite well. He would have been on his feet had this actually been a defense counsel having a similar argument. I would also note that David Pecker's testimony has been called utterly damning by the prosecutor in this case, who was going first per New York law. Now, they're going to go through methodically all the different aspects of this case, Wolf, because they have to prove their burden of proof. They have to just not go and undermine the defense, but actually summarize for the jury all that happened over the past four weeks. And one thing they cannot have the jury thinking about is a sentence. Yeah, Joshua Steinglass, the district attorney, is making the case for the prosecution right now in the closing arguments. We're watching this very, very closely. Ellie, what was your main takeaway from Todd Blanche, the Trump lawyer, from his closing argument?",

But ultimately, his argument came down to, you cannot trust Michael Cohen. You cannot convict beyond a reasonable doubt based on Michael Cohen. And we have, as expected, the ADA just a couple moments ago said, quote, you don't need Michael Cohen to prove that, to prove the case one bit. So predictably, the DA, and I would make this argument too if I was them, would say, you don't have to take Michael Cohen's word. Look at the documents. Look at the phone call records. Look at all the other evidence that corroborates him. And ultimately, that's, to me, the key battleground here.",

His campaign management team has shown up, for all for support. But I think in this, in these hours now, as the case is about to be handed over to the jury and everybody's going to wait through this deliberation for this historic verdict of a first time ever former president being on a being charged here with a crime, you see more in force from his family. So there is the more sort of like human emotional support for the man at the defendants table. Even though we have not seen his wife, Melania Trump, in court or Jared or Ivanka in court. But we do see today Tiffany Trump and Don Jr. and Eric Trump in court of his adult children. One could imagine why his wife may not want to be showing up to this.",

He says that Pecker's testimony, quote, eliminates the whole notion that this was politics as usual and that you don't need Cohen to testify to actually proving this. And then he also acknowledges, to your point, Wolf, to be sure, he says, some witnesses want to see Trump convicted. They've attacked him. They've been attacked by him on social media and beyond. But they're trying to essentially do what they did throughout the trial. Remember, Michael Cohen was the last witness for the prosecution. They had all these people who were testifying to pre-corroborate to suggest, whether it was Hope Hicks or David Pecker or Rona Graff, who is the assistant of Donald Trump and others, to suggest they all can't be a part of the murder on the Orient Express. They can't all be guilty here. They can't all be corrupt or in some way biased. They all talk about, to be sure, there were parts of her testimony that were, in fact, cringeworthy. Well, that's an understatement, given you had to visualize a sexual encounter with the former president and her as well. But this is all them trying to suggest and summarize to the jury, listen, Michael Cohen, yes, does he have some sort of a credibility issue, a big one? Absolutely.

Here you just had the prosecution say essentially that the, not only talking about the motive, but Trump wouldn't pay $130,000 twice that after it was grossed out for taxes just because he took a photo with someone on a golf course. Now, remember, they don't have to prove that there was ever a sexual encounter. All they need to suggest is that there was an incentive by a candidate for office who did not want a story to come out. And you go on to say, then they moved on. Within 20 minutes, they've moved on to now Michael Cohen. Think about how different that was from the defense case, where the bulk of two and a half hours of their statement was all about this.And instead, they're talking about how Michael Cohen is understandably angry, that to date, he's the one who's paid the price for his role in this conspiracy, and anyone in Cohen chooses to want the defendant to be held accountable.
