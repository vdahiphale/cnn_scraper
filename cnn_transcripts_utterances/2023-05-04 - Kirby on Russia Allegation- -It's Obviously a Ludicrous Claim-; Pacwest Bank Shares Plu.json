An uptick in attacks against Ukraine just seems to, I mean, logically to be unnecessary. Given that, you know, Russia has already destroyed entire cities in Ukraine, while we didn't need to provide political justification and to whom to do more of that kind of thing. The way the theory has been explained to me, is that, you know, well, it's not necessarily the Russian audience that the Kremlin applying to its countries of the global South, it's China, it's India, it's South Africa, it's other countries in sub-Sahara Africa, who are at the moment, sort of sympathetic towards the Russian point of view. And it's to them in order to maintain that support, that they would have to justify stepping up military action, if they're going to do that. And so the false flag, if it is that will be aimed at sort of smoothing the way creating political justification amongst countries of the global south at the moment is sympathetic to Russia's point of view.",

Clare Sebastian joins us now. Clare much to discuss. We also have the European Central Bank, of course, raising interest rates as well. Let's talk about the Federal Reserve first, because the challenge for them was always going to be in Jay Powell.

He called that meaningful, he did keep his options open by saying that they will be prepared to do more if warranted. But in his own words, he said that he believes that they are closer to the end of this then the beginning. So it was pretty clear that he's leaning towards a pause without actually saying it. Obviously, the big problem that he has, and to a perhaps lesser extent, but still the European Central Bank has it too is that there's a factor in this monetary tightening that they are not in control of and that is banks tightening lending. And he said as well, very specifically that is very uncertain, it's hard to know, to what extent that translates into monetary tightening. That again, perhaps is strengthening the argument for a wait and see to see how it does impact to the economy. But I think this does put us in this new phase when it comes to the fight against inflation, which of course is still ongoing with inflation in the U.S. at 5 percent in the euro area at 7 percent. And that is when to stop and wait and see how the monetary tightening so far as worked, how the banking issue which was in attendance has been created by this tightening cycle plays into that? And I think that's what we saw play out in that Fed Press Conference.",

Since that major tumble off the back of the Silicon Valley Bank troubles in March, I think that has emboldened short sellers to some degree, certainly their profits have been going up over the month of April. And we have the situation where you don't even have to have a run on the bank. PacWest has not seen a run on deposits. It did lose deposits in the first quarter of the year. But they have come up it says since then its uninsured deposits are at 75 percent, much, much higher than what we saw with Silicon Valley Bank. So you don't even have to have those sorts of issues within the bank for the markets to have an impact now that they've seen their share price dropped by some 50 percent in a day. We'll see how they open of course, in the next few minutes, but you still have to deal with this issue. So they had to come out with that statement saying that they are and I \"They said that as previously announced the company has explored strategic asset sales\".

And so when those banks cut back lending it is definitely going to have an impact on their customers who don't have other ready sources of borrowing. So it is going to be a factor.

And now a transition that starts towards methanol and a net zero, it's the first of many, but it's going to be something quite significant. And we're going to do something with it to actually demonstrate and show to both our customers, our public and also public authorities and so on that where there is a will there is a way. And we have taken quite a few risks to have the chips at the time where we ordered it the green methanol that we need to power it was not available.

Now, many tourist attractions they were inundated images of people crammed into buses, bridges, restaurants, they were all over social media. This May-Day is crazy.

Chinese consumers have been unable to travel for an extended period but its clear consumers wish to explore the world again. And Julia here in Hong Kong, you know, there were many Chinese tourists returning to the city for in fact the first time since 2018.
