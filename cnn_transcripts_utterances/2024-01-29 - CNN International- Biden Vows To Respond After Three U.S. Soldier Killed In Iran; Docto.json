      "sentences": "Well, it appears the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, sort of an umbrella group for a variety of Iran-linked militias, was behind this attack, which resulted in the first American fatalities in the Middle East since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Now, as you said, the Iranians have distanced themselves. They said the last thing this region needs is a regional war. Nonetheless, it does appear that the United States believes that somehow Iranian-backed militias were involved in this attack.And certainly, it's important to keep in mind that since about mid- October, there have been almost 160 strikes on American facilities forces in Syria and Iraq. This is the first time it actually happened in Jordan, although we must stress it was very much on the Jordanian side of the Syrian-Jordanian border. But, as a result of this, obviously, the concerns about a possible regional war have intensified. And I can tell you, here in Beirut, Lebanese and officials and diplomats we've spoken to are all very concerned of the -- basically the war in Gaza spreading, having ripple effects, well beyond the Gaza Strip itself. And certainly, the United States is in a very difficult position. If it doesn't strike hard enough, President Biden's domestic critics, of whom there are many, will come down on him. They're already breathing down his neck. For instance, we saw that Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senator from South Carolina, tweeted \"Hit Iran now. Hit them hard\". But, of course, if that happens, there is a very real possibility of indeed a massive regional war breaking out. And keep in mind, Max, that there are U.S. forces sprawled across the Middle East. There are 900 in northeastern Syria. There are about 2,500 in Iraq itself. And in Jordan, there appear to be more than 2,000 as well, in addition to those U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. So, the possibility for this is very dangerous. And in a sense, we are already in a low intensity regional war, as I've said with you over -- on a variety of occasions, and as I said, this is raising concerns dramatically of something much worse.

      "sentences": "Yeah. And that is a big question facing President Biden as he is going through his options to respond to this attack. There has been this aversion to starting an all-out war with Iran, and the White House has worked for quite some time to try to prevent this conflict in the Middle East from broadening even further. But, the President and his team are expected today to start talking through some of those options that the President will have to respond.Of course, there have been many attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in the region since the October 7 attack, more than 150. But, this really marked a significant escalation, because three U.S. service members actually died in this attack, which really raises the stakes for President Biden, as he is charting out his course of action to respond. The President, over the weekend, vowing that there would be a response in the time and manner of the United States' choosing. But, the big question is, what exactly does he pursue? So far, the President's and the U.S. response to these types of attacks have been trying to target weapon or supply infrastructures for these Iran-backed militant groups. But, the President could decide to take things a step further. There has already been a chorus up on Capitol Hill from Republican lawmakers urging the White House to strike directly within Tehran, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator John Cornyn, among those advocating for that position. But, of course, the President will have to balance what this could mean going forward, as they don't want to see things really spiral into a wider conflict. But, the President is trying to weigh those options of how exactly they will respond now that the U.S. has seen a death due to these attacks.",

That's according to 'Doctors Without Borders' which says vital medical services at the hospital have now collapsed, and staff have very low supplies and are being forced to reuse things like surgical gauze. Meanwhile, in Gaza City, the Palestinian state news agency reports at least 10 civilians were killed when Israeli shelling hit a UNRWA school. CNN has reached out to the IDF and UNRWA about the shelling. All of this as CIA Director William Burns joined other intelligence officials for high-level hostage talks in Europe on Sunday. CNN's Paula Hancocks is live for us in Abu Dhabi with the latest on that. We're not getting a huge amount of information because this is intelligence-led. Isn't it?

We've heard from the UN Secretary General as well, saying how serious that is that they have fired immediately nine of the 12 alleged people that Israel say was -- were involved in the October 7 attacks. We understand one has been killed. And two, they are currently trying to clarify the identification of them.But, we're also seeing a lot of pushback from UNRWA, the UNRWA chief, for example, saying that it was shocking that some countries around the world, including big donors, including the U.S., the UK, and Canada, are pulling their funding temporarily until the investigation is done, saying that it is a desperate time for those in Gaza to need this humanitarian aid. The Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, saying two million people rely on this, and that the funding they have at this point will not see them through the end of February. So, they are calling on countries to reconsider this temporary pause in funding. We've seen other countries, for example, Norway and Ireland and Turkey say that they will continue with the funding, and they will watch very closely to see where this United Nations investigation goes. We've also heard from the Israeli side saying that they believe they have significant evidence. They were speaking about evidence, photographic evidence from GoPro cameras, for example, from the day of the attack by Hamas, and the fact that UNRWA and the UN has moved so quickly to get rid and fire some of those individuals that were named shows that they took this evidence seriously as well.

President Joe Biden was briefed on those options by the U.S. Defense Secretary as well as the U.S. National Security Advisor. And these options are short of striking Iran itself, which the administration is unlikely to do, because it doesn't want to spark a regional open war between the U.S. and Iran.So, the drone attack itself, right at the intersection of Iraq, Syria and Jordan, appear to have come from Syria, though that's preliminary at this point. The U.S. could strike Iranian proxies and Iranian- backed militias in Iraq or Syria, or both. Then it could go after weapons or facilities, or it could take that a step up and go after the leadership of these groups. It is worth noting the U.S. hasn't directly attributed who is responsible for the attack at this point. So, that's part of this calculation as well. So, Max, there are a number of options here, including, of course, the scope and the breadth of the attack. We have seen the U.S. strike targets in Iraq and Syria over the past few months. This one, when the U.S. decides to respond, is expected to be a much larger and more forceful response.",

There is certainly political pressure to respond. And it's more than just political here. The U.S. needs to send a message. It needs to do it fairly quickly to these Iranian proxies and to Iran itself that backs, funds, trains and arms these groups. So, there is that pressure to respond. We do expect it will be relatively soon. The U.S. isn't going to wait all that long. But, a direct open conflict with Iran striking in Tehran itself doesn't seem like the administration is likeliest choice at this point.",

The price of one staple eggs is skyrocketing. And CNN's Clare Sebastian has been sharing a rare glimpse of daily life in Russia.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When your husband spoils you with expensive presents, reads the caption, Russian social media brimming with egg memes, making light of a new feature of Russia's upside down war economy with sudden and unexpected price rises. Drive an hour outside Moscow, though, and it's no laughing matter for these pensioners. Of course we notice it. The pension is 13,000 rubles, says (inaudible). That's less than $150 per month. Maybe we buy less meat, says (inaudible). There is still enough for medicines. Egg prices rose 18 percent in December alone, Russian official data shows, more than 60 percent over the year, far outstripping overall inflation at 7.4 percent. As images spread of lines forming outside supermarkets, this purportedly from Belgorod in December, Russia's President forced into damage control mode. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (Translated): I am sorry about this, and want to apologize for this problem. This is a setback in the government's work. Although they say this is not the case, I still think it is. The problem is related to a failure to increase inputs enough. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The government took the not so subtle hint. Eggs were exempted from import duties for six months, and shipments started arriving from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and staunch ally Belarus also ramping up supplies, its President unable to resist a rare dig. ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (Translated): Our own production covers our needs in terms of grain, pork, chicken, milk, vegetable oils, and chicken eggs.",

I think to me, the key issue here is the fact that there are a lot of deaths at war, and then they have to be replaced. These people have to be replaced, the Russian officials trying to keep it very quiet the numbers of how many people have died. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The weaker ruble, a direct result of sanctions, has also pushed up import costs for poultry producers. And then, there is the wartime spending. DR. RICHARD CONNOLLY, ASSOCIATE FELLOW AT RUSI: The budget for 2024 envisages, even adjusted for inflation, record levels of federal government expenditure. So, when you put that alongside of a supply side tightness with a massive increase in demand driven by the state, you've got a recipe for inflation. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): President Putin now poised for the next price spike, a threat to his image of stability ahead of March elections. They're likely not his presidential shelf life.
