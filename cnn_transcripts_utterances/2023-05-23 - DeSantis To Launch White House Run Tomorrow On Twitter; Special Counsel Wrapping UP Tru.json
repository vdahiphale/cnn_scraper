This is an opportunity for DeSantis to get an audience with a platform that has increasingly been embraced by Republicans and conservatives under Elon Musk. Of course, it is also a platform as you mentioned that Donald Trump was famously kicked off of. Elon Musk has since invited him back, but the former President has not tweeted yet -- Anderson.",

This is something people close to the planning have emphasized to me, and is what they are laying out for the coming weeks as soon as he gets into this race. As someone who has covered DeSantis for the past five years in Florida, it is sometimes like drinking from a firehose down there. The media, Democrats, even some Republicans can hardly keep up with his schedule, the speed at which he is announcing new initiatives and thrusting Florida into the spotlight weighing in on new controversies. And they intend to take that playbook to the presidential race and really unleash him on the campaign trail in a way that they say has never been seen before.",

The Ukrainians have provoked Russia, and that was one of the early things that really hit DeSantis that kind of brought him down from being a competitor with Trump is when he came out and he actually was hedging on the Russian war. So, I don't really understand this kind of who is there to moderate, but certainly he'll probably get a little more attention this way than he would have with just another announcement.

It is obviously a way to kind of troll Donald Trump, if you're Ron DeSantis. For Musk, he has really sought to drive this kind of not just free speech and anti-censorship message, but really kind of an anti-woke or a free speech, anti-censorship for the right kind of a message, and that is part of Ron DeSantis' brand also. So I think they both see it as beneficial to one another, but you're right. While Twitter is increasingly becoming a place that Republicans want to spend time in the latest Axios/Harris Poll rankings, this is reputational rankings for businesses just out this week, we found that Twitter is now ranked number 97 out of a hundred reputationally. It is actually an increasingly polarizing brand since Elon Musk took over, so this may work for getting the base's attention, but will it capture a large enough momentum to really help DeSantis?

Here is I think what can benefit him. If the Republican base is still ready for somebody that like, is out to break the system and be angry and own the libs and all of that, and Donald Trump goes down, particularly with these investigations, I think enough indictments, more and more indictments could actually really damage Donald Trump. People will look to Ron DeSantis for that same energy that Donald Trump had without the baggage, however, if Trump doesn't collapse, I don't think Ron DeSantis trying to be Donald Trump light is necessarily bad, because there's nobody like Donald Trump and you can make the argument of well, he can only get elected one time and I could get elected, too.

One is that DeSantis doesn't necessarily present the same dominant number two choice that people thought he might in the beginning, and the other is that Trump really could be compromised by late fall or by early next spring by all of the legal action. You mentioned, the timing of the trial date in this case out of New York. So I think what you are seeing is both Ron DeSantis and Glenn Youngkin kind of lining up their own different timetables for waiting in the wings, if opportunity strikes. They are going to be months apart. I just want to also say this, while DeSantis -- Governor DeSantis is looking at Twitter to make a news flash, he really is also continuing to rely on other media platforms.

CENTCOM promised there would be more information when details of the operation itself were sort of confirmed and became available.But within hours of the strike happening, multiple defense officials tell CNN that General Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, ordered the tweet to be put out, saying that a senior al-Qaeda leader had been targeted. That is, despite high confidence when the strike itself was taken that they knew who and where they were targeting. Officials knew it would still take a few days to be able to confirm who was killed in this strike. And that's at least partially because there are no U.S. troops in northwest Syria, especially after the devastating earthquake in that part of the country. And yet, this tweet still went out. And here we are nearly three weeks later, and CENTCOM hasn't put out any more information about who was the target or who was killed in this strike. Now, CNN has spoken to family members of the casualty who say he was a 56-year-old farmer who lived in northwest Syria with 10 kids and had no affiliation with al-Qaeda. Anderson?",
