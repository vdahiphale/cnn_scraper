CNN's Zach Cohen and Ivan Watson are following the latest on the situation. Let's start first with Zach and talk about what more we know about this attack.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica. US officials saying that both of these drones belong to Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and the first was shot down as it flew towards an American warship in the Southern Red Sea.Now, at that very moment, US officials saying that the warships crew saw a ballistic missile launched inland in the vicinity of a commercial ship that was sailing nearby. As the American warship responded to the distress call of that commercial ship, US officials say another drone flew towards both of those ships, and it was subsequently shot down by an American destroyer. Now, look, this is just the latest in a series of incidents like this that have played out in the Red Sea and frankly, across the Middle East since the October 7th attack in Israel by the terror group, Hamas, and US officials in the US military deployed these ships, this carrier strike group to the region in an effort to deter Iran and other groups that are its proxies, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen from expanding this war that's happening in Israel and on the Gaza Strip at this moment. You know, US officials say that these attacks and these incidents that are playing out in the Red Sea, in Syria, in Iraq are not evidence that the war is expanding. But it has raised questions if the Biden administration is being aggressive enough in protecting US forces it has deployed to the region in response to the October 7 attack in Israel.",

Today, Israeli Defense Forces ordered people in southern Gaza to move even farther south as it expands its ground operations against Hamas. The IDF saying it destroyed at least 500 Hamas tunnel shafts so far in this war, and claims many of those tunnels were in civilian areas and structures. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Israeli forces will not stop fighting until Hamas is eradicated. Hamas says though there will be no negotiations for the remaining hostages they are holding, which do include women and children still, until Israel agrees to a ceasefire. CNN's Larry Madowo and Matthew Chance are tracking all of these developments. Matthew, we will start first with you for this movie.

      "sentences": "Well, the fact that it is now concentrating more of its military efforts in the south of the Gaza Strip, is I think, really significant.First of all, it's that part of the very densely populated Gaza Strip where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have moved over the course of the past several weeks to escape the intensity of the fighting in the north. There are still attacks taking place in the north of the Gaza Strip, there's some dramatic video that's been put out within the past few hours of an Israeli attack for the second day in a row on the Jabalia Refugee Camp, where dozens, according to Palestinian Health officials controlled of course by Hamas were killed there yesterday. And there have been -- there has been another strike today, and so Israel not sort of slacking off as it were on the pressure in northern Gaza, but it is focusing to some extent in the south as well. It has issued a map dividing the Gaza Strip into what it calls evacuation sectors, blocks that it can order the Palestinians inside to leave ahead of any military action. That's an attempt to try and limit the very high number of casualties that have been caused in this campaign so far, somewhere in the region of 15,000 people, again, according to the Hamas controlled Health Ministry. But Israel is also under a lot of pressure to make sure that that sort of high casualty figure from the north predominantly is not repeated in the South. It's also allowing in trucks carrying humanitarian aid like food and water and medical supplies to alleviate the humanitarian problems in the Gaza Strip, as well as that military action continues. But at the same time, the IDF, the Israeli military is saying, they are still going to pursue Hamas, just as vigorously in the South, as they did in the weeks before in the north, and so the whole region is bracing, I think, for what comes next in this conflict.",

Yes, were any of your doctors able to get their hands on some of the aid that was coming in during the truce?HAJ-HASSAN: The aid that is coming in is really a drop in the ocean. Look, if I could describe the amount of aid that is needed versus what's coming in, there is some aid coming in. There was some water, some fuel, some food, but not nearly enough to sustain the population. So we keep being asked about aid. This isn't a question of humanitarian aid anymore. This is not something that humanitarian aid workers or doctors can fix. Every day, the amount of carnage so far outstrips the amount of aid coming in. If you have families that are being displaced to areas that are effectively deserts, what use is it if water gets to the border? That water is not even going to get to them. So I feel like every day, we take 10 steps further into this abyss of something that we haven't seen in modern day history, a systematic violation of international humanitarian law and an exceptionalism that we wouldn't tolerate under any other circumstance. This is a systematic elimination of a population in a thousand and one ways, and it is a violation on so many levels of international humanitarian law and we keep being asked about aid. When you receive hundreds of casualties at the same time into a hospital that has now been reduced to caring for the majority of a population all under extreme duress, hunger, injury, chronic illnesses that have not been treated, and you expect one hundred, two hundred, even 500 humanitarian aid trucks to fix what on a day-to-day basis prior to October 7th needed 500 trucks with a fully functioning health care system, it's absurd. There is no other way to describe it. There is the cognitive dissonance between what is happening on the ground in Gaza and what we're talking about in the media, and what conversations are happening at a political level and something needs to change. This is setting a precedent for all interactions, conflicts, humanitarian interactions in the future. Humanitarian workers are being targeted, doctors are being targeted, journalists are being targeted. Civilians, thousands of children -- more children have died in the last 58 days than any conflict. You're talking about the entire -- you know, we talk about Afghanistan and Yemen and Syria and Iraq and all of these horrific conflicts and the human toll of them. More children have died in the last two months than collectively, annually all global conflict since 2019, and that record, that is a record that was broken a month ago. That is the worst kind of record to break.",

Second, it's important for everybody to understand what a tremendous challenge we are facing, because not only are we going to fight an enemy that is heavily entrenched and underground and hiding, but we are also going to fight an enemy that uses everything civilian for military purposes and uses civilians as their human shields. And it makes it very difficult for us to on one hand, eradicate Hamas, and then on the other hand, not have any civilian casualties. What we are going to do is the best possible way of minimizing civilian casualties that we are aware of, and that is to evacuate Palestinians from the areas where there's going to be the most fighting and tell them ahead of time, enough time realistically that they can take their belongings and relocate temporarily to another area. We've designated a special humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, close to Khan Yunis, which yes, it isn't perfect, but it is the best, currently available solution that we have. And what we're planning to do is to tell Palestinians ahead of time, evacuate, go to the Mawasi, that's the humanitarian zone and we will tell you when it's safe to go back to your specific neighborhoods, not when all of the fighting is done, but when it's safe to go back to your specific neighborhoods. We're trying to be the highest resolution that we possibly can during war, mindful of the fact that many people are concerned with the amount of civilian casualties, taking that into consideration, but really keeping our focus on defeating the enemy because that is what we need to do in order to make sure that Israelis are safe.",

We didn't send our fighters across the border into their communities and butcher their civilians. This was a war that was forced upon us, and a war that we unfortunately have to fight and we have to win. And we are doing our best to do it with minimal civilian casualties. Now, UNICEF is the same organization that together with UNRWA and with other UN organizations, when we launched the ground operations a month ago, more than a month ago in the northern part of Gaza. Two weeks ahead of time, we announced that we were going to operate and we called on people to evacuate. Now, why did we do that? Because we are cruel? because we wanted to humiliate anybody? That is preposterous. We did it because we want civilians out of harm's way, because we want to fight the enemy and the enemy alone. And to claim anything else, I think is borderline reckless. And at the end of the day, the same organizations that should have been helping Palestinians evacuate then are still today, instead of helping people evacuate for their own safety are perhaps infusing them with false expectations, or telling them things that they shouldn't be telling instead of helping them to evacuate. And our intention is very serious, we are going to operate, and we intend to defeat Hamas because that is what we have to do in order to defend our civilians. If we don't do that, Hamas will launch on October 7th attack again and again and again. And these are Hamas words, not my words. So we have the responsibility to defend Israelis. The only way we can do it is by defeating Hamas and we are doing it while trying and calling on civilians to evacuate. Now, I understand and appreciate that he is emotional because he is there and he sees the human suffering, I get it. But at the end of the day, this is as good as we can do in war, in fighting, and to be honest, I don't think that any other military in any other conflict, defending its own civilians just a few kilometers behind it would be doing anything more than we are.",

It's a reenactment, it really sends a chill down your spine, to think what that must have been like for these young children, for anybody but especially a child. Talk us through what these children endured during that kidnapping in 1976. DR. LENORE TERR, CHILD PSYCHIATRIST: Well, they were driven around in blackened vans without any bathroom, food, stops or anything. They didn't know where they were going. And then they were told one by one to get down into that hole and to give up a personal possession, I guess, so that the kidnappers would be able to prove that they had those kids. And then they heard the sounds of being buried alive and incredible that they were able to think about the possibility of escape, and especially with the older boys, digging them up, and being able to pry open the top of a buried truck trailer in a rock quarry, and they got out.
