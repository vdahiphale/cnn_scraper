But first, Louisiana is bracing for dangerous storm surges of up to 10 feet or three meters as Hurricane Francine closes in now. It's picking up speed and as a Category 2 storm. Multiple evacuation orders have now been issued right along the Gulf Coast, with home and business owners boarding up their windows and buying essential supplies before the storm makes landfall.

We're going to have significant power outages, trees down, windows broken, especially in the high rises around New Orleans. So, if you see what you were seeing there with Derek, that is going to happen in a big city, in the city of New Orleans proper, in Metairie, across even Lake Pontchartrain. So, yes, it's a 100-mile per hour storm right now, 160 kilometers per hour. But it is coming on shore here in a very sparsely populated area until you get to that Morgan City where our Derek was, until you get to New Orleans, where it is going tonight. And as the eye tightens up, as we start to see landfall, this eye will get smaller. Kind of that Coriolis force with an ice skater at the Olympics, she brings her arms in and all of a sudden, she spins a little faster, or a lot faster. That's going to happen with the storm. We're not going to lose a lot of power before it does, at least wind speed power, before it does get to New Orleans. So, you're going to have power outages. You're going to have storm surge, especially in those bayous south of New Orleans itself. Could be two to three meters worth of salt water pushing on up. Now, the good news is, Paula, this moves rather quickly. By Friday, it is way to the north and away from New Orleans and not making any additional precipitation. A lot of New Orleans is actually under and below sea level. So, you have to pump all of that rainfall out of New Orleans. That's going to be a problem tonight if the rain continues hour after hour after hour. We are going to see winds probably somewhere around 100 kilometers per hour, maybe even more. It could be 120, it could be 75 miles per hour in the city itself. And all of those huge, beautiful, majestic trees with limbs coming down on cars, on houses, on power lines.

He wasn't able to be really an effective messenger on this. Where Vice President Harris absolutely was last night. And we've contrasted that with the former president not being able to say whether or not he would support a ban, kind of throwing his running mate under the bus. And we know this is something that women voters are watching, in particular men as well. But that gender gap, I don't think he did the gender gap any favors by that answer. That said, more broadly, there was a question in there that asked Vice President Harris about several of the things she's changed her position on, fracking being one of them, but there were several other things that the moderator named. She answered -- sort of answered the fracking question and then Donald Trump kind of did her a favor by taking the floor and -- because I think she had one of her many baits in her answer and then he took the conversation to completely different area. And, you know, voters noticed that. They noticed that there hasn't been some answers for why she decided to completely change her positions from that 2019-2020 presidential race.

And one of the things that Ukrainian forces have been telling us on the ground is that right now they're not only outmanned by the Russians, but they are also outgunned. One of the big problems that they have is Russia's aerial campaign, not just against Ukrainian cities, but of course, also against Ukraine's frontline troops.

They're the ones that are supplying all the different countries in Africa and wherever else has a need right now in the current outbreak. Monopolies are not good to have because it means there's only -- we're all dependent on one company. And this company cannot supply. They don't have the manufacturing capacity to supply what is needed. Africa has stated they need 20 million doses now, and they may receive up to 5 million by the end of 2025. There's just not enough manufacturing capacity. However, that single vaccine, which is the one that is the recommended one and utilized, which is -- it's safe. It's safe for all populations. The older vaccine that used to be utilized, when many of us had scratches on our shoulders as children, that vaccine is contraindicated for pregnant women, for children, and for people with compromised immune systems. So, you've got huge populations for whom that vaccine is inadequate. GeoVax has essentially the same vaccine as that which is currently approved by the FDA and other national regulatory authorities. It's in the process of moving forward through the regulatory and production process. And we could see that in less than a year that we have a product that has been validated to be able to be produced and be able to add to the supply of that. And that's what we're working on feverishly. We have the first component completed that is necessary for manufacturing, and we are advancing that and accelerating the process to try to move it through the remaining steps to be able to validate the manufacturing and be able to provide product to the WHO that they can then utilize in people.

You're going to see states like Pennsylvania, my home state, where, in 2016, I helped lead the Trump campaign to a victory of about 45,000 votes. 2020, we lost that state by about 70,000 to 80,000 votes. I suspected in Pennsylvania that the fate of the United States may hang in this election on 50,000 votes either way. So, you know, the candidates are both could be out and about on the hustings, you know, campaigning hard. So, last night's debate was a big moment for Vice President Harris and that she looked presidential. She proved that she could do it, but she didn't talk about specifics, and I think a lot of people are wanting to hear specifics from her. So, she's going to have to get out and kind of prove that if she really wants to move the needle, but interesting night, nonetheless.",

That notwithstanding, you know, as you were speaking, we were showing the handshake off the top. We did mention as well that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump shook hands again today at the 9/11 ceremony. There they are again shaking hands. Look, when we look at this now, David, how do you see what Kamala Harris did there and again this morning? Was it a power move or do you believe an attempt to appeal to Trump voters to reveal that, look, I don't have contempt for this president and I respect the people who may vote for him who have voted for?

I mean, it was a parade of celebrities and roughly 35, 000 people rallying there that night before the election in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And I thought to myself, well, this doesn't look great for us, right? I wasn't that optimistic when I went to bed that night, but we woke up the next morning, Donald Trump prevailed. So, despite having all that star power there that night before the election to rally people, it didn't make any difference on the election during the during the Election Day. So, I think, you know, it's a nice thing to have. You obviously like to have those nice endorsements, but at the end of the day, it's really not going to matter. What's going to matter is, you know, average working class people across the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, people who work in the oil and gas industry, fracking, gun owners, people who may be put off a bit by, you know, some of the statements that Kamala Harris has previously made. So, she's going to have to make her case. She's going to have to get on the stump and make it in a retail fashion to Pennsylvanians.",

Now, team owners have aligned with other major U.S. sports leagues by voting to allow private equity to own up to 10 percent of a club. But their involvement is being strictly restricted. To explain the changes, I'm joined by Doug Flynn. He is a certified financial planner and co-founder of Flynn Zito Capital Management. Good to have you on. Why is the NFL, the last major sports league, to allow private equity? And why the heck do they need it anyway? I mean, the maximum is 10 percent. These are franchises that are doing very well.

Andlast year, for example, the Washington team tried to sell, and they needed to pull over 20 people together to make that happen. So, what they're looking for is they're looking for the liquidity. Because what happens is there's only so many billionaires that can write a check for $6 billion and not have it be that big of a deal. So, rather than put all these people together and have them take a controlling interest, this allows people to take a minority interest, sell off a piece. All the other major league sports franchises have done this successfully, and it's really the valuation, giving them the opportunity to take on some capital that they might want to use, maybe create some liquidity and keep the valuations where they are. The average NFL team is about $6 billion in terms of value right now.",

They just haven't found the opportunities that fit within private equity, which is basically illiquid, tie it up, they want above average stock market returns. They want way above that. They're willing to trade some liquidity for that enhanced return. And so people don't want to pay all these heavy fees that private equity has to have them sit in cash. So it kind of solves their problem too. This allows them to put a couple of hundred million dollars to work into something that certainly is something to talk about and brag about that you're a part owner of an NFL team, but also does get some of that cash to work. They need to do that. So, it solves some of their, their need as well. You know, when we look at the long term returns of sports franchises and how they do, they really don't outperform the market overall, but rather than having sit in cash and have something that you can't really get in any other way, this is a way to do that.

But nobody can own -- you know, it's a minimum of 3 percent, the maximum is 10 percent and there's a minimum hold of six years. So, I think those are some good guardrails. You're not going into this thinking, I'm going to flip this in a year or two. They've got to go in, they can't get out. It's a six-year hold. So, I think they'll actually expand that over time to sort of match what the other, you know, league, the other sports have done. So, it's a way to ease in there and see how it goes.
