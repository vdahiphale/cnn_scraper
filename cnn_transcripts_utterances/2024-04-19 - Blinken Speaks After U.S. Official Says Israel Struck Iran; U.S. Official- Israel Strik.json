What could Israel have hit? What didn't they hit? And what did they appear to do that the world, this morning, is reacting with an almost shrug? MAJOR GENERAL JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, U.S. ARMY (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, HEAD OF GEOPOLITICAL STRATEGY, ACADEMY SECURITIES (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, the Secretary of State needs to be reticent like he was. We can speculate, we can estimate, and that's what we're trying to do to put a little more color around this. What was not struck last night were the nuclear facilities -- the enrichment capability that the Iranians have and their delivery means for those. What was struck was a military base in close proximity to that nuclear capability.",

When you look at the situation, I think Antony Blinken said the word \"de-escalation\" at least a half-dozen times as he tried to answer questions.How do you see this moving forward? Are we going to start seeing this sort of proxy war return, as opposed to Israel and Iran going directly at one another? JAMES CLAPPER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE,  Well, last night, when I spoke to this, I had speculated that perhaps Israel and Iran were getting past the messaging phase on the escalation ladder. Well, I think we are very much still in the messaging phase. And it appears to me that both Israel, by its limitations on its strike or strikes, as well as Iran's, so far, non-reaction to this, tells me that they both want to step back from the cliff and avoid a wider war. And what this could mean, and hope springs eternal, is that they'll revert to the behind-the-scenes secret war that's gone on for 40 or 45 years. At least I hope that's the case that this doesn't get any worse than it -- than it is. And I think Sec. Blinken's non-comment about this would tell me that one way to tone this down is just not talk about it.",

Keep us posted what you hear in that building behind you.In the meantime, with us now is CNN's Fareed Zakaria, host of \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS.\" And Fareed, I just want people to know stock futures -- no -- oil futures, I should say -- oil futures after shooting up word of the attack overnight are not actually down, which indicates that oil investors are not too concerned about this escalating further between Israel and Iran. I don't want to talk about oil so much as what that might portend. How is the world now viewing this? What's your general feeling this morning? FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\" (via Webex by Cisco): I think most people are viewing this as the kind of measured incremental response that President Biden and the administration have been urging the Israelis to do. But we are in a different place. We are in a different strategic situation right now. Because ever since Israel bombed the consulate facilities of Iran in Syria, we are in a situation where Israel and Iran are now pretty directly and pretty openly hitting each other. That's very different from the 10-plus-year shadow war that has taken place between Iran and Israel. And so, now the question becomes in these fairly direct attacks, are they going to be measured? Are there -- is there -- is there a path to de-escalation as Tony Blinken was saying, or it is possible that one of these gets out of hand and maybe there's a miscalculation? Maybe there is more damage than expected. It's still something that leaves me nervous because until now, you would have -- the shadow war really wasn't a shadow. It was often indirect. It was often using proxies. Well, we now have this Iran versus Israel. Each time one hits the other, the other feels they have to do something. That's the typical security spiral where one side does something that it believes it has to do. The other side can do nothing and that triggers a further one. So up goes the ratchet. So far, it's been calibrated and calculated, but it could get out of hand.",

It has been urging Israel to have a very limited response to the -- to the Iranian -- roughly 300 drones and missiles launched against Israel. So what it has been trying to do as much as possible is to keep this back in the shadows and not to have the United States, in some way, involved. Because that then -- that's when you would see oil prices really shoot up. In other words, that's when you begin to worry about a much larger geoeconomic and geopolitical spillover.",

Everyone thought this was actually going to take a couple of weeks though, right, and it's actually happening a little bit faster than anticipated.A full jury now impaneled, plus one alternate. And it's really just a cross-section of New Yorkers. There's an investment banker, a speech therapist, a teacher, a lawyer. There are some who are seated on the jury who have been open about the fact that they are not big fans of Donald Trump. One person saying they don't like his persona. Another person saying they believe he's self-serving and selfish when it came to being a public servant. There are people who said that they've read quotes from \"The Art of the Deal\" and they like that he speaks his mind. So a really diverse section -- cross-section of jurors here. Like you said, seven men and five women. Now, the task at hand today, as you just said, is finding those alternates -- as many as five the judge wants to look for. There are 22 people that are still -- have to go through that 42 questionnaires and that's what they're going to start with today. And then, like you said, we could have opening statements come Monday, believe it or not, in this historic criminal trial. One thing to point out, though. After those opening statements are done then, of course, the prosecution will call its first witness. Well, at the end of court yesterday, the defense asked if they could have a list of who those first witnesses might be, and the prosecution essentially said no because we don't trust the fact that Donald Trump won't go on social media and talk about those witnesses. And the judge pretty much agreed with that and said that that's fine. So it's very possible we, the public, and the defense won't know who these first witnesses will be when they are called. So this could be somewhat of a signal of maybe a contentious few weeks as this trial gets started, Kate.",

So the defense knows who is coming overall, generally speaking.What they said they didn't want to do is hand over the order of the first witnesses. So the defense's lawyer stood up and said we'd like to know the first three witnesses, and the prosecutors said we don't want to do that because then we're going to see attacks against those people in the next few days. And the judge agreed with them. So it's not that they don't know who is coming broadly speaking; they just don't have the order of the first few. But it is rare. In most cases, the judge wants everyone to know what's coming so that things can run in a more orderly fashion and everyone's ready. It's only not happening in this case, of course, because of the repeated violations of the partial gag order in place about talking about witnesses who will be part of the proceedings.",

I don't think we would have had a jury in a week in many other courtrooms. So I'm impressed with that and I think I'm hopeful for the rest of the proceedings moving more quickly because of it.It's also a very heavily professional jury. Usually, you see a lot of government employees, a lot of retirees. We're not really seeing that here. These people have jobs and they're jobs that require higher levels of education. So that's going to be important I think. This is a case about financial documents. Prosecutors are going to have to ask the jury not only to kind of digest these documents and find whether the defendant is guilty or not, but it includes this extra step of finding that the intention was to break another law. So I think they'll be happy to have these jurors with a higher level of education and analytical skills.",
