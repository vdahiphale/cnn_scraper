The other thing that I took away obviously, is a warning to Americans to leave Russia immediately. Level 4 as we were told, and that is another indication of where we are right now. It would appear really that, you know the gloves are off. There's no expectation of anything predictable at this point. So the U.S. government is warning and urging Americans to leave.",

How complicated this has been. There have been swaps, including the one last year that got the U.S. basketball player Brittney Griner back to the United States. But there were -- the White House and the State Department have been trying for months and years to get another American Paul Whelan out. He's been in Russian prison for more than 1,500 days. The State Department and Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently said that they had a good, serious offer on the table, but the Russians were not wanting to engage. So that shows you how complicated this is. Another thing coming out of White House briefings earlier on, was the fact that they were unable to say whether they believe that this, taking of an American was in any way related to the indictment of that GIU Russian officer in a federal court recently. So, I think it's very difficult just to work out what the Russian motivations are from Washington to start with, given as the State Department says that lack of communication. This is why -- to Jill's point, this is so complicated, and there's really not a great deal of hope that you know, this can be done quickly, to put it that way.",

A law that said you can't call the war a war. You cannot use information that isn't given to you by the military in Russia, obviously. And so, already any type of reporting on military large objects, the war, how it is going, anything like that is very complicated and sometimes dangerous because the laws are written -- those laws are written in a very broad way. So they could be interpreted to basically to arrest anyone. But now, we're not even talking about that. We are talking about espionage, and that brings it into an entirely different as I mentioned top secret area where we may not even know what precisely are the charges. We may not know where Evan Gershkovich, which is precisely. He may not get access to a lawyer for a while. There are a lot of things that simply will not be clear, and then we're going to have to have the diplomatic reaction by the United States, possibly calling in, you know, the Russian ambassador.

Now, what we don't know is, was he reporting on that or there's some other report that he was talking to Russians about how they feel about military contractors. Things like that. But the point of this is that any normal reporting that you were doing, and it appears that's precisely what he was doing can be suspect because the laws are so broad. So they decided to take him. Why did they decide to take him? Well, he speaks for us. You know, he comes from a Russian-American family. He knows the country he had worked before for other organizations in Russia. So he's -- you know, he's a very effective journalist, and I think that is a problem for the Kremlin. They simply do not want any information about this war that doesn't come directly from them.

That is something that's going to be possible to do. All the normal rules of diplomacy, international relations between the West and Russia have broken down. You know, it's not even clear that the Russians care that much what the rest of the world thinks of its behavior, not just on this issue, but in Ukraine and everything else. So, I think we have to look at this against a backdrop of all that. It's not just the question of individual cases, potential prisoner swaps, et cetera. This is taking place against a wide backdrop of deep antagonism, the greatest hostility between the United States and Moscow, at least, since the cold war and even, you know, during some of that time of the cold war. So, this is a deeply serious situation, and it's very difficult to see even how you can make small steps to get towards a point where you can actually be talking to the Russians seriously.",

You know, why would -- was the White House signaling opposition again and then coming back around and changing minds? Should there be improved communications, particularly for House Democrats, who are -- this is the second time now. JEAN-PIERRE:  So look, we -- I'm going to do a little bit of a laydown because nothing has changed here. We have been very consistent on this process.

After Don Cheadle played Rusesabagina in the film about a hotel manager who helped to save about 1,200 people during Rwanda's 1994 genocide, in which 800,000 mostly ethnic minority Tutsis were killed by Hutu extremists. His act of courage gained him international acclaim but also made powerful adversaries in Rwanda. He was a vocal critic of Rwandan president Paul Kagame. In 2020, he was arrested by Rwandan authorities while traveling. And the following year he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  He is convicted of being a member of an illegal armed group and participating in terror activities. MADOWO (voice-over):  The Clooney Foundation for Justice called it \"a show trial,\" saying it lacks guarantees of fairness. His family has since made several appeals for his release. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Frankly, there are days when I cry a lot. I can't sleep. I don't eat at all. Just knowing that my father is sitting in a room with no windows, no light and no one to talk to, no one he can trust in this country. MADOWO (voice-over):  On Friday there was a new twist to his saga. The Rwandan government said it has committed to reduce Rusesabagina's sentence after a request for clemency. Recently, president Paul Kagame's signaled he was willing to move forward on the issue.",

But he is alleging that he has permanent brain damage from this and that it will exist within him for the rest of his life. He also -- and it is documented -- he had four broken ribs but it's been the battle of the experts because there were MRIs from before the accident, the collision and after the collision.

Now Gwyneth Paltrow is attorney in these closing arguments said that what she has gone through in the last few weeks -- and she's been a punching bag in this trial for his side. And it is true.
