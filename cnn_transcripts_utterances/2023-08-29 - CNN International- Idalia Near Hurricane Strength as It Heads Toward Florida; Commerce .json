      "sentences": "Yes, Max, what they agreed on is actually a new mechanism, a new platform that would allow U.S. officials to explain their export control decisions to their Chinese counterparts. And as you know, that is very much pointing to the contradictory nature of Raimondo's mission doing this visit.Because on one hand, obviously, she's here to stabilize this economic relationship. Trying to promote U.S. business interests. But on the other hand, her own agency, the Commerce Department, has been issuing a growing number of export controls targeting China, especially in terms of semiconductors and advanced computing. That of course, has greatly angered the Beijing leadership, including President Xi Jinping himself. So what Ramondo has been trying to tell Chinese officials is these export controls. Out of national security considerations account for only 1 percent of Americans export to China, so there's still a lot of room for cooperation for growth. But that kind of arguments may not be very convincing to Chinese officials, who simply don't see much difference between de-risking as she and other officials have been saying and decoupling. Now the good thing is she's trying to focus on the positive, as you said. She met with the tourism minister, obviously in a bid to revive the once booming industry of outbound travel from China to the U.S. And ironically, the one thing that's been helping her mission is the Chinese economy itself facing a lot of problems. The post COVID rebound not doing nearly as well as officials has hoped for. And that, of course, has actually given officials from both sides more wiggle room to work together to stabilize this economic relationship -- Max Bianca.",

And Wagner supporters like Dmitri (ph) in Moscow are simply not being heard. Yevgeny Prigozhin's death, he says, just confirms that there are fewer and fewer of us who really think about our country, our history, and our goals.
