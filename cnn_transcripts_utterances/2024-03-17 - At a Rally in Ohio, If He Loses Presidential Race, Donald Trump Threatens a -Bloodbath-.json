Both Donald Trump and his team believe that he will do very well in this state in November. Instead, he was here to boost his endorsed candidate for the Ohio Senate primary, and that's businessman Bernie Moreno. Moreno was locked in a messy, contested three-way primary, and Donald Trump really came to the state in the hopes of giving him that last-minute boost and more support ahead of that race on Tuesday. But even though Donald Trump was here to talk about the Ohio Senate primary, much of his speech focused on the general election. He attacked Joe Biden and blamed him for what he argued were the many charges that he is facing. And he also offered a new line that I have yet to hear yet on the campaign trail, and that is essentially that he argued if he were to not win reelection in November that there would be a bloodbath in this country.

The high turnout, of course, is key for the Kremlin, which wants to claim that Vladimir Putin, who's certain to win, has a strong public mandate for a fifth presidential term.Amid the tightening of Kremlin control, no significant opposition candidates have been permitted to stand. But a spate of disruptive incidents at polling stations across the country point to the degree of frustration with the election process. Election officials say more than 29 polling stations across 20 regions of Russia have been affected, mainly by individuals pouring green dye, ink, paint or paint into ballot boxes to spoil votes that have already been cast. There's also been a number of arson attacks at voting centers with election officials saying that at least 214 ballot boxes have so far been ruined. Well, the attention on a final day of voting will focus on protest calls from the widow of the late Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who's been telling supporters to gather at polling stations at midday, local time in their Russian regions, and to spoil their votes, or to vote for other candidates other than Vladimir Putin. It's not yet clear what that protest will look like, but the Russian authorities have issued a stern warning that anyone engaged in unauthorized election protests will be dealt with severely by the law.

This very tough legal system which cracks down on any sign of dissent. I think, it is significant to see this affecting these elections. We understand now some 29 polling stations have been affected, more than 200 ballot boxes, obviously, not a majority in a country of 140 million people and 11 time zones but it is not something you tend to see in Russian elections and therefore significant. As for whether it moves the needle, very unlikely, and certainly it's not something that Russian state TV is focused on. They are very heavily focused on turnout, which is, of course, in an election with no obvious opposition candidate the key metric for the Kremlin is it seeks to prove that it has a renewed mandate for a fifth term of Vladimir Putin. Right now, we're seeing turnout at the beginning of day three of this vote above 60 percent, the magic number will be 67.5 percent which is what Putin and the election, in general, achieved in 2018. So, I think the idea, certainly, if you speak to Russia watchers is to get more than that to show that he has overwhelming support from the people and certainly the mandate to continue with the war in Ukraine.

And that's just because several blocks out, you've got perimeter after perimeter that is set up by the community and works with the police.So, the police essentially allow the community to do what they need to do to set up these blocks at entries and exits. And the community, in turn, helps empower the police so that they can then do their patrols. But for many of them, it's about setting these up to block what is not far from here, and that is an expanding gang territory. One that has been trying to encroach on this community, in particular, many times over the past year or so. And it got to a point where community members, according to one police commander, had to take justice into their own hands. And they were able to take into custody 14 suspected gang members. They then executed those gang members right in the middle of the street. It was a very public display, but for them it was to send a message to other gang members to keep out of their community. It hasn't stopped the gangs from trying to push further and further in, but for the folks who live here, they say everyday life has gotten increasingly difficult. We see a few street vendors, but not many. When we were here three weeks ago, many of the sidewalks were filled with street vendors. Folks now simply don't have things to sell. And so, they've resorted to trying to secure, as best as possible, using the police's help, some of the supply lines trying to bring water and food into areas like this. I asked some of the community members how is it that they were able to stay afloat? And he said, we rely on each other. Essentially, they will have some of these community members go door to door, collecting food, maybe some money, some water. And then that provides some substance for the folks who are securing these communities. If you ask who's in charge, they look around and they say no one. That's why they've taken matters into their own hands. If you ask, what do you need? What can help Haiti in this moment? The first thing that most folks have told us is for the International Community to not intervene in the way they have in the past. Instead, they want help in the form of aid, but they also say that they need some sort of security backup. What that looks like, they didn't really articulate. Folks really didn't want to go into too much detail in trying to explain what that added security might come in the form of. But for most here, it's just about trying to figure out how to get to tomorrow, and knowing that tonight could bring another round of violence. David Culver, CNN, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

This was suggesting, we understand, that something like 40 Israeli prisoners, all female prisoners, the elderly, the sick and the wounded would be freed, would be released. They have been in captivity since they were abducted on October 7th, in exchange for up to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. That is what the Hamas proposal entails in the first phase of what would be a multi-phased agreement. The second phase would see all of the remaining Israeli hostages freed in exchange for all Palestinian prisoners. And in between though, Hamas is demanding that Israel agree to a complete end to the war and also to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. Now, that seemed to be a non- starter, and presumably is what Prime Minister Netanyahu was alluding to when he said that Hamas' demands were still, in his words, absurd.

The U.S. delegation, they claim, had talked about a secret uranium deal with Iran and some kind of military cooperation with Russia, that they didn't appreciate that criticism, and they said they are a sovereign nation. They can choose who they want to work with.So, this complicates the U.S. operation not just in Niger, but in the wider Sahel region. There are two U.S. bases in Niger, including one in central Niger, which was built at a cost of about $100 million. It's a drone base that's been carrying out major operations in this wider region. There are major insurgencies occurring around this -- these countries, especially Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. Insurgencies from armed groups affiliated to Islamic State and Al-Qaeda. And many Western nations used Niger as a linchpin for the counterterrorism operations here, and all that now has been thrown in doubt, especially considering that the Nigerians also kicked out the French military and they finished withdrawing in December. There is just a small amount of German and Italian troops that are left in the country, Kim.",

Have a look here, this volcano near Reykjavik is erupting for the fourth time since December, spewing smoke and hot orange lava out of the ground. Authorities had warned for weeks that this latest eruption was imminent. Nearby communities had already been evacuated and police declared a state of emergency in the area. No flight disruptions have been reported.All right. Joining me now is Vidir Reynisson. He is the Director General of Civil Protection and Emergency Management in Iceland.

And then the second part is going south, going close to the village of Grindavik, but also the barriers that we built there is diverting the lava away.So, we are in a safe zone at the moment, but the roads and all the infrastructures could be in risk if this keeps going on for maybe six, eight hours more.
