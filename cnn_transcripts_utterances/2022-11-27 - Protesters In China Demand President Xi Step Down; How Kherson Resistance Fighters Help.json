I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Extraordinary protests across China showing no signs of slowing down as anger over the regime's Zero COVID policy boils over. Lockdowns have taken so much from the Chinese people. Money, social freedoms, and in some cases their lives sparked for these now widespread demonstrations. It came a few days ago when a high rise apartment fire killed 10 people in the southwestern part of the country. Many locals there are saying that lockdown measures delayed firefighters and prevented people from escaping. At one protest, crowds can be heard chanting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, others are calling on Chinse President Xi Jinping to step down holding blank pieces of white paper, a symbolic protest against censorship in China. Security personnel are cracking down, however. This video we're going to show you now shows police beating and dragging a protester across the ground. Amnesty International is warning that in the coming hours and days we could see much more of this. Let's go now to CNN's Selina Wang at a protest in Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This is also where the authorities have urged people to stay at home because the COVID outbreak is severe here. Now the area is also important because this is where the American embassy is over there, there are many foreign embassies over here. There is a heavy police presence. I am surrounded by police, they're telling me to shift in a little bit, and if we just turn the camera around you'll see there is a row of police. There is -- mostly young people who have gathered here. And many people are also holding white papers in their hands which is a sign of solidarity against censorship. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Crowds chanting that Xi Jinping step down, calling for freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and so on.

I saw it in Cuba from time to time. So these authoritarian states have a real problem. It's sort of like a pressure cooker, you have to decide if you're the authoritarian figure in charge, how much pressure you're going to let off.In other words, how many protests or demonstrations, how much of that are you going to let happen so that people sort of relieve their internal pressures, their own internal frustrations with the government, and then when do you crack down and when do you let people, for example, emigrated and leave the country because a lot of people will just leave and sometimes that's good for the government, too. So it's a real, real balancing act. But in China, I really doubt that we've got a situation whereby you're going to see sort of an overthrow of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese leadership. The Chinese Security Services like all intelligence services in authoritarian countries spend a lot of time trying to penetrate, get inside these group so that they can have spies inside to know what they're up. So it's a difficult balancing act but I don't think we're going to see the collapse of the Chinese government any time soon.",

They understand that that's a very strong reaction inside of Ukraine. But also you've got, you know, you've got an elderly an elderly population, you've got very young population, you got kids in hospitals, some of whom are being killed by the artillery fire. So, you know, the Ukrainians are in a difficult position but the Russians also understand that as I was talking about earlier the West is also under some pressure. How long can Europe continue to push on with the energy issues that the Ukrainian war is resulting in? Difficult times for them. How long is the United States going to continue the massive shipment of weapons there? So they're playing for time.

But the issue here is Putin recalls how badly this ended in the Chechen wars that he was involved in when he first came to power. In both the Chechen and the Afghan wars, you had a really strong internal movement on the part of the mothers of Russian soldiers fighting in that time in Chechnya and also in Afghanistan.And surprisingly these self-organized groups that were not funded by, you know, the United States or by any other foreign government like the Russians often accuse these opposition groups of being, these were mothers that actually caused real, serious problems in Russian society for the Russian government because of those previous wars. Vladimir Putin remembers that and does not want that to happen again in Ukraine and so I think he's trying to be proactive here and sit down, provided these are photo-opportunities, you're absolutely right. It's all propaganda. They're cherry picked. But it plays well internally inside of Russia to other mothers who might be concerned about, you know, what their kids and sons specifically are being put up against in Ukraine.

He acted alone, but now he was one of Kherson's resistance fighters. ARCHIE, KHERSON RESISTANCE FIGHTER (through translator): They were wasted.

Trump claims that he didn't know who Nick Fuentes was because he came to the dinner as a guest of rapper Kanye Wet who is also had a history of making antisemitic remarks.Former Republican Congressman Denver Riggleman joins me now. Denver, good to see you. Thanks as always for joining us. What was your reaction to all of this and I guess these various Trump explanations which don't add up. DENVER RIGGLEMAN (R), FORMER VIRGINIA REPRESENTATIVE: Not shocked. Not surprised. I mean, that's the thing that he's done in the past. Right, Jim? He's done something appalling and then try to say, well, I didn't know about it or I didn't know these individuals. But when you have, you know, an antisemite and neo-Nazi go to Mar-a-Lago, I mean, it starts like -- feels like a bad joke but when you have those two people actually dinner or lunch with a sitting president I think all of us should be appalled. And I think any excuse that he has is something that he's done in the past, it's his playbook. And what he does is he does something awful. He denies it or says he doesn't know about it. And you get to the point either he's one of the most incompetent individual we've ever actually encountered as POTUS or he's an antisemite and a white nationalist. So, you know, either-or, right? So that's the thing that really struck me about a meeting with a knuckle dragger like Nick Fuentes and honestly, you know, somebody Kanye West who is just about antisemite. But again having a neo-Nazi and an antisemite at the table and having discussions with them I think should tell every -- should actually tell the American public everything they need to know about Donald Trump.",

And I think Trump is not a good enough chaos agent for them anymore. You know, it's interesting, you know, they leave Mar-a-Lago and all of sudden he starts talking smack about Donald Trump. And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that they're trying to make money. That's always the root cause of this but the real part is that they're hateful individuals with bizarre xenophobic and racist ideologies that are out there, you know, say they're going to run for president. And my guess is they still will come around to supporting Donald Trump after all this because this is just a reality show, Jim.

I need to ask you about this report in the \"Washington Post\" that some staffers had raised concerns that Congresswoman Liz Cheney had focused so much of the report on Trump. One former committee staffer was quoted as talking about how they had all given up prestigious jobs believing this would be a fact-finding mission for the public. The staffer says, quote, \"But when the committee became a Cheney 2024 campaign many of us became discouraged.\"You worked on this committee, put a lot of work into this committee.

And I think what got to me was some of the comments from the committee directed at the staffers. And listen, I don't know what the outline of the report is. I don't know what the appendices are. I don't know where they're going with it. I don't know what it's going to look like when it's all over. But I think if you have the committee talking about staffers that are uninformed, why are they uninformed?If you're talking about staffers that are cowards, I mean, that's the first cousin of traitor. And I think we need to have adults in the room and take away the hyperbole, right, in some of these emotive outbursts when it comes to staffers who obviously thought that they needed to go on another direction and the committee who didn't. The other thing, too, I think it's unfair for me to criticize the committee before the report comes out but Liz Cheney isn't the only one making decisions. She has an outsized influence on the committee but the committee decided to do that. So what bothers me I think more than, you know, even the leaks that came out of there in that report which did stun me a little that it was reported is that we're this close to a final committee report. And you have people or you have the leadership saying that they have uninformed staffers, or they're cowards, or things of that nature. My question is, as somebody who's led people in battle, right, I've been there, somebody who's been a CEO, somebody who's looked at situational awareness and targeting of terrorist networks, somebody who's run multimillion dollar programs, I wonder if there was a leadership challenge that wasn't met with communication within the staff and the leadership element.
