Again, dragging the U.S. into the conflict. Again, high risk brazen Israeli attacks and assassinations like the one we saw back in April on the Iranian consulate or against Hamas's political leader in Tehran. That obviously also raises the risk of the spiraling out of control. So there are a very large number of risks here on the table. The chance of miscalculation always exists in cases such as these.",

Usha Vance is making it clear that she's firmly in her husband's corner. Tom Foreman reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) USHA VANCE, WIFE OF SEN. J.D. VANCE: The reality is, he made a quip in service of making a point that he wanted to make. TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Usha Vance is on the trail and on defense for her husband J.D., the Republican vice presidential nominee, under sharp fire for in 2021, calling Democratic leaders -- SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. U. VANCE: What he was really saying is that it can be really hard to be a parent in this country, and sometimes our policies are designed in a way that make it even harder. FOREMAN (voice-over): Team Trump has been eager for Usha to speak up for the Republican ticket and share her story ever since her husbands stumbled out of the gate. Born to Indian Hindu parents in California, Usha studied law at Yale, clerked for Supreme Court justices, and met J.D. who wrote in his memoir, after a single date, I told her that I was in love. They married, started a family with three kids, and even though Usha was once a registered Democrat, she is now firmly on message for the Republicans. U. VANCE: The J.D. I knew then is the same J.D. you see today, except for that beard. FOREMAN (voice-over): It's been rough as e-mails have emerged from years ago of J.D. saying, I hate the police, I hate Trump and what he represents. I really see the racially offensive views of Trumps supporters. And old friends have questioned the couple's integrity. SOFIA NELSON, J.D. VANCE'S FORMER YALE CLASSMATE AND FRIEND: Well, I don't think anyone knows what J.D. or Usha believe because they have literally changed their principles and every imaginable issue. SEN. VANCE: I love you. I wouldn't be here without you and I will never forget where I came from. FOREMAN (voice-over): Through it all, Usha Vance has dug in for her husband, for Donald Trump, and for whatever that may bring. U. VANCE: If I didn't feel that the ticket, you know, the Trump-Vance ticket was able to do some real good for the country, then I wouldn't be here supporting him. And J.D. wouldn't have done this.",

I'm dubbing them the ABC.Rebeca Andrade, Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles. Not only the first all-black Olympic gymnastics podium, but a true show of love, support and respect between the trio. They're all game-changers in their own right, with Biles and Chiles bowing down to celebrate Brazil's Andrade as she celebrated her first Olympic gold at this, her third Games, after coming back from not one, not two, but three ACL tears. And she won. She took the victory in that floor competition. It is really women supporting women in the best possible way. Biles, though, signing off here in Paris with three goals and a silver overall. What she's described as more than her wildest dreams. And speaking of iconic pictures, a fair few produced 10,000 miles away from here in the French territory of Tahiti, venue of the surfing competition. You might have missed while you were sleeping that Team USA's Caroline Marks took the gold, the 22-year-old World Surf League champion, upgrading her fourth-place finish from Tokyo in the best possible way. Or maybe we should be talking about the best possible way, the way that Mondo Duplantis did it in the pole vault. The world champion successfully defending his gold from Tokyo by setting a new world record. The 24-year-old just keeps on rewriting the record books. He's raised the record six centimeters in the last four and a half years since he first broke it. And to put that in context, it previously took 23 years to move it that distance. But he joined us here on the rooftop a short while ago. It's fair to say he's enjoying the celebratory party. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
