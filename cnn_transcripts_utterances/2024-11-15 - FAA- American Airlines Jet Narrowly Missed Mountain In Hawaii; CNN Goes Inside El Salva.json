The flight took off from Honolulu and it was headed toward the east where there was a pretty decently-sized mountain range, about 3,000 feet is where the peaks top out at. This flight was at 2,500 feet, so 500 feet below the mountain range when the air traffic controller came on over the radio and told this flight to turn right to the southeast quickly and also began to climb faster.
