      "sentences": "In just hours, Donald Trump will head to Washington, DC for his third arraignment and arrest in four months. His charges were fueled by lies that he crafted and orchestrated. That's according to Special Counsel Jack Smith in that indictment.New polling from CNN, though shows that the majority of Republicans still believe those lies. Look at these numbers. Nearly 70 percent of Republicans in this new poll say -- in these new numbers that President Biden's 2020 election win was not legitimate. Joining us now, a Democratic congressman from California, Ro Khanna. He also serves on Joe Biden's campaign advisory board. Congressman, thank you for joining me. I want to ask you about those -- the polling in just a second. But on today, which is going to be a moment to watch in this historic day of Donald Trump's arraignment in Washington, DC, what do you think today means for Donald Trump in your view? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, I'm proud that it affirms the rule of law and it affirms a lot of the work that the House January 6th Committee did. The reality is that there was an elaborate plot that the Trump administration had to-- try to overturn a legitimate election. And we in this country need to hold elections sacred. We can't have politicians after the fact trying to nullify what the voters say. And so, I'm glad that the rule of law will be upheld.",

But that's not what is criminal of -- what the allegation is, is that he was interfering with the Justice Department, interfering with White House personnel to plot the overthrowing of legitimately elected electors, and trying to subvert that process using government resources.

And it's no secret that Donald Trump is leading decisively in the polls and is likely to be the Republican nominee. And he's out there and continuing to say the election was stolen.And that's why 2024 is really going to be a decisive election in this country. In my view, it's going to be a rematch between President Biden and President Trump. And the American people really are going to get to weigh in on whether we count our votes, whether it's OK if you lose an election to try to subvert the process. That's what's at stake.",

He came in towards the end of COVID.And that was an economy that was hurting because of unemployment. We had to have spending to bring the unemployment rate down, and that hurt with inflation. So, he inherited a tough situation. But what did he do? We've got construction going on around this country because of the infrastructure bill. We're bringing home manufacturing with semiconductors. We are bringing the fundamental technology to have the industries of the future with batteries and electric vehicles. Some of that is going to take time, but we're beginning to see the results.

He wants to bring people together. That's what his inaugural was about. That's who he is as a person. And I think he knows that if he starts commenting on these things, that aspiration becomes harder. It's the hardest thing to do in American politics. I hope he'll continue to try to do it.

He put her in a cinderblock cell that he made in his own garage, I think we have photos of.
