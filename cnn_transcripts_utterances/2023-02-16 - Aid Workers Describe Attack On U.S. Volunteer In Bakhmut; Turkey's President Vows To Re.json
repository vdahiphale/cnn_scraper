But, of course, the window for finding survivors is closing very, very quickly.And as you mentioned, it is freezing cold temperatures. The situation on the ground in southeast Turkey and indeed in northwest Syria is dire to say the least. And there are huge humanitarian concerns. We have seen a groundswell of support from the international community and from the Turkish government, of course, in terms of providing that humanitarian assistance. But the message that we're hearing from aid groups is that there simply needs to be more. It is not enough for the thousands and thousands of families left homeless in the wake of this earthquake. And, of course, there are still so many there in southeast Turkey hoping -- waiting for news of their loved ones who are still missing and presumed beneath the rubble of the collapsed buildings across that region. Now, just in the last hour or so we've heard a press conference from the Turkish foreign minister alongside NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg. There we heard that NATO has committed further support for the Turkish government in aid of those impacted by the earthquake, including plans to send thousands of tents over the coming weeks in order to house and home many of those who have been left homeless by the earthquake. And I have to say here in Istanbul we're already beginning to see families being evacuated to this city. They're being hosted in university dorms, some of them by volunteers who are opening up their doors to vulnerable families. But, of course, this is going to be a long and hard challenge not only for the Turkish government but, of course, for those who have left -- been left with absolutely nothing -- Christine.",
