To that, Garland really reflected distress that he did not interfere while at the same time refusing to answer any specifics about these ongoing investigations.And Republicans, especially Jim Jordan, they kept pressing on why it took so long for David Weiss to be named special counsel. Of course, Garland just appointed Weiss special counsel last month. Even though this investigation into Hunter Biden has been ongoing for years. Here's the exchange with Jim Jordan.

He has said in gaggles that he thought people who were going before the January 6 committee should be prosecuted. So, I think multiple things can be true here.

And once we will be -- we'll be presented with the whole package, we'll be able to decide upon our priorities. But I want to maybe remind your viewers that three years ago, we just celebrated three years to the Abram Accords when we normalize relations with the UAE, with Bahrain, with Morocco. There was also a price that Israel paid. We agreed to postpone applying the Israeli law in some areas of the West Bank, what we call Judean Samaria. And I'm sure that because many people today in Israel, they understand the importance of having peace with Saudi Arabia, then the Prime Minister and the government would decide upon our priorities once a full deal would be presented by the administration.",

Giuliani denies through a political advisor what happened, what Hutchinson claims happened. I want to bring in Alyssa Farah Griffin, former Trump White House communications director.

And she had told me something similar with probably a little less detail than I saw in the Guardian reporting, but just about him getting handsy. And I want to be careful in saying this, but it was a known fact within the Trump White House that Rudy Giuliani was a liability.There was often a worry that he would show up to the White House complex perhaps inebriated to the point where I was actually given a directive from the President to make sure that he wasn't trying to do stand ups on television on the White House lawn because you just weren't sure what he was going to do, what he was going to say. This frankly, tracks with things that have been reported before that Giuliani has done. And, I mean, I think it's a shame for a lot of us who once admired the former mayor to see him descend into this. But I absolutely believe her account, and it doesn't in any way shock me that this happened and no one in the Trump White House hierarchy did anything about it at the time.",

But I personally witnessed behavior that I thought was inappropriate.I've spoken openly that I reported behavior that I thought was inappropriate by the former president to female staff, to the former White House chief of staff. Nothing was done about it at the time. And listen, you're the company you keep. The former president was very close to Rudy Giuliani. He knew the reputation he had. He knew the concerns that he shared and that his staff shared about how he might arrive at the White House and how he might conduct himself, yet he kept him around. And, by the way, took his advice about, you know, how we're going to challenge the election results over his handpicked White House Counsel. The whole thing is a mess. It shouldn't be really a surprise to anyone. But it's still stunning in this day and age that a White House staffer would experience that on the ellipse of the White House.

A sobering statistic from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the child poverty rate in the United States has more than doubled in the last year, from 5.2 percent to 12.4 percent. Democratic New York Congressman Jamal Bowman blames Congress for the rise writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, quote, let me be very clear, things like the Child Tax Credit and SNAP reduce child poverty by refusing to extend and expand these lifesaving programs. Congress is complicit in this crisis.And Congressman Bowman joins us now. Congressman, good to have you on. It can be difficult to see the direct result of government policies on people's lives, but this seems pretty clear. The expanded Child Tax Credit gave more money or tax credits to low income families after it took effect, child poverty dropped to record lows. Why did Congress let it run out? REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY): Republicans let the Child Tax Credit run out after Democrats cut child poverty in half by 50 percent in 2021. If we are not taking care of our children, we do not have a democracy. We do not have a society. When you see high child poverty, you see high levels of childhood trauma. You see high levels of children struggling with mental health and substance abuse, and you see higher levels of violence. So it is on us to do something about this issue once and for all, not year to year. We need to end child poverty in America once and for all.",
