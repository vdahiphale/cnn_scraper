We have got at least ten, probably more than that. Human beings have come face to face with this man and had conversations with him. We all know the clerk up at the hostel. There's two cab drivers, one that picked him up initially when he first came back in November, took him up to the Hilton. The cab driver that took him from Central Park up to the George Washington Bridge bus terminal. Don't forget the clerk at Starbucks that he bought two power bars from. We've got a lot of people. Now, if he did pay cash as your reporter just said, it's a possibility that means he went face to face with a ticket clerk at the George Washington Bridge terminal. Weve got a lot of people. You know what, Jessica? I'll tell you what I think. Right now as we speak, I think we're very, very close. If you listen to Joe Kenny, the chief of detectives of New York City, you see the statement he made today. He's preparing to take the case to court. That means we're very, very close. I'm not saying that he's identified yet. When he does get identified, it's going to break in one of two ways. They're going to say we've identified him. Here he is. We've made the arrest. Or it'll be a day or two down the road, and we've identified him. We can't find him. Here's a better picture. Right now I'm pretty sure we've got DNA, we've got partial prints, we've got human beings who came face to face and talked with this man. They're very close if they haven't identified him already. We will know soon. (CROSSTALK) DEAN: Do you think it's possible they do -- they know who this person is? They just haven't told the broader public yet?",

And I know Joe Kenny knows this because we worked together in that precinct 25 years ago. There's a tunnel that goes from that bus terminal down to the New York City subway system. And then it's a quick ride down to the Port Authority on 34th Street. So I'm sure we got detectives looking at the footage down at the Port authority at 34th street as well. There's a lot of eyewitnesses. They're more valuable than any of the science. I mean, if the DNA you know, there's got to be in a database for the DNA or for the prints to mean anything to us. It means you got to be not just arrested. You know, if you apply for certain jobs, you apply for a pistol permit, different things like that, you get fingerprinted.

The backpack is near the lake, so. Yes. Dredge that lake. When they finish, and they come up -- if they come up with negative results, will they go to the reservoir? I don't know.

You got to send your people down there. I'll bet we got a team of detectives out in Minnesota right now, too talking to the family, neighbors. Did he coach youth sports? Did he belong to some civic organization or fraternal organization like the Elks Club or something? You need to have face to face communication. You know, experienced detectives can read people.

This is very important to him. He put a lot of thought into it. Now, some of what he's done could be a smokescreen, a subterfuge, the writing on the bullets. It may be related to the denial of coverage and the animosity for the health care industry. It could well be. And that he meant that. But here's something, Jessica, that those bullets, their live rounds, they're inside the magazine of the gun. They're not going to end up on our crime scene unless the gun jams and he's got a racket to clear the jam. That's how a live round jumps out of the gun. You don't go into a shooting expecting a gun to jam. So he wrote, I mean, we did have one of the words I understand was on a spent shell. One of the words was on a live shell. Did he plan on emptying that magazine and firing all his shots. Like to -- he put these words on those on the bullets that stayed inside the magazine. And the only reason they came out is for an unplanned event, the gun jamming. He put a lot of thought into it. I don't think he's the sharpest knife in the -- in the drawer there but he did put a lot -- I'd say it's important to him. I say it is very important to him.",

He sort of ticked through what he viewed as the accomplishments of the administration and of the Pentagon over the last four years. That includes new partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, the aid and security assistance given to Israel, and then of course, the aid and security assistance given to Ukraine that has allowed it to stand up to Russia for nearly three years.

Congressman, thanks for being here. I first just want to get your reaction to this nearly $1 billion in aid for Ukraine. REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): Well, I think it's an important show of commitment to Ukraine. And there's a lot of talk around there needing to be a negotiated settlement. Certainly coming out of President-Elect Trump's camp. I think that's probably true but you have to negotiate from a position of strength. And you can't do that if Ukraine can't defend itself. They are very dependent upon the U.S. and the 50-plus nation coalition that is supporting them. They need our aid. They need our assistance to stop the Russian onslaught and force Putin to the negotiating table.

It didn't quite work out that way. So I don't know that he has a specific vision. The only logical way it can play out is for Ukraine to be strong enough to stop Putin, force him to the negotiating table and get to a negotiated settlement. But step one is stopping Putin, and he has upped the onslaught in recent weeks and months. And that has to be stopped. So it could play out that way.

Look, Elon Musk has some good experience in that. J.D. Vance has some experience in that so there's reason to be, I don't know if optimistic is the word I would use, but certainly there are some folks that we could work with there. But when it comes to the cabinet picks, when it comes to Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard there's a ton of concern about the role that either of those would play in this broader effort.

I mean, they can get advice and be guided. But at the end of the day, as Chuck just pointed out, these folks have six-year terms and they all view themselves with their own individual agency. Some of them may not ever run for re-election again. Some of them benefit from feuding with Donald Trump. And some of them take and have national security views that are far different than what Trump has laid out or what Hegseth has laid out. All of this will, of course, go into the pot of a confirmation hearing, and we'll see what comes out on the other side.

He's not taken office yet, but you can already see the attitude change of the American posture and the posture of the rest of the world to the United States of America.
