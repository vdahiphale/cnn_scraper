After years of investigating, Special Counsel John Durham releases his findings on the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia probe. But does his report actually reveal very much? A violent attack on a lawmaker's office. A man wielding a baseball bat injuring a staffer and an intern on her very first day. And we have new video that appears to show the same man involved in an earlier attack. Explosions ring out across Kyiv just hours after Ukraine's president wrapped up a whirlwind tour securing new aid to his country's fight against Russia.",

Nonetheless, Donald Trump claimed vindication posting on his social media platform that it was evidence of a scam. Durham's report finds many mistakes by the FBI including what he calls confirmation bias. He concludes that the FBI discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia.

This overnight barrage complex assault involving a variety of different missiles. The head of the armed forces in Ukraine himself has now come out and said 18 missiles, various types were used, launch from the sea air and land that Ukraine from the north.So, you really get a sense of the sort of scale of the attack. Even though it has to be said that we've seen the scale of these sort of overnight barrages from Russia lessons since those attacks on the energy grid during the winter. Now, of course, this comes after President Zelenskyy is what -- one Ukrainian official described as very successful trip to Europe. Russia on Monday, threatening retaliatory action after the U.K. pledged hundreds of air defense missiles and attack drones to Ukraine. I think it can be viewed in that context. I think it can also be viewed in the context of the upcoming counter offensive which we are expecting from Ukraine. Ukraine has warned in the past weeks that Russia is trying to wear down its air defenses ahead of that campaign. So, that may be part of that strategy. I think it's also interesting to look at this in the context of Russia's resources. Ukraine has said that while they believe they have enough missiles to sustain these kinds of barriers, they may not have enough resources to launch a significant offensive action of their own. So, it looks like we're going to see more of this kind of attritional style aerial assault tactic from Russia as we head closer to this counter offensive.

      "sentences": "Well, OK. So, the biggest challenge with A.I. right now is first, we have a world that has been trained to be afraid of technology, right? There's a lot of technophobia. So, you have a lot of people really terrified almost over the top about what A.I. can do.Now, that's not saying that it isn't really scary. The real challenge with A.I. is that we don't know where it's going and what's going to happen with it. And that there are some bad actors out there who are going to use A.I. to create problems to send out what we call deep fakes where they're portraying a video of someone and it's not really them, or using A.I. to create content that's not authentic, and thereby causing millions of people to think things that aren't true. And so, there's a lot of challenges with managing this fast content generation that A.I. can do that feels real and feels authentic, but isn't. But the other side of this is that A.I. is actually a fantastic tool that can help a lot of people. In any business category you name A.I. is bringing a lot of services and solutions that are very positive. And so, the challenge with this is how do we manage this in a way with regulations that tapers the bad actors, but still leaves it open for innovation. And that's the yin and yang of this right now is how do you do both at the same time?",

I also think that tech companies are going to need to step in harder and really manage this, you know, really provide some guardrails for consumers and other folks that are using their solutions.And then I think the general populace is going to need to step in and make some demands as well. So, when we see a piece of content, we need to know is it authentic or not. Is this a real piece of content? And I think tech companies can help that by providing some verification processes so that we know OK, that was a real piece of content. So, I think you need a trifecta here. I think you need government, I think you need tech companies and I think you need consumers all working together to figure this out.",
