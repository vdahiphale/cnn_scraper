This after Israel and Hezbollah exchange fire with rockets, missiles, and air strikes early this morning. Yes, Israel fired more than rockets, guys. Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia, says its first phase of retaliation is now complete after it launched about 300 rockets towards Israel. Israel, however, says it struck first preemptively to destroy rocket launchers and firing positions in Lebanon, heading off what they described as a major attack planned by Hezbollah. All this took place as negotiations continued in Cairo for an elusive hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. We have CNN's Jennifer Hansler and Nada Bashir tracking these latest developments. Nada, first to you, I wonder what negotiators there in Cairo have been telling you about the status of the talks. It's remarkable they continued today despite the fire that we saw across the Israel-Lebanon border last night.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right. And there had been hope that we might see some progress, there certainly was some optimism around the fact that we are seeing Hamas delegation here in Cairo. That delegation has now left in the initial outcome of these talks. The initial statement that we have received from Hamas is frankly no different than what we've been hearing from Hamas over the last few weeks.They continue to reiterate that they want to see a deal which reflect the deal presented by President Joe Biden in late May. A deal which they said they agreed to in early July, and sticking points that we know where the key focus of these discussions appeared to remain, those gaps appear to not have been narrowed according to the initial assessment of Hamas' response. They have said that they continue to reject any suggestion of a longer-term presence of Israeli troops within the Gaza Strip. We know of course that Israel had presented a revised proposal which would see a reduced number of Israeli forces stationed along the Philadelphi Corridor separating Egypt from Southern Gaza, that has been once again rejected by Hamas officials. They've also called for further guarantees to ensure that there is a potential transition to a lasting permanent ceasefire. And we know that Israeli officials have previously said that they would welcome a temporary pause in that first phase, a six-week pause in fighting, but so far we have not heard any explicit endorsement of a transition to a permanent ceasefire in the second phase from Israeli officials. That is something that Hamas has been clear they want to see. That is something that mediators have insisted they also want to see. But, again, these talks are expected to continue. We are hearing from officials that there will be talks of a technical level from members of both sides as well as mediators taking place over the coming days. It remains to be seen whether we see a full-on peace summit or negotiation talks being held again. But clearly there has been no progress or limited progress in trying to narrow those gaps between Israel and Hamas despite the bridging proposals put forward by the Biden administration. Of course, pressure is continuing to mount not only because of the deteriorating situation in Gaza, not only for the family members of hostages still held captive in Gaza, but also, as you mentioned, as we continue to see tensions mount in the region.",

That Hezbollah has said this is it for now. The for now is something to be, the qualitative difference here, the quantitative difference actually.And so what is to come for the -- before the next now, and I think what's happening is that the Hamas and the Israelis are shutting down I think seriously this time to find way forward. Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire. You cannot have a permanent ceasefire unless Hamas has a permanent recognition of the state of Israel's right to exist. And so for Hamas to insist permanent ceasefire, you say, well, yes, how about recognizing I have a right to be secure and safe as a sovereign Jewish country?",

Iran seems to be keeping its powder dry. Hezbollah carried out what can only be described as something of a fizzled attack last night. But it seems to be quiet for now.

It's there as a deterrent. If that deterrent fails, then it will be defensive in nature to shoot down whatever missiles can be fired at Israel or us. And then to punish the Iranian should they decide to go forward. So I think that's had a deterrent effect. I hope it continues as such.The one thing we don't want to see is an expansion of the war because what is said to be regional is really global and consequence, anytime you have a major conflict in that region, price of oil will spike. People will go without oil, without food supplies, et cetera. It would have an economic consequence that would be global in its impact.

Congresswoman, thank you so much for being with us. The U.S. helped Israel track the incoming rockets, but said it did not participate in the strike inside Lebanon. What do you think the U.S. approach should be to try to keep this from spreading into a wider regional conflict? REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): Thanks for having me and what I am really proud and thankful for is that the U.S.-Israel relationship has the strength to be able to make sure when it comes to an imminent threat like this one, there is awareness and the ability of us to provide intelligence assistance without kinetic assistance to Israel is real. And our policy is always that Israel needs to be able to defend itself by itself. Vice President Harris said specifically in her acceptance speech on Thursday night, that she will always stand by Israel's right to defend itself and also ensure that she can. And so knowing as Israel did that was an imminent threat looming on the part of Hezbollah, any nation would be well within its rights to keep its people safe and Israel launched a preemptive strike to ensure that they could do that.",

In their charter they're sworn to Israel's destruction, sworn to the killing of Jews, no nation should be able -- should have to accept a terrorist threat living on their doorstep, nor have 109 hostages that have been there for 324 days. This is absolutely essential that Hamas take this deal so that they can get assistance and humanitarian relief, and the aftermath of this terrible war and to move forward. Peace can be restored.

There is no winner in a suffering competition.You had Keith Ellison who mentioned then talked about the importance of eliminating suffering and this was, I mean, the suggestion that was made of an uncommitted delegate speaking was one that there was no commitment to ensure that they would have a unifying similar message.

She's 33-years-old from Arizona and her family is saying that they are still hopeful that they will find her alive. They say they love her and care for her and want everything to be focused on this search.So, they're holding on to hope as the days go on. They believe that she was swept away by the waters on Thursday. Authorities saying that she may be near the Colorado River confluence and what they're saying is that on Thursday, these monsoons triggered those flash floods and eventually she likely was swept away. She was essentially, not the only one that was stranded after Thursday's storm. In total, 104 people had to be rescued and that included her husband. So, authorities are saying that her husband was rescued and is safe and so are the other people that were rescued that day, but they continue the search for Nickerson. Now, authorities also saying that this was something unexpected in this area, but it is the season for these monsoons. So, they're telling people that they need to be careful. The other thing here is that they will continue this search for as long as they will, or they'll let us know essentially when they will continue this. And they are saying that among the people they rescued were some of the hikers and also some of the tribal members. As you mentioned, Paula, it was Governor Katie Hobbs, who activated the National Guard. They had to use Blackhawk helicopters to get these people out of there and I want you to listen to what one of the hikers had to say after she was rescued? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They had to shut down the area for locals and for hikers. There was a tribal village that also had to be shut down just about eight miles under essentially the canyon rim.
