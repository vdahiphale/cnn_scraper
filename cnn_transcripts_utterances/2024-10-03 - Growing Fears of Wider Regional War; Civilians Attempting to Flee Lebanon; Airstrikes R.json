Also ahead, U.S. President Biden says he's open to Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities, but says retaliation won't come today. I'll discuss with a former U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon about what could come next. And the Dominican Republic set to start massive deportations of Haitian migrants living illegally in the country. We're live in Santo Domingo this hour. But first, a Lebanese Minister says Israel's offensive on Hezbollah is destroying his country, urging an immediate ceasefire. But the war is only escalating today with powerful new strikes on Beirut. And these are the latest pictures on the latest strike, in fact, in southern suburbs considered a stronghold of Hezbollah.

This is how they described their border operations as limited, localized, targeted raids. We're yet to see if that expands and grows into anything else. But already, you know, they appear to be going over on foot. Those are the images that the IDF sends back from pictures with their troops. The IDF is characterizing this as something that's small and they come back, and therefore, it's a very high toll that we're hearing already. This is not troops that are, you know, miles inside of Lebanese territory according to the IDF. So, I think this gives us a sense that there's a stiffer resistance and obviously, a much greater price to pay than the IDF is paying by dropping bombs on Beirut and other Hezbollah targets. And it was interesting today, the army chief of staff, General Herzi Halevi, was at the border today and he said that he'd already read through the review of how these soldiers had died yesterday, and what he said was that he -- what he saw were commanders leading from the front, that when there was a firefight, they led from the front. And I think we were noting yesterday that there were many staff sergeants, first sergeants, captains, among those killed of the Israeli -- of the -- among the IDF casualties and death toll. And that was because we've heard it now from the -- from their commanding officer, if you will, that they were putting themselves in the firing line. But it's very clear, you know, when you hear a speech like that coming from the Chief of Staff, what he is doing there is sort of giving a role model to the rest of the forces to carry on a pep talk, a morale talk. But he's also said very clearly that they will continue with these operations, and that they're targeting, they say Hezbollah infrastructure along the border. So that they're -- so that the Israeli civilians who live along the border, the 60,000 can go back. But the fact that the Chief of Staff was there today talking about those deaths and also saying that there already been a review into how they had died. I think that tells you that how hard that has actually hit.",

It's the first time an Israeli strike hit the center of the city since all-out war between Lebanon and Israel in 2006, and even then, strikes like this were rare. This is the second time this week that we've seen attacks outside the southern suburbs, Hezbollah's seat of power. The target appears to have been a Hezbollah-affiliated health authority office in a residential area, and several medics were killed. This happened in the middle of the city, in the middle of the night with no prior warning, a terrifying development for the people of Beirut.

And both Hezbollah and Israel have spent the last 18 years implementing the lessons learned from that stalemate. Hezbollah's arsenals are bigger, they have more sophisticated weapons, longer-range weapons, and they become battle experienced by propping up Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. The Israelis, for their part, have kept their eyes on Hezbollah and have worked on penetrating them in terms of their Intelligence, which we've seen in results of that. Already, in the last two weeks, there have been more Lebanese killed than were killed in that entire 34-day war.

And with only a few weeks left until the November election, in fact, 32 days ifyou're counting, Donald Trump's January 6th case is back in the spotlight. Special counsel Jack Smith's newly unsealed 165-page document provides the fullest picture yet of his case. And it argues actions Trump took to overturn the 2020 election were in his private capacity, not as a President, but as a political candidate. Therefore, Smith argues Trump is not entitled to protection from prosecution that the Supreme Court justices identified, if you remember, back in July. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is tracking this new filing, she joins us now from Washington D.C. And Katelyn, this new filing, I mean, I saw  it yesterday when the news broke. It is detailed, it is lengthy. What does the special counsel just lay out in this? Just break it down for us. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Yes, this isn't an ordinary legal filing in court. This is the fullest summation of the evidence against Donald Trump. The case against Donald Trump, that the Justice Department has, and that they want to take to trial and present to a jury. So, it's a 165 pages. The thesis that Donald Trump was acting on his own behalf, for his own personal gain as a candidate and not the President after the 2020 election, as he was sewing discord and trying to claim the election was fraudulent. That is the legal argument they're making, and they need to make that because they're going to have to convince both the trial judge and then quite very likely the Supreme Court, that this was all private activity by Donald Trump. Here's how they write about it. \"When the defendant\" -- that's Trump, \"lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office. At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private criminal effort in his capacity as a candidate, the defendant used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process. The defendant used these lies to inflame and motivate the large and angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and to disrupt the certification proceeding.\" That's the case that they want to present to the jury. They also lay out in this filing, how they're going to do it. They say they have his tweets and they can prove that it was Donald Trump writing and sending those tweets, including one, harassing Mike Pence on January 26 as the rioters were closing in on the Capitol building, they also have witnesses who will testify against him and have laid that  all out, even Pence's own notes.",

When the number of commercial flights shrunk, we first worked with the remaining carrier to make seats available. And when we found that there were still more American citizens that wanted to leave, we organized our own flights. And we'll continue to do everything that we can to help American citizens who want to leave get out safely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, Kylie, I knowthat the State Department had organized chartered flights. It was supposed to be for today. Do we know if those have left and how many people we're talking about here? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, the second plane left today. Yesterday, there was one plane. Today, there was a second plane. In total, about 250 Americans and their direct family members were on those flights out of Lebanon. The State Department says that they will continue to organize flights of the like such -- so long as they see the demand from the Americans in Lebanon that there need to be these flights. They're also working with the commercial flights that are going out of the country to try and get seats on those planes for Americans. So, effectively, the State Department is trying to respond to the demand signals that they're getting in. They've given out a form for any Americans in the country to reach out to the State Department, to learn more about the efforts underway to provide them with, to provide them with support to get them out of the country. So, we'll continue to watch this space very closely. It's also a very delicate one because sometimes there are Americans who want to leave and then they decide they want to stay because they have family members there. So, this is typically a situation that is delicate and can have different degrees of certainty when it comes to if people actually want to leave the country or not.",

UNICEF has a team here on the ground, and we were supposed to go and do distribution today of essential relief items, but it was 100 meters from where one of the airstrikes took place last night. So, it was not safe. But our team spoke to the people in the shelter who said that the children, even today, were absolutely traumatized from what had happened last night, and we're even afraid to venture outdoors in case more airstrikes would be coming for them.
