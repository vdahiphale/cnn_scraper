Inflation 7.7 percent last October. Despite those numbers, retail sales are expected to increase in this Holiday season. This Holiday shopping season is expected to break records. Today alone on Saturday, a day after Black Friday, more than 60 million Americans are expected to go out and hit those stores and try to get those discounts, those deals.

Well, I want to bring in a travel expert, Clint Henderson is a managing editor at \"The Point Sky.\" Clint, thanks so much for joining us. I want to show some of your tips to dealing with delays and frustrations. Let's go down the list. First of all, you say have a backup plan. So, what exactly do you mean by that? Do you mean have other flights in mind? Be prepared to rent a car? What are you getting at? CLINT HENDERSON, MANAGING EDITOR, \"THE POINT SKY\": So all of the above. You want to make sure you know what other airlines fly the route that you want to take. So, if something goes sideways with American Airlines, for example, and you need to get to Seattle, you should know what other airlines operate that flight. So when your flight gets canceled or substantially delayed, you can call American and say, \"Hey, put me on this Delta flight.\" Know the flight number, know the information, have that plan in your back pocket, so you can be one of the first people to be rebooked if something goes wrong. Same thing with renting a car. If obviously, you're not going to drive to Seattle, but if your trip is a little closer, renting a car might be the best option if there's a lot of delays.",

So not only could you potentially be alerted to a delay, or cancellation via the app, you could also be one of the first people to rebook yourself if that flight gets canceled, so that enables you to rebook yourself right away as you run to the Customer Service Counter, and you call the airline and you ping them on social media.You want to be able to rebook yourself, because remember, there's less flights now. Flights are full. So you want to be one of the first people off that plane to be able to try to get on the next available flight before everyone else does.",

So, it is possible, follow them on Instagram, follow them on Twitter, if something goes wrong, try that avenue. Because if you're having to go get in the Customer Service line, who knows how many people are in front of you. You should be using all the tools in the toolbox. You know, try to rebook yourself via the app, get on social media, call the airline and stand in that Customer Service line.

So the backlash is growing over Trump's decision to host the rapper, Kanye West and White supremacist and Holocaust denier, Nick Fuentes, a podcaster who has a large and growing following on the far right.And as you know, Paula, West became engulfed in controversy in October after repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories during an appearance on a podcast. But this week, he showed up at Trump's private Mar-a- Lago club with Nick Fuentes, whose beliefs are so offensive that he has been banned from most major social media platforms. Sources told our Kristen Holmes that Fuentes was a guest of Kanye's and was not invited by the former President, but that they sat at a Thanksgiving dinner table with others for roughly two hours at Trump's outdoor patio table. And a source briefed on the dinner said that Trump was engaged with Fuentes and found him to be very interesting. Fuentes, who was at the Capitol on January 6th made it clear to the former President that he had a good understanding of Trump's base and told him that they prefer it when he speaks off the cuff and ad libs during his speeches. So, at one point during the dinner, sources told Kristen that Trump declared that he liked Fuentes and in a video that West posted on Twitter, a Mar-a-Lago debrief as he called it, he claimed that Trump is really impressed with Fuentes. But this is creating considerable controversy for Trump who announced that he is running for President as you know, just over a week ago, and he has already made several attempts to explain Fuentes' presence on his social media platform, Truth Social. And I just want to read you the President's statement on this. He said: \"This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a- Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.\" So of course, he had the opportunity there to condemn the ideology or apologize for hosting a Holocaust denier, and he did neither of those things.

Then we saw DeSantis slowly climbing up, 15 percent in the early part of this year. By the middle part of this year he was at 23 percent. But Trump was still basically holding in the low 50s. But look at what's happened since the election. Trump has actually fallen below that 50 percent mark. He's now at 44 percent. Ron DeSantis is at 32 percent. That once 40 plus point lead is now down to just a little bit more than 10 points. There are a slew of other candidates that are basically pulling right now in the low single digits.

You can see this here in the exit polls, favorable view or approve of Donald Trump's job performance, look at that. In 2018, 45 percent; 2020, 46 percent. Those aren't great numbers, but they're certainly much better than the percentage of all Americans right now.
