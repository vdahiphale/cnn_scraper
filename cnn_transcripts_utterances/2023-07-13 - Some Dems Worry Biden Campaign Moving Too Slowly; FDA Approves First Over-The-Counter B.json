We have some new CNN reporting about growing concern among some Democrats who think the president's reelection campaign really needs to pick up the pace. CNN spoke to a half dozen senior Democratic advisers who felt the Biden's reelection bid isn't taking full advantage of the built-in head start granted by being the incumbent.

What are they saying he's not doing?EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, look, in the next couple of days by Saturday, we are going to find out how much money Joe Biden raised for his reelection campaign since launching at the end of April. The general feeling is that it's going to be a decent number but not a huge number. Not as much as all of those nervous Democrats who can't ever stop being nervous Democrats would like to see to reassure them there's this burst of enthusiasm for Biden. And that is the leading to the latest round of questions about Biden that seem to be the perennial question of how much support is there really for him? Is he the strongest candidate going into 2024? The Biden circle, of course, would say we've done this a lot of times before, and look, he is the president.",

He stays out of the fray by not going after Donald Trump every day, by not going after some of these Republican candidates, and he's doing his day job. And his day job, as we have seen all week long, he's had some big successes.What some Democrats that I've been speaking to are afraid that he's losing is the true power of the incumbency. He has the benefit of time. He doesn't have a serious primary challenge, so is the campaign using this moment to sort of rebuild his support among Latino voters, among African American voters, among some base voters that they will need? Are they doing voter registration efforts in Latino communities in North Carolina, in Georgia. So, some basic things that sort of can be done in the off year. When it's not just the moment where, you know, the campaign is coming to voters at the time of an election. So are they using this time to sort of build the party? The DNC would argue that, yes, they are. But that is sort of a question, using the power of incumbency in many different ways here. I think they'll start doing more of that in the coming weeks and months. But that's sort of what's the question. If you look back at 2011, the Obama campaign was already built up. The headquarters was in Chicago. They had a few hundred staffers. He has not yet opened his campaign reelection headquarters in Wilmington. It's going to be there. There's a handful of people working at the DNC, big difference.",

That means no prescription, no doctor visit needed to get birth control. Opill will be available online and in stores in early 2024. Joining me now to talk about this is Dr. Leana Wen, CNN medical analyst and a former health commissioner for Baltimore. So, Dr. Wen, you have advocated for this change, what do you think the practical impact is going to be here?DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, I think this is a big step and one that's really overdue, Brianna, because over 100 countries have already allowed for some form of over-the-counter contraception in the form of birth control pills, and the U.S. is long overdue in joining this. We also know that Opill, this particular pill was first approved by the FDA in 1973, which is 50 years ago. And so, we have decades of research showing how safe it is and how effective it is. It's 99 percent effective in perfect use, 93 percent effective in typical use, which is more than other forms of contraception that are available over the counter. And so, we're in a situation now where there's really significant unmet need. 19 million women of reproductive age live in contraception deserts. 8 million women in this group are uninsured. And we also know that half of all pregnancies nationwide, nearly half of all pregnancies nationwide are unintended. And so, there really could be a significant impact when it comes to reducing unintended pregnancies and breaking down these quite significant barriers to access.",

    },

      "timeStamp": "15:35:00",
      "speaker": "WEN",
      "sentences": "That's right. I think with every medication there are always benefits and there are always risks, and those risks need to be communicated. So for example, with Opill, this particular medication is progesterone only, it's not the one with estrogen. And so, there's no association, for example, with blood clots as there would be if there's estrogen in it.But Opill should not be used in individuals with a history of breast cancer. There are certain medication interactions. For example with some barbiturates, with some seizure medications, St. John's wart and people should be aware when they're taking the medication. Also, it's not 100 percent effective, and individuals need to know that. And they need to know that it needs to be taken at the same time every day in order for it to be as effective as possible. All that said, we also have many other medications over the counter like aspirin and Tylenol that have risks associated as well. And so, I think it makes sense for this to be made available over the counter, and this is one of the reasons why the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, really other major medical organizations have endorsed making it over the counter because it is safe and effective and helps to reduce a barrier to access. Which I should say, we really need to improve health care access for all. I would love for every young person, every woman, every person to be able to have access to comprehensive health care, but if that does not exist, we at least should not be having more barriers to contraception.",

Officials insist there is no real reason for concern. They say they've determined neighboring properties are safe. They have mobilized experts who handle sinkholes and geotechnical issues. I'm glad there are people who do that. And in Washington, the Secret Service today concluded its investigations into that bag of cocaine found at the White House, though without identifying a suspect. The agencies says that FBI lab results from the packaging found insufficient DNA, could not retrieve any fingerprints either.

This is an appellate case that was overturned so he was initially convicted of this crime. Says it was humiliating that he pulled on her pants and it hurt her. And so, she was outraged that this was overturned.But one of the things that's so important here is the outrage that so many people, men and women in this country are feeling. This is a country that often errs on the wrong side of misogyny. But we've seen this campaign, ten seconds, or in Italian, dieci secondi, where people are posting videos -- ten second videos of acting out various forms of groping and it's really shocking to see just how long ten seconds is when you think this was not consensual.
