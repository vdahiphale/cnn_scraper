Now, I'm told by people close to the President-elect that there isn't anything that could be published that would change that. However, again, this is coming from people who have no idea what's actually in this report, and it's something that they're hearing from Donald Trump himself, who has said that they would - he would stand by Matt Gaetz.In fact, earlier today, we actually saw him lamenting the fact that some of his more controversial picks were not getting to be approved quickly or not getting confirmed quickly, and that there was some sort of holdup. So clearly, he's going to stand by Gaetz at this point. He cannot stop reiterating the fact to Donald Trump, because he handpicked Gaetz, believes that this is something that he really needs to get through and get him confirmed. But he cannot control all of these Republican senators. And despite the fact that Gaetz is saying, and not Gaetz, but these Republican senators saying they're having good meetings with Gaetz, obviously, if this report is released, which it sounds like whether or not it's released officially or unofficially through back channels, it is likely to at least get some of that report out, how this would impact those Republican senators. Because at the end of the day, Donald Trump is going to have several controversial picks that he's trying to get through, despite the fact that he says that Matt Gaetz is his ultimate priority. That's where he wants to focus his political capital. But all of these other senators, they also have their careers on the line, and depending on how they want to handle Donald Trump, that's where we need to find out.",

They usually put the partisanship aside. But you know the pressure that comes with Donald Trump is very intense. I do think, ultimately, we're going to find out some of what is in this, and whether that's just - they transmit it to the Senate. They - that's at a bare minimum, what they have to do, what they need to do is transmit it to the Senate, even if they don't publicly release it. But the excuse about it's not completely finished, look, at no point is a report actually fully completely finished until, I don't know, even months after, because you're always, you know, lightening up, crossing the T's, dotting the I's. So I think that could be an excuse, because it sure sounds like they're very close to at least having, pretty close to a finished product, in my mind.",

But I have no doubt in my mind, and I say it jokingly, Washington and Capitol Hill leaks like the Titanic.

I mean, why reinvent the wheel if the House Ethics Committee, the other chamber, has already gone through this whole very long, involved process of doing this investigation? I mean, I suppose that would open it up for the possibility of another leak.But once in their hands, Marc, do you expect that actually, if there's some really bad stuff in here, that might mean they can't proceed with going for Gaetz.",

That all - that's all it takes is four Republicans out of what looks to be 53 Republicans to say no, and this nomination would be done.If you're on the Team Trump side or with the others, you're trying to keep to getting at least 50 so the vice president can break that tie when the new Congress takes effect.",

And so you either have to just learn to acquiesce to every demand MAGA has or actually just be, you know, what people elected you to be, which is kind of an independent thinker.The good thing is Senate Republicans tend to be more independent thinkers, when you're a senator, particularly if you're not up for reelection this time, although a lot of the kind of sane senators are up for reelection. So I do think it will have an impact to have JD Vance there. I don't know. I mean, look, if I was JD Vance, I'd be frigging embarrassed to be walking with Matt Gaetz. I mean, this guy has - is basically a, you know, it's been accused of having sex with underage girls. And apparently the Ethics Committee has proof of this. We know what he said to us, the disgusting things he has said to us in person, why he can be the chief law enforcement officer and JD Vance will go along with this. I don't know. I think this is partially because Donald Trump can find people to go do his bidding in the in the DOJ. This is partially Donald Trump's attempt to break the will and the resistance of Senate Republicans to prove that he can get anything through, although I don't think he's going to get this one through. But this is - again, you kind of - if you're a Senate Republican, you can oppose this one and then you're scared to oppose anything else. And that's where you have like Tulsi Gabbard and some of the others that actually would - should deserve opposition as well.",

It's in its final review stages, and during this report's review stages, of course, the staff is the one that conducts all the interviews. They compile the report. And then the members have to sign off on it. And there's a back and forth that is going on, on that particular issue.But Brianna, I can tell you that this report could have come out earlier, but the committee has rules in deciding when it can release reports. They can't do it too close to an election, which is why they waited until after the election. Then Matt Gaetz abruptly resigned and now it puts this committee in a bit of a dilemma here, with the Speaker saying, don't release reports against former members, even though there is precedent in doing it.
