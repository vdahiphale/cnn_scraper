KINZINGER: And the whole point about the party and the 14 percent that hold him accountable, it's true. And the problem is we're now, a week before a caucus, expecting that number to change. That number should have changed three years ago when we had January 6th. That number should have changed when my committee did the January 6th hearings. It should have changed at every presidential debate, because the leaders in the Republican Party should have actually stood up and told the people that they -- that trust them to tell them the truth the truth.
