And so they're angry about that. But in terms of how Trump is doing, I don't think this is really going to affect much in terms of support from other Republicans. He has his base within the Republican Party. It is very strong in the sense that there's very little that's going to change that. If we look at the Republicans in total, Ron DeSantis is the candidate, potential candidate, that has the best chance going against Trump. And in fact, polls that were taken after the November midterms -- so just a few weeks ago -- revealed that DeSantis is almost ahead by 2:1. A \"Wall Street Journal\" poll showed that DeSantis was ahead by maybe 20 percent. A Morning Consult poll showed DeSantis was ahead by maybe 15 points. So Trump is in trouble within his own party. This isn't going to change things that much, this big reveal here. But as I mentioned, it might be something that, if DeSantis does run -- and I think he may announce this in the spring -- that he could use to pick apart at Trump's image, that he is just not as successful a business man as he has led the public to believe.",

You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.Barbara Walters, one of the most beloved and admired American journalists of the 20th century, has died. She was 93. In the early 1960s, she burst into U.S. living rooms as a rare female reporter in a news business dominated by men, while she later became the first woman to co-anchor an evening news program in the U.S. She never looked back, blazing a decades-long trail as a world renowned interviewer of the famous and powerful. In her final years, she was the sharp and witty creator and co-host of the talk show, \"The View,\" before retiring in 2014. Tributes for the legendary journalist Barbara Walters are coming in almost endlessly right now. Bernice King, the daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., tweeted this message, thanking Walters for her courage and trail-blazing ways as a female journalist in America and having, quote, \"difficult conversations that mattered.\" Oprah Winfrey shared her thoughts on the loss of Walters on Instagram. She shared a picture of the two and thanked her for leading the way for other women in the field. John Miller, who is now a CNN analyst, worked with Walters as a co- anchor on the show \"20/20.\" Earlier he spoke with CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota and reflected on what made Walters so formidable.

And I remember saying -- and this is about generosity and her confidence in her own picks -- I remember saying, Barbara, I've never anchored anything at all in television. And this is one of the highest rated television news shows in history. She said, well, don't worry. Everyone has to start somewhere. CAMEROTA: That's wonderful and what a great story. She faced resentment from a lot of male co-anchors, I think, not just Harry Reasoner. But when you talk about the incredible interviews that she did, I mean, so many were record ratings-breaking and they were memorable. So just to name a few, obviously, she did a lot of heads of state. She did one with the Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat. And I remember she sat down with Michael Jackson, which, you know, basically broke the ratings system. And then I think the highest rated one ever was Monica Lewinsky. I mean, as you say, John, people, whether it was in the middle of a scandal or it was in the middle of a celebration, she was their go-to. She was the person who had established herself.

I mean, you didn't feel it going in. And she asked it with real curiosity. I really -- the viewers really wanted to know the answer to this. And it made even a difficult interview, even an interview that might be hostile with another interviewer, seem like the kind of thing where the person just wanted to talk and tell her. And she got a lot out of a lot of people. You name it, world leaders -- Fidel Castro, she brought me back a box of cigars because she was not a cigar smoker and she knew that that would make me happy. But I mean, it was the way that made people feel confident that she would ask whatever needed to be asked but also get their story out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is set to be an uncertain beginning to the new year with the anticipation of potential intensification of Russia's bombardment of Ukraine.Over the last 10 months we have seen that bombardment continue. But despite that President Zelenskyy has remained defiant. We heard him speaking just yesterday in his nightly address, a defiant tone to the nation, saying that the Ukrainian armed forces are maintaining their positions in much of the eastern front lines and in fact, making some slow advances in parts of the east. But over the last two weeks we have seen that bombardment continue and heavy clashes, of course, in missile attacks by the Russian armed forces in key areas in the east. Particularly on Thursday, when Ukraine saw one of the largest barrages of missile attacks by the Russian armed forces that they have seen since the beginning of Russia's invasion 10 months ago, attacking the country from all fronts, from Ukraine, from Kyiv, the capital, and along the eastern front line points. Clearly we are seeing a doubling down of the effort by Russian armed forces. The message from Zelenskyy has been a continuation of the support from the West. He touched on the significant developments that the Ukraine armed forces have had in relation to air defense systems, saying this would be crucial going into the next year, not only for Ukraine but for Europe as a whole. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This year, we not only maintained our air defenses but we made them stronger than ever. In the new year, Ukrainian air defense will become even stronger, even more effective. Ukrainian air defense can become the most powerful in Europe. And this will be a guarantee of security not only for our country but also for the entire continent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is a claim that the Russian armed forces has maintained throughout its invasion of Ukraine. It stands in contrast to what Ukrainian military officials have been telling us and of course, the evidence we have seen on the ground. President Zelenskyy has over the last two weeks taken to sharing images, often graphic images of the impact of the missile launches, civilian losses and, of course, damage to infrastructure across the country. He says it is further evidence that Russia is engaging in terrorist activities in Ukraine, calling for further support. There are, of course, concerns that the attack from Russia will intensify in the new year -- Laila.",

It is estimated the flooding has caused more than $20 million in damage to infrastructure and crops. About 50,000 people were forced to flee their homes. And in Bolivia, protesters on a 24-hour strike burned cars, blocked highways and attacked buildings. This is in response to the regional governor, who is a right-wing opposition leader. Luis Fernando Camacho was held on charges of terrorism and sentenced to four months of pretrial detention. Camacho maintains he is innocent. Prosecutors deny his arrest is politically motivated. In one of his last acts as Brazil's leader, Jair Bolsonaro has revoked the ban preventing Nicolas Maduro from entering the country. That will allow Mr. Maduro to attend the inauguration of the incoming president on Sunday. But Bolsonaro won't be there, choosing to fly to the United States instead.
