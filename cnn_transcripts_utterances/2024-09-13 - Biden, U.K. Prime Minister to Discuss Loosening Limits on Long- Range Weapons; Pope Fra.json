      "sentences": "In the next hour, President Biden will meet with new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House and they will discuss the hot-button issue of allowing Ukraine, perhaps, to use long-range weapons provided by Western allies to strike deep into Russian territory. Biden has been facing increasing pressure to loosen the restrictions, he's been facing it from Ukraine and also from folks here at home, and he's signaling a new openness to this. Russian President Vladimir Putin is warning that if those restrictions are lifted, it means NATO countries will be at war with Russia.We're joined now by retired Army Major Mike Lyons to talk a little bit more about this. Major, how should the Biden administration consider that warning from Putin as they are looking at this possibility? MAJ. MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): I think they have to take it seriously and this is why. These weapons are strategic. They're going to give Ukraine somewhat of a tactical advantage at first, but from a strategic perspective, firing 150 miles inside of Russia does create a supply logistics issue that Russia will have to defend there. But more important, Putin knows that it's going to take the United States to do battle damage assessments and things with regard to these targets. So the United States and NATO countries will be all over the intel with regard to what these targets hit. And from Putin's perspective, that's a red line. And that really says NATO is now involved with this and that would give him a chance to escalate. Now, we've crossed many red lines already with him, but this might be the final one that he says, look, the United States is definitely involved because of the level of intelligence it's giving back to Ukraine if it fires these rockets.",

I mean, Russia still maintains this advantage from a manpower perspective.We know that we've seen the Ukraine forces have gone into Russia. There was a counteroffensive now trying to get them back. I think Ukraine military is doing what they can to protect those forces there. But eventually Russia has capacity to just grind down the troops that are there. They have this long range capacity. They could also decide to go proxy. They can decide to get with the Iranians to try to increase funding to Shia militia groups that decide to attack U.S. forces in the Middle East. So the retaliation might not take place in country inside Europe, let's say, but it might take place outside as Russia continues to try to expand its influence.",

      "sentences": "Well, we'd give them about 150 miles inside the Russian border based on where they could fire them from Ukraine, going after likely infrastructure targets that would hurt really the civilian population, as well as some military targets there. But the Russians have done a good job of moving those assets back.For example, the air assets that launch many of the drones that they're sending towards Ukraine are well outside the limits of the HIMARS and the Storm Shadow and these rockets. So again, and we would be blind. We wouldn't know we'd launch those and not be able to see them. There might be some cameras on. There might be some technology that's used. But the bottom line is that would come from the United States from satellite shots to determine what exactly they hit. So again, they're not difference makers. None of these things that we're providing are actual difference makers. They're just more tools for the Ukrainian military to use tactically. But they all have strategic implications.",

In fact, there's likely some political pressure to try to do this from our side. If you can get to an agreement here before our election, this administration can take a lot of credit for that, which is good. I think eventually we want to see a peace settlement there. The question is, what does that look like? But again, historically, countries that have greater capacity in wars of attrition end up winning those as they try to grind each other's down. And right now, that's where we're still at. There's no real change in the front lines of what's going on in Ukraine and Russia.",

We could see it on the airwaves in the U.S. before it was shut down here. But they've really gone covert, according to U.S. intelligence officials. They've tried to hide their activities.This announcement today is a warning that the U.S. is trying to give to its allies that it's not just U.S. elections that RT and the Russians are trying to meddle with. It's elections around the world, and they provided discrete examples from South America, Africa, elsewhere, where this Russian influence operation has been very active. And, you know, there's a lot of criticism about various media outlets and how they operate, but this is, can we say, very unorthodox and not a media outlet if they have Russian intelligence agents feeding them information and vice versa. They responded to our request for comment with mockery, which is usually the way it goes. They're trying to assume the role of Russian trolls. And this is just the latest step for us right before the election to try to stave off this kind of information operation.",

But it's pretty lucrative. You know, a lot of people would take that money. And for now, what we know is that they're keeping it. However, we also know from our reporting that the investigation into this activity is ongoing from the Russians.

Of course, the Catholic Church historically opposed to abortion.But what Francis is saying here is that anti-migrant policies, which he says are evil, it's wrong not to welcome migrants. He talks specifically about the U.S.-Mexico border, but equating that with abortion. Of course, some in the Catholic Church want to single out abortion as the main political issue. Francis is saying that both are wrong and anti-life. A strong intervention, I think. KEILAR: And Christopher, how does this compare to what he has or has not said about past U.S. elections?",
