      "sentences": "Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong, ahead on CNN Newsroom. The top 5 Republican presidential candidates come out swinging at each other and the front runner in their latest debate, but Donald Trump was a no-show again.Questions continue to swirl over who will control Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war is over. And done deal, finally. Hollywood actors reach a tentative agreement with the major film and television studios to end their months-long strike. We begin in Miami, where Republican presidential hopefuls gathered on Wednesday night for the third GOP debate. All of them are hoping to catch fire with voters just 2 months before the Iowa caucuses. But the man to beat, front-runner Donald Trump, again chose not to participate, instead holding a nearby rally. The debate also came after Tuesday's election saw significant Democratic wins. Only 5 of the other candidates qualified for the stage this time round. Well, each was asked why they should be the party's nominee instead of Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will fight for you. I will make sure to lead this country's revival and I will win for you and your family. If you look where we are now, it's a lot different than we were in 2016. And Donald Trump's a lot different guy than he was in 2016. He owes it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Everybody wants to talk about President Trump. Well, I can talk about President Trump. I can tell you that I think he was the right president at the right time. I don't think he's the right president now. Let's make sure we pay down our debt. I think we need an accountant in the White House. Let's make sure that we have transparency in the classroom. As a mom, I know what that means. VIVEK RAMASWAMY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE I think there's something deeper going on in the Republican Party here. And I am upset about what happened last night. We've become a party of losers at the end of the day. It's a cancer in the Republican establishment. CHRIS CHRISTIE, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'll say this about Donald Trump. Anybody who's going to be spending the next year and a half of their life focusing on keeping themselves out of jail and courtrooms cannot lead this party or this country. It needs to be said plainly. TIM SCOTT, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need a president and a candidate who will actually help our base solidify and attract independent voters into our party. The Great Opportunity Party is now winning back African-American voters and Hispanic voters because we are working on a foundation based on faith. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She still trails DeSantis in Iowa, but she's getting a lot of attention right now. She got off to a great start with a great opening statement and had a lot of strong moments on foreign policy. She had some back and forth with Vivek Ramaswamy. And I think her exchanges with Vivek, although he's sort of far down, show her to be a fighter. And I think that's working for her.I also think Ron DeSantis had a good night. He had a great opening statement. He had some good exchanges on issues as well. So, the 2 people that I think are really plausible as alternatives to Trump are Haley and DeSantis. They both had a great night. Neither of them dominated the other. They'll probably both get the most attention in the aftermath of this. I think for the rest of the crew, it was kind of an also ran evening.",

He's got dominant leads in Iowa and in New Hampshire. And I think for someone to really make a run at him, they're going to have to get close to him in New Hampshire. Maybe they don't have to beat him, but you've got to get close and make yourself look like a plausible nominee. He's obviously still ahead in the next state, New Hampshire. I meant Iowa. That's the first state. But he's still ahead in the next state, New Hampshire.You'd really have to find a way to get close and just not get blown out in the first 2 states because what's going to happen is if Trump looks dominant going in and looks dominant coming out of Iowa and or New Hampshire, you know, the field is just going to collapse and he's going to be the nominee. There is a high likelihood today he'll be the nominee no matter what any of these folks do. If, you know, let's say DeSantis dropped out tomorrow, not all of his voters are going to go to Haley. A lot of his voters are going to go to Trump. I mean, the reality of Trump is even people that are voting for DeSantis and Haley right now, a lot of them like Donald Trump.

I've seen from across the Republican spectrum, people are saying the way she described the issue and her approach to it is something that they really rallied too tonight. The interesting thing about the primary process, though, is the first state is Iowa.A huge number of evangelical Christian Republicans make up the folks who go to the Iowa caucus. And so the Republican candidates want to attract support from them. They cannot stray too far to the middle or to the left on abortion. When you go to the next state, New Hampshire, more secular, not as much evangelical influence on the people voting in the primary. Plus, you could have independents and Democrats voting in the Republican primary. So, I think Ron DeSantis is still hewing a more conservative line on that topic. You saw Nikki Haley start to try to widen the aperture on that argument, perhaps in anticipation of making a stand on it in New Hampshire. Of course, sitting atop all this is Trump. He appointed the 3 Supreme Court justices that ultimately led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. And there's been some reporting that even he believes the Republican Party is in trouble on the issue of abortion right now. And he is seeking to moderate his stance as well.",

Well, the months long actors strike officially ended just a few minutes ago, hours after the Actors Union reached a tentative agreement with the major film and television studios. The group representing the studios praised the deal, saying it provides the biggest contract gains in the history of the union and also gives extensive compensation protections and the use of artificial intelligence, which had been one of the main sticking points.The president of the Actors Union, Fran Drescher, posted on Instagram, quote, We did it. Billion plus dollar deal. Three times the last contract. The agreement still has to be ratified by the roughly 160 000 members of the SAG-AFTRA union. Well, joining us now is Emily Longeretta, senior editor at Variety magazine. Lovely to have you with us. Is this a breakthrough deal what the actors were after or have they had to compromise?",

And they won't really just give in. I think early on in the strike, both the writers' strike and the actors' strike, there were a lot of messaging out there that the studios were saying, they won't back down until people are out of jobs and are out of money. And clearly, that was happening. I mean, this is a huge loss for the industry on every aspect. But this contract is valued over $1 billion, which means that the studios were losing a lot of money. And ultimately, had to pay the actors for what they deserve.So, they really are realizing that, unfortunately, in the long run, this is not something that was going to be beneficial for them. This is something that the actors were sticking to their guns. And they learned that they can't really play hardball at the end of the day, because the team of leaders for the union were going to fight for the multiple points that they deserved. And it's important to note that it wasn't just the AI point. It was a lot about those streaming residuals and fighting for the right raises and the increase in salary that hadn't been happening. I mean, they got the largest increase in 40 years that we are hearing.",

This is thousands of Palestinians fled south from northern Gaza through a temporary evacuation corridor opened by the IDF on Wednesday. Israel says its troops are now in the heart of Gaza City, targeting Hamas infrastructure and commanders. Well, earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will be in charge of Gaza's overall security indefinitely after the war. But on Wednesday, the US pushed back against that, laying out its vision for Gaza's future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: Gaza cannot continue to be run by Hamas. That simply invites a repetition of October 7th, and Gaza uses the place from which to launch terrorist attacks. It's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. The only question is, is there some transition period that might be necessary, and what might be the mechanisms that you could put in place for that to make sure that there is security? But we're very clear on no reoccupation, just as we're very clear on no displacement of the Palestinian population. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
