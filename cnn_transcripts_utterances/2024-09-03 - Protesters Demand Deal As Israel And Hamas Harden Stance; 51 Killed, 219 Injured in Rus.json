In Israel, thousands of protesters calling for an immediate hostage deal have returned to the streets for a third night. The anger and grief comes after six hostages who survived, 329 days in Gaza were killed by Hamas hours before being found by Israeli forces. And Hamas is warning more hostages will be killed if Israel tries to rescue them. Both sides are doubling down on their cease-fire demands. Israel insisting it will keep troops in a key corridor on the Gaza/Egypt border while Hamas says it will only agree to a deal if Israel leaves the Philadelphi corridor. International diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv for us. Nic, I can see you're surrounded by protesters. You can talk about what they're telling you. But just to be clear, if we go back to May, Netanyahu agreed to President Biden's proposal, which didn't include Israeli troops being present in that corridor. Its strategic importance hasn't changed. So what has? Because clearly the protesters, there aren't convinced its that important or a deal- breaker.",

Just a few seconds ago, about two minutes ago. This was a sea of protesters is just the burning embers of a fire as they marched off somewhere else, but the three hours here, it was a cacophony of calls calling on the prime minister to get out of Gaza, why are we still in Gaza? People are saying, get the hostages home. If they don't come home, then we're all hostage. That was another thing people were saying. It's much quieter now as that crowd was gone. But to your point about the Philadelphi corridor, it's not just the crowds here who are raising their concerns and they don't believe what the prime minister saying, they don't believe it's an issue as much substance as he makes it out to be. What we were hearing just a couple of hours ago from Benny Gantz, the leader of the main opposition party, if you will? The biggest opposition party here, at least who was in the war cabinet until a few months ago what he has said this evening echoes what everyone here is saying is that he's saying what the prime minister told you to last night about the Philadelphi corridor is a lie that he was presented with military proposals for a way to keep that border safe and free from weapons movement, which is prime ministers concern and he didn't go for it. He says the prime minister understands there are alternatives and therefore his language, he says this is the reason that we can't make a deal. So there's a huge wave -- uplift, if you will, of opposition to the prime minister. But as your question rightly frames it, he's dug his heels in and he's not moving.",

Now, President Biden said that he believes the U.S. is close to proposing a final bridging proposal in terms of the U.S. has described it in. But today, John Kirby said that there's no timetable that he was able to provide as to when that final proposal would be put forth.

      "sentences": "Kayla Tausche there at the White House, thank you.All right. Let's talk more about this. Avi Mayer, former editor in chief for \"The Jerusalem Post\", joins us now. Good to have you with us, sir. It's not just about three days of protest. It's also about a cause for a general strike that we've seen across Israel, too. It arguably is the most intense pressure that the government and Prime Minister Netanyahu has faced. Does it move the needle and does it sway him to change his position? Because what we've seen and talked about already is an appearance of doubling down on his decision to stand by the terms. AVI MAYER, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE JERUSALEM POST:  Well, Julia, I think tensions and emotions are as high in Israel today as they've ever been at any point in this war, the sense of grief is profound. Those six hostages had become household names in Israel. Of course, many around the world familiar with the name of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who is an American Israeli, whose parents were I think some of the most visible advocates on behalf of the hostages. But the five others were also extremely well-known within Israel. And so the emotions are extremely real and extremely raw at this moment. As you saw, there have been hundreds of thousands of people swarming the streets of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and other cities. And I think the pressure is becoming extremely, extremely strong. I don't know how the prime minister can really withstand it for very long, and I think that even his coalition members, those who are perhaps most disinclined to proving some kind of a deal at this point under the current terms will be hard pressed, not to go forward some kind of a deal at some point in the very near future.",

And that I think may be the brew that actually does bring that pressure to bear and does make him consider whether this is a direction he needs to pursue.Ultimately, I don't think the prime minister is opposed the notion of a hostage deal. I think he understands that is the only way that as many hostages as possible are going to be brought home. Yes, we've had those heroic rescue missions that have brought certain number of them home alive. But we know that that's not going to bring back the bulk of them. He recognizes that. The leaders of the military and the defense establishment realize that it's a matter of figuring out what terms we can get, how Israel can ensure that its own basis security needs are met in the context of any kind of agreement. It looks like almost there. Let's hope we get there in the days and weeks ahead.",

I mean, look, I think many of those who are opposed the deal under the current terms are deeply concerned, for example, about the number of Palestinian terrorists who would be released as part of a deal.They look, for example, at Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre, who was himself please as part of a previous deal in order to secure the return of an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit. He was one of 1,000 Palestinian terrorists released at that time. And many of the critics of the proposed deal look at that and say, how can we risk that happening again, how can you risk this large number of terrorists returning to terrorist activity and perhaps trying to perpetrate a massacre like October 7, again, so these are very real concerns. The question is, which concern wins out at this point, at which risk is the one that is I think most important to take at this time. I think most of Israel would say the immediate priority needs to be to bring back those hostages will deal with the security concerns and those long-term ramifications after they're brought home. CHATTERLEY:  But your balance and the context is desperately needed at a moment of some high emotion. Avi, great to have you with us. Thank you, sir. All right. Now, to Ukraine, where the death toll continues to climb in one of the deadliest single Russian attacks in two-and-a-half years of war. At least 51 people are dead, more than 200 injured after two ballistic missiles hit a military academy and neighboring hospital in Eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian defense ministry, their time between the evacuation sirens and missiles striking was so short that many were killed on the way to the shelter. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeated his calls for more air defense systems saying there needed in Ukraine not somewhere in a warehouse, quote.

While Ukraine's air defenses often take down Russian missiles, that consequences can be devastating when they don't.

Its been a red state for the last several elections, but it does show you that they wanted very much seize on this issue of abortion rights to galvanize some of their voters Florida is a state where abortion will literally be on the ballot in November. Amendment 4 would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution and replace a draconian ban according to Democrats, of six weeks for abortion in that state.

And I think that tells you a couple of things. One, they're just swimming in money at this point, the Kamala Harris campaign raised more than $500 million in the time since she became the candidate. So they have quite a lot of money to work with here. But also, they're just want to focus on these down-ballot races. That's something that Democrats haven't necessarily been successful in previous cycles. And I'm thinking back to the Barack Obama administration when that aspect of the ticket wasn't necessarily a priority.

This was a strategy they actually had first deployed in the lead up to the Iowa caucuses. And during the primaries, this idea that they could really win on the margins perhaps if they can create new voters.And particularly, that's what you're seeing happen with some of the social media influencers and these interviews that Donald Trump is doing. They are targeting some of these male celebrities, predominantly, I should say, male celebrities to go after male voters who are younger, younger audiences trying to get, to get them to see if they can interest them enough to turn out for Donald Trump and this has long been something we've seen Donald Trump engaged in throughout this most recent 2024 campaign. He's had interviews with the series of different social media influencer. In particular, I want to talk about his interview with Elon Musk. With that interview, they were not necessarily expecting it to be some long-ranging a policy conversation that would help Donald Trump with many of his existing voters, or even more broadly, some more moderate voters that they could maybe target. Instead, they were going specifically after Musk's following, people on his Twitter, his own followers seeing if they could court those people themselves, these more nontraditional people who are not that interested in politics and see if they could maybe turn them out. And again, they recognize that these are people with more conservative leaning listeners, conservative leaning audiences per se. And so, that's been a focus for that. And I will it work? Unclear, but this is something they have long done. And it's another thing I just want to add that Donald Trump himself enjoys doing. You can see that when he feels like he's on with some of these younger people, tend to be more candid, more a comfortable interviews for him.

Vance on the ticket.So if anything, I think there might be even more intensity, particularly in states like Florida and other places where there are in Arizona where they're actually are abortion ballot initiatives going to be voted on in November. I think it will have significant down-ballot effect as well. There are competitive congressional seats in Florida. There is a Senate race in Florida, so its really not just the presidential are people that turn out and some of those places where there, for example, there are competitive House races.

Already, the Republicans are being outspent in the House and Senate and even more of that's going to get pushed down by the presidential race.

I also think just that you can overstate the economy as an issue in elections in the sense that in 2012, in the exit polls, Mitt Romney had better marks than Obama on handling the economy in 2020. Trump had better marks than Biden on the economy in 2022. Republicans had better marks than Democrats on the economy. And Democrats won every single instance.

Justice Jackson was just named to the court two years ago, and she's already produced this memoire. And that's a very short time period compared to the other books. And then in terms of memoirs, the kind of memoirs has started frankly with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, our first woman justice on the Supreme Court. She wrote a book back in 2002, to some two decades after her appointment, you know? So that's kind of our origin of this new wave of personal memoir. And what makes Justice Jackson's different from Justice O'Connor's, Justice Sotomayor's, Justice Thomas's is just how intimate it is. It's far more personal and, of course, Julia, it's also -- also through the lens of her very historic appointment as the first Black woman on the court. And she writes at one point, just on the eve of when she's about to be sworn in only one generation after my mother and father had experienced the spirit crushing effect of racial segregation in housing, schooling, and transportation, while growing up in Florida, their daughter was standing on the threshold of history, the embodiment of our ancestors' dreams -- Julia.",

Of course, his father was the late Senator John McCain, who, of course, was considered by many to be a war hero. And so, he was very personally affected by what he saw at Arlington National Cemetery last week when Donald Trump was there posing in front of gravestones of people who he says did not necessarily give there -- were not able to give their consent, right, to being in a political ad. And of course, add to that the controversy surrounding Trump and hiscampaigns treatment reportedly about an Arlington staffer who tried to get them to stop filming at the cemetery. All of this really felt to Jimmy McCain like it was very insulting and demeaning to the people who are buried in that cemetery, which includes it should note, his grandfather, his great-grandfather, and other members of his family. And so what he told me during this conversation is that when he saw that Trump had visited Arlington and kind of made this a political event, he was quote, blown away because these men and women that are laying on the ground there, they really have no choice of whether to be a part of this political backdrop. And, you know, I asked him why he thinks that Donald Trumps so frequently, particularly when it comes to his own father, John McCain, makes veterans and make service members a target. As you'll recall, Trump repeatedly said that John McCain is not a war hero because he was captured. He was captured in Vietnam and was a prisoner of war there. And Jimmy McCain, you know, he said that he believes that Donald Trump simply does not know what it is and what it -- what it feels like to actually serve his country. And he said you know, these people that are in Arlington that were buried -- that were buried there, they signed on the dotted line to serve their country and he said, quote, that's an experience that Donald Trump has not had.
