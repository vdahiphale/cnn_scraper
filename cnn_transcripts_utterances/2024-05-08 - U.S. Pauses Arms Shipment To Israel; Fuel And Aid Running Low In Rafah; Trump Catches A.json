We have the very latest. Meanwhile, in Rafah, more than a million Palestinians are in dire conditions, and there are only a few days of fuel left. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland joins me in just a moment. And a body of work that bears witness to history captured in signature black and white. My conversation with world renowned photographer Sebastiao Salgado. But first, tonight, we begin with an unprecedented development in the longstanding relationship between the closest of allies, the United States and Israel. The U.S. Defense Secretary confirms that the U.S. is pausing -- since they may be used in a major offensive in Rafah. Lloyd Austin says Israel shouldn't mount an attack there without a plan, accounting for the safety of civilians. It is something of course, that the U.S. has been calling for, for some time. His comments follow a CNN report last week that the U.S. had suspended shipments of more than 3,500 bombs to Israel. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But aid workers are warning that there is not enough space in these safe zones. There is not enough infrastructure to support the arrival of these tens of thousands of people, some of whom, Isa, have been displaced now four or five times. The World Health Organization is also warning that the hospitals in southern Gaza will shut down in three days if more fuel does not start to get through the border. You may remember at the beginning of this conflict back in October, this was a consistent theme and concern of the humanitarian aid workers that the blockage of aid most pronounced effect would be this blockage of fuel, and that in turn would have a huge impact on the entire hospital and medical care system. There have been strikes continuing, six people according to Palestinian health officials on the ground were killed overnight, two of them, women, but reports of more strikes during the day today, and certainly a very high state of fear, not quite all-out panic yet, but high fear and anxiety that this so-called what the Israelis are calling a surgical or precision anti- terror operation could unfold into a broader offensive that would have cataclysmic effects, Isa.",

They're arguing this is the first time that they've ever had to produce this kind of report during an active conflict, and therefore, they're saying they're not able to meet that, what they're calling a self-imposed deadline of today. So, we are expecting that report to be transmitted to Capitol Hill in the coming days. Now, this has the potential to be an extremely significant report because this isn't the first time since the start of the war in Gaza that the U.S. will have to determine yes or no, whether Israel has committed violations of international humanitarian law. And they will also have to decide whether Israel has held up U.S humanitarian assistance into the besieged Gaza Strip. This is something that humanitarian aid officials say is indisputable, is happening and the report itself is causing a lot of divisions both within the administration, as well as on Capitol Hill. We know here at the State Department, there have been divisions among different offices about whether Israel's assurances that they are using U.S. weapons in accordance with law can be in fact deemed credible and reliable. We know some here are in favor of it and some have not taken a position. On the Hill, it is this group of Democrats led largely by Senator Chris Van Hollen, who called for this national security memorandum. This is the thing that mandated this report to be created, and they are calling for the administration not to take Israel's assurances just at face value. They want to see this be substantive.

So, her reasoning is that she has eight pending motions to resolve, and she says that, that will take her at least until the end of July to resolve all of those. That's why she is pausing this trial date -- trial start date indefinitely. It was actually supposed to start in just about ten days, May 20th, but now she's saying, I want to resolve all of these issues before we even put a trial start date on the calendar. Needless to say, this is a big win for Donald Trump, not just by the mere fact that it delays this trial, but Judge Cannon is also going to be hearing two of his motions that many legal watchers considered a long shot. So, on June 21st, she's going to be hearing Donald Trump's motion against the special counsel, Jack Smith. Trump has said that he believes Jack Smith is unlawfully appointed. So, they're actually going to have an in-court argument about that motion. And then on June 24th, they're going to have a three-day argument on another long shot motion that Donald Trump actually wants access to Biden administration records from the White House and from other agencies. Donald Trump's contention is that agencies within the Biden administration are somehow involved in this prosecution. So, again, Isa, a very long shot motions that this judge is taking seriously and having hearings on that it will be delaying the start of this trial.

So, the likelihood, even before this appeals court decided to hear this part of the case, the likelihood that this case was even going to happen before the election, was getting slimmer and slimmer by the day. This appeals court is not known to move very fast. So, it's possible that they won't even have a decision on whether Fani Willis should be removed from the case for several months. So, all of this is really putting the brakes on the Georgia case as well, plus, you add in, if Donald Trump does win the election and does become president, the likelihood of a state prosecution going forward of a sitting president is extremely unlikely. And Donald Trump would likely be able to put the brakes on the two special counsel cases, the classified documents of January 6. So, yes, things are looking very rosy for Donald Trump's defense team.

And then he's also trying to stave off a defeat, and to convince people to vote for him who have been saying that they won't vote for him because of that support to Israel. And so, he's in a tough spot. I think the main thing that President Biden wants to do right now is get to a negotiated solution. Get the hostages released because the last thing that he wants to focus on in the summer months leading up to an election is the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and this awful war that's happening in Gaza right now. Now, the problem is that the Americans have not really been able to exert the right kind of pressure, the sustained significant kind of pressure that is necessary to get Netanyahu to change his way of thinking precisely because and partly, to be fair, because Netanyahu sees himself as being in an existential crisis, a survival -- a battle for his own survival. And so, there's nothing -- it seems to be that there's nothing the Americans can do to change his mind. But also at the same time, there are many things that the Americans haven't tried yet. And even this weapons shipment that we're talking about right now, Isa, the Americans have made clear that they don't know whether they will eventually release the shipment or not. So, it's not really a full, sort of, we are not going to give you these weapons. It's if you continue what you're doing, we won't release these weapons shipments. But they're leaving that door open for that shipment to go through if Netanyahu doesn't go into the city of Rafah proper. So, moving in from the outskirts and crossing red line with Biden.

Another important thing to know about these medicines is that tirzepatide based drugs, those are the Eli Lilly drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro, they actually have a warning in their labels. Saying that the drugs may make oral birth control pills less effective. That probably has to do with how these medicines work. They slow the movement of food through the digestive system, and that can affect the absorption of other medicines taken by mouth. Now, we did talk with a young mom who took Mounjaro for about five months for weight loss. She lost 40 pounds in that period of time.
