And even with 14 challenger tanks, it's going to take a significant requirement to train Ukrainian soldiers on that very modern, technologically advanced weapons system that the U.K. is giving that's very different from the T-72s that they've been fighting on. And in addition to that, they have to have the repair parts, the capability to conduct the repair and resupply these vehicles with ammunition. So, again, you won't see -- they may be -- the U.K. may be given these 14 tanks to Ukraine, but you will not see them on the battlefield within days, it will probably be within weeks, just like the 50 Bradley systems that the United States are given the Ukrainians, they are now beginning the training on those vehicles that Graph and Bureau and Hohenfels training area in Germany, a place where I know very well.

Life and the events around us prompt the answer. How many -- however many it may take, our miserable, exhausted motherland needs to be saved. It has been pillaged, wounded, dragged into an aggressive war, and turned into a person run by the most unscrupulous and deceitful scoundrels.\" Navalny is serving a nine-year prison sentence for fraud charges, which his supporters say were politically motivated. Well, Sweden and Finland are hoping an upcoming meeting will help convince Turkey to approve their bids for NATO membership, bids brought on by the war in Ukraine. The Turkish foreign minister will be holding talks with the U.S. secretary of state in Washington in the coming days. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports now from Istanbul on the sticking points so far. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some Turkish officials have been saying that they are in no rush to approve Finland and Sweden's membership in NATO. Some Turkish officials also indicating that they might not take this to the Turkish parliament for a vote before elections that are expected here in May or June. Turkey has accused those two Nordic countries of harboring members of Kurdish separatist groups that Turkey views as a national security threat. They did sign a memorandum between these three countries, between Turkey, Sweden, and Finland, in which they say they will be taking steps to address these national security concerns that Turkey brought up. Turkish officials are saying that some steps have been taken but not enough has been done. They say they want to see more concrete steps taken before they go ahead and approved a membership. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in recent days also saying that they will not go ahead with this until Sweden and Finland hand over more than 100 individuals, they say, who are wanted by Turkey. But it's also very important to keep in mind that what Turkish officials say publicly doesn't necessarily reflect where things are in terms of negotiations taking place behind closed doors that have continued now for months, especially at a time where Turkey is headed into elections.",
