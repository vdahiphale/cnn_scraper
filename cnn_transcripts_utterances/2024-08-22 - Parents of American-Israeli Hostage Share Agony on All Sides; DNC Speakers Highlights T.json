Sources telling me and our colleague, Samantha Waldenberg, that The Chicks are set to perform the national anthem tonight. So, they will be kicking off the big night, Kamala Harris' night at the DNC.Now, as you see, said there, Jim, it was back in 2003 that the group faced intense backlash for their comments about then-President George W. Bush. The backlash was so bad that they were pulled off many country radio music stations. Now, fast forward to 2024, and things have really changed in the country music genre. Of course, country music historically has been aligned with more conservative views and conservative fan bases. But if you look at who the convention has brought out this week, it's not just The Chicks tonight. On Monday night, they had Grammy nominated country music star, Mickey Guyton. Last night they had Maren Morris, who is one of the most liberal country stars. So, the genre is shifting as we're getting younger up and coming, more progressive artists in the country music scene. [10:55:00] Now, I have to tell you, they are not going to be the only stars that we are going to see tonight. Yesterday, we exclusively broke the news that Pink is also performing tonight, Jim.",
