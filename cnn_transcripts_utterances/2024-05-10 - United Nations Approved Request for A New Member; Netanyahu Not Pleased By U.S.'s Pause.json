It would also grant Palestinians new rights and new privileges. Israel's U.N. ambassador, meantime, accused those voting in favor of the resolution of trying to, quote, \"advance the establishment of a Palestinian terror state.\" The measure will go to the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. has vowed to vote against any bid for Palestinian statehood. The vote at the U.N. comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is defiantly vowing to do what it takes to win the war against Hamas, with or without the help from the United States.

You know, this is, this was quite a moment and an inflection point in the US-Israel relationship to see President Biden effectively condition U.S. weapons shipments to Israel based off of its conduct in the war in Gaza. That is not something that we have seen from President Biden up until this moment. Even as we have seen that increased rhetoric for months, there was never any kind of actual tangible condition tied to that rhetoric until now. And certainly, that is a moment for U.S.-Israel relations. It's also a moment in terms of the relationship between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, two men who have known each other for decades, who have endured ups and downs in their relationship over that period of time. And certainly we are at a moment now, a low in Israel-U.S. relations and one that it's not clear exactly how it will be resolved because of the fact that the Israeli prime minister and his government are very much indicating that they will not back down on what they view as a military necessity, and that is carrying out this all-out ground offensive in Rafah to eliminate four Hamas battalions who the Israeli military says are embedded within the civilian population in Rafah. But what is clear is that already, even as we don't know when that all-out offensive will be carried out, when it will expand beyond what we have seen, already we know that this limited military operation in eastern Rafah is already having enormous consequences on the ground. At least 110,000 civilians have been displaced from their homes, some of them displaced for the second, third, or even fourth time to areas north of Rafah that humanitarian organizations say are simply not suitable for that number of humans to be living in, given the lack of sewage, the lack of running water in parts of that area, and just the access to basic humanitarian aid that they need. One of the three functioning hospitals in Rafah has had to shut down because of this limited military operation, as the IDF is calling it, in eastern Rafah, and the Rafah border crossing has now been closed for -- since the beginning of the week as a result of this military operation as well, seriously hampering the entry of humanitarian aid as well as fuel that is desperately needed by those remaining hospitals in Rafah in order to carry out those operations. So there's no question that it's already having an impact on the ground, and that should the Israeli government and the Israeli military choose not to heed the warnings from the United States, that the situation on the ground for Palestinian civilians will undoubtedly get much, much worse in the days and weeks ahead.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and that was some of the key testimony yesterday and today from Madeleine Westerhout. You know, shesat right outside the Oval Office during her time at the White House. So, she continued her testimony this morning. She did make a few interesting points during her testimony. First, you know, she talked about this unusual arrangement with the former President Trump having what was a separate P.O. box that he received mail at while he was in the White House. And that was because, in terms of his view, the White House process of just accepting and distributing mail, it often took too long. Sometimes things were lost. So, that was a bit of a quirky arrangement that the jury heard about. Most notably, though, Westerhout, she did testify today during cross-examination that Trump would often sign his checks without even reviewing them. She talked about his penchant for multitasking, where he might be on the phone while signing a stack of checks, doing any number of other things. This, of course, will help the defense in arguing that Trump just didn't know exactly what he was signing when he signed those checks to Michael Cohen as reimbursement for the Stormy Daniels hush money. Since Westerhout's testimony this morning, we have heard from a number of people from AT&amp;T, Verizon, also staffers within the D.A.'s office, those people just being used to get in various evidence, like phone records and tweets and other things that were subject to subpoena. Of course, Zain, the big spectacle, perhaps, will be on Monday, when Michael Cohen is expected to take the stand for what should be several days of blockbuster testimony. You know, he could be this witness that will potentially provide what is a link, potentially, between Trump and his hush money scheme to shield these records and what the payments were really for. You know, the prosecution needs Michael Cohen to link Donald Trump to this scheme, where, you know, they called these payments to Michael Cohen's legal expenses, when in fact, they were reimbursements to help Trump's campaigns. That is the basis of this criminal indictment. So, Michael Cohen will be key, and he'll also testify, likely, about what, in prosecutors' eyes, was a crucial February 5th, 2017 White House meeting, where Trump and Cohen discussed the hush money payment, how it would be made and, potentially, how it would be covered up. So, Zain, we have to go through some housekeeping now with some of these minor witnesses who are on the stand today. The judge actually said that we'll probably wrap up within the next hour. He's going to make it an early day for jurors today on Friday, gearing up for what will be a very big Monday with Michael Cohen. Zain.",

And again, they're going to do that not only based on thewords of Michael Cohen, but on the words of other witnesses who have previously testified about what went on in connection with these payments. Some of the actual records from the banking institutions that have been admitted, these cell phone records that they've been talking about today, tweets that have been published and that are out there, all those social media reports, some of the testimony about people who said that Trump knew exactly what was going on and when these meetings took place. And as was pointed out, that crucial in-person meeting that took place where he and the former president were the only people who know what was being said. Again, they need to prove criminal intent here, and they're doing that with their star witness. He is certainly going to be one of their star witnesses and the linchpin here for their case. So, it's important for him to withstand the cross and for the prosecution not to hide anything about him and to front it all before the defense starts asking questions.",

As you see, the protests lasted into Thursday night when the protesters marched to the office of the university's president. D.C. police say 33 people were arrested on Wednesday. Many were later released. All right, we've been telling you about demands from many student protesters that their universities cut financial ties with Israel. Ireland's famous Trinity College, Dublin, is the latest to listen to student demands, announcing that it will actually divest from some Israeli companies by next month. The move comes after talks between the prestigious college and demonstrators. Protesters had set up tents on campus last week. They also blocked access to the Book of Kells, which is a popular tourist attraction at the college. It cost the university a lot of money, the fact that tourists couldn't access it. Time now for the exchange. I want to bring you someone who has had first- hand knowledge about these protests. David Landy is an assistant professor of sociology at Trinity College.

Now, Ireland has had a long history of sympathizing with the Palestinian cause, and that is because, you know, Ireland was essentially Britain's oldest colony.

Cohen is the most important prosecution witness in this case, the man who made, who actually made the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels that were allegedly reimbursed by Donald Trump. Let's once again bringing CNN's Jessica Schneider to help us sort through all of this. Obviously, today wasn't the most exciting day in court, especially when you compare it to Stormy Daniels taking the stand yesterday. But the big focus for everyone, the day we all have to sort of circle our calendars and mark and sort of look forward to from a legal perspective is, of course, Monday. That's when we're going to be hearing from Donald Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen. Take us through that.",

Had to get through the housekeeping, the drystuff before the big blockbuster witness on Monday, who is Michael Cohen. So just to walk you through a little bit of what happened today, we had witnesses from Verizon, AT&amp;T. They had to get phone records in. Granted, Michael Cohen will probably talk about some of those phone records when he appears on Monday. We also had staffers from the D.A.'s office. They got an evidence that they've reviewed in this case like tweets and text messages. Interestingly, the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, was even in the courtroom today watching over some of his employees as they testified. But the most interesting testimony probably from today, it was a carryover from yesterday, Madeline Westerhout. She sat right outside the Oval Office and she talked a little bit about just Trump and the way he operated. The most interesting thing that came out of her testimony was the fact that she said sometimes Donald Trump would multitask while signing checks. Sometimes he'd be on the phone, maybe not exactly paying attention to what he was signing. So that might be key for the defense here in trying to argue that Donald Trump wasn't always 100 percent aware of the financial documents that he was signing or taking part in. But of course, the big blockbuster testimony will in fact be on Monday. It's interesting. Next week, we'll have court Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. It's off on Wednesday and Friday. Friday, so Donald Trump can attend his son Barron's graduation. But Michael Cohen will probably be on the stand for all three of the days that we are in session next week. Zain, it's going to be very interesting to see how exactly he can provide that link between Trump and the hush money scheme, because of course that is at the core of the prosecution's case and exactly what they need to prove to get a guilty verdict here.",

Stephanie Busari joins us live now from Abuja. Stephanie, I am so excited to see Meghan in Nigeria, because I remember when she revealed that she is actually 40 percent Nigerian, which basically means we're sisters. And just in terms of what she's actually set out to do on this trip, it's all about promoting mental health and it's all about, for Harry at least, because of the Invictus Games, it's all about meeting with wounded soldiers and their families.
