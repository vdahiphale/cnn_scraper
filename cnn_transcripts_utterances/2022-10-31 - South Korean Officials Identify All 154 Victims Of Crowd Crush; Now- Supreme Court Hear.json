The problem is, is that some of the people in front including many of the young women who died were pushed over and down onto the ground, and that's when they started to pile up. The description from first responders that we spoke with yesterday, there all you could see were faces about 10 people high, just packed -- jam pack right in that narrow alley right there. One of the people who survived spoke to my colleague Ivan Watson.

But, Kate, the really big burning question is, where were the police?Yes, there were extra officers assigned here. Some of them were sent to another area, to a protest. There were no barricades up. And we have just learned today from the government here in Seoul, that in fact, they did not have a plan. They do not have a crowd control contingency plan for events that don't have a single organizer, events like the one here in the nightclub district of Itaewon were 100,000 young people came spontaneously and packed into that alley right there. So you have huge questions about why the police were not responding sooner. Why was there not a plan in place? How was this allowed to happen? And what needs to be done to prevent it from ever happening again, Kate?",

Now we understand a barrage of missiles, as you mentioned, more than 50 cruise missiles fired across 10 regions in Ukraine hitting 18 different facilities, most of them energy-related, electricity- related.What that means here in the capital today is that 80 percent of the city's residents do not have access to running water. The mayor says officials are scrambling to bring that back up as quickly as they can. All of this taking place just a couple of days after Russia accused Ukraine of attacking its black sea naval fleet with drones. Ukraine has denied that accusation. But in response, Moscow pulled out of this very important UN-brokered with turkeys help grain deal. A deal that's allowed Ukraine to export millions of tons of grain despite the conflict. Now that's in flux, but we understand is dozens of ships, potentially up to 200 vessels could be trapped in the Black Sea unable to get out those exports. Ukraine is saying that they were able to get 12 ships out today with the help of the United Nations. But Russia's response to that was to say if Ukraine carries on without Russia's involvement in the initiative, that could be \"risky or dangerous.\" That's very worrying rhetoric there. But again, Kate, this is the continuation of the pattern we've seen, right? Russia taking the battle out of the battlefield, right into people's homes because we're talking about the basics, food, water, energy, all of those now Ukraine says being used as weapons by Russia, Kate.",

In fact, the newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, she has been really leading the questioning on the liberal side. She has been stressing that race is crucial to student identity, and she just wonders how colleges could practically be barred from considering race.On the flip side, though, some of the conservative justices have been asking whether other factors other than race could be just as effective in creating diversity on college campuses. And we know that Chief Justice John Roberts has repeatedly in many cases over many years, been skeptical of factoring in a race in any number of situations. And he's taking the same line in the cases he's hearing this morning, He actually asked an attorney for the group against affirmative action whether other factors besides race could be just as effective in creating diversity. Here he is. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE, U.S. SUPREME COURT: The discussion has been about the dramatic plummeting of the number of African American students that would take place if the practice of checking a box with race is taken away. And my suggestion is if that's not, then maybe there will be an incentive for the university to in fact, truly pursue race-neutral alternatives, such as you know, allowing, which I think would be allowed students -- applicants to indicate experiences they have had on -- because of their race.

And you add to that the fact that nine states around the country have in fact banned affirmative action in admissions decisions.Those -- some of the colleges in those states, though, have filed briefs with the Supreme Court. They say that they haven't been able to achieve maximum diversity in the year since affirmative action has been outlawed here.

How was that message projected onto the outside of the stadium here during the Florida-Georgia game on Saturday? All of that remains unclear. What is clear when you speak to folks from the Jewish community here is that at the -- at the root of this, as they see it is hatred. And they find this unnerving because it wasn't just that message on the stadium, also over the weekend antisemitic banners over an overpass of a pretty busy highway in this area. You know, I spoke with the ADL and they tell us in their last audit, they had 2700 antisemitic incidents reported. That's a 34 percent increase over the previous year. And they believe that extremist groups are engaging even more when it comes to trying to stir up fear and anxiety in these communities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OREN SEGAL, VICE PRESIDENT, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE CENTER ON EXTREMISM: We need to keep extremists on the fringes. But when they get a degree of aid and comfort from influential figures, is that a surprise that they are engaging around the country in more of these sorts of outward activities? In other words, what happens online and what leaders say has consequences in the real world. It doesn't just stay online. It doesn't just stay in the ether. It animates people to action.
