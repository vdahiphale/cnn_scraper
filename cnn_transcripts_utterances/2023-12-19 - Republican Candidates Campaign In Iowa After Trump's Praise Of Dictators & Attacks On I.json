      "sentences": "The weather may be getting cold on the campaign trail, but attacks between the candidates are heating up. InIowa, Nikki Haley is taking aim at Donald Trump's praise for dictators, while his team is responding in reaction to her rise. And all is not well between Wilmington and the White House, as President Biden's team confronts another falling poll, despite signs of a rising economy. And in the halls of Congress, one GOP Senator says there is no way a border deal gets done this week, setting them all up for lumps of coal in their respective stockings. Good day, everyone. I'm John Avlon, in for Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. in Washington, Tuesday, December 19. There are 27 days until the Iowa caucuses, and 321 days until the election. This is today's State of the Race. America is saying goodbye to a Supreme Court pioneer, a centrist icon, the first woman on the High Court. You're looking live National Cathedral in Washington where the funeral for former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is underway. President Biden and Chief Justice Roberts are among those who will be eulogizing her. But, meanwhile, on the campaign trail that will determine our democracy's future, Donald Trump's GOP rivals are wrestling with how to respond to his comments praising dictators and attacking immigrants. Trump said over the weekend that immigrants were \"poisoning the blood of our country\". He also called President Joe Biden a threat to democracy, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin while doing so. But, here is former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley responding in Iowa on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The part that bothers me is our national security is at risk. And what's he doing? He is praising dictators. When Israel fell to her knees, what did he do? He talked about an old vendetta with Netanyahu and praised Hezbollah. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Meanwhile, Trump is set to speak in Iowa today, and his super PAC is attacking Nikki Haley in a new ad, while Haley's ads target Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and President Biden. So, let's dive into this with today's great panel. We got LZ Granderson, Los Angeles Times OpEd Columnist, Visiting Scholar at Western Michigan University; also former House Republican Adam Kinzinger, CNN Senior Political Commentator. He is also the Honorary Chairman of the Country First Political Action Committee. And last but not least in no way is Maria Cardona, a CNN Political Commentator and Democratic Strategist. All right. It's great to see you all. We've got a lot to talk about. Adam, I want to begin with you about Trump's praise for dictators, the escalating rhetoric and signs that maybe Nikki Haley is stepping up to criticize him on that, certainly very divergent views of foreign policy. Is it too little too late? Or are you on the Nikki Haley bandwagon right now? ADAM KINZINGER, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN, &amp; CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yeah. I mean, it feels like -- good to be with you, by the way. It feels like it's a little bit of too little too late. I mean, we're 27 days from the Iowa caucus. The last three or four months, it's not like Donald Trump had been quiet and he wasn't saying anything crazy. He was saying crazy stuff then. But now, it's like -- it's good. And I mean, I encourage her to -- you've got to go after Trump, but then the -- give that compliment sandwich of, yeah, but his policies were really good. It is tough to separate the man from his policies. When the man is praising dictators, I don't care what his policy is. He is a dictator praising President, and he obviously has an affection for that. So, look, I encourage anybody to come on the \"tell the truth train\" and I'm glad she is there. But, I guess if I was advising her four or five months ago, I'd say now is the time when he is 50 points up in the poll to go after him, not at the very end when people generally have their mind pretty made up.",

I think it is effective. And for those voters who believe that age is going to be a defining issue for them, meaning that they're not going to be able to vote for somebody who is old, like she says, I think it could be effective, but it might also then keep him from voting in November, because let's face it, to your point, just now the discussion you just had with Adam. I think it's too late for Nikki Haley. I think that she might have tried to get on the truth train. But, I think the truth train left her months ago. Right? If she had started telling the truth and going after Donald Trump at the very beginning, she might have had a chance to be maybe tied with him now at least in New Hampshire. But, look, she might be rising now. The momentum might be with her. But, I do think is too late. Now, anything can happen, obviously, right? New Hampshire, Iowa, today's politics, it's all crazy. Anything can happen. And a day is a lifetime in politics. But, the problem with Nikki Haley is that she can't have it both ways. And Adam just talked about this too. She can't say on the one hand that he is talking about being a dictator, and her criticizing that, and then saying that she supports his policies. Well, did she support when he separated babies from the arms of their mother? Did she support the Muslim ban? Did she support when he was calling his supporters to go and attack the Capitol? I mean, all of those are in the Trump package, and you cannot try to make yourself support that and then also divide yourself from it. It makes absolutely no sense.",

Look at the state attorney generals he has targeted. Look at the Heritage project, the Project 2025, and everything that's laid out for the first 180 days that the conservative movement wants to do. That doesn't mean Trump wants to do it all. But, I mean, there are tangible things we can actually look at, and ask ourselves, what does this mean?

And so, he knows that there is no downside to meddling. And so -- by the way, it's interesting, because somebody that sat through these briefings that has obviously seen classified information in my prior job, when they say high confidence, that is very rare for an intelligence agency to say high confidence. It means they've seen it happen. It's not a conjecture. It's not taking three or four pieces and making a complete picture with that. It's actually having seen different things without going into more information. I know they have the capability to do it. So, it's very clear. I mean, look, just a week ago, or even a couple days ago, Vladimir Putin is praising the Republicans for blocking aid to Ukraine. So, there is no doubt who he wants to win.

And so, I think that China and Russia and Cuba and all of these things put together in this package also underscore the kind of existential threat that Donald Trump will be if he is elected President, because he will kowtow to all of them. Even though he might have tough talk against some of them, he will kowtow to all of them, because they all have dictators. He loves dictators. He wants to be one. He wants to be a strong man. He said he would be a dictator on day one, if we actually let him near the Oval Office again. And he is a dictator on day one. Do we really think he is going to give up that power? So, he looks up to China. He looks up to Russia. He looks up to Cuba.

I don't think people really care about what you've done for them anymore, at least in this moment. So, if you go to somebody and say I voted for the infrastructure bill, which I did, by the way, I don't think they care, because they're wrapped up in these, yes, culture war issues, these issues they feel bad about.

But, there is also the political path, which is the reason why GovernorAbbott did what he did, because this is bad policy. It's racist. And it really echoes what Arizona tried to do a few years ago, where it's basically, show me your papers, a sort of bill that actually got them cost in the Super Bowl that year, I believe. And so, when you think about this, this is an extension of what we've seen before. Trying to find reasons to stop people of color in the street, like a stop and frisk sort of scenario, under the guise of this is good immigration policy, is bad policy. But, it's good politics in Texas. And this is why there is a problem here on the border. And believe it or not, there is a lot of people who look like me, who do not believe national Democrats take this issue seriously. So, whenever there is a school shooting or something horrific that's happening in Texas, and Governor Abbott gets in front of a microphone and says something insensitive, and you find yourself asking, how do people keep the mechanist man, is because he understands there is a real fear about resources here in Texas, as well as in Arizona, and California is facing as well, that when you're trying to handle that many people, if you don't have enough resources, guess who is going to pay for it, the people who live in those states. He understands that. That's the reason why he did this. It wasn't about the policy. It was about the politics.",

That's unless Congress gets its act together and approvesthe additional help President Biden has requested. The National Security Council and the Department of Defense have both stated that additional aid to Ukraine is in the United States' national interest. Joining us now is Anne Applebaum, author of \"The Twilight of Democracy\". She writes for The Atlantic, a Senior Fellow for the Johns Hopkins School of International Studies. And it's great to see you and to have you on the program. You've written so extensively and eloquently on this topic. I just want to know concisely, what is your message to Republicans on Capitol Hill opposing aid to Ukraine? ANNE APPLEBAUM, AUTHOR, \"THE TWILIGHT OF DEMOCRACY\", &amp; SENIOR FELLOW, JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: It is in our national interest that Ukraine not lose. Putin's goals in the war are the same now as they were two years ago. He said it last week, his goal is to destroy all of Ukraine, to replace the Ukrainian nation, to remove the President, to remove the government, to change the nature of the country. If this happens, there will be an immediate threat to Europe and to all of our allies in Europe. There will also be an immediate understanding that the United States failed that we made a promise. We didn't keep it. And other countries around the world who consider themselves our allies, in Asia, in Europe, will understand that as a message.",

But, there are certainly members of Congress who speak the same language. They use the same arguments that that Putin and his propagandists use. And so, I don't know what is the correct word for them. They're agents of influence. They're pro-Russian. They're acting on behalf of, I'm not sure what the right language is, but they are certainly acting on behalf of Russia when they block aid to Ukraine.",

So, he -- it's a long story, but essentially, he eliminated the independent judiciary. He mostly eliminated the independent media. He changed the rules of the Constitution and of the electoral laws that was almost impossible for him to lose. And he did so all the while using this language of culture war. Hungary is fighting the scourge of immigration, which, by the way, there are very few immigrants in Hungary. But, he achieved something that they admire. And they would like to do that too. They would also like to take power in the United States, and then never lose it. And I think his example for them and his proximity to Putin may have some influence on them as well. And I should also say, he and people around him make an effort to cultivate foreign politicians, like the Republican far right, like the French far right. They see that if they have allies in their illiberal undemocratic vision of the world that they will find it easier to stay in power.",

I think -- and there has been a running conversation going on for a number of months about why don't we unfreeze them and not give them back to Russia, but give them to Ukraine as a form of advanced reparations. And Russia has robbed Ukraine of its property rights, undermined Ukrainian sovereignty. And so -- and broken all kinds of international laws, and in recompense, we would give Ukraine Russian money. I think there are some risks to doing this. But, I think the time has come to take those risks. I mean, now that we have embedded in the U.S. system, and in some European systems, and certainly in the European community, we have pro-Russian politicians and political leaders who are arguing Russia's case. That's making it hard to get money to -- the money that Ukraine needs to continue fighting the war. And I think the time has come to give Russia's money to Ukraine. Why not?
