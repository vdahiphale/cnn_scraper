And then we have President Trump who has said somethings like, if countries don't pay what they're supposed to, he'll let Russia do whatever -- do whatever it wants to them. How does NATO go about protecting Ukraine in this case from the political headwinds and kind of the volatility that American politics can inject into this?",

It's casting a shadow over the entire summit.People wonder, what's going on with President Biden? Is he fit to lead as president today? Will he run for reelection? Will he be replaced? And if he's not, is it going to be Donald Trump? And what is he going to do? That question about American leadership is fundamental and hanging over the summit. Now, what should be done and you asked this in your question. We should be institutionalizing ways of supporting Ukraine so that we are a little bit more secure against the volatility in our own democratic systems. Of course, the Congress is going to have times when other priorities and it's going to be difficult to pass something. The same thing with the European Union. So let's establish a couple of key things. A fund at NATO, based on the existing cost share formula -- the U.S. pays 20 percent -- to say that this is how we're going to provided ammunition and arms for Ukraine over the long term. Let's put in place the Lend-Lease arrangements that we had on the books until the end of '22. Get them back in there so Ukraine can borrow money if needed without depending upon an appropriation from the U.S. Congress. The E.U. could put in place of fund for increasing their defense industrial production and providing that to Ukraine. A lot of steps could be taken that are more structural than what we're doing right now.",

That is Senator Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Now which one of them is at the top of the list? Well, it really depends on who Donald Trump spoke to last and who reporters are speaking to. Remember, there are a lot of people who are allies of all three of these men who really want to see their person win, which means they might hear a different thing from Donald Trump than, say, someone else here. All of this to say we are reading every tea leave. We are waiting to see what he does and when he does it. One thing I will say is not to read too much into the fact that he is currently doing a rally in Miami and the only one on that list is Senator Marco Rubio, who is going to be here tonight.

Now we have seen records just being broken around the region. I mean, Palm Springs, all time new high of 124 degrees, Las Vegas 120. That was hit on Sunday. Today -- or yesterday, hit 115, if you can call that a cool off. Not really. And then you have Ukiah 117, Palm Dale at 115.

And the extent of this heatwave and how long it's hanging around. Death Valley, that hitting 125 degrees. That is expected to continue. These temperatures through Friday and through many of these other places through the weekend as well. So it's not just that fact that they are hitting these temperatures, it's the length of time as well, Boris, of these heatwaves that are making them so entirely dangerous. And you've got to keep in mind that a lot of these people live near the coast or they live in parts of the state or area where they don't need air conditioning, usually.

But they are concerned about these winds picking up in the afternoon. And that is dangerous because all it takes is a little bit of a breeze to pick up an ember of fire, below it to another home or another building nearby, and that fire could become engulfed in flames. This is the concern. And then on top of that, think about those firefighters that are out there with all of that gear hiking up through that rough terrain to put out these blazes. It's also very dangerous for them. Well, we saw with an earlier fire that some of the firefighters were hurt because of heat illnesses, but they were expected to recover.
