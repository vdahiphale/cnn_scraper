There's no doubt about that.But they have been using nuclear-capable weapons against Ukraine from the very beginning. There's four or five 5 different types of missiles and other weapons that are delivered by various means that are all capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. So again, I think that we should not make too much out of this. And in fact, it strikes me a little bit of Russian -- they're worried. I mean, they're worried because they see that Ukraine already is achieving very good effect with the ATACMs and also with the Storm Shadows, which they can now use against headquarters, against logistics. And so the Russians are going to do what they can to try and (TECHNICAL ISSUES) decision on doing this.",

They -- they may not have known the target, obviously. But you know, if you're going to launch a weapon like an ICBM or, in this case, this medium-range weapon, there are a lot of things that happen that can be detected. So I don't know this, but my guess is that they decided to alert the various embassies that there could be something coming towards Kyiv. And so the different nations took different steps to deal with that. So again, I think that this was appropriate. We'll probably see our great diplomats back at work. And in fact, I'm pretty sure some of them never left. They'll be back at work tomorrow.",

      "sentences": "Yes, including yours truly. It's how I'm coming to you live right now.Well, this follows the landmark ruling earlier this year, finding that Google had violated U.S. antitrust law with its search business. The question now is, what to do about that finding? OK? The court says that Google is acting illegally. So what to do about it? Overnight, the Justice Department filed its proposal. It wants the government to, in this case, the court, to force Google to spin off Chrome, to break the Chrome browser off from the rest of Google. And that's part of a broader effort to break up some of the tight integrations of Google products. But it's those integrations of products that Google says makes everything work so well. So Google's chief legal officer, Kent Walker, came out saying the DOJ is being overly broad here with this proposal, pushing a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans. That's the Google position. What you can tell from that statement is that they will clearly appeal this. In other words, this is going to take months, probably years to play out. But if this does go through, if the court does order Google to break up in this way it would be the most significant antitrust penalty for any tech company in a generation.",

Comcast saying it's going to spin off most of its cable channels, including MSNBC and CNBC, into a separate private -- a separate publicly traded company. This process is going to take about a year.And there's lots of opinions about why Comcast might be doing it. Are they trying to come up with a growth opportunity for the industry, as they say, or are they trying to get rid of assets that are declining in value in the streaming era? I would say the Google story and the cable story are connected in the following way. With the incoming Trump administration, there may be a much more beneficial environment for mergers and acquisitions. The DOJ, actually, when Trump takes over, might decide to punish Google, not to follow through with the penalties that we just talked about. Conversely, the incoming Trump administration might decide that MSNBC or CNBC is not friendly enough, particularly MSNBC, and try to slow down any deal or try to stop any deal. So there's so much uncertainty right now in the marketplace, whether it's big tech or media. And a lot of that uncertainty has to do with the change in administrations.",

So we're talking poverty level.Whether we do some cutting here or adding here, it's never going to be enough for someone to retire. So you need to be your own retirement plan. Do not rely on the government. Instead, rely on the U.S. economy. We've seen the stock market double over the past seven years. So if you've been putting money in that 401K or that Roth IRA, you're going to do far better than these measly Social Security benefits that we call Social Insecurity.",

There's no other place you're going to find random income. Otherwise, you have your kids trying to support you. That's what we're seeing. They're called Silver Squatters now, where they go, hey, kids, we got to move back in with you because we didn't prepare for retirement. So the only option here is to continue working to bring in that extra income. And there's a simple solution here. It's called margin. You've got to spend less or make more. So we've got to cut your lifestyle down, which means getting rid of those debt payments before we retire, getting rid of the mortgage before we retire so that we can lower our monthly expenses and retire with dignity. And it's very much possible, even for those that are getting started later. If you're 40 with nothing in retirement and you invest 15 percent of the average household income, that's 80 grand, you'll be a millionaire by 63, $1.3,000,000 in that nest egg.",
