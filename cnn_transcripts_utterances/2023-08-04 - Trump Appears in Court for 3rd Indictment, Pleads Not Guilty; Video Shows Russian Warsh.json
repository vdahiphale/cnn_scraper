What is normally a mundane proceeding. It is not that when it is of a former president. As the former president is waking up this morning after being arraigned yesterday, he is in Bedminster, his New Jersey home. He did plead not guilty for the third time in a courtroom yesterday in just four months, this time on charges stemming from his efforts to stay in power after he lost the 2020 election. The clock is ticking. The next hearing just a few weeks from now. That is when a trial date will be set. Trump's lawyers indicate they will attempt to delay the trial, push it out. So this just sets the stage for a chaotic campaign season, disrupted by court dates. We do have new reporting this morning on how Trump is feeling, his state of mind, and his political positioning moving forward. Sources tell our Kaitlan Collins the former president was irked that the judge referred to him simply as \"Mr. Trump,\" rather than his presidential title. And his lawyer foreshadowing that Trump is preparing to use the charges to revisit his election fight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She will then set at least the beginning of a timeline. Sometimes in that scenario, a judge will say, I'm going to go all the way to the end and set a trial date and work backwards. Sometimes a judge will say, let's set some intermediate dates, and then we'll hold off. But we'll set a trial date at some point in the future. I think this judge is going to set a trial date. Now, I also think she's given the signals that she's said so far I think she wants to get this in before the election. Easier said than done, though. Because let's keep in mind: 2024 looking ahead. March and April are already occupied by the Manhattan D.A. hush-money case. May into June and July are already occupied by Jack Smith's other case.

This has been a major problem since 2021. Iran has seized around 20 of these ships, including oil tankers. And the U.S. has tried to figure out a way to deter that. Now, this plan could be implemented not just in days or weeks -- not just in weeks or months, I should say, but it could come in a matter of days. There has been no final decision made here. And these ships, importantly, would have to actually request this additional security.
