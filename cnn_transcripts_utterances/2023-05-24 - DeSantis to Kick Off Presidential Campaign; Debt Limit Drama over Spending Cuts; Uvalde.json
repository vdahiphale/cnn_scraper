The event will be audio only and promises a live, unscripted Q&amp;A session. Right now polling shows the Republican governor Donald Trump wants endorsed poses the greatest primary threat to the current GOP front-runner. DeSantis' decision to take this virtual stage tonight, one of the latest attacks being hurled, of course, from Trump's team. CNN reporter Steve Contorno is leading off the hour.

This is months in the making. He's spent most of the spring touring the country on a book tour, giving -- doing this policy rollout and building an agenda for him to run on. And now it will be official that he will be challenging Donald Trump for supremacy of the Republican Party going forward. Last night, his wife, Casey DeSantis, teased this coming announcement with this video, showing her husband about to walk out on the stage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

But it is also a controversial choice.Elon Musk's stewardship of Twitter has been full of criticisms of how he has operated. He has embraced conspiracy theories and the far right. However, DeSantis has tried to curry favor with the conservative influencers that have embraced the new Twitter. And he will use them to sort of build influence to take on Donald Trump. He will also need a lot of money to go after the former president. And following today's announcement, he is holding a fund-raiser this week in Miami, where his donors have been told it's time to start dialing for dollars. Already he has about $100 million in various accounts and that's expected to grow. Of course, Donald Trump is a well-funded candidates and between his various super PACs supporting him and his campaign, he's raised over $100 million. So we will have a long, expensive fight between these two Republican heavyweights for the nomination starting tonight.",

They've tried to negotiate on a whole other range of issues as part of Republicans' conditions to raise the debt ceiling. The Democrats have tried to offer their preferred ideas as well but the Speaker has indicated to me publicly yesterday that he will only agree to one concession and that is to raise the national debt limit. No other priorities whatsoever. And that position has rankled Democrats and rankled the White House, which believes that they need to have some of their priorities added as well in order to get Democratic support out of the House and even through the United States Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Just moments ago, I caught up with Kevin McCarthy's top negotiator in the room, Patrick McHenry, who defended the Republican approach and refusal to offering any concessions and also indicated that he believes that the White House badly miscalculated in their initial position that they would not negotiate with Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC):  The predicate to get this out of the House is that we have to cut spending. That unlocks the rest of the negotiations.
