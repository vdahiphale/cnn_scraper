The U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Donald Trump and future presidents have some immunity from prosecution. French fright. A round one victory to the far-right National Rally leaves rival parties looking to block them in this weekend's decisive vote. Boeing backlash. The company set to avoid a criminal trial over the two 737 MAX crashes, according to a lawyer for the victim's families. We'll speak to a woman whose father died in the second crash. And a brain chip breakthrough. A competitor to Elon Musk's Neuralink preparing to test on humans. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, Supreme Court confusion. Donald Trump has the immunity for official acts he took while president. That's the ruling from the High Court in a six to three decision. Now, it's up to a lower court to decide just what counts as official versus unofficial. The White House responding, saying, \"Nobody is above the law.\" The decision is the latest blow to officials prosecuting Donald Trump. It's expected to further delay the federal trial he faces for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election. Paula Reid has more on what today's ruling means. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Presidents have to be given total immunity. They have to be allowed to do their job. PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court partially siding with Former President Donald Trump in his ongoing January 6th case, ruling that former presidents are entitled to some immunity from prosecution for official actions, but not for private conduct. In the 6-3 opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority, at least with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. The president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the president does is official. The president is not above the law. The high court, though, leaving it up to lower courts to determine which actions are official and therefore immune. Roberts writing, other allegations, such as those involving Trump's interactions with the vice president, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public, present more difficult questions. Meaning, District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing Trump's January 6th case, will need to decide whether Trump's pressure campaign to get Vice President Pence --",

So, what we have here, it's not a total win for Mr. Trump, it's a partial win, and it's not a total loss for Mr. Smith, Jack Smith, the prosecutor, but what it does do, it sends it back to the district court judge who is going to have a Herculean task of having evidentiary hearings to determine which of the three buckets we're talking about with respect to the allegations in the indictment. Here's the bad news for Mr. Trump, though, Julia. This case may not be tried to a jury this year, but the bad news is you're going to have fulsome and extensive evidentiary hearings to determine whether it's bucket one, two, or three that a particular allegation falls into.

It's an actual movement. BELL (voice-over): Marine Le Pen's party held just 88 seats in parliament before Macron called the snap elections. Now, it leads the votes, securing outright 38 seats in the first round, with projections showing that it leads the race in more than half of 501 seats that are up for grabs in the second round. The far-right now poised for a parliamentary majority with the remaining question of whether or not it will be absolute and with that, whether the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella will become the next prime minister. JORDAN BARDELLA, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RALLY PARTY (through translator): I'm the only one in this election who can talk about the substance and the day- to-day concerns of the French people, purchasing power security and immigration. BELL (voice-over): But it is on France's relationship with the rest of the world that some of the biggest questions arise in particular what a far- right French government would mean for Europe and for Ukraine. DONALD TUSK, POLISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): This is all really starting to smell of great danger, not only the results of the first round of the French elections, but also the information about Russian influence and Russian services in many parts of the radical right in Europe. BELL (voice-over): Long seen as a fringe party, considered too toxic by some to be electable, its move to center stage has led to calls for the country to unite against it ahead of this Sunday's second round of voting, which will see an unprecedented number of races between three candidates, representing the far-right, the left-wing new popular front alliance, which came second, and Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble coalition. Within that coalition, the Renaissance Party, eight years after it was created, looks set to be the main victim of an election its founder never even had to call. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.

Even this plea deal, it offers them the ability to choose their own independent monitors. And what got us in the situation to begin with was allowing Boeing to self-regulate.

Now, Elon Musk's Neuralink company is taking its first steps towards its goal of merging man and machine. Earlier this year, it implanted a chip into the brain of a quadriplegic man who is now able to control a computer using just his thoughts. And not far behind is Austin, Texas-based Paradromics. It's set to begin trials of its brain implant device next year. It's announced on Monday that it will join a U.S. program to help speed up the review process of its products. Paradromics hopes to begin selling its devices by the end of the decade. And Matt Angle is the CEO and he joins us now. Matt, fantastic to have you on the show. Just let's take a step back. Give us the vision of Paradromics.",

The first people to benefit from this technology will be people who have lost the ability to communicate because of severe paralysis.

The ability to communicate is essential, to be able to say I love you to a family member or to be able to communicate your own health care needs to your own doctor.

And right now, we're extremely lucky to have people at the FDA who have expertise and brain computer interfaces and fundamentally want to bring safe efficacious devices to patients as soon as safely possible.

And I think one aspect that you've put your finger on is that anything that is a powerful tool can be used for potentially nefarious things. I think an even more important ethical consideration, though, is for the good things that it can do, how do we get -- how do we provide access to people? Because these are expensive devices. When they go to market, I anticipate that they will cost six figures, and yet, they're also life- changing therapies. And so, from my perspective, maybe the most important ethical consideration is access, and how do we make sure that governments and private insurance payers are going to pay for these devices when they become available.",

Anyone else would have stepped away after this. An incredible save by the Atletico Madrid keeper, Jan Oblak. Now, Oblak knows Ronaldo from their time together in Madrid. Ronaldo was playing for Real, Oblak still is at Atletico. So, he pulled off that save and everybody expected Ronaldo to shrink away. But instead, he stepped up, he scored the first. And then, the goalkeeper for Portugal, Diogo Costa, 24 years old, plays for Porto in Portugal, he pulled off three saves, the first keeper to pull off three saves in a shootout in European championship football history. A wonderful night for Portugal, but a very dramatic night for that man there, Ronaldo. He will dominate the news agenda and the sports agenda. I should say tomorrow.
