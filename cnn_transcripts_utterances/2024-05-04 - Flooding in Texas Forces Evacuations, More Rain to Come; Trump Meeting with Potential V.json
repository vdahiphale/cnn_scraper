I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with the dangerous weather situation in Texas that could get even more treacherous this weekend. Heavy downpours in parts of the state have swept away vehicles, damaged homes, and triggered evacuations. Some areas have gotten hit with almost two feet of rain triggering widespread flooding. And more rain is in the forecast. CNN correspondent Rosa Flores is in Houston for us. So, Rosa, people living in the flood-ravaged communities are bracing for more rain. And I see the air boats behind you. They're ready for evacuations or picking up people?",

So I haven't talked to them yet. But let me set the scene for you because this is just an extraordinary amount of water that has a fallen in this area and is impacting real people and real communities.This road that I'm on leads to an area that has that has waterfront property that you can't see anymore because the San Jacinto River just swallowed this road and you can see that people are using jet skis right now to get around instead of cars because the river swallowed the road. And just to give you a sense, this road leads to a community that has many homes in the Rio Villa area. But, Fred, you can't see any of these homes. You can't see the road and you see that people are using air boats or simply boats to get around right now. Now we have a map of the evacuation area and that gives you a sense in what part of the city of Houston and Harris County that we are in right now because it is the northeast part of that area. It's where the San Jacinto East Fork side of the river is. Now the Trinity River is just east of there and there are issues down both of those rivers. Those of course empty out into the Gulf of Mexico. Now we do have a video of some of the rescues that are happening. I just got off the phone with the Houston Office of Emergency Management and they tell me that, A, rescues are happening, but also that they are trying to convince people to evacuate if they are in these evacuation zones. And all you have to see is what you see behind me, this river that has swallowed up a road. And you can see the current. This is not normal, this is not supposed to be what you're seeing here. You're supposed to be seeing a road, cars driving by, and instead, you see a roaring river that's emptying into a bay which that bay empties out into the Gulf of Mexico. Now about the number of people who are impacted, I asked the city of Houston Office of Emergency Management that question and they say that they don't know at this point. They're best estimate is that hundreds of homes are impacted, but they haven't been out to do damage assessments. Those will be happening on Monday. So on Monday, we'll get a better sense as to the number of individuals who are impacted, the number of homes who are impacted. Now, Fred, one of the biggest frustrations for first responders right now is individuals who are moving barricades from roads and trying to drive through rising water.",

But like you said, turn around, don't drown.All right, Rosa Flores. Thank you so much. We're going to check back with you and hopefully we'll also find out where the people in the air boats went off to, who they're trying to help or assist in all of this. Thank you. All right, joining me right now as well is Hayley Adams, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Houston and Galveston. Haley, great to see you. So we're talking about one to two inches of rain expected today, right? What are the big concerns that come with that? HAYLEY ADAMS, METEOROLOGIST, NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, HOUSTON- GALVESTON OFFICE: So of course we already have widespread flooding going on generally north of the city, so of course that additional rainfall is not going to help matters in any case. Our main concern is for the next 24 hours, really through Sunday night, expecting another complex of thunderstorms that could be rolling through and could be dumping anywhere from one to three inches average. But we're seeing some potential swaths of higher amounts, four to eight inches possible within that watch area.",

You know, our reporting, when they're talking about 20 inches of rain, you know, in a very short period of time in parts of Texas and Louisiana, you know, very flat. A lot of this water doesn't have anywhere to go. Some of them like in Houston, you know, right along the river of the San Jacinto River.So help people understand, you know, how this concentration of water, what it's resulted in. I mean not a lot of this water has anywhere to go. It's only accumulating and in some places when I talked to emergency management a little bit ago the water hasn't even crested in some areas and it's already dangerously high. ADAMS: Right. So even before this event, we had another rainfall event, so our soils were already pretty saturated. So you add on all this rainfall that we've gotten in the last week and it just -- it's created a mess and over the last seven days, we've had portions of northeast Harris County received just over 11 inches of rain in the last week and in the Lake Livingston area, that's in Polk County. That location, we've seen some reports of around 20 inches of rain in the last week alone. Closer to the city and generally south of I-10. We've seen less rainfall in those areas. One to three inches, isolated four inches in the last week, but I would say north of the city around Lake Livingston area, Huntsville, have seen an enormous amount of rain in the last week alone. And of course, as I mentioned earlier, we've had rainfall prior to that. So this rainwater really hasn't had anywhere to go. And you tack on the rivers nearby with that and it's created a really big mess here.",

When I've talked to people, they said, you know, Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, and she's to co-chair of the RNC, as well as the RNC chairman Michael Whatley, they were some of the featured speakers alongside Donald Trump.And a lot of people in the room, as you mentioned, who could potentially be one of Donald Trump's vice presidential picks. People like Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. Two of his former Republican primary challengers, Tim Scott and Doug Burgum, all of them in the room brushing shoulders with the former president this weekend. And I do just want to be clear, though, Fred, when I speak to Donald Trump's team, they insist that he's still a long ways away from deciding who his running mate is going to be. They expect that decision to be made closer to the Republican National Convention in July. However, it's still a really good opportunity for them to brush shoulders with the former president and show him his support. Now another interesting figure who is also here this weekend at the RNC retreat in Palm Beach, they're all staying at the Four Seasons, is South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. And of course, she has been at the center of a lot of headlines lately over some of the excerpts in her book including one excerpt where she describes shooting and killing her dog. She's been trying to do damage control for the last week or so around that and she's here as well.

On Monday, Donald Trump will return to a New York courtroom as testimony in his hush money trial continues. The second week of testimony wrapped up on Friday with a day of dramatic testimony from one of his top former officials, Hope Hicks. The former White House communications director looked noticeably uncomfortable as she avoided eye contact with her former boss. While on the stand, she described the fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape and the Trump White House response to stories about hush money payments. And after a key moment in her testimony, she began crying. Joining me right now to talk more about the trial is CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers. She is a former federal prosecutor. Jennifer, great to see you. So let me start with that dramatic moment where Hope Hicks started to cry on the witness stand. How might that impact a jury? JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think, Fred, really the issue is that she was very believable. I think that her discomfort, you know, she started crying at the end of the direct examination before she was asked any questions on cross, and most people who were in the room who I've heard relay what happens said that it seemed like she just kind of realized she had said some things that could hurt her former mentor and the former president Donald Trump, and so she was emotional about that. So I think the jury is going to look at her in a human way and say she was emotional. You know, she didn't want to hurt his prospects, but she's here telling the truth. So I think it will go over well in terms of their view of her as a witness. I think they will believe her.",

Nothing on the fraudulent financial documents and in fact, we haven't heard much about that at all. None of the witnesses to date have really tackled that issue.

It's almost inevitable that Joe Biden, and kind of who he is and the politics that he emerged from, would feel strongly about speaking out against that.The problem is, in so doing, you know, he is reaffirming kind of a positioning that puts him crosswise with not only a majority of young adults but increasingly a majority of Democrats. You know, there is overwhelming disapproval among younger Democrats, in particular, younger voters in general, about the way Israel is conducting the war in Gaza and Biden's approach to it. And so he has gone a long way down the road of linking arms with Netanyahu, criticizing him, but not imposing consequences.
