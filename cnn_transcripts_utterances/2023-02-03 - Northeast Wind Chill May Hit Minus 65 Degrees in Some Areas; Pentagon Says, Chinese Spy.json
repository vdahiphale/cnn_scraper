The northeast could see some of the coldest weather in decades. Forecasters are warning it could be epic and not in a good way. Once in a generation potentially with wind chills plunging to 50 degrees below zero in some parts of New England. Look at some of these wind chills in the forecast. Here in New York City, minus seven degrees. In Boston, it gets worse, minus 32 degrees. We're going to go there live in a moment. That is not a typo, though. The wind chill could reach minus 100 degrees on top of Mt. Washington in New Hampshire because of those hurricane-force winds. The arctic blast in the northeast comes after a deadly ice storm wreaked havoc across the south leaving at least eight people dead. We're going to check in on the latest forecast in a moment. But, first, we have our CNN affiliate reporter Melissa Cooney live on the ground in Burlington, Vermont. Melissa, I know it's already close to zero degrees where you are. How are officials in the area bracing for this? How bad are we expecting it to get?",

Right now, as you said, we're teetering on zero to one degree, and over 200 schools have already been closed here in Vermont. And multiple ski resorts are shutting down too, which is unique because, of course, they love the cold.A few ski resorts, like Stow, are staying open with some lifts in and some not. But right now, this is severe with the wind chill we're seeing, negative 17-degree wind chill right now. And temperatures here in Vermont have dropped 30 degrees since the night. I'm going to show you something. I've been freezing a pair of jeans all morning. And as you could see, this is rock solid. This pretty much only took 15 minutes to freeze. That is really how cold it is here in Vermont. At the waterfront center, we actually saw some folks swimming just about two minutes, which is interesting because we have a polar plunge here, an annual event. That too has been canceled due to the severe weather. For now, we also know that this has been a warmer January. It's pretty unique because the winter has been the fourth warmest January on record until currently. Right now, we are seeing the negative temperatures for the first time all winter, which is actually quite unique. And even more so, we are going to get even warmer next week. We're going to be in the 30s and the 40s. So, this is just a temporary cold snap, but you're right, folks in the area are bracing for the cold. Some we spoke to say they are not going to leave their house. And others, you know, Vermonters like to be in the wilderness. It's like what we do. So, for now, we are live in Burlington, Melissa Cooney.",

But it's the wind that will blow through every single crack in your home that will try to cool the inside from the out.Winds are going to be 50 miles per hour. On top of Mt. Washington right now, which is in New Hampshire, it's way up there, it's the highest peak in the East Coast, 83 miles per hour right now. And that number could actually go up later on today. Tomorrow morning will be the coldest part of this. This is a quick hitting storm. It does leave by Sunday. But look at the wind chill forecast here from now moving you ahead into the 20s and 30s degrees below zero. So, Saratoga to the spa all the way up to Vermont and Burlington, those are the areas that have said, hey, don't even travel. Do not go out. These are dangerous numbers. Yes, they look silly at 34 degrees below zero. But you don't think about how much colder than that is than freezing, freezing at 32. Here is 66 degrees below freezing. Those are real numbers in Montreal and Quebec City and up toward (INAUDIBLE). You're already feeling it right now. That is our neighbors to the north on up into Canada, Ontario and Quebec. They're feeling it at this point. New York City, you go from 8 to 56 in just the next few days. Buffalo, you're going to get cold but not as cold as New England.

There may even be communications gear that can intercept certain audio. So, you know, the question really, Kaitlan,l is what are they looking for? They're flying over key military installations. But I think the thing is you follow the path, you see where it goes. And you'll have a good idea of what they're looking for depending on where it ends up.

So, it's over populated areas.I think the real question we have to struggle with here is this is a big, fat, conspicuous thing in the intelligence world when you fly a giant balloon the size of three buses over the Continental United States. It's provocative. So, why? You have got the secretary of defense who is in the Philippines saying, we're going to beef up our military presence here in case we need to respond to Taiwan. You have the secretary of state heading to China to meet with leaders there about detained Americans, chemicals to make fentanyl being shipped from China to Mexican cartels.
