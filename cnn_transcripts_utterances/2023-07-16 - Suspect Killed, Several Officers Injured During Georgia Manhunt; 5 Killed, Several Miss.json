Ben, great to see you. Let me just ask you because it seems maybe a little counterintuitive to be asking this question on what these Pew findings show us because Democrats did a lot better than expected in the 2022 midterms.

At the same time, the fact that we won in the governor's race in Wisconsin within a point of the Senate race here, we won in Pennsylvania, in Arizona, in Michigan, these key battleground states, I think underscores that it's not just who votes.

It was breakpoint for Novak Djokovic to go up two games to love in the fifth set after he won the fourth set. He had all the momentum, and it looked like to me that Alcaraz was sort of looking at history saying, well, this is the way it goes kind of thing. And Novak missed a very easy swing volley to go up to love, and instead Carlos held on to his serve to go one all on the fifth, and then Carlos broke him immediately after that to go up 2-1.

Initially Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was seen as the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. But now according to \"The New York Times,\" quote, \"Mr. Murdoch has privately told people that he would still like to see Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia enter the race according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.\"I should note here Governor Youngkin has publicly said he has no intention of jumping into the 2024 presidential race. Let's bring in CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy. And Oliver, I mean, it sounds like FOX News, Murdoch, they have not learned their lesson from that massive Dominion lawsuit.

I think what's interesting to note is as the conservative media universe has really grown in the last 10, 15 years, his influence has started to slip. And I think you're seeing that right now.He wants to stop Trump. We know he doesn't like Trump. He privately disparages Trump. But he seems unable and powerless to do so. First he after the 2020 election tried to throw his weight behind DeSantis and spotlight DeSantis while basically sidelining and ignoring Trump, and that really hasn't worked. You've seen DeSantis' campaign still fail to really be able to take on Trump. And so now I think he's looking at other options, maybe thinking Youngkin can do it. But the bottom line is that while he still is influential in conservative politics, he may not be as influential at this moment as Donald Trump.",

He was someone who watched the channel and was misled by the false election claims being made on FOX News in the aftermath of the 2020 election.So he went to the Capitol to protest, and afterward he found himself being defamed by Tucker Carlson on the channel and basically being drawn into this conspiracy theory that he was one of the people purportedly working with the federal government to incite rioters to attack the Capitol. This is all part of Tucker Carlson's false flag conspiracy theory. Anyway, so now he is suing the network. He demanded a retraction. FOX News never did that, and it's just adding to the legal mess that the network has had to deal with for all the nonsense it peddled to viewers in the aftermath of the election.",
