Just ahead, a special operation in Rafah bringing two Israeli hostages home 128 days after they were first captured. Those scenes unfolding amid more devastation for Gaza with dozens reported dead after another round of Israeli strikes.And the Kansas City Chiefs notched their third Super Bowl win in five years. We're live in Las Vegas with the highlights from the thriller in the desert. Good to have you with us and we begin this hour in Gaza where the Israel Defense Forces says two hostages have been rescued from the southern city of Rafah during a special operation overnight. The two men are now at a medical facility in Israel where they are said to be in good condition. The IDF also says they conducted a series of strikes in one district in Rafah. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says more than 100 people have been killed in those strikes and says the death toll may rise further with people still trapped under the rubble. All this comes as concerns are growing over a potential Israeli ground offensive in Raffa. Journalist Elliott Gotkine is following developments from London, but we begin with CNN's Nic Robertson who is standing by in Tel Aviv. So Nic, what more are you learning about this special Israeli military operation that successfully rescued two hostages?",

      "sentences": "Rosemary, I mean these would appear to be the most intense strikes that Israel has carried out on Rafah since the start of this war on October the 7th with the Hamas terrorist attacks. But let's not forget that this isn't the first time that the war has come to Rafah. It's been a part of this war since day one, with Israel carrying out strikes every now and then.And I suppose the countries and the leaders around the world who have been expressing grave concern about the possibility of an Israeli ground operation in Rafah will perhaps feel even more concerned after this operation to see more than 100 fatalities, albeit with a successful rescue of two Israeli hostages. And I suppose the big questions which everyone is still asking is how exactly does Israel propose to evacuate more than a million Palestinians, more than half the population of the Gaza Strip, many of whom have been displaced multiple times and taken refuge in Rafah? How is Israel going to get that many people out of Rafah to enable it to carry out its ground operations? And where are they going to go? And as far as the operations are concerned, Israel is convinced that there are four Hamas battalions remaining in Rafah and feels that in order for it to be able to achieve one of its key wartime missions, namely destroying Hamas militarily, it has to destroy those battalions. And Prime Minister Netanyahu in interviews over the weekend saying that anyone who says to Israel that you shouldn't go into Rafah is simply saying that Israel should lose the war and Hamas should stay. And the other thing to note about Rafah is, of course, that it is on the border with Egypt. And it is believed and suspected by Israel that under the ground there, that has been where the tunnels that Hamas has managed to bring in so many materials and supplies and weapons to help its war machine keep running, where everything from fuel to the materials it needs to build that sprawling tunnel network to rockets, to rocket launchers, it believes that many of those would have come through tunnels under the ground from Egypt into Rafah, and that is another reason why this is a key part of Israel's war objectives. But as we know, there is grave concern not just regionally, from the Saudis, from the Emiratis. The U.K. has expressed concern. We've had the EU's foreign policy chief warning of a potential unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe if Israel goes in on the ground. Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu has instructed the IDF to create or come up with a detailed plan of how to do so. And I suppose while everyone was focused on that, and this was also something that Netanyahu discussed with President Biden over the weekend. You know, no one was really thinking that there might be the kind of operation that we've just seen happening overnight. And I suppose Israel will feel emboldened by that operation and hold that up as evidence of why it needs to go into Rafah. Rosemary?",

He has also criticized some of the member nations for not spending as much money on defense as he believes that they should or not reaching the suggested 2 percent of GDP to put towards the NATO pocket.But what we've heard is a very swift and a very stiff pushback from those within NATO itself and also from European leaders. We've heard, for example, from Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, saying, quote, \"any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U.S. and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk.\" Now, the basis of NATO, at the core of NATO, is this Article 5, which stipulates that if one member nation is attacked, then all member nations act as though they are attacked. They would all come to the defense of that one particular country. Now, what we've heard from the former president over the weekend suggests that may not be the case if Trump were to be in power once again as well, and it is increasing concerns within NATO.

It did look like that way for much of the game. You know, the first half was rather slow, lots of punting. A lot of people were like, yeah, this is not going to be one of the greater Super Bowls we've ever seen, but it certainly did not turn out that way because Super Bowl 58 is going to go down as one of the best finishes the game has ever seen.To show you how it all went down, you mentioned Taylor Swift was here to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play in the Super Bowl. She got showed on the jumbotron and even started chugging her drink for all of her fans. Now, not a lot of offense in the first half picking up with the Chiefs down 10 to 6 and they were punting. But this play really changed the game. The ball hits a Niners players' foot. They can't field it. Chiefs recover just totally swung the momentum. Very next play, Patrick Mahomes or Marquez Valdez scantling Chiefs take their first lead of the game, 13 to 6. Niners, though they would come right back. Brock Purdy to Jauan Jennings. So, the Niners go back on top, but Jake Moody's extra point was blocked, and that would be huge because the Chiefs would kick a field goal in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter to send this game to overtime, tied at 19. Just the second overtime game in Super Bowl history. Niners get the ball first, kick a field goal. So, then Mahomes had a chance to go 75 yards to win it, and he did just that, finding Mecole Hardman for the three-yard touchdown to win the Super Bowl. Chiefs beat the Niners 25-22, their third Super Bowl title in five years. Taylor Swift on the field celebrating with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, giving him a big smooch and some hugs. And for Mahomes, he wins his third Super Bowl MVP and he's already thinking about going for three titles in a row.",

Now, this call came amid tensions between the two leaders and at a critical juncture for hostage negotiations.Now, according to the senior administration official, this call lasted about 45 minutes, two-thirds of it focused specifically on the release of hostages. Now, U.S. officials have been working around the clock to hammer out a framework that would include the freeing of those hostages as well as a humanitarian pause. Now, there are significant gaps that remain, but it's unclear exactly what they are and what progress can be made in the days and weeks to come. But President Biden, according to the White House, re-emphasized the need to capitalize on the progress so far. This of course, following pushback from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called Hamas's recent proposals, quote, \"delusional.\" Now another important element of this phone call was about the military operation that Israel has suggested would happen in Rafah. That is a city that has more than a million Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced and have nowhere else to go. Now, a senior administration official said that the U.S. has taken issue with this, noting that under the current conditions, the U.S. cannot see how this would happen.

There's been some talk of moving them into northern Gaza, but the Israeli defense force is still undertaking operations there against Hamas units. So there really is nowhere for these people to go, and they are very much in harm's way. Either as a result of Hamas deliberately putting them in harm's way as human shields, which we all need to accept does happen, or because the Israelis are undertaking military operations in densely urbanized, built-up areas packed with civilians. I think what the Israelis may need to do is not repeat what they did today with that large-scale airstrikes.

I think that as the Israeli defense force moves south, there is a greater risk that more civilians will be harmed. There's a greater risk for the hostages, that they'll be harmed. And at the same time, the Hamas group will try to exploit every single civilian that is harmed for their benefit. So this is a really difficult situation. I do think that it's time for the Israeli defense force to stop with these air attacks and these artillery attacks and start going on the ground with precision and with recognition that they have to follow the laws of armed conflict which express proportionality and international humanitarian law.

That's where you're looking at that threat for the 70-mile-per-hour wind gusts, large hail, and a few tornados. Some heavy rain there, too. You can see that line continues to push east and then move north into the Carolinas into Monday.And as we go late Monday into Tuesday, it starts to clash into cold air up in parts of the northeast going into New England. And that's going to pump some snow from central Pennsylvania, Upstate New York, and parts of New England. And we'll find that snow come with some gusty winds and could drop visibility late Monday, early Tuesday morning, and then going into Tuesday night, all of that starts to exit. Here's your footprint of the snow. You see the deep pinks and purples? That's where we're looking at snow totals 6 to 8, even upwards of 12 inches of snow. Snowfall rates could be 1 to 3 inches per hour. Couple that with a gusty winds, gusting to 40 miles per hour. You're looking at some really messy conditions, low visibility kind of peaking as we go into Tuesday, really, again, exiting Tuesday night. Now, we haven't really seen much snow in the east. A lot of our snow depth so far this year has been to the west, 25 percent snow cover for the lower 48. And a lot of it from the Sierra Nevada's into the Intermountain West where we had that atmospheric river event unfold just a week or so ago. Seasonal departure from normal for snow has been well below average for some places from the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes area, then going into New England. Some places that you really typically see snow, like Minneapolis, Buffalo, haven't really seen too much so far this year. And part of the reason is, we've had a really warm winter. You see all the red dots. A lot of these cities in the great lakes region and the northeast are looking at their warmest winter on record. It's just been kind of spring-like, really lacking a lot of the cold, lacking a lot of the snow. We know that winter is warming across the Lower 48 since 1970. You can see those same places, the Upper Midwest, great lakes, going into New England are some of the places with the biggest fever, 4 to 5-degree fever since 1970. That makes winter the fastest- warming season for a lot of these places. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
