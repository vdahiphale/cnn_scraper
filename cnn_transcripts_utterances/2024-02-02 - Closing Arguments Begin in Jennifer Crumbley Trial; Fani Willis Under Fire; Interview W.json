      "sentences": "Soon, we will see President Biden fulfill perhaps his most solemn of duties as commander in chief, receiving troops who made the ultimate sacrifice to the country as they return home.He and the first lady will attend the dignified transfer of the bodies of three soldiers killed Sunday by a drone attack in Jordan, Sergeant William Rivers, Sergeant Kennedy Sanders, and Sergeant Breonna Moffett. The plane transporting the fallen will land at Dover Air Force Base, where, in a process of ritual and precision, they will be taken to the mortuary to prepare them for burial. The soldiers are the first U.S. troops killed by Iranian-backed militias, who've launched scores of attacks against American forces protesting the war in Gaza. We should note that, today, one militia group said that strikes against the United States would continue, though Iran's president also stressed today that his country -- quote -- \"will not start any war.\" Let's turn now to CNN's M.J. Lee, who's tracking this from the White House. And, M.J., the president, is meeting now as we speak with these families. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. And, Boris, this is one of the hardest and most gut-wrenching things that the president can do in his role as commander in chief, and that is to bear witness to and honor these three American soldiers returning home after they were killed in the line of duty and consoling and comforting their families. This is Sergeant William Rivers, as you said, Sergeant Kennedy Sanders, Sergeant Breonna Moffett. They were killed in that drone attack in Jordan last weekend, and they were the first Americans that were killed, first U.S. troops that were killed since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. And earlier this week, we actually got to see how the president speaks in private with some of these Gold Star families. There was a moment where he was speaking with the family members of Sergeant Kennedy Sanders, and this was when they actually learned for the first time that she had been posthumously promoted to sergeant. And we saw how the president, as he so often does, referencing his own grief around the death of his son Beau to try to comfort and grieve with these parents. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I join the country in mourning the loss of these service members, and the president is doing exactly the right thing by reaching out to their families and participating in the dignified transfer ceremony. But this is just another example that this is not abstract. When you're a commander, either a military commander or the commander in chief, as the case might be with President Biden, you have to look at the very real impacts of what's going on here. It's not OK to be one of these armchair generals in D.C. and talk tough on Twitter, on social media, because there are very real consequences to this.

So, we can never let our guard down and be complacent, because we have seen over 100 attacks actually against shipping, against our service members, against our outposts, our forward operating bases since the October 7 attack.

The defense rested late this morning after calling the defendant as its only witness. Crumbley's attorney appeared to whisper in her client'S ear moments after deciding not to call any other potential witnesses. The state's cross-examination of Crumbley was also relatively brief, focusing on her son's mental health and how he got the weapon that he used in the Oxford High School shooting. Let's check in with CNN's Jean Casarez, who's been following all of the details in this case.

Do we know who they are? We know her parents were on the witness list. We do know that. Don't know any more. But the cross-examination today was short. It was very short. I think most people believe that it would be extensive. It was aggressive. But people thought it was going to go into nooks and crannies and just really focus on things. They will -- in their closing argument that's beginning now, they will focus and tie it all together. They will take that cross-examination and make the most of it to this jury, because they have the burden. One thing. We know there's two theories they're proceeding on for involuntary manslaughter, gross negligence, as we have been talking about, but failure to perform a legal duty. The parents had a legal duty to their child, to the community, and there was failure because of gross negligence to perform that duty, two theories going to the jury for that one count, no lesser includeds at all, just involuntary manslaughter.

A defendant can sit there and not even cross- examine witnesses at all. It is the state, the government that has to really bring forward the issue. And I think what the defense really wanted to do from the outset -- we saw it in the closing argument -- very -- excuse me -- the opening statement. It's very unusual to make the commitment that my client will testify. They did that and they delivered with respect to having her testify, giving context with regard to the blame issue, the husband being the person who purchased the gun, giving context to the issue of the meeting they had with the school, saying it was not abrupt, it was a matter of fact, and there was no basis or reason to believe that their son represented any danger, giving context to the notion that they had any information, that is, Jennifer and her husband, that he had these medical or mental health maladies, giving context to the notion that the school had this information about their son that they didn't give to her, right? So how was she to know that her son would behave in this way? No behavioral issues to speak of in the school at all, nothing that they could point to that he did wrong in a violent nature to anyone else. So how was she to know? And so with regard to having her testify, I don't quibble with that. I thought she helped herself significantly in doing so. Now it will be up to a jury to assess her credibility and to ultimately determine whether she's guilty of this involuntary manslaughter.",

How does a jury go about determining which is more credible, which testimony is more credible to them?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so, Boris, usually, with credibility assessments, it's based upon corroboration.And I think the way that this needs to be addressed -- what's this? This meaning the context of that meeting. Your son apparently wrote on that piece of paper in terms of he needed help, putting a gun there, putting blood there. That's a big deal. So now the defense is saying it was really a nothing meeting, they were just bringing it to their attention. They would have gladly taken their child home. What's the corroboration? The corroboration is, the school had a duty also, right, to do something about it. The school could have checked the backpack if they thought that Ethan was such a danger. They didn't do it. The school could have looked within it. The school could have demanded that she take him home. The school could have removed him from class. The school could have done any number of things, which they do. The school could have said that, you know what, your child says that his life is a mistake. Did you know that, that he was having a rough time? Did you know that, that he was sleeping in class? Did you know that? So in terms of your question and assessing credibility, you assess it by the outside circumstances. And if it was such a big deal to the school, meaning Ethan Crumbley's behavior, why wasn't the mother put on notice of it? And if their son was such a danger, why didn't they insist he come home? So those are the arguments that will be made from a defense perspective. Whether the jury buys that argument is going to be up to those 12 people who are deliberating ultimately beyond the reasonable doubt unanimously as to guilt or innocence.",
