      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, what stood out to me about today's oral arguments is that Texas went on the defensive, telling the court that it reached the wrong conclusion last week when it blocked the law.Now, that was a two-to-one vote. And in the majority opinion, the chief justice practically said that this law was unconstitutional. But Texas argued that Texas is dealing with an unprecedented migrant crisis that the federal government is not doing enough. And so the state of Texas is taking matters into its own hands. And that's when Texas said, and maybe Texas has gone a little too far. But then Texas argued that, if there were aspects of this law that were invalid, that the court could actually strike those aspects of the law down. Now, one of the aspects that has been very controversial is the deportation clause. And I want to read you what the law actually says because it's important. It says, quote, \"On a person's conviction and order requiring the person to return to the foreign nation from which the person entered or attempted to enter.\" That sounds like a return, a deportation. Well, Texas argued that it went back and talked to the Texas attorney general and that what that actually means is that the state of Texas would take violators to a port of entry and then the federal government would decide what to do with that individual. The problem with that is that's not what the law says. And that's what many critics have said about this law. it's written in a very vague way, which causes a lot of problems when you then take it to court. Now, the chief judge, who wrote the majority opinion last week, now she was the swing vote, she was very clear about this law being unconstitutional. And based on the questions that she asked today, it doesn't appear to me that she has changed her mind. Now, let me remind you of what she said last week. This is in part from our majority opinion. She said, quote, \"Texas, some would say, seeks to fill at least partially the gaping void but it is unlikely that Texas can step into the shoes of the national sovereign under our Constitution and laws.\" Brianna, meaning that S.B.-4 is unconstitutional. Now, could she change her mind? Absolutely. We're going to have to wait and see what this court comes up with. And of course, that order could come down at any moment -- Brianna?",

Sunglasses, that's not going to cut it. Staring directly at the sun can result in disrupted vision. It can even cause blindness. Joining us now is Dr. Avnish Deobhakta, who is an ophthalmologist in New York Eye and Ear Infirmary at Mount Sinai. Talk to us a little bit about this because NASA obviously telling us what our parents have told us, don't look directly at the sun. Tell us about the risk. DR. AVNISH DEOBHAKTA, OPHTHALMOLOGIST: Well, the risk is very, very, very, very strong. The fact is that this -- these eclipse rays are very powerful. And so we had a patient who had looked at the eclipse in 2017 in New York City and the issue was that she had thought that she had been wearing the proper protection, but in fact, she wasn't. And what occurred was that she got an eclipse-like burn in the retina. So you could actually see a crescent level of damage in that part of the eye that actually takes in the light. So it's very important that people use the standard glasses. And by that, I mean the ISO standard glasses that everyone is sort of looking into right now. I hope those glasses that you're wearing are the ISO standard glasses. But those are the ones that you want to look -- to use if you're looking at the sun.",

And the ones that are actually protective are the ones that you need to make sure that they actually dim the light very, very cleanly. So you can't -- you can't just grab sunglasses from a store.

Because we're going to have tools that we can use to evaluate you.But of course, the type of damage that we're worried about is the damage where you have persistent kind of the visual field defect, is what we call it. And what that just means is that if, after you look at the eclipse, then you start, let's say, reading, say, four or five hours later, and you start to have problems seeing certain words because there's a defect in your vision, that's the kind of thing that you really want to be concerned about and you want to come in and see us. But it doesn't tend to happen only after a few seconds. You really have to be looking at the sun for 10 or 20 seconds, that kind of time range. But it's not just a few seconds.

Witnesses who have been in the club before describe it as a maze with only one way in and one way out. The fire started in the middle of the day as crews were carrying out renovations.
