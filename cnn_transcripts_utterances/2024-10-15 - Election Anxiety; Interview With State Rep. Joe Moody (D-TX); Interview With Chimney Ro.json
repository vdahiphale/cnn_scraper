I want to go back to this claim. I was talking about this false claim the government planning to seize your devastated community and then bulldoze bodies under the rubble. People are actually believing this. How does something like this take root? PETER O'LEARY, MAYOR OF CHIMNEY ROCK, NORTH CAROLINA:  I have no idea. I mean, it's baffling to me. When I first heard some of these claims being bandied about it's just -- it's just unbelievable that people would say stuff like that, and that -- that would spread it. And what I found -- and I haven't investigated these too much because I can't waste time on them. But, often, they're coming from people that are in Texas or some other part of the country. And I don't mean to pick on Texas, but they have no idea because they're not here. They're not actually seeing what's happening. They just see some wild claim on the Internet, I guess, and then they just start spreading it.",

And I will tell you why, because everybody here is working as hard as they can to clean up and recover and rebuild. I think what it affects is the people outside of us. And it affects people like me that are trying to get stuff done, and now I have to spend time debunking ridiculous claims. And that's really where it hurts is, it just diverts resources and people's attention away from what's real to something that's just absurd.",

Bring us into those conversations with them and what they're going through and, like, the fear that they may be feeling with these threats and whether residents there are more distrusting now because of this misinformation.O'LEARY:  I don't think -- people here aren't mistrusting, because the threats, again, are -- they're so overblown. It's all out there in the Internet. The one person you talked about earlier that was arrested for making a threat, that was a single person. And when I -- I heard some reports of armed militias roaming about, I have seen absolutely no sign of that. I have talked to our sheriff for Rutherford County. They have seen no sign of it. This was a single threat that was found pretty quickly and this guy was arrested. But, having said that, when you have the threat out there, no matter if it's on the Internet or actual, you have to respond to that threat. But we don't see the -- all this talk about militias and people hunting FEMA, I mean, it's just crazy stuff I have seen online.

That's -- if -- I don't know how many people -- obviously, these people haven't taken any real journalism classes, but my son is a journalist.

That's not the science anymore. The jury never heard about that. Theynever heard about the questions that could be raised. If this trial were held today, a number of issues would be raised about the science that was under -- that would be the underpinning of this prosecution. So the jury never heard that. And the courts in Texas, unfortunately, haven't really engaged with this new scientific evidence meaningfully. And what it could mean, what I think it should mean to people is, we have to put a pause on this execution. We cannot move forward, we can't barrel forward when we know that there hasn't been a real deep dive and look at this scientific evidence. No one should want that from a system of government, which is why I think you have seen members from the far left end of the spectrum and the far right end of the spectrum join in on this call for clemency for Robert.",

And Mr. Wharton is correct.When they saw a flat affect or someone that didn't seem to be emotionally disturbed by what had happened to their daughter, that all just moved them to the path of guilt, this is a culpable actor, this is someone that did something wrong. And then when you couple that with science at the time saying that, if these three factors exist, then this child was killed intentionally and then was shaken intentionally, all those things just collapse into a trial that ends in a guilty verdict and it ends with Robert on death row. But if you look at these things with through the lens of new science and through the lens of people that understand why he might have had a flat affect, why he might not have had an emotionally connected response to his daughter's death, all of those things matter. We met with Robert on death row. Robert does present in somewhat a childlike way, but he has -- he's very engaging and is thoughtful about where he's at, the situation he's in. And so we're trying to do everything we can do to raise awareness about this case and what I feel is imperative, that we hit pause on this execution.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:55:11] BROWN:  Well, if this year's election has brought up feelings of anxiety for you, you are not alone. A new poll from the American Psychiatric Association finds that 73 percent of people surveyed cite the election as a source of anxiety. Jonathan Hershfield joins us now.

So it kind of makes sense. Everybody I know is anxious about the election, and it is sort of the ultimate uncertainty question, right? So we know that anxiety is a stress response to an unknown fear. You could be afraid of something and say, OK, that's the thing I'm afraid of. What about having a stress response to an unknown fear? How is the election going to turn out? Will I be able to cope with consequences of turning out one way or the other? And people are getting much more feedback than in times past, right? People are on social media, constantly checking their news feed.

So people aren't having meaningful conversations with each other about politics, about the future of America. They're actually cutting people out of their lives, cutting them off of their Facebook, because it's too stressful to deal with the gray area about some of the nuances of some of these issues that we're considering. I would also like to add that this week is OCD Awareness Week. And for people with OCD, many people with OCD struggle with what we sometimes call moral scrupulosity or obsessing about needing to know for sure that they're always doing the right thing. Many people with OCD also have fears about being responsible for causing harm through negligence. So you have this intense responsibility to know everything about all of the issues, know that you're voting the exact right way, know that your candidate's going to win and that everything's going to go your way, or else it might be your fault. And so dealing with that uncertainty can be very overwhelming for someone susceptible to a condition like OCD.",

It's setting some limitations around how often or for how long you're going to look at your social media news feed, or to be more intentional, like, I'm going to set aside this time and actually go to this Web site and read this thing, and then I'm going to turn it off and go spend time with my family or go spend time in nature. And then, of course, if you're getting overwhelmed, you could practice meditation, paced breathing, down-regulation skills, grounding skills, anything that kind of makes you feel in touch with the present moment because a lot of this anxiety has to do with the future, right? The election's coming up in a few weeks and we can't predict the future.
