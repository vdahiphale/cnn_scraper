But also home right now to more than a million Palestinians who fled there seeking relative safety.The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet have indicated an all-out assault on Rafah is now simply a matter of time.

Protesters greeted Prime Minister Netanyahu, as he arrived for Israel's official Memorial Day ceremony. Dozens have walked out during his speech, some holding protest signs which read their blood is on your hands. Netanyahu, though, remained defiant, telling the crowd the war with Hamas is a matter of survival.

If Israel's military efforts are not accompanied by a political plan for the future of Gaza and the Palestinian people, the terrorists will keep coming back and Israel will remain under threat. We are seeing this happen in Gaza City. So we are talking to Israel about how to connect their military operations to a clear strategic end game, about a holistic, integrated strategy to ensure the lasting defeat of Hamas and a better alternative future for Gaza and for the Palestinian people.

But, and this is very important, even in order to, let's say, hand over the Gaza to the PA, or doing kind of another plan, multinational coalition as the U.S. and the more moderate section of the government would like to do, one has destroyed the organized military force of Hamas. So what the government did decide upon is a milestone, is a kind of an interim war goal of dismantling Hamas, cutting its supply lines from Rafah, and this will be necessary for evil post. Evil, you know, handing over Gaza to the PA as part of the two-state solution or, as the right-wing want, to settle Gaza. In any case, what Israel is doing now will be necessary.

Meantime, Human Rights Watch says there is a pattern of IDF attacks on aid workers, which is raising questions about Israel's commitment to international law.The group says Israel has carried out at least eight strikes on aid workers throughout this conflict. And that includes an attack back in April, which killed seven workers of the World Central Kitchen.

Day 16 of Donald Trump's hush money payment to a porn star trial and the prosecution's key witness who once said he'd take a bullet for Trump has finally taken the stand.

Cohen detailed how he set up the $130,000 payment to former adult film star Stormy Daniels, and through his testimony, jurors for the first time heard evidence directly connecting the former U.S. president to the payoff and reimbursements.
