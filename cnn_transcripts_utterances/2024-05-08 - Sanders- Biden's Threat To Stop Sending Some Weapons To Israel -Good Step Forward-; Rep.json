If Israel invades Rafah, the U.S. will stop sending bombs. A demand my source tonight has been making. Senator Bernie Sanders will join me live. And inside the most explosive and explicit testimony yet, in the Trump hush money trial. Trust me. I was there. How his attorneys are now prepping for when Stormy Daniels will retake the witness stand, tomorrow. We've got an insider, who is deeply-sourced in Trump-world. And Marjorie Taylor Greene's temper tantrum, as it is being called, by her irate fellow Republicans, on Capitol Hill, saying that her dramatic move, late today, to oust House Speaker, Mike Johnson, is the wrong one. Instead, now they're uniting against her. One of her most vocal Republican critics is here live. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Despite the constant complaints that we have heard, about how his ongoing criminal trial is keeping him off the campaign trail, Donald Trump spent his day today, off from court, at his Mar-a-Lago club in South Florida, not on the campaign trail. But then again, after what we all heard in that courtroom yesterday, maybe it's not just the former President who needed a breather. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail today, in that key battleground state of Wisconsin, President Biden is trying to beat back the issues that are vexing his campaign, before November. In an exclusive interview, here on CNN, Erin Burnett asked President Biden, if he's worried that he's running out of time, to improve his standing with voters, when it comes to the economy. Biden says that corporate greed is to blame, for some of the pain that Americans are feeling. But on the whole, he argues he's already made huge progress. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, what I would say to young people and all Americans, if you believe in the foundations of American democracy, you cannot vote for Trump, who is undermining democracy. If you believe that women have a right to control their own bodies, you can't vote for Trump. He appointed the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. If you believe that climate change is real, and we got to save this planet for our kids and future generations, you can't vote for Donald Trump. He believes climate change is a hoax. If you think that -- you're concerned that we have massive income and wealth inequality, you can't support Trump, because he wants to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to the 1 percent.

Certain leaders have a psychological ability, to get under the skin of their people. But the difference here, and I think it's a very notable difference, is that Trump has a kind of a narcissism, that is so obviously destructive to everything around it. How many people? I mean, it's not just Michael Cohen. How many people from his world have left in disgust, in anger, feeling betrayed? How many people did he stiff, when he was in business and never paid? This is a pattern that I think makes him unique. And I think, this time, the trick's not working the same way. Him being in the courtroom every day?

Now, prosecutors made the argument that they needed to get into some of this detail, to show what she would have said, had she told her story in 2016. And therefore, what Trump was worried about coming out. That's their argument. The judge had put pretty constrained parameters, on what that was supposed to be. And as you said, her testimony blew past that over and over and over. Todd Blanche, Trump's lead defense lawyer objected several times, many of those objections were sustained. That's all stuff the jury got to see. And the judge was clearly not pleased, as we got to see out of the jury's presence. But it was -- it was a lot.

For more on what we could see tomorrow, I'm joined tonight by David Kelley, a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

DAVID KELLEY, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: I think they spend some more time with her. Susan Necheles, I mean, there's a reason why Susan is doing it, and not Todd. And they're looking to not offend people. But they're trying to make her look really bad. I think the challenge is, is that her appeal is the fact that she's not appealing, as a -- from a prosecutor's perspective. I mean, that's what you're trying to paint here. You're not trying to make this look like some lovely person. She's not. And they don't hide from that. So, I'm not quite sure what more the defense can accomplish here.

And this just adds to it, Kaitlan. But the thing I'll point out is, he's actually doing pretty gosh darn good in the polls, right? I mean, look what he's polling nationally? He's polling in on average 13 percent of the vote. That's the best for a third-party candidate at this point in the cycle, since Ross Perot in 1996. And more than that, remember, the threshold to make the debates is 15 percent. He's right there. All he needs to do is slightly better, and he could be on the stage.",

And he could be at that 15 percent. And he could be on the debate stage. COLLINS: And I should note that his campaign said, this issue with the dead worm in his brain was resolved more than 10 years ago, and he is in robust physical and mental health.
