For a third day in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial, his former fixer and longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is on the stand. In nearly six hours of cross-examination by the defense and counting, defense attorneys trying to paint Cohen, not just as a liar, but a bitter one, bent on getting revenge on his former boss for not getting him a job in the White House. In, Washington, House Republicans are having to reschedule items on the agenda because 11 of their members trek to New York to show public support for the former president. Of course, that's more members than is the number of the majority. CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider joins us now. Jessica, we knew this moment would come in that the defense would attack Michael Cohen's credibility. After all, he's been convicting -- convicted for lying that there was a particular moment the last several hours, which seemed consequential. And that is the defense zeroing in on Cohen's foggy memory of this October 2016 phone call, which he testified earlier in the week he said that's when he told Trump that the money was paid to Stormy in effect, it had been taken care of. The defense calling into question his recollection of that phone call.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think the defense, this has been their most effective part of their cross- examination. They also actually got into another pretty effective part of it talking about how Michael Cohen would often call reporters without Donald Trump's express knowledge or input. So that kind of cast some question on, was Michael Cohen always acting at Trump's direction? I thought that was really interesting point from the defense. But a bigger point from the defense was really casting question on Michael Cohen's memory of a particular phone call where he had previously testified it was solely about the Stormy Daniels payment and again, it went to this idea that he kept Donald Trump updated at as to every step in this hush money scheme. And now that the defense has cast this cloud over this testimony, it does leave you wondering, will that really erode Michael Cohen's credibility when it comes to the jury, will the jury take this one instance and maybe not take all of his other testimony as seriously? It's a big question.",

So, it all did not rest on one mans testimony that they had David Pecker recount conversations in the plan, Stormy Daniels, the accounts et cetera does that groundwork outweigh this instance or is this instance, this phone call, in particular, of according to Jessica Schneider was saying of several times, he spoke to Trump about this does, that take that all down in effect?",

It's a little inside baseball, right, for us lawyers, but it's very critical, that jury will be in as to the issues of disregarding the totality if they choose of Michael Cohen's testimony are only limited portions of it and that is a big portion.What portion? You're on direct examination, that's when you get softball questions thrown to you by the prosecutor. You're going over chapter and verse, the timeline of when you spoke to the president, the nature of the conversation. Was it about Stormy Daniels? What specifically was said, did you get confirmation on the deal, et cetera? And you say chapter and verse about it. You don't mention anything about a 14-year-old, anything about harass you, anything about that being the reason you contacted his head of security and defense brings it up. That's troubling. If that's an issue and if it's an issue that prosecutors were aware of what prosecutors would do was they would say, hey, on this call, was that the sole basis of the phone call? Were there other issues on that day? And that you would say at that time, there were other issues. Well, what were they? There was this 40-year-old harassing me, but that was only a limited portion. After that, I spoke to the president. There was nothing said about it. So, now, the fence brings it out. Now you have to do serious damage control because Michael Cohen didn't say a word. That affects his credibility greatly. I'm concerned and he needs to be rehabilitated or else it could be a significant problem with the ultimate prosecution case.",

He may not say a word. Schiller, will we have from him, right, the security person? We may not. So who do we have to rely on? Cohen. What does it go to? A core issue in the case.

However, one of the things that they warned us about now today and I spent pretty much through the entire day in front of that hospital getting some of those updates. They said he is still in pretty critical condition and he is still feeling very weak.In fact, there was one political ally who visited him today. He said even had trouble speaking because he was still so week, which obviously is really no surprise considering those side gunshot wounds that you were talking about, which the doctors there acknowledged have caused substantial damage. Nevertheless, he is now out of life's danger, but of course at the same time, there is a lot of wrangling here now, politically, and a lot of people who are saying that all of this was politically motivated. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): After getting shot five times in broad daylight, Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico's condition remains difficult, officials say, even though the wounds are no longer life- threatening. This is exactly the place where Robert Fico was shot and you can see on that tree over there that there is a hole with a forensic teams appear to have carved something like a projectile out of the bark. Now, he suffered several gunshot wounds and had to be air medevaced into a hospital nearby. The hospital says two surgical teams had to operate more than five hours to save the prime minister's life. Slovakia's president-elect confirming Fico is now conscious. PETER PELLEGRINI, SLOVAK PRESIDENT-ELECT: He is able to speak, but only few sentences and then he's really, really tired because he's under some medications (ph) -- some medical commendations (ph).

(END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And, Jim, that is one thing that people that you speak to have all walks of life have been doing so over the past 48 hours that we've been on the ground here. They will acknowledge there are deep divisions here in the society. And there certainly are politicians who see that something like this, an assassination attempt like that could seriously destabilized society like that.

This would be helpful. The -- on the other hand, Jim, you've got to look at what deterrence means. You give the enemy a complete menu and roadmap of how to attack and guarantee 'em and you won't respond, you lose deterrence.

In general, it seems China has avoided that at least openly, although the U.S. believes China is providing other material support, perhaps dual use technologies or technologies, while there certainly buying Russian oil, which, of course, funds the Russian war machine.

We had the inflation numbers that suggested that inflation isn't going to be that bad, or at least the Fed may be people to at least resume some form -- excuse me, some form of cutting.And as a result, you know, we have this phrase psychologically important. And what I've discovered over the years and it's been technically proven is that markets find very difficult to get through the psychological barriers. They just, Jim, they just can't push through. So it gets towards 40,000 and it dallies and dillies and dallies and dillies. And then it sort of pulls back and then you just need one sort of impetus. And what we saw today was that Walmart number, up 7 percent Walmart today, because of the prospect of better retail sales for Walmart, massive retailer, largest employer, and that's why it just needed an oomph-o-rama.
