The judge in this case -- this is a civil case -- a lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani. The judge here has already found that Giuliani defamed them. That he lied quite publicly about what had happened after the 2020 election. He said that they had been switching votes as they counted ballots, accusing them of doing things nefarious that was just not true. And so, what's happening now is that he's going to trial before a jury in Washington, D.C. in federal court, and that jury is going to determine how much he should owe these two women for what he said publicly. Now, just in the trial itself -- not even the stakes of what the jury could find -- there's a lot at stake. Giuliani must be there, himself, in person. We are expecting to see him today over at the federal court. And also, we do know that his defense attorney is pledging that he will take the stand to testify. So we're very much watching for that. And much of this could be replicated in some way in other trials upcoming when we hear from very similar witnesses.",

And we have no intention whatsoever to hurt civilians. Our target is the Hamas terrorist organization that brutally killed our people and we want to hit them. And the civilians of Gaza are not our target -- that's clear. Have we, unfortunately, had too many civilian casualties in this conflict? We have and we regret every single one because our goal is to do that as a -- to minimize as much as is possible civilian casualties. They are not our -- not our target. If I can add, we are making a maximum effort. We are continuing to make a maximum effort but there hasn't been a conflict in human history where you haven't seen civilians caught up in the crossfire. And while, as a democracy, we're doing everything we can to reduce those casualties, Hamas is doing the opposite.

Because that resolution -- that text -- basically, what it did is it gives Hamas a new lease of life. They threw Hamas -- they wanted to throw Hamas a lifeline.
