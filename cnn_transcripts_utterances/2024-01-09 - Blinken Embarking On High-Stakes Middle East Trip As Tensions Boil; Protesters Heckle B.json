And they're certainly keen on avoiding war, at least a major war in the Middle East, because that can only serve to drag them down.However, on the Israeli side, one of the things that we've noticed in the last few days and really few weeks, is the increased volume of attacks between the Israelis and Hezbollah up in northern Israel, it's more than frontier the northern border with Lebanon. And that indicates that Israel is, I think, poised to strike at Hezbollah in a more concerted and more meaningful way than we've seen up until this point, the volume of attacks has increased on both sides. And that, of course, tells me that it's going to be the possibility at least is very high that there is going to be a two front war for the Israelis. Can they fight that war? I -- they can.

The problem that you run into, of course, is one of resources and whether or not the Israelis can actually make it, but from a pure military perspective, that actually is a valid military goal.

Now those operations are less effective than they were in the north. And so in that sense, the IDF spokesman is absolutely correct. They have a better chance of, in essence, mopping things up in the Central Park and in the south, and the -- with the resources that they currently have than they did in the north with the similar set of troops.

Nada Bashir has his story and a warning there are some disturbing images in a report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): A final painful goodbye. Not the first for revered Palestinian reporter Wael Dahdouh. His eldest son Hamza, a fellow Al Jazeera journalist, killed in an Israeli airstrike in the southern region of Khan Younis on Sunday. Laid to rest just a few short months after his mother, brother, sister and nephew were killed in a strike on Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp. This family's utter despair seems impossible to put into words, and yet day after day through so much loss. It is the words of Wael Dahdouh that have given crucial testimony to the reality faced by all in Gaza. WAEL AL-DAHDOUH, AL JAZEERA GAZA BUREAU CHIEF (through translator): The world should see through its own two eyes what is happening to the Palestinian people, not through Israel's eyes. What did Hamza did to the Israelis? What did my family do to them? What did the civilians do to them? They did nothing but the world has closed its eyes what is happening in the Gaza Strip. BASHIR (voice-over): On Monday, the Israeli military confirmed that it had carried out the airstrike which killed Hamza and fellow Al Jazeera journalist Mustafa Thuria, saying they had quote, struck a terrorist that declining to provide further details. Israel says categorically that it does not target journalists maintaining that the IDF is targeting Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack. But it is hard to reconcile Israel's expressed intentions with the overwhelming number of civilians killed in Israeli airstrikes. In Jabalya bodies lay tangled in the rubble of this residential building. At least 70 were killed here survivor safe, struck overnight as many were sleeping. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): My mother, my father, my brothers and sisters, all of them my whole family has been wiped off the civil register. There was nothing here. No fighters. BASHIR (voice-over): Such grief is felt across Gaza in the central region of Deir al Balah, there is little hope left as men dig with their bare hands in a desperate search for survivors. At the nearby Al-Aqsa hospital, the only emergency care center left functioning in the area. Medical teams are dangerously overwhelmed. Now, fresh warnings for the Israeli military have forced doctors from several international NGOs to evacuate their patients left with nowhere else to turn. [01:15:00] GEMMA CONNELL, OCHA GAZA TEAM LEADER: What I'm seeing today inside of the hospital is an absolute shame on humanity. I've seen children lying in their own blood I've seen a child who was hit by shrapnel and doesn't know when his family is. I've seen a woman who was hit in the face by air strike for his waited six days, six a whole days to access health care because the fighting around her was so virtuous. So what I've seen inside this hospital and asked to end the ward has to end. BASHIR (voice-over): As calls for a ceasefire continue to go on heated, the humanitarian situation in Gaza grows more desperate. It is a reality painstakingly documented by gardeners journalists. Wael Dahdouh back on just hours after his son Hamza was buried a symbol of resilience for many. DAHDOUH (through translator): We will not hesitate for a single moment. We will not stop for a single moment, as long as we live as long as we are able to fulfill our duty. BASHIR (voice-over): But also one of determination for the world to see and acknowledge exactly what is happening inside Gaza. Nada Bashir, CNN in Beirut. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Alongside migrants from Latin America, at each camp we meet dozens from China.The numbers reflect the surge. From 2013 to 2022, CBP recorded fewer than 16,000 Chinese migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border. This past year alone -- more than 31,000. That is roughly double the prior ten years combined. But unlike those fleeing countries in turmoil like Venezuela, Cuba or Haiti, these migrants are leaving the world's second largest economy. What was the reason you left China? Their answers very. Most cite deepening financial hardships despite the Chinese governments narrative of a steadily rebounding economy. How did you get here? How did you get to southern California? Their trek north primarily starts in one Latin American country where Chinese do not need visas to enter. To Ecuador? How many of you here came through Ecuador? To really understand their journey, and how it differs from other migrants you need to see it in action. We touched down in Ecuador's capital, Quito, and standing outside of international arrivals, we noticed this man. A hired driver, scrolling through photos and messages in Chinese. A few minutes later, passengers began stepping out. They tell us they are from China and planning to go to the U.S. But most ask we do not show their faces. The driver approaches this group, making sure that he got the right passengers. He has got a booking for them. We uncovered an assortment of travel packages offered specifically to Chinese migrants. You can pay smugglers who promise to ease some of the planning stress. From $9,000 to $12,000 flights, hotels, transportation booked for you. For $20,000 or more thousand it's a premium service. Getting you to the Mexico side of the U.S. Border, skipping some of the most treacherous crossings. We drive through Ecuador's capital city with Long Fanwei (ph), he shows us private homes and AirBNBs where Chinese migrant stay when they arrive. Long has lived here in Quito five years, he runs a travel agency. He has witnessed the recent surge in Chinese migrants. And with it, a spike in businesses catering to them like this Chinese run hotel. The owner estimates there are as many as 100 hotels in Quito that like hers host Chinese migrants headed to the U.S. Take a look at this, they've got essentially a how to guide to go from here, and to continue north. And they tell you here, how many days you should be preparing, vaccinations you might need, other documents that you should carry with you. They even mention bringing $300 and hiding that amount of money because of presumably being robbed at some point and needing cash as a backup. It's advice Zheng Shiqing could've used a few days earlier. Your parents still think you are in China? They have no idea that you left?",

We noticed that a lot of folks, migrants from like the one from Latin American countries like these over here do not have any money to do that, so they walk.In the cold rain, we meet Angel and Isabel from Venezuela. They say it's really expensive to try to cross so they have to walk. Vulcan (ph) residents tell me they see hundreds if not thousands of Chinese migrants passing through each week. And because they are often carrying more cash, they are now prime targets for corrupt police and cartels. But like Zheng, they remain determined. As we returned home, he updates us on his trek. Over two weeks Zheng travels through five Central American countries. At times messaging Chinese speaking smugglers who remotely coordinate with local cartels to get him and others on vans, buses, boats and on flights. It cuts his travel time down to about half that of most Latino migrants but it is costly. By the time he reaches northern Mexico, he has spent more than $10,000 with one more border to go. A camera we set up, facing the U.S. southern border captures weeks of crossings, thousands entering the U.S., through this gap in the wall.

India's top court (INAUDIBLE) quashed the early release of 11 convicts who have been jailed for life for gang-raping pregnant Muslim woman, Bilkis Bano and murdering her relatives in the communal riots in the western state of Gujarat, in the year of 2002.The supreme court has also directed the men to surrender to prison authorities within two weeks. Convicted in 2008, the convicts walked out of prison in August 2022 by order of the Gujarat government which is led by prime minister Narendra Modi's ruling party government. The decision to release them prematurely and the celebrations as they left prison had caused massive national outrage. In his ruling on Monday, the top court said the Gujarat government was lacking in competency to pass a remission order as the trial and sentencing happened in another state. The court said the state government who served and abused power not vested in it when it ordered the release of the 11 convicts. A verdict was announcing after a hearing a batch of thieves challenging the government's decision. The court order was celebrated by supporters of Bano who had decried the men's release as an attack not only on Muslims, by women's rights in the country, where government data shows a woman is raped every 17 minutes.

In this era of private space, we don't always get this kind information in a timely manner. But when you see that kind of crumpled insulation, you know there is trouble. It appears there must have been some difficulty with the propulsion system, perhaps just leaking out propulsion somehow, and losing the precious prop that they need to fly this mission which also made it difficult, of course, for solar rays to be pointed directly at the sun.
