Trump demanding late that there should be additions to this proposal, namely the very complicated issue of raising the national debt limit, something that doesn't have to be dealt with next year, but one that he wants done now so he doesn't have to worry about it when he's president. However, because he does not have the votes in the House that failed yesterday, his efforts to try to do just that, raise the national debt limit. Now Republican leaders have agreed to push that aside into next year. Now they're trying to move on a separate course, extend government funding past midnight tonight till mid-March.Included as part of that, disaster relief, providing money for communities hit hard by natural disasters and aid to farmers, billions in aid to farmers, all wrapped up in one proposal that will come to the House floor this hour. The question, Jake, is can they get 290 votes if all members are voting present? That is 2/3 of the House. That is a threshold. They need to meet tonight to get there. One thing to watch, there are a lot of Republicans and Democrats who frankly are gone. Their absences could be an issue here. But nevertheless, there's a belief that finally, after this late drama over the last couple of days, that they can get past this drama past this side of the House tonight and then over to the Senate to give it final approval averting a government shutdown with just hours to go, Jake.",

That was a hard red line for a lot of Democrats who believe that they could really have leverage next year on this issue and who believe that including the debt limit would make it easier for Republicans to pass their massive tax package next year.Again, one of the questions is what does Hakeem Jeffries say to his members in a couple of minutes? Obviously, the fact that this bill is slightly different than what was unveiled on Tuesday night, that hard negotiated package that Republicans and Democrats had come together to unveil, that package is no longer alive. They're going to have to vote on something different. But the sense that you're getting from Democrats heading into this meeting is they are open minded.

And government spending, I would argue, is a key culprit to inflation. You cannot just continue passing CRs after CRs after CRs while the nation's fiscal health is in complete disarray. We're 30 plus trillion dollars in debt and there appears to be no one who's interested in figuring out a way to pay this stuff off. And so at some point, even if you do have to pay for what you've already expensed, at some point, I think the obligation for both Republicans and Democrats, just like every single regular American across this country, is to pass a balanced budget, pay down the debt.There's not a single person in this country who could say, well, you know what, I'm just going to pull out all the money in the world and just keep buying things with no recourse. But that's essentially what our Congress is doing. And at some point we got to say enough is enough. And so for the Republicans who are standing tall and saying we have to not continue this type of behavior, it's not beneficial for generations to come. I salute them for doing so.

They said, kick it into the New Year. Well, they got their wish. Then there was a bipartisan deal. Then they blew it up. They changed their minds. Then they said, well, let's do the debt ceiling now, or at least Donald Trump did.

CNN's Fred Pleitgen is on his way to the scene from Berlin.And Fred, what are you hearing from your sources and from local media? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Jake. Well, one of the things that we've learned about this driver is that he's apparently 50 years old. As you said, he's from Saudi Arabia, a doctor. We're also hearing that apparently the car that was used, that black BMW, was rented. So this apparently was a car that was rented. What we know from the scene, Jake, is that right now everything has been widely cordoned off. There's a lot of ambulances that are standing there. What the sources of the scene are telling us, the police really making an extra wide cordon because they're not only putting ambulances in that area, they are also actually setting up tents because there's so many people who have been injured, who need treatment, who are being tended to right there at the scene. Obviously, we know that the death toll has now risen to two, that one of the killed is a toddler, the other one is an adult. But the local governor of the state where Magdeburg is situated, and he says that he believes that the death toll could rise, as he put it, significantly because there are so many people with some very severe injuries. Of course, we have seen that surveillance camera video of that car plowing through that Christmas market with a very dense crowd and obviously nowhere for those people to hide or to try and go anywhere. And that's one of the reasons why there are so many casualties. This, of course, being treated as a mass casualty event by the Magdeburg authorities. One of the things that we have to know is that Magdeburg is a very big city. It's also got a large urban area around it. So right now all the hospitals are scrambling, any sort of personnel, any sort of ambulances, helicopters that they have to the scene there. And that's why we know that the cordon has been going as well. As far as German politics is concerned, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said that he is going to visit Magdeburg tomorrow. The interior minister is going to visit there today -- tomorrow as well as obviously for Germany, this is a huge and tragic event. And the Germans, of course had been on alert for possible attacks against Christmas markets. And Christmas market security had been a big issue here in this country today.",

Not all of us talk -- not all of us members talk to him all the time.You were presenting information to him.

But what it means by a motion to suspend the rules is a process by which they can quickly move this bill to the floor. But that requires two-thirds majority of the House is a narrowly divided House. Of course, there are 219 Republican seats.Typically, when all members are present and voting, that's 290 need to vote in the affirmative to pass this bill. And right now they appear to be on the way to that. There's still a lot of members who have not voted yet. People are going to make their way to the floor over the next 15 minutes or so. But right now, from just judging about the trajectory of this vote, it is going in a positive direction to get this bill across the finish line. There are 90 -- 76 Republicans who voted yes. Thirteen Republicans have voted no. Eighteen Democrats have voted yes. There are still many Democrats who haven't voted because they've been huddling behind closed doors with Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, who has indicated that they -- he believes they won a key concession from Republicans as part of this about their decision by the Republicans to drop language that would have suspended the national debt limit for two years. That had been a late demand, of course, by Donald Trump. He injected this late in the process, essentially scuttling a separate bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown because he wanted that issue about the debt limit, a complicated issue, off the table when he came into office in January. But now that Democrats resisted that, they want to use that as leverage next year. Conservative Republicans don't want to vote to suspend the debt limit either, given the bipartisan opposition. They were forced -- the Speaker of the House was forced to essentially drop that demand from -- from Donald Trump, set it aside, deal with it next year. And now moving on a separate package that includes extending government funding from tonight midnight until mid-March, when they're going to have to deal with this all over again in the first hundred days of Donald Trump's new term. A part of this deal, too. It would extend an expiring farm bill, programs that need to be done by the end of this year, also direct aid to farmers to the tune of about $10 billion, another $100 billion for communities hard hit by a range of natural disasters like hurricanes in the Southeast. All that had been pushed very hard by a number of members. So this is a hugely significant measure. And right now, Jake, very much on track to pass the United States house. There are 131 votes in the affirmative. Now, it's going up very quickly, 133 according to Mike Hout here. And again, two-thirds majority they need they appear on track to get that tonight, then over to the Senate, Jake.",
