Here are some of the top stories we're following today.Former U.S. President Donald Trump is blaming technical issues for his voice sounding, quote, somewhat different and strange during his conversation with Elon Musk on Tuesday. At several points Trump's speech sounded as if he had a lisp or was slurring his words which attracted quite a bit of attention online. This November voters in Arizona and Missouri will weigh in on amendments that would establish a right to abortion in their state's constitution. There are now eight states with abortion ballot measures this fall. Tropical storm Ernesto is now close to category 1 hurricane strength as it lashes Puerto Rico and heavy rain and strong winds. Flash flood warnings are in effect there as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands where most people have also lost power and more than a hundred thousand customers are without electricity in Puerto Rico. Now Greece's worst wildfire of the year has eased as strong winds died down and firefighters worked to put out the last of the blaze. More than 400 square kilometers or 156 square miles of forests in the Attica region and up to the suburbs of Athens have burned in the fast- moving fire. At least one person was killed and thousands of residents were evacuated as the fire came very close to the Greek capital where more than three million people live. Emergency crews have been working to extinguish the fire which began on Sunday near the town of Varnavas. One resident describes the inferno. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): It was hell. The fire started from very high up and it came all the way down to the village. It was running at great speed. It was very windy. There was panic. There were sirens. A lot of people, police, people crying, screaming, shouting and it reached and burned all the way down to Athens. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACFARLANE: A local mayor told CNN at some point the fire was faster than the cars and trucks and he said that studies show that in the next 30 years similar fires could devastate everything under 300 meters leading towards the middle of Greece. Well across Europe there's no relief in sight for the heat wave, especially in the southeast. Volunteers have been distributing water and ice pops but some tourists in Milan, Italy say they were not prepared for the blistering heat. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've got civil protection people around handing out water like you said in these cities. And it's so important for tourists to take a heed to this because so many of them come from places where they're not used to the heat. You know one thing you won't see though, Christina, is that the Italians are not out during the heat of the day. People who live in Southern Europe do not go out during the heat of the day.

It's the second year in a row the fund has been depleted before the peak of hurricane season. A trend one official tells CNN is because of climate change. The agency shifted into so-called immediate needs funding last week while it waits for Congress to pass a $9 billion supplemental funding request. A FEMA spokesperson says the agency does have enough resources to respond to impending disasters like Ernesto but will need to pause long-term recovery from previous disasters. And realtors across the U.S. are bracing for a seismic shift in the way they do business. Beginning Saturday new rules will overhaul the way realtors get paid to help people buy and sell their homes. CNN's Karin Caifa reports.

For decades, a seller's agent typically charged the seller five or six percent of a home's purchase price intended to be shared with the buyer's agent. That puts sellers on the hook for an additional cost some experts say inflated home prices. Now sellers will no longer be expected to make commission offers to buyer agents.

Russia claims its air defenses shot down dozens of Ukrainian aircraft type drones and four tactical missiles over Kursk. That's the region where Russia has -- where Ukrainian forces have been advancing.It's been one week since their incursion shocked and humiliated Moscow and put Russian President Vladimir Putin on the defensive. Ukraine claims it's already taking control of more than 1,000 square kilometers, 40 of those in the past day alone. CNN's Clare Sebastian has been tracking developments. And I think for the first time since we heard of this bold move by Ukraine into Kursk, we're beginning to learn new details now about the motivation behind this and what they intend to do next.

So it's not quite the same, right? Ukraine is making it clear they don't want to annex anything, but they are, it seems, if you believe their reports, obviously impossible to verify at this point moving with some speed.But you're right. Initially, we got nothing from Ukraine on this shrouded in secrecy, then sort of cryptic details came out. And now much more direct comments, both from the foreign ministry we got yesterday, and from the president on why they're doing this. The foreign ministry is saying that the sooner Russia agrees to what they call a just peace, according to Ukraine's peace formula, that it's laid out, the sooner the raids on Russian territory will stop. So it seems there is some kind of endgame here. I think there's also a clear PR motive. This is coming in the context of waning Ukrainian morale when it comes to the war and President Zelenskyy very much trying to leverage this moment here. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): All of us in Ukraine need to act as unitedly and effectively as we did in the first weeks and months of this war, when Ukraine seized the initiative, and began turning the situation in favor of our state. We have done the same now, we have once again proven that in any situation, we Ukrainians are capable of achieving our objectives of defending our interests and our independence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's blaming the West. He's trying to sort of make it clear that it's isolated to these few regions, all of the sort of human interest stories are now creeping through on Russian media, they're not so much talking about the military movements, and he's trying to claim that he's back in control. And so that's what the Russian people are being told. And we see the chief propagandists who do these sort of influential nightly news shows pick this up and, you know, threaten revenge and make sort of thinly veiled threats towards the West. So that's what the Russian people are hearing. In terms of how they actually feel, you know, I think it varies. I've spoken to people who say that this was a huge surprise that they're not sure what to make of it at this point, that it is potentially a problem for Putin.
