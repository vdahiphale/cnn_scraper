Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight, keeping them honest, with a matter of fact, not opinion, about the Democratic and Republican candidates for president. Whatever else you might think of them, and whoever you plan on voting for in November, President Biden and former President Trump see the world as differently, one from another, as any two modern day candidates have. What's more, their differences are not trivial. They touched on decades of bipartisan consensus about the way American democracy and foreign policy works. And lately, the contrast between the two is increasingly on display from campaign rallies to courthouses to cable news, and today, a World War II monument to American Army Rangers who fought and died on D-Day 80 years ago.

Judges, for example, could not accept speaking fees. I traveled around the world and I would give speeches for free. And you are not supposed to accept honorarium. There was an effort to change that in 2000, and it was actually called the \"Keep Scalia on the Bench\" bill by some lawmakers. And it was defeated because people didn't want judges to get money from private sources that would then cast doubt on their impartiality. So essentially, what Thomas has done is effectively bypassed, done an end run around that so that he could get these lavish trips that really is so outstrips every other justice, so outstrips every other judge.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAT SAJAK, RETIRING AS \"WHEEL OF FORTUNE\" HOST: It's been an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes, night after night, year after year, decade after decade. And I've always felt that the privilege came with the responsibility to keep this daily half hour a safe place for family fun. No social issues, no politics, nothing embarrassing I hope, just a game. But gradually it became more than that. A place where kids learn their letters, where people from other countries hone their English skills, where families came together, along with friends and neighbors and entire generations. What an honor to have played even a small part in all that. Thank you for allowing me into your lives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
