(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  It is a very active manhunt that's underway in southeast Pennsylvania. Initially, on Friday, authorities had said that they were afraid that Danelo Cavalcante was making his way towards Mexico and then potentially, to his native Brazil. However, at about 1:30 in the morning on Saturday, he was spotted on surveillance video a mere mile and a half away from the Chester County Prison, which is where he was serving a lifelong sentence for murder. And precisely in that area, authorities are really focusing much of the search with hundreds of SWAT team members (local, state), federal law enforcement officers that are now urging people who live in the area, only about 30 miles west of Philadelphia, to keep their doors locked and certainly reach out to them if they spot the 34-year-old fugitive. The 34-year-old man was initially -- at least he was beginning his lifelong sentence after being convicted for the stabbing murder of his girlfriend. Investigators say that he stabbed her to death in front of her two children, which is why what we heard on Sunday from the Chester County district attorney not only urging residents to be extremely vigilant but continue to describe him as an extremely dangerous man.

Quote, \"At the invitation of the government of the Republican of India, Premier of the State Council Li Qiang will attend the 18th G20 summit to be held in New Delhi, India on September the 9th and the 10th.\" Now, at this year's G20, Xi would be missing out on some pretty critical conversations on climate, on Ukraine. And his expected no- show in New Delhi comes as China and India clash over a map and a border dispute. It also comes as China battles a number of economic challenges, including one involving its -- one of its biggest homebuilders teetering on the brink of default. Now, on Sunday, we heard from the U.S. President Joe Biden. He told reporters that he was disappointed that Xi was not attending the G20 summit but suggested that he would be meeting with him in the future but didn't elaborate. Now, U.S.-China tensions, of course, continue to flare over Taiwan, over trade, over territorial disputes. And to try to stabilize this relationship, a number of senior Biden officials have gone to China to visit in recent months, including the U.S. Commerce secretary last week. President Biden previously told CNN that he would be meeting with Xi Jinping in, quote, \"the fall.\" And David, they may still have an opportunity to speak on the sidelines of the APEC summit due to take place in San Francisco in November.

Not only will Xi not be there but also President Putin isn't going.And I think it's significant that we saw President Xi attend the BRICS summit in South Africa recently where he was lauded. He got a very big red carpet treatment arrival when he was there. And the signal from the BRICS summit was look, we -- these nations don't particularly like the order that's being set up, let's say, by the G7 and by the G20. We're going to strengthen the BRICS. We're going to invite big -- the big power broker in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and some other significant countries to join -- to join the BRICS group. So I think what we're seeing here is, in essence, something of a diluting of the influence and the -- you know, the ability of the G20 to work together as a force for good in the world. These big powerful economic nations are drivers for the way that the world goes and this weakens it in a way. I think it's hard to say more than that at his moment, though.",

In essence, its complaint right now is that it can't sell its grain and fertilizer around the world in the way that it wants to, but those are the measures that it brought upon itself through this war.The grain deal that the U.N. and Turkey helped broker previously -- the Black Sea grain deal -- were two parallel deals; one with Ukraine and one with Russia. And Russia unilaterally pulled out a month or so ago, which essentially stymied the whole Black Sea grain deal. And subsequent to that, there's been a concerted effort by Russia to target Ukrainian grain and port facilities -- so denying them the opportunity perhaps to get some of their agricultural products into national markets. So what's on the table here? Look, the U.N. Secretary-General wrote to the Russian foreign minister last week and said here's a set of concrete proposals to get you back in the grain deal that are going to go some way towards answering your questions. What the Russian's Lavrov said last week when he met with the Turkish foreign minister is these are promises. We want guarantees. We want substance. But what we're hearing from the Russian state news agency is that while Erdogan may be going in to talk about the U.N.-brokered grain deal, Putin wants to talk about an alternate grain deal where he ships Russian grain to Turkey who then ships it to the world. And, of course, the Ukrainian government saying look, don't let -- don't let Russia subvert the Black Sea grain deal. The U.N. says it's hugely important. Russia seems to be making Putin -- wants, it appears, to make an end run around that deal to get some other gains.",
