It also comes after a week of this total siege, as Israel called it, that has, of course, cut off those vital supplies. Not only compounding the humanitarian crisis, but a significant impediment, of course, to people actually being able to move from the North to the South of the enclave.

Thanks, Clare.Now, for the first time since the shocking and deadly Hamas attack on Israel, the president of the Palestinian Authority has condemned, and condemned strongly, the militants' actions. The Palestinian news agency WAFA is reporting that Mahmoud Abbas said the policies of Hamas do not represent the Palestinian people. He also called for a rejection of violence and the release of prisoners on both sides of the conflict. WAFA says Abbas's comments came during a phone call with the president of Venezuela. Iran's president is warning that the war between Israel and Hamas could spread to other parts of the Mideast if the crisis in Gaza is not resolved soon. In a call with France's Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, Iran's president called for an immediate end to the bombardment of residential areas in Gaza and demanded that efforts be made to lift the blockade on the territory. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent that weekend holding talks with leaders across the Middle East, in the hopes of preventing a spread of the conflict. He is warning Iran and other regional players not to take advantage of the crisis, noting that the U.S. is sending a second carrier strike group to the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We back that up, not only with the words that we're saying, but with what we're actually doing, including the deployment of these aircraft carrier battle groups, again, not to provoke anyone, but to send a very clear message of deterrence. That no one should do anything that widens this conflict in any way or that furthers aggression against Israel from any other direction. So, we've been clear about that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And also hitting some Israeli towns, killing one Israeli civilian and wounding several others. Israel fired artillery and launched air strikes on what it called Hezbollah military infrastructure. As a result of the fighting, Israel declared a four-kilometer-deep closed military zone along the border to keep civilians away. In the afternoon, a volley of rockets was fired into Israel, most intercepted by the Iron Dome. But it wasn't Hezbollah, but rather the military wing of Hamas that claimed responsibility. At roughly the same time, a rocket hit the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force just North of the border, slamming into the helipad there. No one was injured. The U.N. is trying to determine where the rocket was fired from. All of this doesn't amount to war yet, but it's getting dangerously close. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Southern Lebanon.

A very clear message to other groups in the region. Not even just Hamas, but Hezbollah, groups in Syria, as well as a deterrence to try to keep them from getting involved. Now, we do know that the Americans have sent -- already have on the ground a federal team who can help in hostage situations. They're assisting the Israelis. And there is reporting that a marine expeditionary unit is heading, potentially, towards Israel. This is a unit of more than 2,000 marines and sailors who not only can help in major evacuations, but they also had training in hostage rescue scenarios. Now no indication that that is where they're headed, or that's why they are headed, why they would potentially be headed towards the region. But it gives you an idea of potentially the support that the Israelis may be receiving from the U.S. military. Now, the Israeli military and the U.S. military work very, very closely together. They're constantly training with one another. And Israeli military officials often call the American military their brothers in arms. They actually just had their largest ever joint exercise in the last few months. And during that exercise, they explicitly made it clear that such an exercise was a very clear message to Iran, saying that, if you get involved in a way of attacking Israel, be careful because the Americans are there to support them. But John Kirby has already said that they have no plans and no intentions right now of sending U.S. troops on the ground into Israel. And Chuck Schumer, in an interview with Erin Burnett earlier, also said that the Israelis have not asked for troops on the ground. What they want right now is support in the forms of things like -- of munitions, ammunition, also, just the support of having those carrier strike groups off the coast to try and deter any other actors from getting involved. But even if a hostage rescue operation is attempted, it will be incredibly complex. It will be very, very difficult.

You mentioned my brother and my U.S.A. affiliation at the beginning. All of the schools are being targeted. You know, at least 1,900 U.N. facilities have been damaged in this conflict. The staff don't feel safe. They're moving from one town to a town. They are trying to help the refugees there with shelter. And you've mentioned the number of 400,000 Palestinian refugees. It is a school. It is not supposed to have shower. And, you know, there's a lot of complications that are not taken into consideration. Water. This is like a crime. If Russia did it, everybody would be writing on Facebook and all of these NGOs would be speaking about it. Now, they're beginning to speak about the atrocities happening in Gaza. But to be honest, it doesn't feel like it has teeth. There's a mismatch between the attitude of America and the West and their behavior. What we see in Gaza is horrific.",

Police say 71-year-old Joseph Czuba fatally stabbed 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume and seriously wounded the boy's mother, as well, in what authorities believe was a hate crime.The mother reportedly texted the boy's father from the hospital saying Czuba, the family's landlord, had attacked the family, yelling, \"You Muslims must die.\" We've not yet heard from Czuba, and it's unclear if he has an attorney. In a statement, President Biden said in part, quote, \"This horrific act of hate has no place in America and stands against our fundamental values.\" He went on, \"As Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred.\" Now when House Republicans gather behind closed doors in Washington on Monday evening, they will be in their 13th day of operating without a leader. Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan is expected to force a full vote on Tuesday as he tries to become the next speaker of the House. Jordan was nominated to replace Kevin McCarthy, who became the first U.S. speaker in U.S. history to be ousted by his own party. During Friday's nomination vote, Jordan seemed well short of the support he'll need to win the speaker's gavel. But he appeared optimistic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

It might be when. Meaning that, at a certain point, as you said, Republicans are saying publicly, we don't look good. We look like clowns. This looks like chaos. So it may be that if Jim Jordan fails, that the next person who is able to make some compromises and get some additional Republicans on board to get to that 217 is the person, not because they necessarily have the legislative credentials and/or experience, but because people come to realize that we simply can't run our government this way.",
