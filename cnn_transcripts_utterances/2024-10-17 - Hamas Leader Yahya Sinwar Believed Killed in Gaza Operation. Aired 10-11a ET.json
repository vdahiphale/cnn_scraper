As you mentioned, Becky, a statement issued by the IDF saying that they are checking the possibility that one of those militants killed. They say they killed or eliminated in their words, three terrorists that one of those militants killed may have been Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas. They've said that at this stage the identity of all three cannot be confirmed but they are carrying out checks. We await updates from the Israeli military on this. But of course, Yahya Sinwar has been a key target of the Israeli military throughout the course of this war, which has lasted of course, over more than a year. Now they have expressed from the outset of this war their intention to take out the top leaders of Hamas and Hamas' allies. And that is certainly what we have been seeing. Of course, we've seen military leaders within Hamas, Muhammad Al-Deif, of course, killed and assassinated. We have seen Ismail Haniyeh in July, killed and assassinated in Iran, the political bureau chief of Hamas. We've seen a deputy political bureau chairman Saleh al-Arouri assassinated, killed in a direct strike in Beirut in January. So we have been seeing these senior leaders killed within Hamas, both within Gaza and outside of Gaza. We've also seen key allies, of course, being targeted, including, of course, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon. But of course, there has been questions around what that actually could mean. The significance of this, whether this is perhaps enough for the Israeli government to declare that they have in some ways, won this war. Maybe, perhaps whether this could be the beginning of the end. We know of course, according to U.S. assessments that Hamas' military capabilities have now been downgraded to a point where they are not in a position to carry out an attack of this scale which we saw on October 7th. The Israeli government has persistently reiterated, particularly prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that he intends to see this war out until all of Israel's expressed intentions have been achieved, namely, the full eradication of Hamas as an organization. Whether that can be achieved, whether you can get -- (CROSSTALK)",

But there's also an alternative and that is to say that this offers Netanyahu the picture of victory that he has been looking for that would have been impossible to achieve without the death of Yahya Sinwar. And indeed now, if indeed Sinwar is confirmed to have been killed, this could provide a window of opportunity for the Israeli prime minister and for his government to say, to declare victory, to say that Hamas, as we know already, is no longer an effective governing or military structure inside of Gaza. It effectively operates now as a guerrilla force and that going forward, Netanyahu could say that victory has been achieved. And indeed move to transition to ending the war. And moving to a post-war phase of this conflict. That is far from assured, of course, at this stage. But there could be an opening. But make no mistake, regardless of what happens, this changes everything. If indeed Yahya Sinwar has been killed. You know, we have seen, as Israel has taken out numerous senior Hamas leaders, Mohammed Deif, the head of the al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas. He was also killed by Israel. And so now you really will have a Hamas force that will be somewhat rudderless. And the question is, who will step into that void? And it raises the question of whether or not this will make it easier to achieve a ceasefire and hostage deal or perhaps whether it will make it harder. I was speaking to one source who said, make no mistake. There's the possibility that, without any kind of obvious leader for Hamas, you could see chaos. And you could see risks to the lives of the hostages in the absence of clear direction from a senior leader.",

Even if there was, even if we get a cease-fire in Gaza, this not does not really mean ending it. We will witness the end of the war between Israel and the Palestinians. At the end of the day, Becky, Israel faces a strategic dilemma without ending its military occupation of Palestinian lands, without granting the Palestinians self-determination. Sadly, this is really becoming more of a forever war that is not just in Gaza but the West Bank. We hardly talk about the West fan. Think of what's been happening in the West Bank, the occupied West Bank, and now Lebanon.

What if my loved one is with him? And that's because the working assumption over the course of the last year has been that Sinwar was likely surrounding himself with multiple hostages, perhaps a dozen or so hostages, using them effectively as human shields to try and protect himself from Israeli military operations. And so therefore, this is sending a clear and immediate signal to those families that there were no hostages around him at the time when he may have been killed, if indeed his -- this body is confirmed to be that of the Hamas leader.",

We haven't heard anything official from the Biden administration in response to the fact that the IDF is investigating, if indeed this is the death of Yahya Sinwar. But as you point out, if this is something that Netanyahu uses to claim victory against Hamas in Gaza, that would presumably be what U.S. officials would hope to see. They have long said that Sinwar is the one who is standing in the way of a ceasefire and hostage negotiations, a deal in that sense. With the secretary of state saying that Sinwar has the fate of the deal in his hands just recently. And so the U.S. would presumably be tested when it comes to those comments in a very real way, if Sinwar is in fact dead here, because this would presumably pave the way for that. But as you guys have been discussing here, we don't know if that will be the case. We don't know who would take over leadership for Sinwar. We don't know if those folks would actually drive things forth to a hostage release and a ceasefire deal. This is something that obviously U.S. officials are presumably speaking about right now. And I just do want to point out that the fact that that IDF statement said that this operation was carried out in a building, not a building underground, not the tunnels underground, is really interesting. We don't know exactly the specifics of Yahya Sinwar's movements. Of course, it does tell us that he is such a hard target for the Israelis and for the U.S. side, because they have said that he has been hiding in the tunnels under Gaza. But they don't know exactly where he was. So the fact that he was just killed in this routine operation, as Jeremy is reporting, is hugely significant. It is a dose of luck, frankly, even though there have been operations ongoing for more than a year to try and find this leader, to try and take out this mastermind of October 7. So this will be a really interesting space to discuss with U.S. officials. And there'll be questions, as you guys were discussing, about the future of this conflict, if this confirmation does actually come in.",

He has for some in Gaza and even outside of Gaza. Yahya Sinwar has represented an image of resistance against Israeli occupation. But for many in Gaza now, there is a significant amount of discontent toward Hamas, toward Hamas' political so-called leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who some, we've heard firsthand, who some have accused of dragging Gaza into this war, that they have had no part in that. Civilians are paying now the highest price for a war essentially brought on by Hamas' decision to carry out those attacks and massacres in Israel on October 7. And of course, as you mentioned, Becky, it is Israel that is targeting Gaza. It is Israel carrying out these airstrikes. And of course, it is not just airstrikes and military operations that are now leading to civilians being killed but also a blockade which has led to now spreading famine across Gaza. So there is a lot of layers to this. But yes, on the political front, there is a sense of discontent now toward Hamas as to how this war has been prosecuted, what the essential end goal is. And, of course, at each point when we've seen some levels of progress with ceasefire negotiations, what we've seen on the ground in Gaza is real celebration. People are desperate for this war to come to an end. More than 42,000 people have been killed. We're watching children dying of malnutrition. So the desperation for there to be a ceasefire is immense. And what we've been hearing from officials in the U.S. is that they believe Yahya Sinwar, who, of course, is more of a hardline figure than Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in July, the political bureau chief of Hamas. He was perhaps more engaged in those negotiations. But of course, following his assassination, it is Yahya Sinwar who has been making those final calls on the final details of these ceasefire negotiations. He is seen as more of a hardline figure. So there is discontent around that as well with regards to the stalling ceasefire negotiations that we have seen. Of course, important to underscore as well that Hamas and others in the region have accused Israel of putting forward new conditions which are seen as non-starters. Again, putting a pause on those, on the progress of ceasefire talks. But for many in Gaza, the shared feeling is just a sense of desperation for this war to come to an end. And what we're hearing more broadly from the international community is that this needs to come from a political negotiated solution, not through military means. As the Israeli military has continued to push one, the Israeli government, of course.",

      "sentences": "So a couple of things I think Becky, one is was his brother, Mohammed, with him and if he -- if YahyaSinwar was killed, was his brother also killed? And the reason I asked that question is because his brother had, following the killing in July in an Israeli airstrike of Mohammed Deif, the military commander of Hamas, if you will, who put together the part of the October 7 plan as well with Yahya Sinwar. When he died, he was replaced by Yahya Sinwar's brother. Now the IDF or a senior Israeli official recently told me oftentimes Mohammed Sinwar, Yahya Sinwar were often traveling gather and really represent the sort of ultimate in the leadership of Hamas inside Gaza. If both are dead, that's something different than just Yahya Sinwar being dead. If his brother Mohammed is alive, then you can understand that the organization will probably try to continue in exactly the same way that Yahya Sinwar was leading it. If, if they are both dead, then it opens the possibility for another leadership to emerge and potentially take a different line with the Israeli government in terms of negotiations for the release of the hostages, a ceasefire, all those sorts of things. I think it's way too early to draw any realistic conclusions about what can be possible, what might be possible. That was one of the first things that occurred to me. And I think the other thing that enters the arena now is the possibility for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sort of declare a sort of a break point, if you will, in his war with Hamas. This gives him the opportunity to say, we've now killed the leadership. I think the military have long been clear in Israel, the IDF, that Hamas is depleted, in effect, in terms of a cohesive force as it was a year ago. It's ineffective in that way. Now the political leadership is what has remained, if you will, the thorn in the side of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If that leadership has gone, does that open other possibilities? And even that isn't really clear at the moment because we see the way that the IDF and the political decisions have been taken about the humanitarian situation in the north of Gaza. And that leads you to a conclusion that perhaps politically prime minister Netanyahu, even with Sinwar's death, isn't, isn't prepared to call this a moment where he can say that Hamas is defeated. Again, the dust really needs to settle and we need to get a clearer picture of what's been left behind, Becky.",

This is an opportunity to begin a different narrative. But this is where we have to let the dust settle and see what version of Hamas is left. I do think it's key about Yahya Sinwar's brother, whether he's alive. And will he pick up the reins and try to carry on? Will he become the next target for Netanyahu? What's been widely seen by diplomats and everyone else is once Israel started the war against Hezbollah, they parked Gaza on one side. They kept up military operations in the north, reinforced, cut off aid, continuing to bomb what they said were Hamas targets, command and control centers of Hamas, continuing to go after the leadership there. But for all intents and purposes, Israel's principal focus was on Hezbollah in the north. And part of that was an object lesson  to Yahya Sinwar in Hamas that you can just stew and wait. We're going to deal with you. We're not going to deal with the hostage issue. You can wait and look at what we can do to your ally and partner in Lebanon. This is, you know, that Hezbollah has been all the time engaged in the fight with Israel, they say, on the grounds of supporting Hamas, the Palestinians, the people of Gaza, the West Bank, all of that. And this, in essence, the war against Hezbollah for the Israeli government has been a lesson to Hamas that they can fight in the north and they can park the Hamas issue on one side and just deal with it militarily, not deal with it politically, not deal with it diplomatically. So yes, this is a huge opportunity to break that cycle and so a lot of focus, yes, absolutely, will be on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Does he declare this a moment of victory or not?",

Sources say Israeli infantry troops encountered three militants near a building in Gaza. And after battling them, Israeli troops found a body resembling Sinwar's and alerted their senior commanders. We now understand that the Israeli military and intelligence services are working to identify whether that body is Sinwar's using DNA analysis. Well, the death would be a hugely significant development with Sinwar considered to be the architect of the October 7 attacks. As many of you may know, unconfirmed pictures purporting to show the dead body of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar are now circulating widely on social media. In them, a man strongly resembling Sinwar can be seen lying dead in the rubble of a destroyed building with serious injuries to the skull. The source of the photos is unknown. CNN's photo desk has run the images through authenticator software, which shows no signs of image manipulation.

But that is by no means a foregone conclusion. Obviously, there's a sense that Israel right now has escalation dominance in many ways. Benjamin Netanyahu sees an opportunity to reset the table, not just in Gaza but in Lebanon and throughout the Middle East as it relates to Iran. But I can tell you, I mean, talking to these senior officials here in the region, I've heard it from a senior White House official that as long as Sinwar is alive, the administration did not think that a ceasefire in Gaza is going to be possible. So this opens up the opportunity. However, we also have to ask the question whether the administration has the political will to bring enough diplomatic wherewithal, enough pressure on Netanyahu, to call it a day, call it a victory in Gaza, which then opens up possibilities beyond Gaza. Because as we know now, Hezbollah's former leaders, secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, was looking for a fig leaf from Benjamin Netanyahu in this ceasefire that the administration was hoping to engineer. When Bibi Netanyahu took to the U.N. stage in that speech, of course, Bibi did not take that opportunity and instead decided to assassinate Nasrallah.

And I think a reasonable Israeli government would decide that here's an opportunity to claim victory but that assumes that they're looking for an off-ramp. And I think that's -- that assumption is unwarranted. I think what we're seeing on the ground in northern Gaza, we're seeing willingness to use starvation as a weapon.

Hezbollah, having been dealt these severe blows, including the assassination, essentially the decapitation of its military leadership and Hassan Nasrallah, its secretary general, is itching for a ceasefire. We've heard that time and again, including from its deputy secretary general only days ago. They need a fig leaf, they cannot, they and the Iranians who support them, cannot decouple from Gaza. They need some kind of an arrangement, some kind of an end to major military operations in Gaza in order to save face and agree to wind down in Lebanon, come out with a new diplomatic outcome. A new security arrangement for south Lebanon and that border with Israel. So in that sense, this might provide the opening for an eventual deescalation in Lebanon. On Iran however, I do think that that counter-strike, that Iran, that Israeli response to Iran is forthcoming and is going to be unrelated to this. And there are some thinking here in D.C. that this might be a multistage operation where the initial Israeli response is limited, does not go after oil installation. Some of the nuclear infrastructure is contingent to military sites and the IRGC. But then when the Iranians themselves respond, there will be a much bigger Iran -- Israeli operation. And that perhaps would, in terms of timeframe and timeline, put that much larger Israeli attack beyond the November 5 Election Day here, which is crucial in terms of the administration and what it's looking for and what it's pressuring Bibi Netanyahu to do. So I don't think it will have much of an impact as it relates to Iran but potentially impact when it comes to Lebanon.",

And so from Israel's perspective, this is a huge development, a huge achievement, even though reports seem to indicate this almost happened by accident. This wasn't an intelligence led operation targeting a tunnel, as many would probably have expected over the past many months. But this was an unprovoked, sudden development on the ground. So it's unquestionably significant for Israel but also internationally. And I think, certainly sitting in Washington  from a U.S. perspective, this is the big box that the U.S. government has needed to be ticked before the U.S. government ever pushes for a genuine end to the conflict in Gaza. And I think that is very significant from a U.S. perspective. Does that mean that the war is going to end in Gaza? No, not necessarily by any means. But it is very significant in terms of changing the calculations around the situation there.",

So I don't think we can say from Netanyahu's point of view that this is going to be a fork in the road. It could just be a moment where he said, where he takes this as a victory and then continues to press down. I think as far as Hamas is concerned, look, this is an organization built on resilience. It's an organization whose ethos is resistance. It's an organization that believes in martyrship. It means that it believes in dying for the cause. Sinwar was absolutely part and beholden to that. He will see -- would have expected his death, not to put a bump in the road but -- for Hamas but merely just be another notch in its way forward. So I think they will have prepared for this moment. They will have had ideas, which again is why I come back to the point about his brother and other senior leadership figures, who may still exist that we're not aware of, names that hadn't been talked about who may emerge.
