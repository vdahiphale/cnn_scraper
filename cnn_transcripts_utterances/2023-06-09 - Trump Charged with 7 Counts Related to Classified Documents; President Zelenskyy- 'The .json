It's the first time that a current or a former president has faced federal charges. Now, Trump has been charged, we're told, with seven counts in the indictment, and one of those counts is a conspiracy charge. A source tells CNN, the special counsel has been investigating Donald Trump's handling of classified documents ever since some of these classified documents were found in his possession at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Now, the former president wrote on Truth Social, Thursday evening, that he's expected to appear at a federal courthouse in Miami at Tuesday, at 3 p.m. We're also told that here at Bedminster, we're very nearby to where the president is. He's huddling with some of his aides. He's feeling emboldened by this news. That is his first reaction to this. He's thinking that, you know, potentially, this could have a political boost for his reelection campaign. But other advisers of his say that there are some concerns and reservations about how this could affect Donald Trump in the long term and affect his reelection campaign. Now the special counsel, Jack Smith, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland seven months ago to look into this case, once they learned that there were still classified documents in Donald Trump's possession, but also once it was clear that Donald Trump was running for reelection again.

And Trump's attorney says the former president is disappointed but not shrinking from a fight. A special counsel has been investigating how Donald Trump handled or mishandled classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago, Florida, residence after he left the White House. Seven counts Trump is facing, including charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, making false statements, as well as willful retention of documents under the Espionage Act. Trump posted a statement on his social media site which reads, \"The corrupt Biden administration has informed my attorneys that I have been indicted, seemingly over the Boxes Hoax.\" That's what Trump calls it. He then went on to accuse President Joe Biden of having more than 1,800 boxes at various locations, including two universities and his garage floor.

Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: He is so egotistical that he has this pension for conducting risky, reckless acts to show that he can sort of get away with it. It's part of asserting his -- his ego. And he's done this repeatedly at the expense of all the people who depend on him to conduct the public's business in an honorable way. And, you know, we saw that with both impeachments, and there's no excuse for what he did here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, there's been dozens of studies now, including by the World Health Organization, that estimates upwards of 5 million people died prematurely each year from natural air pollution. Now a lot of that is in places like India and China, where this is a chronic thing. You know, thankfully, outside of extreme events like this, the U.S. to date has had pretty good air quality. But the problem is, the increasing wildfire severity in the U.S. and Canada threatens to undo much of the progress we've made over the last few decades, cleaning up air pollution under the Clean Air Act. And so if we don't sort of reduce the causes of these wildfires, which is both drier conditions and hotter conditions due to climate change, but also a history of poor forest management in many parts of the country, where we sort of put out fires too effectively, left too much fuel build up in parts of the forest. We need to manage that, as well. If we don't do that, we could really see a reversal of the gains we had in air quality in this country.",
