Harris' team now saying, no, that is not what we agreed to. It was a different candidate when we agreed to this debate. There are new rules now. We want the mics unmuted.

There's going to be a debate. We need a debate, because I think, based on just - as a - from a strategist's viewpoint here, we're going to get - and you guys in the media are going to get very few opportunities to actually get an unscripted, non-teleprompter Kamala Harris over the course of the next 70-some days. It's pretty evident by where they are. We got this elusive August 31st deadline coming, and an interview that's supposedly coming. It's August 26th, we haven't heard much about it.

Who do you think it would benefit more to have an unmuted mic?Julie ROGINSKY: Oh, a hundred percent it would benefit Kamala Harris more, and I was actually disappointed that the Biden team hadn't negotiated originally to have the muted mic. Because one of the most striking things about Donald Trump that voters need to see is the lack of discipline. And, of course, we know now from the previous debate that when Biden was speaking and the mics were muted, Trump was still speaking and mumbling under his breath, something that the mics would have caught. And I think something that would have probably irritated viewers and voters had they actually seen that. So, there's no question that, of course, if he continues to behave this way, and he's quite an old man, so I don't see him changing his stripes any time in this belated stage of his life, that the same kind of thing is going to happen. We know that he cannot handle even being on stage with a woman. We saw what happened when he stalked Hillary Clinton back in 2016 across the stage, interrupting her, crowding her, mumbling under his breath when she was speaking. So, consistently, this is something that is even worse for him when he's debating a woman. And I think that's something that voters need to see for themselves.",

By my background, I'm a military officer, Air Force, but also an engineer and an operator. I spent most of my life in operations. And so what I'm going to be spending my time on is trying to understand what happened in terms of procedures and protocols to make sure that we understand that, and specifically also we'll be focusing on some new technologies such as the drone that was involved in this particular situation.

As Congressman Crow stated, we had a 416 to 0 vote, and I thought it was the right way to get started, and I think it sent the right message to the American people that we weren't going to let politics get in the middle of this, that we were going to work together to get this done in a very quick and expeditious way. Because it's so important, as the Congressman said before, to make sure everybody understands whether they're candidates or voters alike, that the Democratic process will not be undermined by violence. We're going to make sure we protect all candidates and voters up, because we had someone who came to the rally who died that day too. So we need to make sure that they're protected as well.

And you're listening to those remarks just a moment ago from a lot of these congressmen and women who have come out here.And I think that's what you're hearing quite a lot of, just the awe and a lot of them, frankly, stunned by their words, the proximity of how close the AGR building where that shooter perched and took shots at former President Donald Trump, how close that actually was to that rally stage. And again, a bit of - it's a sobering moment for them. And I'll just say personally, I was also here the night after that shooting here in Butler. This is my first time back. And this is the closest that I've been also able to get there. And the more that you see just how close these two locations are, I mean, it really is stunning to see. But then the other thing, Brianna, that's really important about this particular task force and their being here on the ground, and you heard it from, again, these representatives, is this is a bipartisan task force. There are a little less than a dozen, both Republicans and Democrats, a group of them, both Republicans and Democrats here. They spent the better part of the last hour plus time walking the area from where former President Trump was standing over to the AGR building. I believe we have video. We also showed a lot of these representatives climbing on top of the AGR building themselves to, again, get that perspective. And you heard it from, again, some of the representatives who were just speaking. The main goal of this particular task force and coming out here is to identify what in the world went wrong here and to try and work towards preventing that. Part of that and part of this visit has been speaking with local law enforcement officers. You heard them mention the Pennsylvania State Police, also the Butler Township Police. That's some of the folks that they've been meeting with on the ground to better understand their perspective on that day, because so many of those local officers were the ones on the outside of the perimeter, as we've been talking about for the better part of six weeks, who ultimately first saw Thomas Matthew Crooks and then who ultimately tried to get attention before he pulled off those shots against the former president and, of course, fatally killing one man in the crowd. So that's really what this particular day is about. The other thing, Brianna, is that you heard it from these representatives. They're really making the point here that they're taking this investigation seriously. Mind you, this is just one of a number of investigations that are occurring into what happened and what went wrong. But this group wants to say that it is important to have Congress on the record in a bipartisan fashion to try and figure out, again, what happened, but also find a solution so that something like this never happens again, Brianna.",
