You also in the announcement for this said that these people would get a review from a judge within 90 days. The backlog right now is 2 million and a half years is the average wait time or 4.3 years.

If we're going to make them walk to our southern border and ultimately give them a pass to come into the country and see a judge at some point in time, we should do it at that juncture. It would be a humane American operation working with local governments and ask the same questions that we asked here by officials, just the way we do here by American officials. Everything that we're doing here in South Texas, we could be doing it on that border of Guatemala.The President of Guatemala has agreed to this idea. I think we should embrace it. I think we -- until we build long term immigration infrastructure further away from the border, we will always be dealing with this issue. People are running from poverty around the world and they're coming in very high numbers.

TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think they're helpful in this time where we're seeing spot shortages, not widespread shortages of these drugs that so many parents rely on. Children's Tylenol, children's Motrin. And we know that sales of these drugs have been up 65% compared to the same time last year. So there really is an increased demand from this combination of RSV, COVID and the flu. And so, what CVS has done is say we are going to limit sales in person and online, in store and online to two of these products, children's pain and fever reducers per person. And Walgreens has followed suit by saying we're going to limit sales only online to about six products, but in store there's no limitation. So, they're hoping that this is going to make access equitable, that this will alleviate some of those issues around demand as manufacturers are trying to ramp up supply to meet this.",

And then count back by about five days. And in that time period, you want to try to avoid large, indoor, unmasked crowds. If you do have to attend an event like that, you want to try to mask with a high-quality mask, certainly hand washing, making sure you're up to date on your flu and updated COVID booster is important. And then, whoever you're getting together with, you want to try to all do the same strategy and making sure that any vulnerable, people are protected. So, if you are sick or you have symptoms, staying home is important, and then,  you know, ventilation can't underestimate the importance of that. So, HEPA filters, opening the windows, or if you're traveling somewhere warm, which I know you may be, having your celebration outdoors is a good idea.

Yesterday were in court and there was no shortage of theatrics. I was sitting just next to Sam Bankman-Fried at one point, and even he seemed confused. Why his Bahamian attorneys seemed to be on a very different page than his U.S. attorneys, essentially saying that they had not agreed to extradition, although that was the reason for that hearing yesterday.By yesterday afternoon, the attorneys here in the Bahamas, their tune had changed somewhat. They said they had the opportunity to consult with their client and that, yes, he would agree to leave this island, give up his fight for extradition, and that would involve him if all goes according to plan, tomorrow, having hearing behind me in the morning. And then he would be taken either from this location or the prison where he's currently being held. I imagine by a very heavily armed guard. He would, imagine, being escorted by U.S. federal officials and then taken to an airport here in Nassau, where he most likely be put on a private U.S. federal plane. And then flown, we expect to New York, where he faces charges, eight charges, and if convicted, could lead to over 100 years in prison. And so, he would have to after arriving in New York, we imagine he'll be booked. And then questions like whether or not he could receive bail, something that was denied to him here in the Bahamas, will take place. So, while it may be the end of his time in the Bahamas, where he lived as a billionaire, it's only the beginning of his legal troubles in the United States. Victor.",
