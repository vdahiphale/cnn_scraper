Doctor, I mean, you're the impartial person here in terms of sport. A lot of people talking about the violence of the game becoming too violent or the players are too big or, you know, it's just becoming too tough. What's your view as a doctor?DR. ANTHONY CARDILLO, EMERGENCY ROOM SPECIALIST: Oh, boy, this is a rough question. I'm sure my two younger boys aren't going to be happy with the answer as most people in America. Because it's such a part of our culture whether it's football, whether it's hockey. There are a lot of sports that are very dangerous. I will tell you, however, the majority of these cases, this Commotio Cordis, this acute chest trauma that induces cardiac arrest, we see it a lot -- not a lot but we see it most in baseball believe it or not. It's when the pitcher gets hit with that ball traveling at a high rate of speed into the anterior chest. If you look at the literature, that's the majority of these cases as related to sports, it's in baseball. We have a handful of cases every year that we see so obviously if it can happen a few times, it can happen many more times. But I'd have to agree that football is becoming very dangerous. A lot more dangerous than perhaps 20 or 30 years ago. The players are a lot more sophisticated. The equipment is also being pared down more and more. But it's almost becoming more violent, so to speak, when they're playing. And we know this. It's just a matter of making sure the players are safe, whether it's concussive injury, whether it's neurologic and spinal cord injury and now whether it's chest injury with cardiac events. You have to look carefully at how we can protect these players. I don't think it's reasonable at this juncture to start talking about dismantling football as part of our American culture but certainly to think how can we prevent our players, looking at the disease entities that injure them, and then doing the best we can to, you know, just institute policies, procedures, protective measures to keep them as safe as possible.",

And we've already heard from the former defense chief of the Donetsk region. Who has said that there are still Russian soldiers who are unaccounted for. They haven't been added to the official death toll. And as we've seen in the past the Russian Armed Forces, the Kremlin in general has been keen to downplay the death toll figure. What we have heard at this stage from the Ukrainian side, was that while they are working to clarify that figure around the scheduled death toll, at the time of this attack, up to 10 units of Russian military equipment in the area has been confirmed, to have been either destroyed completely or at least damaged following that attack.",

He says there shouldn't have been a scale that size of Russian troops and soldiers concentrated in such a small space. Essentially making them an easy target for Ukraine. But interestingly we've also been hearing from pro-Russian bloggerswho've taken to Telegram and social media to question the use of sloppy tactics by the Russian Armed Forces essentially describing the Russian military command as being incompetent. So clearly, we are seeing a shift there in the sort of rhetoric that is being used from pro-Russian voices around the Russian government, around the Russian Armed Forces.
