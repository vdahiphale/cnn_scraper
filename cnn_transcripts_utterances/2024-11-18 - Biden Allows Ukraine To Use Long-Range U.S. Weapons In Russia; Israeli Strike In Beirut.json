President Joe Biden for the first time allowing Kyiv to use long-range U.S. weapons to strike deeper inside Russia. The decision had been under consideration for months as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for the green light in the hopes of gaining momentum in the war.But U.S. officials have been divided and also concerned it could escalate to conflict. A U.S. official says the weapons are to be used primarily in Russia's Kursk Region for now, where Moscow has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to try to take back territory. Thousands of North Korean troops are among those taking part in the Russian offensive. President Zelenskyy with this message after news of the U.S. decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what the Russian president said back then is that he believes that these types of weapons, like for instance, the U.S. provided ATACMS, surface to surface missiles, can only be used by the Ukrainians with the help of specialists from the countries that provide those weapons, in this case, obviously meaning the United States. And Vladimir Putin has said that he believes that strikes deep into Russian territory with these weapons therefore constitute a direct attack against Russia by the countries that provided those weapons. And Vladimir Putin believes also provided the expertise to use those weapons accurately against targets inside Russia. Now, the Russians went a long way to try and dissuade the Biden administration from making exactly the decision that it has now made. The Russians even changed the fundamental nuclear doctrine of those -- of this country. And the new thing that this nuclear doctrine now includes is if the Russian Federation is attacked by long distance weapons from a non-nuclear country like for instance, Ukraine, with the help of a nuclear country like for instance, the United States, that the Russians could then trigger the nuclear -- a nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear weapons on their part. So the Russians definitely say that to them, the United States allowing the Ukrainians to use weapons provided by the United States to strike deep into Russian territory will be considered a major escalation.

Part of this bigger theme that we've talked about during the G20 as well as with APEC, a chance for China to draw a wedge, put a wedge between the United States and its allies. And it's something that we have seen already in clarity. It was earlier this past week when the APEC was set to get underway in Peru, when President Xi Jinping, as well as leaders from Peru unveiled this massive port. It's a $1.3 billion investment by the Chinese government in Peru, a way for China to symbolically show that as the world's second largest economy, it's a government, it's a nation that's worth holding a partnership with. So as we look ahead to G20 and ways for China to -- to send this message and to exert its power, expect to see a long list of dignitaries, many of whom may have conversations with Xi Jinping that could include the U.K. as well as Japan, Australia, India. The Prime Minister of India will be at the G20, not at APEC, but at the G20.

And that happens from May through August. Well, why does this happen? Well, it's because the earth is round, and it's kind of crooked. It goes around the sun year-round but does so at a tilt so sometimes on its trek around the sun, the earth is tilted away from the sun, and other times its tilted towards the sun. Well, as we head into December, we are about to be at a point where the earth is tilted away from the sun in the northern hemisphere. That's what causes the start of the winter season. You have more of that solar energy in the southern hemisphere that's why they get the start of summer. So this tilt-away from the sun literally points you away from the light and into the darkness, which is why the north pole will wind up seeing full weeks of darkness, not one stitch of light, as we go through the next couple of weeks. Notice that the opposite happens in the southern hemisphere. You get full sunshine for the next couple of weeks as they go into summer. As we go into spring and autumn, it's even. Even hours of daylight and darkness until it again flips. As we go into summer, in the northern hemisphere, again tilted towards the sun. That's going to open up the daylight and you'll find more of that sunshine in the Arctic Circle and the opposite happens with the darkness in the South Pole as they head into winter in June.
