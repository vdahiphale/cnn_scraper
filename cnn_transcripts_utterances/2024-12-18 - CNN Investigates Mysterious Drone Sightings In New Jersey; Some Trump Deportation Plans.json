We will see how many he -- how many people he's actually able to deport. To your point, Priscilla, I think it's a good one. It is actually hard to deport a lot of people. So I think the size and the scope is one of the biggest differences here. And just the methods of being used. I mean, the military, again, is not used routinely. It's against the law actually. But he is saying -- the president-elect and his team are saying, you know, if these folks are criminals, they could perhaps use the military. So I think that's the biggest difference.

He was killed by the Israelis. So that's number one. He's gone. He's been replaced by people who are more willing to talk. Second, Hamas was always hoping that Hezbollah and others would join into the fight. And of course, we know, this summer, the early fall, Israel decimated Hezbollah. And now they're in a peace -- I'm sorry -- truce agreement, if you will. That means that Hezbollah is not coming to their aid anytime soon, nor is Iran, for that matter, for similar reasons. And then thirdly, more overlooked is the fact that if you look at the people, the Palestinians in Gaza, in September, they supported Hamas to the tune of 60 some percent, 64 percent of Palestinians supported them. Now that number is down in the 30s. So you see that they, Hamas, are losing the support of the Palestinians in Gaza. So I think all these factors combined are now pushing the Hamas leadership to take a softer stance in negotiations. And I think are creating some room for maybe a deal.",

Trump seems to be more aligned with Netanyahu. So maybe that will give him the more of the ability to -- to press him in certain ways. Again, in either case, what's unclear now is what -- what position does President Trump and his team, will they take with regard to the future of Gaza and the relationship, the peace process going forward? You know, will they go back to a two-state solution? Members of his campaign have said that's not the case. But think about the bigger picture out there. You know, Donald Trump, to his credit, launched the Abraham Accords in 2020. That was successful in terms of bringing countries like the UAE. And now it's sitting out there and Saudi Arabia says, hey, look, we'll join the -- the Abraham Accords. We'll normalize relations with Israel, something that the Israelis have wanted for decades. But there has to be a number of things agreed to, a security arrangement between the United States and Saudi Arabia. But importantly, back to topic, there has to be an end state, a peace process to deal with the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank.
