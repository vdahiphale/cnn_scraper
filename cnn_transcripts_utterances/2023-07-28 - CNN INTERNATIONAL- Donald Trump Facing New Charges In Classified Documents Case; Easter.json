Now, in some areas of Europe slightly cooler weather is giving firefighters a much needed break, as they work to extinguish wildfires made worse by the scorching heat but the relief may be short lived, with temperatures again expected to rise across much of the region in the coming days.In Croatia firefighters are working to contain another wildfire along the Adriatic coast, the second one this week. And in Greece, fires are still burning in the hard to reach mountain areas around roads. Greek officials say 10 percent of the land on the heavily touristic Island has been destroyed by the recent fires, Nada Bashir, following all of this, for us from Rome, Nada?",

In Italy, there are still some fires burning in the south. But at this stage, they are all contained according to the authorities and they are no longer classifying this as a fire emergency.But of course, we are expecting temperatures to subside to either average or even below average levels over the coming days. But there is concern around those strong winds and the potential to rekindle fires in forested areas across the south of Italy. And as you mentioned, we are still seeing fires burning in cross Greece. We have new authorities yesterday saying that 124 fires had been reported. But again, some positive indications for the first time in nearly two weeks. No large fires being reported that there is of course some positive indications there. But again, the country is still on high alert. And this is something that we're seeing across the Mediterranean real concern around the potential for further high temperatures later on in the month in August to lead further wildfires. Now we heard that warning yesterday from the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres giving a stark message on the situation that this region is facing. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: Climate change is here. It is terrifying. And it is just the beginning. The era of global warming has ended the area the heater of global boiling, as arrives. (END VIDEO CLIP) Global boiling has arrived. It is a deeply concerning prospect. And of course, we've been hearing those warnings repeatedly. Now yesterday that report released by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service highlighting some really concerning assessments. I'll just pull out a few of those key points yesterday. July again said to be the hottest month on the planet recorded every day since July 3 has been hotter than record set back in 2016. And almost every month this year has been in the top five hottest on record. There's some deeply concerning statistics there. We've heard from EU officials saying they are trying to make the necessary preparations for what is expected to be further extreme heat events in the coming years. Experts say this is not only going to become more frequent, but these extreme heat events, these wildfires that we're seeing across the Mediterranean could also become more severe, Max.",

It's the main square was filled with people in brightly colored outfits jumping and dancing and waving. Kim Jong-Un was front of the centers.They celebrated the armistice agreement that ended the fighting on the Korean peninsula 70 years ago and anniversary that North Korea falsely calls Victory Day. During the military parade, North Korea's prize whiles some 18 intercontinental ballistic missile. And other hardware were on full display the North putting on a show, a high level delegation from close allies Russia and China. CNN's Marc Stewart is tracking all of this live from Tokyo and for many this is being seen as effectively Russia endorsement of that arms program in North Korea.",

And it says it supports the queue in hopes of preventing bloodshed and maintaining people's well- being. CNN's Larry Madowo following developments are for us, a scary time for people in Niger.",

      "sentences": "Scary time indeed. And there's some division among the public over who to support here. When the reports first emerged Wednesday, our President Mohamed Bazoum, being held at the Presidential palace by the Presidential guard that those who came on to the streets to support him and demand the return to democracy.On Thursday, we saw pro-military protesters come out on the streets go to the National Assembly. They set fire to the headquarters of the party of the President. And most notably, they set fire to the French flag. And they held up some Russian flag some of them said -- are done with Russia, among other statements in support of Russia. Again, it's too early to tell here. But this is notable only because there's a lot of anti-French sentiment in the region in France and Central West Africa. There is some growing Russian influence in that region, especially in Mali and the Central African Republic, where the Wagner group, the mercenary group has been active. Who has a so French, who has a so Russian flag in Burkina Faso after the coup. So there appears to be a trend here. And some of these protests that I want you to listen to one of them and what they say about this particular protest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And to U.S. officials tell CNN that the American there are about a 1000 American troops in Niger as part of the counterterrorism operations there. Their army command, which has supported the military man that took over the country say that there should be no foreign military intervention in this situation.Otherwise, it risks having very serious disastrous and uncontrolled consequences. So we still don't know about the status of President Bazoum. Even though, Max, the French Foreign Minister has said he's still reachable. He's spoken with President Emmanuel Macron. And there's still a chance that he might be returned to power but so far, we've not seen him. So it's all up in the air.",
