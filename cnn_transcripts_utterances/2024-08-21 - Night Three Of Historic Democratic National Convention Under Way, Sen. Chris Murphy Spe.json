We're following it all from our CNN skybox with our teams on and near the convention floor. I'm Anderson Cooper along with Jake Tapper.

The campaign says that Walz will highlight the small town values he grew up with in the Nebraska along with his experience outside of politics as an assistant coach for football, and a teacher, and a National Guardsman. Democratic insiders describe the governor's speech as positive and patriotic. Tonight's other top speakers include former President Bill Clinton, who will be delivering his 13th convention address. Also, we'll hear from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, an excerpt for his speech suggests that he will describe the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump as. \"We the people\" versus \"Me, myself, and I\". And in a huge get for the DNC, CNN has learned exclusively that Oprah Winfrey will take part in the program this evening. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is just off the stage as the convention program takes it to higher gear and CNN's John Berman and Kaitlan Collins are getting reaction from the delegates on the convention floor here at the United Center in Chicago.

Now, I will say over the last several minutes, the incredibly emotional speech from the parents of the Israeli hostage, Hersh Goldberg-Polin. This place was completely silent, you could have heard a pin drop. I saw tears streaming down everyone's face. Everyone is very emotional already and I do think they're very much looking forward to everyone else will come on this stage. I actually walked over here to the Illinois delegation because after Jamie Gangel reported the news that Oprah would be speaking, I wanted to get reaction from some of our hometown crowd here so I came over and I bumped into the speaker pro-tem of the Illinois House Jehan Gordon-Booth.

Put it in terms that are simple and easy for people to understand, that are relatable. That is another big reason he was picked on the ticket is actually his ability to convey ideas. When he came up with the idea of, weird, it came to encapsulate a lot that Democrats are trying to say about their political opposition. So, I expect that to be the main thing that he does tonight. I also think, Jake, the other part of the reason why this stadium is so full, is that I think people learned last night that there is a convergence of celebrity power and energy and excitement and the unexpected that has been happening in this arena.
