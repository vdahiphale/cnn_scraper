But are the demands from some protesters for colleges to divest from Israel actually feasible? And emperor penguins at risk. How the world's largest penguin species is severely threatened by climate change. Thanks for joining us. Well, the U.S. is ramping up diplomatic pressure surrounding hostage release and ceasefire talks involving Israel and Hamas. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia just a short time ago where he will meet with Arab officials. Blinken is expected to discuss aid to Gaza as well as how to achieve a, quote, \"lasting peace and a pathway to a Palestinian state.\" On Sunday, the Saudi foreign minister weighed in on solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

That according to a source familiar.Now, this call lasted just under an hour and was described by the source as, quote constructive. Of course, U.S. officials have been working around the clock to try to reach an agreement that would allow for a temporary ceasefire about six tweaks and also the release of hostages held by Hamas and for more humanitarian aid to get surged into Gaza. Senior U.S. officials have been traveling to the region over the last several months to try to advance these talks and Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to the Middle East on Sunday, where he too will be involved in these conversations as well as the conversations about getting more aid into Gaza. Now, the president and the Israeli prime minister are also touched on other issues, including, for example, around the airstrikes against Israel and Israel's airstrikes against Iran, the first time they've discussed that since that occurred earlier this month, and about Rafah. That's an area where Israel has said that they would potentially launch an operation. It's also where there are over 1 million Palestinians displaced. And according to a White House readout, it said, quote, the leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clearer position. That position from the U.S. being that an operation at this point would be untenable. Of course, those conversations are ongoing. Now, what happens after this call and the results of it are still unclear. But what we will be monitoring in the weeks to come. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Seventy-one percent of respondents say they don't like the way he's handled the war between Israel and Hamas. That number is 81 percent among those aged 18 to 34. The survey also asked registered voters, their preferences and a head- to-head match up between Mr. Biden, and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and found Trump leading by a margin of 6 percent.Former President Donald Trump is laying the groundwork for a potential second term in office. Specifically, he's been talking about his plans to overhaul the federal government and eliminate what he calls the deep state and ensure most government employees are loyal to him.
