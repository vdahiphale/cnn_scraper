We just talked about drones, paragliders, you know, commando teams, missiles, but none of that is particularly sophisticated. What was sophisticated about this attack, stunningly so, and as an intelligence professional I'm still in shock, is the operational security level, which is, this had to involve not just hundreds but thousands of players, all of whom must have known something, many of whom must have known a lot. And the idea that this wasn't picked up by signals intelligence, that it wasn't picked up by satellites, that saw bulldozers moving, that it wasn't picked up, and this is the key, by human sources, that, you know, one of the greatest intelligence agencies in the world, the Mossad, presumably, you know, had penetrating groups like Hamas' military wing, all of that is a shock to the system.So, there's the sidelight, which is also, that has been a government in controversy in chaos for some time, which can be a real distraction, a watch word to us is we have a broken Congress.

Now it's a virtual ghost town, of course. A lot of people are still sheltering in place, those who have not already been evacuated. It's quiet right now, but there has been steady rocket barrages throughout the day. There's a shelter over there that people can run and take cover in.But this is extremely difficult and dynamic, fluid situation on the ground. And the fear right now, or I should say the priority really right now, is to try to ensure that all of the militants who successfully infiltrated that border have been killed or captured. That all of the various breaches in the dozens we now know, I believe it was 80 according to the IDF, have been resolved and fixed, and that the hostages can now be the main focus. And I should say, we were talking to a major with the IDF, who said that it has been very difficult for the Israeli forces to try to ascertain how many of those hostages with alive, how many of them may already be dead.

And from a military intelligence perspective, not only how did they miss this, how did they miscalculate Hamas's strategy going forward. Now, Hamas hasn't launched a rocket from Gaza in two years. And the Israeli focal point has been more on Fattah, viewing Hamas as an organization that is focused more on governing and not terrorism. So, if you take a bigger step back and look at their overall intelligence assessment of where Hamas stood, there are a lot of questions to be asked. Where did they get so wrong?
