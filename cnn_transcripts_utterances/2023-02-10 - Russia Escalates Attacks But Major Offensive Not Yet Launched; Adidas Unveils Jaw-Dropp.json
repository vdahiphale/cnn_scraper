And like Kanye, or Ye as he is called now, it's a lot.CNN's business and politics correspondent, Vanessa Yurkevich, is here to break it down. Vanessa, how -- I hesitate to ask. How much money are we talking about really? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Wow. This is an expensive breakup. I want to walk viewers back to how we got here essentially. October 2022, was not a good month for Kanye West. He wore a \"White Lives Matter\" shirt to a Paris fashion week event, got a lot of criticism there, got into a fight with P-Diddy. Tweeted anti-Semitic comments. More ranting and more anti-Semitic comments on a podcast, which ultimately led Adidas to terminate the partnership in October. So what is that costing Adidas? Wow. $1.3 billion because of this breakup. And why is that happening? That's because they have an estimated $1.3 billion of unsold Yeezy merchandise. So they simply can't sell it anymore. So what they're Looking to do is possibly, possibly rebrand the items. But part of this partnership was that people wanted to buy it because they knew it was Yeezy. And another thing they can do with this merchandise is ultimately destroy it or donate it, but that doesn't get them any money back. Potentially, rebranding could get them a couple hundred million dollars back. But you know, this partnership between Yeezy and Adidas, Abby, was so lucrative for about a decade. But, wow, just $1.3 billion in the hole now because of this breakup -- Abby?",

They didn't want to lose that $1.3 billion.But separately, the \"Wall Street Journal\" just reported not about Beyonce concert tickets but about this clothing line that she has with Adidas, Ivy Park. It is, despite all of the buzz around Beyonce, suffering from weak sales. What's going on there?",

      "sentences": "Yes. You know, Beyonce may have broken records with the number of Grammys she's won, but she's not breaking records with Adidas right now.According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" sales dropped 50 percent last year compared to 2021. So it brought in about $40 million. That's the Ivy Park line. However, the projection from Adidas or the target from Adidas, rather, was $250 million. That's what they were hoping to get. So they are down in terms of what they were hoping to make by $200 million. Now according to Adidas -- they're responding to the \"Wall Street Journal's\" reporting on this -- they say, nope, the partnership is strong, and it's successful. Beyonce not commenting on this right now. However, what she is doing is, on Instagram, she's posting that there's a new Ivy Park drop this week. So there's a new line of merchandise coming out between the two. But projections, according to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" for this year not looking much better, $65 million in sales for Ivy Park. They were hoping to target $335 million. That is a huge difference. I think all of this begs the question, Abby, are these celebrity partnership deals really worth it for brands? At least when it comes to Beyonce and Kanye West, the numbers are not painting that picture -- Abby?",
