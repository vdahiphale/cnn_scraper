Water rescues are underway at this hour as the storm's torrential rains have triggered flash flooding and trap people in their homes. You can see some of this video right now of rescuers outside an apartment building. Crews across Florida's gulf coast have been working through the night. The winds of the Category 3 hurricane have also proved very deadly, spinning off an outbreak of tornadoes even before it arrived. At least four people that we know of at this point are confirmed dead in St. Lucie County, about 150 miles from where Milton made landfall. High winds shredded the roof off of Tropicana Field where the Tampa Bay Rays play baseball. You can see the remnants of that roof. They're just unbelievable. Earlier this week, it was announced that the stadium would be used as a base camp for 10,000 first responders and emergency workers. A short time ago, we heard from Florida's governor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  We will better understand the extent of the damage as the day progresses. And you have people that are out there assessing damage right now. First responders have been working all through the night to help people who were in distress. And what we can say is the storm was significant. But, thankfully, this was not the worst case scenario.

So, in some ways, we're fortunate that when it did landfalls Category 3 for the Bay Area where we're at, ended up hitting about 60 miles south of us. It originally was the track was right into the bay of Hillsborough County, the Tampa Bay area.So, we were fortunate, but we still are outside assessing damage.

The folks out here are at this hour starting the process of trying to clean up some of this debris.We're in a neighborhood about 10, 15 minutes south of downtown Fort Myers, where we spent last night as that storm made its way north. This one house here, we'll walk over here so I can show you the damage, the owner tells me that he was here yesterday with his family last -- yesterday afternoon, and they started to feel this wind and they started to get worried. And, of course, because you can see how much plywood they have up, they really weren't quite sure what was happening outside of the house. But at one point, they quickly realized that what was happening was a tornado was making its way through this part of Fort Myers. Over in Cape Coral, just on the other side of the Caloosahatchee River, there was another tornado that we believe damaged several homes in that part of Lee County. And so we'll walk a little bit more to show you some more of the damage. This house here had its white fence torn apart. The folks here are in the process of bringing down what's left of it and then putting it out to the front yards as they decide what will happen next. And then to give you one bigger sense of just how things looked on the other side here, you'll take a look at the roof of that apartment building over there. It is also gone. Jim, I can tell you over in Fort Myers Beach, things got a little bit about five to six feet of flooding over on Sanibel. They also saw that same kind of storm surge. We're being told that residents will be allowed to get back onto both of those islands later this afternoon. There had been a mandatory evacuation for both Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel Monday into Tuesday. And then yesterday was really a ghost town. The folks here are well aware of the power of a very strong storm. Two years ago, Hurricane Ian destroyed parts of Lee County, especially Fort Myers Beach in Sanibel. And so a lot of these folks made their way inland and now they're about to be able to go back home to take a look at the damage. Jim? ACOSTA:  Yes. Carlos. I mean, that's what I was going to ask you about because, I mean, you're right. I mean, so many of those folks out on those barrier islands are still recovering from Ian and they're just going to get a chance to get out there. Do we know from local officials just how bad it is? Is it as bad as Ian or we just don't know yet, it's too early?",

And this Hurricane Milton, of course, made landfall to the north of here. The storm surge numbers yesterday were, we were expecting, between 8 to 12 feet of storm surge. What we ended up getting in downtown Fort Myers was probably three to four feet. And a good amount of that water receded once high tide cleared out.",

I really appreciate it. And to all your team members out there, thanks to them as well. Let's go to Derek Van Dam in the Weather Center. Derek, I know you got the latest on the numbers on this hurricane.

At least four people were killed in St. Lucie County when tornadoes touched down in the area prior to Milton making landfall. One twister ripped through a steel storage building, housing patrol vehicles for the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Department. Officials say the mangled building was destroyed within moments of the tornado touching down.Joining us now to discuss is the mayor of Port St. Lucie, Shannon Martin. Mayor, thank you so much for joining us. What can you tell us about how things are going there? We've heard about this tornado coming through. What kind of damage did it cause? MAYOR SHANNON MARTIN, PORT ST. LUCIE, FLORIDA:  So, as reported by the St. Lucie County Sheriff, and good morning, thank you for having me on, they did have a pavilion that housed emergency vehicles and that pavilion got destroyed in a tornado. I believe that they were doing everything they could to get some of the emergency vehicles out, and also making sure that no one was injured and luckily nobody was injured with that pavilion collapse.",

The tornadic activity was extremely unprecedented for our region. We've never seen anything like that before. I know I've never seen anything like that before in almost 20 years that I've been here. Even our local newscasters were quite surprised and shocked about the tornadic activity that we did see.We had about three tornadoes, at least here in Port St. Lucie. The worst, of course, was the tornado that hit the Spanish Lakes community outside of the city boundaries in the county, where there are four confirmed deaths and a lot of destruction. We did aid -- our police department did aid our partners in the county and our sheriff's office and our fire district with assisting in that. And I know we will be go County Administrative Emergency Operation Center around noontime today where I believe the governor is expected to be there and to provide updates to all of our residents and the region about the assessments and what's going on.",

I'm not sure exactly what you can see, but there are folks that are being escorted out on boats. There's a lot of equipment out here.Officials are going door to door in this apartment complex to get people out. I've seen people come out holding anything that they can, their pets, their clothes. I actually talked to one resident who told me that they started panicking at about 1:00 A.M. when their apartment started getting flooded. We've seen at least a foot likely more of rain come down in Clearwater, and they ran out at 1:00 A.M. when the hurricane was still nearby. They ran to safety. Around that time, emergency officials said that they started getting calls for help. They were able to respond. They've gotten tons and tons of people out. I don't have an exact number for you, but one woman I spoke to told me that all she was able to get out with was the clothes on her body. She said -- or rather, emergency officials told me that in this area, there's been up to chest-high, neck-high water. We're watching these rescues unfold and we're watching these officials go door to door. We've heard them banging on several doors. I saw someone holding an official holding a sledgehammer previously. You see officials here off to my right putting on a wetsuit equipment. They're likely headed in now. And if we could zoom in, I want to show our viewers, once officials clear a room, they mark it with an X. And you can see it up there on the right as these rescues continue. Like I said before, we've heard banging. So, they're essentially trying to find out if there's anyone who is in desperate need of aid as we're watching. Now, more boats go off to try to rescue folks. Fortunately, Jim, what I've heard from folks that I've spoken to here, no reports of injuries at this point, but obviously all of that can change, given the fact that we're dealing with a very fluid situation. This area in Clearwater, one of the hardest hit by rain, but there are many across the Gulf of Florida that have experienced the powerful effects of Hurricane Milton, Jim.",

I don't know specifically -- we literally arrived here moments ago, so I don't know specifically this apartment complex, whether it was under an evacuation order or not. What I can tell you is that from experience, and talking to folks who decide to stay despite those types of orders, there's a number of factors at play. One of them is the cost of leaving. Having spoken to officials and residents here, it sounds like this was a community that was working class.So, it may have been difficult for folks to access the resources that they needed to leave further. A lot of times you talk to these folks and it's the simple things. It's their pets. They don't want to leave them behind. And I've seen folks bringing out their cats and dogs. Obviously, there's a sentimental attachment and not every shelter takes pets. So, that plays a role as well. And then lastly, Jim, a lot of it is just uncertainty. Folks don't realize that they're in immediate danger until it actually happens. I know yesterday when the rain started coming down at first, it just seemed like normal rain. But then as the evening picked up, it got worse and worse and worse. And, obviously, we've seen some really historic rain from Hurricane Milton, Jim.",

But that one section of the community where we can see those rescuers taking those boats into the water there, it looks like that might have been near some kind of a creek or stream or something that just couldn't handle all of that water and it overflowed into that section of the parking lot.",
