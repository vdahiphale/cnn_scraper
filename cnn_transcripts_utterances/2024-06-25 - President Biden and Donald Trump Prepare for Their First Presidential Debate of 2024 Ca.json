Our new reporting this morning, advisers outside Biden's campaign are urging him to not talk about his own first-term policies on the debate stage, but instead focus on going after former President Donald Trump. Today, a new attack ad from Biden's team he was taking direct aim at Trumps economic plans.Also this morning, the only person who has ever debated both men is sharing her list of dos and don'ts for the American people as they listened to Thursdays debate. In a brand new \"New York Times\" op-ed, Hillary Clinton told voters, \"when you see these two men side-by-side, think about the real choice in this election. It's between chaos and competence.\" As for Donald Trump, he is in Florida today doing debate prep his way. We are closely covering both campaigns.

Now, Biden's advisers have signaled there are three areas where they want to really draw a contrast with Trump on the debate stage. That includes abortion, democracy, and the economy.And CNN has learned that outside advisers have been giving the president and his team advice when it comes to making their economic arguments. Sources have said that they have relayed to the Biden team that they believe that Biden should focus less on taking a victory lap about his own economic accomplishments and focus more or on drawing that contrast, going on offense and attacking Trump's vision for the economy. It comes as they are urging Biden to really try to tie Trump to corporate America while also highlighting the inflationary nature of some of his economic plans. Part of the concern is that Biden's record at times, while he has been very quick to try to promote it, it just isn't something that's sunk in with voters just yet, with many still harboring very deep reservations about the state of the economy and how the president has handled it. Now, the Biden campaign today is really trying to lean into their economic arguments, releasing this new ad trying to portray the former president as someone who is only looking out for himself and not the American people. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But Sunday evening, we saw this emergency filing filed by the trustee and that is when he laid out what he plans to do and he said he plans to have an orderly wind-down process and a sale. Now, the reason that this emergency filing was filed was actually because one of the parents, one of the families of one of the kids who were killed in Sandy Hook living in Texas, they filed a motion trying to go after this Free Speech Systems assets because they themselves, just that family is owed $50 million themselves. But this trustee is saying, hey, can we freeze this process to make sure that everybody gets their fair share? We are expecting to hear from the judge on this this week about whether that will be frozen. Jones himself has claimed that there are things happening behind the scenes. He is saying don't believe everything you hear, but he has said something that is true. He said, listen, Infowars is just a building and my crew and a name and overall, it is me and that's true. Because even if Infowars is shutdown in five months, nothing is preventing Alex Jones from continuing to speak and spreading his lies and spreading his conspiracy theories. In fact, he is still talking about Sandy Hook. He does admit that Sandy Hook happened, but he is claiming being that this whole lawsuit is some sort of plot by the government. Nothing is preventing him from doing that. He still has his First Amendment free speech rates. The only thing that would prevent him from talking about Sandy Hook is a settlement, a settlement with the families. That so far has failed to materialize. So even if Infowars is shut down, he can go on whatever platform that will still have him, think about people like Tucker Carlson who he has already had several events with, he has been on air with -- any of those people could take him. He could still spout his lies. But here is the thing: Any money that Alex Jones makes likely for the rest of his life will go to these families because $1.5 billion is a lot of money. He doesn't have nearly that amount of money either in his personal assets or within Infowars. So even as he continues spouting his lies, at least we know that hopefully the families will start seeing some money because these families have seen not a single cent so far.",
