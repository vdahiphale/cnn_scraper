He also talked about how close he is with Xi Jinping, the president of China. Obviously, those two have had a long relationship and really regard each other as friends.

And I think the special counsel is particularly interested in what they have to say for that reason. They were in those rooms. They were present for those phone calls. The one call in particular between former President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, in which Trump is putting the pressure on him. So, they want to know what they know and they want to know what Trump was thinking and what he was doing in particular on January 6th, where there are is still a lot of unknowns about what happened on that day and they were present for a lot of the events of that day.

He believes for some unknown reason that Ukraine belongs to him, Ukraine as I said belongs to the Ukrainian people and I think there are none of your viewers who aren't inspired and in awe of the resilience and bravery of the Ukrainian people.

It is unclear if it detected any overheat. But in Salem, Ohio, just 13 miles further along, surveillance video clearly shows sparks and bright lights coming from under a rail car at about a half pay point of the train. There was another hot box detector just down the track from where surveillance video was taken, but it is not clear if it detected an overheat either.If it did, both the conductor and dispatcher would have been alerted to a heating issue. The NTSB said shortly before the derailment, a wayside defect detector alerted the crew to a mechanical issue. CNN estimates, based on the time stamps of the surveillance videos and distances between towns, the train would have been traveling an average of 49 miles per hour between Alliance and Salem, Ohio, then slowed to an average of 29 miles per hour between Salem and East Palestine.

Ohio residents will speak out and try to get answers from top officials. It all begins tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern. Let's bring in CNN Political Director David Chalian and CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes. Kristen, you've been following Trump's visit to Ohio today, where he was very critical of President Biden. I want to listen -- I want you and all of our viewers to listen to something else he said. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, we already heard from the mayor, that man that was standing right behind Trump in that clip you just played, who spoke on Fox News, he's a Trump supporter and he basically lashed out at Biden for going to Ukraine, for spending money in Ukraine when he said, this again is the mayor of East Palestine, said that they still needed help on the ground there, that Biden hadn't been on the ground there.And this is really part of what Trump's advisers were hoping to accomplish with this trip, to contrast former President Trump and President Biden and really highlight Trump's America First agenda that he has routinely pushed. The other thing to point out here is that we know from conservative -- from advisers that conservative commentators and conservative influencers have been calling on Trump for weeks to make this trip to Ohio. They believe that this was an area that was full of Trump supporters, that he could actually make it there, he could make an impact by visiting. And it was clear today that that is accurate, that that was one of the things they tried to prove. The other thing I want to just point out here that advisers had tried to accomplish and hope to accomplish was to make Trump look presidential in this moment. And this trip really did mimic a White House disaster trip. He visited a site, he was flanked by local officials. So those were the two political things that they were trying to achieve with this trip. BLITZER:  And, David, I'm curious what do you think, politically speaking, should President Biden go to East Palestine now?",

There is a long tradition of presidents going to high-profile disaster sites. This president is well-known for his empathy and trying to give voice to those that are afflicted by something like this tragedy in Ohio and the comfort of a nation. That goes sort of across parties here.Listen, Joe Biden may do that and it would be irrespective of the politics. I don't know if Donald Trump would have made the trip if it weren't in as friendly Trump territory. I mean, this was the way Trump likes it, right, a resounding welcome for him. He's extraordinarily popular there. Kristen noted that his advisers are eager to make him look presidential. It just reminds you of the unprecedented nature of the Trump candidacy. He was president so he actually has been presidential, if you will, with the trappings of the office and all of it before for the country to see. The fact that his advisers think they need to recreate that image for Republican primary voters is interesting insight into where they think things stand.",

But the military is saying that the timing was because of intelligence they received saying that these militants were planning an immediate attack. The Israeli military saying that when they reached the House where the militants were located, a large fire fight broke out as well as ensuing clashes with Palestinians in the area, as we can see from footage from the scene.Now we know of several Palestinians that were killed, six of them have been claimed by militant groups including Hamas and Islamic jihad saying two commanders of theirs were killed. But it's likely based of the ages of at least of the three victims, as well as eyewitnesses, but some bystanders were killed as well. Some videos we're seeing, which I should warn are graphic, show what appears to be men running away down a street before at least one of them is shot and falls down. CNN does not know the condition of the man. The Israeli military says they're looking into the incident to see what happened before the clip begins. Then there is the sheer number of injuries. More than 100 injured, most from live ammunition, according to Palestinian authorities, one of the most violent days in the west bank in years. And that's also likely the result of the timing of this raid, the day, the old city of Nablus was busy. We can see from the videos of the ensuing street clashes of young Palestinians throwing things at the Israeli military vehicles how many people were out on the street. Now, the Red Cross director said, quote, bullets were everywhere, and an Israeli military spokesperson painting a picture of a large chaotic event which he acknowledged got very messy. Now, the Israeli authorities are preparing for some sort of reaction. Israeli police beefing up their security preparations while all eyes are south towards Gaza, in case the militant factions based there, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, may respond with rocket fire towards Israel -- Wolf.",
