I'm Kaitlan Collins, live here in Tel Aviv, alongside my colleague, Pamela Brown, who is in Washington.Israel now has the list of hostages who are supposed to be released tomorrow, and we are just hours away from day two of this expected four-day truce. I should note, we are getting new reporting in now. We are told there are several children who are on that list for tomorrow. Of course, the final group remains to be seen. That is something that we will learn as it happens in real-time, as we did today, with this first group of Hamas-held hostages being back on Israeli soil. What we know is happening right now is they are getting medical treatment across multiple different locations here in Tel Aviv, where they have been reunited with their families. They are also including, at this children's hospital that is right outside of where I'm standing right now, 24 hostages in total, which are 13 Israelis, 10 Thai citizens, one Filipino, all evacuated from Gaza today and released by Hamas after being held there for several weeks. Israel's chief nurse described today's events as emotional, saying there was not a dry eye in the room when five of these hostages were reunited with their families after a very long period of time.",

But you see the handover taking place to the Red Cross. You see one of the Hamas fighters sort of trying to put his arm around a young boy. We believe that is nine-year-old Ohad Munder, who was one of the young children released today. You see another scene in which one of the Hamas militants actually picks up one of the elderly hostages and carries her into the vehicle that's waiting for them.

They talk to us about the fact that they tried to create an ambience and an atmosphere in the specialized unit so that it wouldn't feel like a hospital. It wouldn't feel clinical. It wouldn't feel intimidating or overwhelming. They wanted it to feel, in their own words, like a beautiful hotel. They had put a lot of toys there. And most importantly, they had hand- picked the staff who are the most experienced in dealing with, you know, childhood trauma. They had the top psychiatrists. They had social workers -- a social worker for every single family that was admitted. So, really trying to go above and beyond to be as sensitive as possible and understanding the reality that the trauma is real and that the children who emerge from those helicopters are probably very different children than they were seven weeks ago when they were first taken hostage.   COLLINS:   Yes, it's hard to even think about the road that they have ahead of them. Clarissa Ward, thank you. And, of course, that is just the beginning of this. Israel has now confirmed the identity of these 13 citizens that were released today, obviously, children among them. They are all women and children. They were held for nearly seven weeks. Yaffe Adar is 85 years old. She was the oldest person to be taken hostage on October the 7th. She lived on Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with 11 other hostages that were also released today. That kibbutz saw some of the most severe damage on that day. A fourth of its residents were kidnapped or killed. Margalit Mozes is a 77-year-old mother of three, a grandmother of 10. She's a cancer survivor who also suffers from diabetes. She's been without any kind of medicine for the last several weeks. Also, 79-year-old Hanna Perry, a diabetic and a mother of three. One of her children was murdered on October 7th. Another tonight is still being held by Hamas. Some of the youngest hostages were also among those who were freed today. As you heard Clarissa mentioned there, nine-year-old Ohad Munder, who celebrated his birthday last month while in captivity. He, along with his mother and his grandmother, they were all released today. His grandfather is still believed to be being held by Hamas tonight. It just speaks to what a bittersweet moment this is. Daniel Aloni and her 5-year-old daughter, Amelia, they are now free tonight, back here in Israel. They have been kidnapped alongside four of her other family members who are still in captivity tonight. The last Daniel's family heard from her was a message on WhatsApp that said, quote, \"Help! We are dying.\" Doron Katz-Asher, along with her two daughters, Aviv and Raz, also back in Israel tonight. Her husband last heard from her the day of that attack when she called him to say there were terrorists inside her mother's home. She and her children had been sheltering there. Also, 76-year-old Hanna Katzir, 72-year-old Adina Moshe also among those released today. Many -- a lot of happy news for those families of those hostages who are now back and safe, and being medically- evaluated. I'm joined tonight by IDF Spokesman Major Doron Spielman. Thank you so much for being here, sir. You know, what do we know tonight as these hostages have been reunited with their families, but also taken to these hospitals and these medical centers?

And Israel, unfortunately, knows this area very, very well.When it comes to this, we provide ongoing support, counseling, psychological, financial support.

And therefore, the process has to be done with enormous sensitivity to prepare the family whose relatives are hopefully coming home and also prepare them that, until they're in their hands, nothing is for sure. We do not trust Hamas. As the president of the United States said, Hamas doesn't give a damn about these people. And I quote him, and he's correct. Therefore, we prepare them. Until they're in their hands, we don't know, and we have to support the other families. Also, at the same time, the relatives are not on that list. This is a horrific situation.

They heard they were issued a diktat that any Palestinian expressing joy over the return of these prisoners that that was, in and of itself, a terrorist act because he said, these are terrorists. And therefore, this is a celebration of a terrorist victory. Except when you look through the list, Kaitlan, by the Israeli government's own reckoning, out of the 24 women released and the 15 minors, most of them were detained for extensive periods of time, in some cases, without any charge. Six of them were under administrative detention, which allows Israel to just continue holding Palestinians indefinitely. And of those who were sentenced, there's a lot of concern around how those trials went forward. A young lady, Malak Suleiman, who is from east Jerusalem here, at 16, Israeli officers said they searched her bag and found a knife. She was sentenced to jail for convicted murder. And her parents have spent all these years trying to get this to the Israeli supreme court. Today, when her mother was welcoming Malak home, she could not do it outside.

But so far, even as there are about two dozen hostages who had been released, there were no Americans who were included in that figure. President Biden to that day, said that he was still hopeful that they would be able to get three Americans out that includes two women, as well as four-year-old Abigail Edan, whose parents were killed in the October 7th attack by Hamas. But President Biden was not able to provide any detail on what exactly he believes those Americans would be led out. He said they don't have a list of names. They don't have a timeline just yet. And we are still waiting to hear from the White House tonight whether they have set eyes on that list that was provided to Israel on Friday going into Saturday.

Good to talk to you again tonight, Ambassador. What do you make of just first on the release of these hostages today? What these people are coming home to as so many of them are just now going to be able to find out about, you know, the depths of the horrors on October 7th? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Good to be with you, Kaitlan. Indeed, and I think there's a marked contrast between the release of hostages to Israel and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons. First of all, you're talking about a one-hand hostages, innocent people who are taking separated of the families, in some cases, their families were killed, as opposed to people who were tried as accessories to terrorism or people actually tried to carry out terrorist attacks and released. And, you know, they come home to Palestinian families that are celebrating. Our hostages are coming home to sadness, to -- there's nobody rejoicing. Everyone is relieved that these people have been brought home. But as long as we have 170, 180 hostages remaining in Gaza, no one's going to be rejoicing tonight. And so there's a sense of that relief, but also have great tensions and the trenches are just not of the families of the hostages, it's the families of the state entirely because there's a tremendous risk being taken here. Clearly, Hamas is going to use this time to reorganize, to regroup, to set more booby traps. And we're -- the government is in a position of a one-hand, gaining a life of a hostage but on the other hand risking and perhaps losing a life of soldiers. And that's a grave risk. And also, the long term risk that if this pressures mount on Israel to agree to a longer ceasefire without a hostage release, then it can risk a situation where Hamas wins. Hamas gets away with mass murder. And Israel will not be able to restore its internal security. We have 250,000 people have been removed from their homes, can't go back to their homes, because Hamas has promised if it gets away with that mass murder to try again and again. So it's full of risks, full of tensions. We're very happy these hostages are coming home. But it's far, far from the end.",

But given what you just said, what President Biden said earlier that stood out to me, he said the chances are real based on what he saw today that this pause could turn in to a longer ceasefire, could open the door for that. Do you -- what do you make of that? Is that something that Israel is open to?",

At the end of the day, Hamas is not going to release all the hostages, because that is their ultimate human shield.If Hamas were to lose all the hostages, then we could proceed to, for example, flood the tunnels with sea water. That's what the Egyptians used to do, and do away with Hamas. We can't do that. So Hamas is always going to keep these hostages as its, you know, sort of get out of Gaza free card. And the end could be, I mean, ideally, something similar to what happened in 1982 in Beirut, when the Israeli army laid siege to that city, and the PLO under Yasser Arafat was evacuated from that city on ships. OK, Hamas can go wherever the heck they want to go. They can go to Algeria, then go to Libya, just give us all the hostages back. I think that was a deal that Israelis would accept. But barring that, the army is going to have to proceed with its stated objective of destroying Hamas. [20:40:07]",

Of course we're going to get hostages back. That's a strategic discussion. But the soldiers are at risk. They're still in the middle of Gaza. They are targets --",
