And that was what he was wanted for.He shows up here in Washington D.C. in the last few weeks, according to prosecutors, and he was live streaming. And the way he ends up at the neighborhood where Barack Obama, former president lives is the former President Donald Trump reposted a -- what was purported to be the address of President Obama and Taranto reposts that on his Telegram account, and then says something to the effect of, \"We got these losers surrounded.\" He's also according to the investigators making threats against Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican, and Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin. So, all of this draws a picture of someone who's perhaps a lot disturbed, and so prosecutors want him detained. The judge is wrestling with whether to send him back to be supervised somewhere in Washington State, which is where he is from, where he -- where he was supposed to be living, or whether he should just remain in detention here in Washington, D.C. We'll see what the judge in the end decides. But for now, he remains behind bars.
