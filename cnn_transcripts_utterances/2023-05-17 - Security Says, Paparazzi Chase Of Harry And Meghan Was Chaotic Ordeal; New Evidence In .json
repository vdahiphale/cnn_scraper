We've got the inside story of what happened when Harry and Meghan were chased by paparazzi through the streets of New York last night. The taxi driver who was at the wheel is with us live to explain what Harry and Meghan were saying and doing during that ordeal. Plus, we all remember when Donald Trump claimed he could declassify documents just by thinking about it. Well, we have exclusive reporting tonight on the 16 records that show Trump and his top advisers did know how real declassification works. What does this mean for the ongoing investigation? Our panel is going to take that one on. And the license plates that are too lewd even for New Jersey. We'll show you some clever spellings that try to trick the DMV. But let's begin with what happened to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as they tried to leave a New York event last night. Their security calls it a dangerous game of cat and mouse with paparazzi running red lights and driving into oncoming traffic. A spokesman for the duke and duchess described it as a near catastrophic car chase with multiple near collisions. Of course, we all remember that's how his mother Princess Diana was killed. So, here's what harry told Anderson Cooper in January. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're in a blacked out SUV, you can't really see in there anyway. The object of the game seemed to be to conduct a surveillance that took them back to where they were going so that the paparazzi could stay -- stake that out, you know, camp out there and then be able to follow their every move. So, they were trying to thwart that. And, I mean, that goes literally they go all the way uptown. Can't shake them, they're trying to slow down. They're not running red lights. They're not speeding, but these people are swarming around, blocking the front of the car, driving through red lights into oncoming traffic.

And some of them were just like, you know, there are just things to happen that something from her blog in 2014 that was repeated four times.
