And it's been 24 hours since this country witnessed a former American president placed in grave danger. Twenty- four hours since a bullet was close enough to graze his ear while he campaigned for reelection, the world let alone the nation was holding its collective breath, wondering if this would be the day that so many of our parents and our grandparents, and even ourselves once asked, where were you when.But he is here and ready to accept his party's nomination this very week, just as in the seconds after he emerged and under the weight of Secret Service, shielding not only him but our nation from a terrible and tragic repeat of history. He pumped his fist while exiting his plane just a few hours ago. His team, they say he is doing well. And we're told the CT scan he underwent, it came back clear. But the attempt on his life has cast a long and dark shadow over the convention, the campaign and frankly, the entire nation. President Biden appealed to the nation tonight, imploring America to remember that while we may disagree, we cannot treat each other as enemies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: There is no place in America this kind of violence for any violence ever, period. No exceptions. We can't allow this violence to be normalized. You know, the political record in this country has gotten very heated, it's time to cool it down. We all have responsibility to do that. We stand for an America not of extremism and fury, but a decency and grace. All of us now face a time of testing as the election approaches. And the higher the stakes, the more fervent the passions become. This place is an added burden on each of us to ensure that no matter how strong our convictions was never descend into violence.

One law enforcement officer hoisted himself up, according to the sheriff, to this ledge of the rooftop and was clean to the rooftop when he saw the shooter. According to the sheriff, the shooter saw him and pointed his weapon at the law enforcement officer. But at that point, the officer was not -- he was holding on to the ledge and could not engage the shooter with his weapons so the officer had to drop down for his own safety.

If it were just the attempted assassination of former President Trump, the pressure on the Secret Service would be more than enough.However, tomorrow, the Republican Convention kicks off, followed a few weeks later by the Democratic Convention. These are designated national security events. The Secret Service is the lead agency for the design and implementation of the operational security plans for both conventions, they've got a lot on their plate. But I can tell you that operating under these kinds of pressures is where the Secret Service traditionally excels. I've done conventions myself and I can tell you, they are not a piece of cake.

I have words, and I have brains, and I have emotions, and so I can use all of that to make an argument. That's not what's happening. Obviously, it didn't happen on Saturday. But I do think that JD Vance's comments, the senator from my home state, are not great. They are inappropriate, and they should not have been said, not in the first 24 hours of the attempted assassination, and not ever quite honestly. If we really want to use this moment to turn the page, we need to turn it. We need to -- people need to acknowledge their role that they have played in it.

Thank you so much for being here. What a time we are in, governor. You have been critical of former President Trump in the past. I am very curious to know what your opinion is of how both Trump and Biden have been handling this near tragedy in America. ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think he'd been handling it very well and see it as a moment to reduce harsh rhetoric, and to bring the country together. President Biden first made a very gracious statement, appropriate supportive. The fact that they suspended the -- some campaign activities is consistent with that. And then, I'm just thrilled with Donald Trump and the introspection that I think this serious event in his life has caused. I mean, he could have lost his life. And while he showed determination and vigor at that moment, and, you know, at the same time, I think it caused him to reflect, and I hope so. And this is a moment that with President Biden's calmness, and now with President Trump rewriting his speech, it's an opportunity to really showcase positive things about our country, and to diminish the harsh rhetoric. When you think about it, Democrats are saying Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy. Republicans are saying reelecting Joe Biden will be the end of Western civilization. And so, people interpret these words in different ways.

But for some reason, I didn't feel fear. Like I just knew they weren't aimed at me. And I kind of maintain my composure, right? I saw Trump go down, you know, the first few shots. And I was scared, but then when I saw him come back up with the Secret Service and he raised his hands, raised his fist, and all of a sudden the crowd just went crazy, like USA, USA, USA. It was just static, li , everybody was just -- I just -- in unison just felt incredible, I think. But there was still some people who just could not be consoled at the same time, you know? They would just got to the point where they were just sobbing, and weeping and could not be brought out of that. So I would say the emotions ran from zero to 10.

Speaking tonight, Biden says there's no place for violence in politics, but a handful of Republicans blame the shooting on Trump's critics. Ohio senator and Trump vice presidential hopeful JD Vance went a step further than that, saying that Biden's rhetoric calling Trump a threat to democracy led to the attempted assassination. Georgia Congressman Mike Collins suggesting Biden ordered the shooting and calling for local prosecutors to indict Biden for \"inciting and assassination.\" Now, there is zero evidence that President Biden was involved, but it is an example of the heated discourse once again infecting our body politic, even after an assassination attempt.Well, joining me now is someone who's all too familiar with political violence, former Capitol officer -- Capitol Hill Officer Harry Dunn who protected the Capitol on January 6. He has also been a Biden campaign surrogate. Harry, my friend, good to see you this evening. But, my goodness, just having to resuscitate -- recite, excuse me, what was just said in different camps about the conspiracy theories and beyond. I mean, you're somebody who is no stranger to this. You have survived the assault on the Capitol on January 6. And so, a lot of this must be quite triggering to hear politicized reactions to something that maybe would have had a universalizing effect. What is your reaction when you heard the news of a shooting attempt, an assassination of the former president?",

They were there with violent intent at the behest of, you know, the president, the former president.So anybody right now, like it's so frustrating to hear the rhetoric that's going. Anybody from any party attempting to score political points in a moment like this, but we need to -- yes, we do need to take the temperature down as so many people have said, that temperature needs to come way down. Because, you know, sure, we -- people have talked about just the grace of God, that the former president is still with us. You know, what if it's not so lucky next time or what not even just the former president, like I said, we lost a dedicated public servant to this country. So people's lives are being changed. And, you know, I've always fought for accountability since January 6. And, you know, with the Supreme Court, you know, issuing their ruling, it's clear that we have to do it at the ballot box and not on, you know, on a battlefield like President Biden said earlier tonight.",

It has been a heightened temperature.So they're not expecting what has happened this past weekend, but how do you course correct air your grievances about both believing that the other is legitimate threat to democracy?

Somebody attempted to assassinate the former president, that happened. Also, the president summit a mob to attack the Capitol on January 6 on his behalf. Until you have people acknowledging on both sides that those two things happen then, you know, you can't really be you how realistic and honest are you being with yourself that you want to take the political -- the temperature down, so to speak, because you're not even being honest about what happened that day. Until this day, even now, you know, there's referring to January 6 as a peaceful protest that maybe got out of hand. That's not what happened that day. And until we're being honest about what happened, I am all for bringing the temperature down.

And there are people who have conversations that are not very helpful right now. I think I want to know why these folks are behaving in that way, and why we aren't able to have a conversation about facts and about honesty, because I think, Joe Biden's point is like, we don't want to go down that road. But we're not even going down the same road right now. People are on one side of the street, and someone's on a whole different road, going down another side of the street. And it's not like we're even going to find a way to read, to have an intersection, to have a crossroads, because we're going in such opposite directions. And so, the only way that I think this intervention can happen, even with the truth telling of like, I don't like your policy, I don't like your policy, is that someone who has to say, stop and say, hey, I think we're going in the wrong direction. Let me tell you why, and let's have this conversation. And we get back. But right now, it's like we're talking past each other.
