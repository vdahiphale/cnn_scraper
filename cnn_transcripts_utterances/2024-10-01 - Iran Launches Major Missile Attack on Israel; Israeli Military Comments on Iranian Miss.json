      "sentences": "Beirut. So, people here, at least in those parts of Beirut clearly taking some solace in the fact that Israel's being hit. Keeping in mind that it's been -- it was just two weeks ago today that those pagers started to go off in Beirut, the next day, the walkie-talkies and certainly over the last eight days, what we've seen is what amounts to a full-scale war between Hezbollah and Israel.And it's also important to note that Iran in its -- putting out its statement in the aftermath of these strikes on Israel said that it was in retaliation for 31st of July assassination of Ismail Haniyeh; the head of Hamas' political bureau, assassinated in the heart of the Iranian capital Tehran. And then of course, last Friday, Hassan Nasrallah killed in the southern suburbs of Beirut in that massive blast. And also a senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps also killed in that strike. But stepping back and looking broadly at the situation, I think we are at that tipping point that so many people feared a real regional war. I was here in April when you had more than 300 Iranian missiles and drones fired at Israel, but that was such an orchestrated telegraphed event, and Israel barely retaliated, and I think just one missile on some obscure target in Iran. But given the size of the Iranian strikes on Israel this evening, the broad nature of how many of those missiles were fired across Israel. I fear it's inevitable. There is going to be a significant Israeli response on Iran, and therefore, you get into a situation where we could easily find the region, the Middle East engulfed in that regional war that so many people feared.

And Israel got help from the U.K. and other countries as well in that region, some 300 missiles and drones and rockets were fired towards Israel, but the Iron Dome and Israel's other anti-ballistic missile system worked and destroyed most of them, causing very limited damage in Israel.

And I think the question here is, do they target Iran's nuclear capabilities? What does that look like in the aftermath? Because that could really shape the future of this war in this region.",

Israel has other capabilities.We have submarines, we have -- we have long-range missiles that we haven't used yet in these -- in these conflicts. So, there's a range of -- there's a spectrum of possibilities that Israel can do, and I think that Israel has to respond in a very forceful way because again, that goes to the very DNA of the country. The big question, Wolf, is what will be America's position here? I was in the White House recently, I asked very pointedly, it's the United States willing to put teeth into don't? Remember, the President said, \"don't\" to Iran and to Hezbollah. They did. And now, is the United States willing to adopt a posture that's not just defensive, but offensive? Were the United States to do that, I strongly believe it would be a game-changer in the Middle East and a game-changer in the world.",

And Israel is not going to be able to agree to any ceasefire, it wasn't going to agree to a ceasefire even before this, the 21-day ceasefire that was requested by the administration and by the French, was a nonstarter in the state of Israel because that ceasefire would have benefited only Hezbollah, giving it a chance to regroup and re-arm.Unless that ceasefire came with agreements with the United States, the United States would support Israel wholeheartedly should Hezbollah break the ceasefire and not implode -- and not retroactively implement resolutions 1701 from 2006. And that is to withdraw north of Litani River about 20 miles from our border. But now, with the Iranian shelling of Israel -- and my family, my grandkids are all in bomb shelters now as I'm speaking to you, there are huge explosions in my neighborhood and a major terrorist attack as Jim reported a little while ago on CNN, a major telegraph in my neighborhood, literally down the street, eight people killed. Israel is going to have to respond, and again, there will be a spectrum of possibilities. The big question, again, will the United States just act in a passive way and help Israel to take down these rockets? And I think we'll find out shortly that United States military assets in the Middle East were very active in intercepting these rockets. But is the United States willing to say to the Iranians, you shoot at our ally, the way you've shot at our ally and you're going to pay a prohibitive price, because up to this point, the Iranians haven't paid a price. They've fired at American bases in the Middle East some 200 times. They've wounded dozens of American service people, killed three, and Iran to this point hasn't paid a price. Here's an opportunity to change the rules of the game so the Iranians will know in an unequivocal way, that if they destabilize and bring it to the Middle East and bring violence to so many people, they are responsible for literally hundreds of thousands of deaths, and many hundreds of American deaths. That there will be a very painful price to pay.",

And I want to bring in CNN's Alex Marquardt, because Alex, it was just days ago that Prime Minister Netanyahu was here in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. He delivered a speech and there was a line that day that stood out, but even more so now, where he said it was a warning to Iran, a very frank one.He said, \"if you strike us, we will strike you. There's no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach.\" And Alex, you and I went to a briefing with senior Israeli officials talking about the very prospects of what the next steps of this war could look like, especially as we were on the verge of getting confirmation that the leader of Hezbollah had been killed in a targeted strike by Israel.",

And then clearly, Israel showed that it had no intention of abiding by that ceasefire, they did not agree to it.And just a couple of hours later, we got confirmation that Hassan Nasrallah had been killed. The U.S. has made clear that they did not want Israel to go into the ground in Lebanon and further inflame the situation. So, I think I can answer that question that Ambassador Michael Oren was just posing about whether the U.S. will take a more offensive stance. I think the U.S. has shown zero willingness, and has no desire to engage proactively, militarily with the Iranian regime. And I think there are a lot of officials in this town who would take issue with his characterization that what the U.S. is doing right now is passive. In fact, what we're told is that the U.S., it has been very actively involved tonight in this aerial defense of Israel as they were back on April 13th. And so, right now, Kaitlan, we have to get a sense of what it was that Iran has fired at Israel and what the destruction, what the results have been. I'm also told Kaitlan that in terms of this defense of Israel, the Jordanians have been actively involved with their Air Force in terms of shooting down many of these missiles. So, we're starting to get a sense of what this collective defense of Israel has looked like tonight, and as we know so far from the Israelis, there have been no deaths and no injuries. And therefore, the question will then be, what are -- what is that Israeli response going to be? We heard the Israeli say that there will be consequences. You can imagine the U.S. is going to be pressuring them to not escalate and to not respond in a way that will further inflame things, Kaitlan.",
