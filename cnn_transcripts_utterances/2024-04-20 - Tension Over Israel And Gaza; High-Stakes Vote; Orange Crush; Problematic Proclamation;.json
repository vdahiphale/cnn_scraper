Let's start it right now.Well, first of all, there are really not too many days that we can say Congress is getting ready to cast to a consequential vote especially not on a Saturday morning. Yet today, it will happen. Next hour, the House gavels in to start debate on foreign aid funding, aid to Israel in particular is the focus of some passionate debate across the country. Even how people debate it is up for debate. This week, we saw calls for crackdown on protesters who blocked traffic. Look at this, this is what we saw at the Golden Gate Bridge. After her social media posts were targeted by pro-Israel activist, USC canceled a speech by its Muslim valedictorian. The school said it was concerned for safety. And now USC says it's also canceling attendance of its outside speakers and honorees. There have been pro-Palestinian protests on campus also at Yale and Columbia, where students have been camping out and getting arrested. Another form of protest though is the vote. Aid to Israel is ultimately expected to pass when the House votes on it today, but some members want to send a message by voting no. And that includes my first guest this morning. We, first, spoke with her when she became the first Jewish member of the House to call for a ceasefire in November. Today, she plans to vote no on sending weapons to Israel. Democratic Representative Becca Balint is joining us. She represents a district in Vermont. Thank you so much for joining me. Let's start with why, why are you a no on this Israel aid funding? REP. BECCA BALINT (D-VT): As you said yourself, it's clear that this is going to pass. So this vote is really about sending a message that we understand that if we continue to send offensive weapons to this extremist government, to Netanyahu, it's essentially sending a green light for an invasion of Rafah and to continue this devastating, devastating war in Gaza. And I believe a no vote is indicative of where most Americans are right now. They want a safe and secure Israel. They want us to make sure that we are also putting a check on Netanyahu's ability to wage this horrible war and to escalate tensions with Iran. So I know it will pass, but I do believe this is a moment for those of us who do support Israel, who do believe we need to have a sovereign Jewish state, to also stand up and say we have a role to play as the United States of America, in how those weapons, whether they're offensive or defensive weapons are used.",

And so, I want to be just really clear, sometimes it is used in an anti-Semitic way and sometimes it is used in an Islamophobic way. And so, I condemn the use by extremists on both sides.

And they will use that as part of your debt to income ratio. Or now what's really exciting is that if your payments shows that it's $100, because maybe you're on the new safe plan, which is a new plan given by the Biden the administration that's really affordable. It's that the interest accruing each month, you can use that number now to buy a home.
