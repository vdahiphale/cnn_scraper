It compels every state to allow gay marriage if done in another state even perhaps at a moment it comes when certain laws are shifted. And that state may try and ban gay marriage. That's one part of it. The other is, it repeals the Defense of Marriage Act. It's not something that's been focused on much, but it's still technically on the books even in the wake of the Supreme Court decision that directs the federal government to recognize any same-sex marriage from here going forward. The symbolism though is enormous, and you can see it on the south lawn right now. Thousands of people marking this moment, particularly in the wake of some of the Supreme Court decisions that raised questions about the future of the Obergefell decision back in 2015.

But everything is relative and this is another step in the right direction. This is actually the fifth month in a row where annual inflation has cooled off. It's the lowest level for this reading all year. You have to go back to last December. If you dig into the numbers, there are some good signs. Core inflation which strips out food and energy increased by the smallest amount in 15 months. We saw price declines for airfare, used cars, medical care. Energy prices -- they also cooled up. All of that good news. I do think we have to be careful not to declare victory too early here, right? There have been head fakes along the way. Inflation has been very stubborn. Seven percent inflation is still 7 percent inflation. But hopefully, this trend continues because that would bring real relief to families.

Parts of manufacturing are already in recession. Services are doing just fine. And United is doing just fine because people are wanting to travel.

We found that in two-thirds of federal prisons that have housed women in the last decade, there has been sexual assault of female inmates by employees of the federal bureau of prisons. Some of the details particularly shocking. At FCI Dublin in California, the warden and the chaplain were both sexually assaulting inmates. At FCC Coleman in Florida, multiple BOP employees using multiple women over a sustained period. No one was prosecuted.

It used to be a hard no when it came to Patriot missiles and then it was worth considering and now we expect imminent approval, according to U.S. officials, a patriot missiles to Ukraine.Part of the challenge with Patriots is the number of soldiers required. Patriot missile batteries required dozens of soldiers, if not 100 soldiers to properly operate a battery. And the complex systems require months of training. So, that was part of the reason the administration decided against it earlier. But now, it's obvious this war will continue and because of those attacks on civilian and energy infrastructure in part of Russia that you just mentioned, that seems to have tipped the scale in favor of sending Patriot missiles to Ukraine. Now, there is still months of training ahead and this will be a process. As you look at the U.S. has provided so far, Patriot missiles will provide a longer range option, on top of the NASAMS and shorter range that the U.S. has already provided.",

That's not been a challenge. It's how much can they compress the training to make that work. This is normally months of training.Ukraine has shown an ability for its soldiers and its service members to learn U.S. systems, complex systems very quickly, but I suspect we are about to find out how much you can shorten the timeline on a complex aerial defense system.",

And they are putting more soldiers up there at a time when Ukraine needs resources as they fight intensely on the front lines to the east and down across from Kherson, the liberal liberated city to the south.But up in the north on the Belarusian side, there are joint combat drills that were happening as recently as last week between the Belarusian army and the Russian army. Now, of course, these two are very economically and militarily close. They actually are formally part of the union state. And yet, Belarus had said before the beginning of the war that they weren't going to get involved. They did allow Russians to invade across their border in February. And now, at least three Belarusian regions, the number of Russian troops is growing day-by-day. Now the question is whether this is some sort of an event to stage, try to distract Ukraine and pull them away from other areas, hotspots where they need resources, or if Russia is indeed trying to drive across the border once they -- once the deep freeze hits -- the Ukrainians have a very different surprise, not much of a surprise, they brought us, waiting for the potential invaders. They have land mines throughout the forest. They have rigged bridges with explosives. They have trenches that are staffed 24/7 keeping an eye on the horizon ready for whatever comes down the road, Jake.",

You know, Russia has been relentlessly attacking the power grids across this country.Even here in Kyiv, earlier today the air raid sirens went off. In the end, it turned out to be a false alarm. Russian bombers were spotted in the area with a kind of missiles that Ukrainians cannot shoot down. As of now, that's why it is patriot missile defense system uses so welcome in the Ukrainian capital, Jake.",
