In France and beyond, many are trying to process the astonishing mass rape trial that resulted in guilty verdicts across the board.But fears also that justice was not served. The survivor at the center of the case has been called an inspiration for going public with the atrocities that she endured and forcing France to reckon with gender-based violence in a way that it simply hasn't before. Melissa Bell has a look at the trial's takeaways. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gisele Pelicot was determined that the shame should not be hers. Waiving her anonymity and, with it, that of her rapists. \"Rapists, we see you,\" shouted the crowd outside as inside, Dominique Pelicot received the maximum sentence of 20 years for the drugging and mass rape of his then-wife, Giselle, over nearly a decade. Outside the court, there was anger that the 50 other men on trial alongside him had not received the maximum sentences sought by prosecutors. But as she left the court, Gisele Pelicot made no comment on the verdicts. GISELE PELICOT, SURVIVOR (through translator): I have faith now in our capacity to carve out collectively a future where everyone, women and men, can live in harmony, in respect, and mutual understanding. BELL (voice-over): A stark contrast to the brutality of a trial that saw the violent rapes of an unconscious Gisele Pelicot shown in court day after day. Through the videos shot by her then-husband of more than 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, unmasked by chance in 2020 when a guard caught him filming up women's skirts in a supermarket.",
