The attorney general saying it could constitute a death threat. This as Trump and Harris at this moment going head to head in Wisconsin, as you see on your screen. And tonight, a CNN investigation, the Supreme Court ordering 1,600 people purged from Virginias voter rolls. The problem is, is that included U.S. citizens who do have every right to vote. Plus a fake ad showing a Haitian immigrant voting repeatedly for Harris. It's still on X tonight, Elon Musk's social media site, even as the Georgia secretary of state has demanded it be taken down. The Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger will be OUTFRONT. Let's go OUTFRONT And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT on this Friday, the breaking news. Trump's comment about Liz Cheney now under investigation as a possible death threat. The attorney general of Arizona saying she's investigating whether Trump's comment, quote qualifies as a death threat under Arizona law. Well, this is as the final fight for the battleground states is underway tonight. And tonight, the candidates in Wisconsin, Harris and Trump, both holding rallies around Milwaukee this hour. Right now, Harris just took the stage at another rally further north in Wisconsin. You see her there live and then going to be heading down to Milwaukee as new polling in the state shows a slight edge for the vice president. This is a new poll out of Marist. It shows Harris with 50 to Trump's 48 in Wisconsin. Polling tilting towards Harris in Michigan as well, three points spread there. You're still in margin of error here. But these are all going now in the direction of Harris within that margin of error. That's Michigan. And in perhaps the most crucial of the blue wall states for the Democrats, Pennsylvania. That has Harris and the Marist poll up by two, 50 to 48. And that led Trump today to do something he almost never does, which is to defend the comments he made about the former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who, of course, has endorsed Harris and appeared on stage with her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrel shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face. You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh, gee, well, let's send -- let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. But she's a stupid person. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She is on that campaign trail tonight in Wisconsin, the battleground state just outside of Milwaukee, which is where Harris is taking the stage later tonight. So, M.J., what is the latest you're learning from the Harris campaign tonight?M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erin, the Harris campaign continues to see this as a very close race where the outcome could really end up coming down to the margins in just a handful of states. But in these final days, we are starting to see some bullishness starting to creep in from the Harris campaign particularly when it comes to the voters who have already voted and specifically the voters who they say only recently made up their minds in a number of these battleground states and in particular, campaign officials are pointing to some of the offensive and incendiary comments coming from Donald Trump and some of his surrogates, some of which you refer to in that intro there and saying that undecided voters simply do not like what they are hearing. Now, if we are starting to see a little bit of those bursts of optimism from the Harris campaign, that does not mean, Erin, that Vice President Kamala Harris herself is anywhere close to predicting victory. And in fact, we have new reporting that gives us a little bit of a window into her frame of mind in this final stretch. I'm told by multiple sources that one thing that the vice president has been clear she will not discuss even in private with her team, is the question of who might serve in a future Harris cabinet or administration. The vice president herself has said, described herself as being a little bit superstitious, and I am told that superstition is definitely a bit at play here. That's not uncommon for politicians, but I do think all of this adds up to, I think, a picture of a campaign that is not willing to take anything for granted. And number one proof of that tonight is the fact that the vice president is second time in two days -- Erin.",

Those undecided voters, they say, are there going that way. If that's the case and we know them to be 1 to 3 percent in these, these states where if the polls are right, that's the margin of victory.

They look at early vote numbers in these -- in these blue wall states. They feel good about that the gender, the gender composition of that early vote registration in Wisconsin you can register right up to election day, the registration. So they're looking at all of these things, but I don't talk to anybody who says, we got this thing. I just think they think that it is moving in a way that may be favorable to them.",

I want to go now to the Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.So, Senator, you hear Rene talking to that woman in Virginia who was purged from the voter rolls, even though she is a citizen, she is eligible to vote. Now, Rene did lay out that. And there are loops but she can still register. She can still vote, according to Virginia law, so she would be able to vote. The people on that list who are not citizens would not. Do you think that this is a situation that is ending in a fair way, or no? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): What we see across the country is that Republicans are making it difficult for legal -- legal voters to vote. We know that it is illegal for people who are not citizens to vote, and that is a crime. But when they start kicking people off the rolls who are actually legal as the people that the CNN reporters talked to, that is a major problem. Fortunately in Virginia, people can register. But of course they don't know exactly where they kicked off, were they not? And they're going to have to go and check, hopefully, by going there early, that's better off for them. Not on the same day, even though they can do it on the same day. Let us make that clear. But they can actually register. So I hope all those people who find out and go right away to their polling places or their early voting places, and make sure that they're registered. But this is the Pennsylvania story actually similar thing in that these people were simply this is about envelopes. They were simply when people have an envelope issue, of which envelope did they use? They were simply allowing them to make good on that so they could still vote ahead of time. And the Pennsylvania court said, of course they should be able to do that. This ruling went a good way, and that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Pennsylvania to keep curing these envelope issues. But this all started with a Republican suit. So what you're seeing with the Kamala Harris surging in the polls, as you guys just pointed out in places like Wisconsin, Michigan and now Pennsylvania, Donald Trump is back to his old games. He is doing everything to try to suppress the vote and then seed misinformation, so that afterwards, if and when he loses, he's going to claim its not fair and everyone has to be on their A-game to make sure that people know that they can still legally vote and go to vote.",

If you've ever been to the horse track in the two minutes before the race goes off is when you get all the betting that goes on -- well, that's the way that these markets work too.In the couple of days, or even Tuesday morning of election day, you'll get a surge of money because then the outcome is known later that day, or maybe in the next day or two. People are not going to bet this in February and hold it for nine months, waiting for the election. They're going to bet it the day of. And they're also very good because they give you a way to summarize because that's what I think they are. They are just the summary of all the information we know into one number. So on Election Day, they're going to be very volatile. They usually are. They could move 30 or 50 points as opposed to 2 or 3 points, which is what were comfortable with.

It'll tell you if one candidate goes up or the other candidate goes down. That'll be the summation of what we think it means. BURNETT: And, obviously, if anyone you know, watching, if you think they're wrong right now on sort of you said coin toss but advantage Trump they think Harris you go in on that if you're right you can make a lot of money. It depends. Now there's been some talk quickly before we go, Jim, that these markets are being manipulated. Few big players are trying to get the outcome they want.
