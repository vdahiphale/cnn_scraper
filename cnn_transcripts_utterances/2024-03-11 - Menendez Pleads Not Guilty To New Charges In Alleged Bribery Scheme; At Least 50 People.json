It was a loan for that money that they received to buy that brand new Mercedes. Prosecutors saying that was simply not true. Also alleging in the superseding indictment that they lied basically to their former attorneys and that those attorneys, then in turn, in meetings with U.S. attorneys, made misleading statements. Now, again, the Senator and his wife, in addition to the two other defendants, have denied all of the allegations. The Senator saying this is just the government trying to go after him. Saying in a statement, \"It says that the prosecutors are afraid of the facts, scared to subject their charges to the fair-minded scrutiny of a jury. It says, once and for all, that they will stop at nothing in their zeal to get at me.\" Now, this trial had been scared scheduled for May 6th. And there was some question with a superseding indictment, if that would somehow be delayed, but the trial is still set for May 6th -- Boris?",

Thank you for going through this with us. Co-defendant, Jose Uribe, flipped just before this superseding indictment came down in a court. And according to \"The New York Times,\" Jennifer, Uribe says he agreed to lie to investigators and to his own lawyer after he spoke to Nadine Menendez to say that the Mercedes payments that were made for her were actually a loan rather than a gift, which could obviously be seen as a bribe. And Menendez and his wife, according to prosecutors, then lied to their own attorneys and, in turn, the court, as you saw there. How problematic is this for the Senator and Nadine Menendez?",

      "sentences": "Yes. This is a game changer, Brianna. Now they have a cooperating witness who was part of the scheme itself.So he will have given them a lot of information about how the scheme worked. That's why we so additional substantive charges coming into the new indictment. But he also gives them something else, the obstruction of justice part, the part where, after they all realized they were under investigation, they tried to cover it up by pretending that bribes were actually loans. And that's so critical when you go to trial because jurors understand inherently the coverup, right? They understand getting caught with something, trying to make it seem like you didn't do what you did. And so that's a really, really powerful tool that prosecutors use, both in a separate charge, like they have here, an obstruction of justice charge. But it also goes to consciousness of guilt for the underlying offenses as well. So Jose Uribe flipping and now testifying at trial, as he will for the government, is a huge, huge benefit for government here.",

They show all of these communications, many of which were with the Senator's wife, Nadine Menendez.And then they have calls to and from Nadine Menendez and her husband. But you also have to expect that some of their communications were not over the phone, right? They would have been in person. So what you see is you see these communications among the other co- conspirators and then you can assume communication from Nadine Menendez to her husband because you then see Senator Menendez doing basically what Nadine Menendez and the others were talking about. So it's not as directly implicating him in some of these instances, but there's plenty of ways with circumstantial evidence that you can piece it together. And frankly, plenty of evidence of Senator Menendez himself being in these meetings and having communications with the other co- conspirators. So the proof is very, very strong here.",

So that's good. I think there are enough eyes on him at this point that it's not a huge national security risk. But I do think that one of the things prosecutors do when they face this kind of case is try to perhaps craft a resolution, a plea agreement that includes a resignation. And that's for that reason, right? We don't want people in these positions of public trust who have violated that trust in the way that Menendez is accused of doing. So, well see if he's amenable to any plea discussions at all that involve resignation. So far, he's been very defiant and says that he's going to see it through to trial. So we'll see about that.",

      "sentences": "Well, passengers were describing this drop. But there's a bit of a mystery as to why this occurred. It sounds like a severe turbulence incident.Although there was a really interesting statement here from Latam. And I want to read you that. It says, \"This was a technical event during the flight that caused a strong movement of the plane.\" \"Technical event\" leaves a lot of room for interpretation. And investigators will want to know if something happened in the cockpit. Was this an issue with the flight controls? Was this an issue with the autopilot? So a Boeing 787, not a 737 Max, like during the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout two months ago. But even still, Boeing says it's working together more information about this incident and it's standing by to support an investigation. This plane was going on to Santiago, Chile. And the latest data from FlightAware shows it now remains in Auckland. The flight that continued was canceled. That's where first responders treated 50 people in total who were on board this flight, 12 taken to the hospital, one patient in serious condition. Technical event or not, passengers are describing this like a severe turbulence incident. And one telling Radio New Zealand blood was on the ceiling and people flew and broke the ceiling of the plane. Turbulence can be caused by weather, like up and down drafts from thunderstorms, sometimes wind shear, where there are two columns or rows of air moving at different speeds. But turbulence can also be triggered by no weather phenomenon at all, called clear air turbulence, meaning it's invisible to pilots. Airlines have gotten a lot better at forecasting turbulence, but the National Transportation Safety Board says turbulence is the number-one cause of injuries on commercial flights here in the U.S.",

This was at 41,000 feet, the cruising altitude of the flight. This is typically a time when people are up, milling around through the cabin, going to the bathroom, their service taking place. So this is a really good time to just reinforce the folks, keep your seatbelt on. These turbulence incidents, if this was ultimately that, can sneak up at any moment.",

Some people called it boring, but others enjoyed the pacing of the show. And the fact that it wasn't mean-spirited. It was more fun. We paid tribute to the actors and people who make movies. And that was important. And when people call it boring, I think part of that is it's the nominees and who wins. And since \"Oppenheimer\" basically ran the board, won seven of 13 nominations, that can make it boring. When you take the suspense out of who's going to win, well, that slows the show down, or at least takes some of the excitement out. But Jimmy Kimmel did a fabulous job.",

That caused a big problem because they didn't have a chance to stop, talk about their movies or their projects, their outfits, and different things and interact with the press. They just barely got in the building. But I do also believe that the earlier starting time let the show breathe. And you saw the pacing in the different skits that they added were beautiful. And it also allowed them to add things, like bringing back all the nominees or the past winners to talk about the nominees in the acting categories. I thought that was beautiful. It gave the nominees kind of their flowers.
