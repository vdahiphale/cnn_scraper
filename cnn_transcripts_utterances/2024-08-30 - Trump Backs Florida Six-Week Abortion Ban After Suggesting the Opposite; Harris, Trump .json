So, let's get right to what America is talking about. Where exactly does Donald Trump stand on abortion? The answer would depend on whether you asked him yesterday or today. For example, right now, his home state, Florida, has a six-week abortion ban. Last night, he was asked about a ballot measure that would amend the law and give women up to 24 weeks to make that decision. Here's how he answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Mike, I want to talk to you because obviously you've worked with the Trump White House. So, you were there at the time when they had really solidified support from the anti-abortion activist movement, aimed at the backs of that movement. So, do you see a shift? MIKE DUBKE, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Do I see a shift in the president's position? No. This has never been an issue that he has wanted to discuss outside, really outside of talking about the three Supreme Court justices that he appointed. My issue with this, frankly, from right now, and I think the reason we're talking about it tonight, is because there are these perceived shifts in his answer. And the enthusiasm on this issue has shifted from the pro-life to the pro-choice movements because of the decision on overturning Roe.

Now, Mahomes is the teammate of Taylor's boyfriend, Travis Kelsey. So, of course, he cares about Taylor's. reputation, especially since she's BFF with the wife, Brittany.It's worth noting that Taylor typically says that she is a student of Aristotle, but clearly, she, too, knows how to ball. Young girls and women very excited by the fact that Taylor has invited them into the game of football. And when the Chiefs won the Super Bowl last year, which was really hard as a 49ers fan, really hard, Taylor proved that she not only loves the players, she loves the game. So, will she be criticized? Yes, but I think she will shake it off, all of that criticism. She's her own mastermind, and I doubt that coming up with football plays is her endgame. And she will prove that if she were the man, she'd be the man.",
