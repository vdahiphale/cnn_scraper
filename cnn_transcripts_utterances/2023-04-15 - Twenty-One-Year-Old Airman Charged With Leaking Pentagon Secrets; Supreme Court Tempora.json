And we begin this hour with new details in the case against a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman. He's accused of leaking top secret Pentagon information. Jack Teixeira appeared in court yesterday and was charged under the Espionage Act. His arrest follows an intense week-long search for the source of the online leak of secret documents. Teixeira held a top-secret security clearance and is accused of posting documents that exposed sensitive intelligence the U.S. has on both close allies and adversaries. CNN Senior National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt is joining us live from Washington right now. Alex, what more are you learning about Teixeira and, you know, learning about him and then how he was able to print off these documents?",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Fredricka. Well, the question of printing is a very good one, whether he himself printed these top-secret documents or he was able to obtain top secret documents. What we do know now is that he posted them online. In fact, he started posting classified information back in December, that was just text. And then that evolved into these photos of these classified documents, both secret and top secret.And we understand that there were hundreds of them that were posted on online months before these really came to light in the public. That was back on April 6 when the Secretary of Defense got his first briefing. And then, just a week later, Airman First Class Jack Teixeira was arrested at his -- at his family home just south of Boston. Now he is of a fairly low rank, he has been in the military since 2019. And he's had this top-secret security clearance for the past two years. And the reason, Fredricka that he has this clearance is that he works at what is called the 102nd Intelligence Operations Wing. That is a military outfit that prepares intelligence products for senior military commanders around the world. And Teixeira is a -- an I.T. specialist. His technical title is a cyber defense operations journeyman. But he's a specialized I.T. person who works on these highly classified networks. That is simply why he had access to these documents. So now investigators are certainly going to be asking him what at -- what documents he accessed and put online. They can certainly go through his computer. We know that they have started doing that. They are going to be looking at printer logs to figure out whether he did in fact print off some of these documents. But this raises much bigger questions as well about this concept of need to know which really governs the intelligence community and who can access these kinds of documents, Fredricka.",

He has said that the court will ultimately rule Wednesday by midnight. And this does not at all forecast how they will cast their final votes. It's just meant to put things on freeze to give them more time to get ready and the Biden administration and the manufacturers of this drug argued that the lower court got it wrong in restricting access. They say if the lower court opinion is allowed to stand labeling on the drug jug will change. For instance, women will only be able to access it up to seven weeks of pregnancy instead of 10 weeks.Women would have to come in and have it administrated in person instead of being able to get it by mail. This will make abortion access more difficult. The Justice Department says, unless the Supreme Court steps in. They want the justices to either freeze the lower court opinion for now permanently while the appeals process plays out below. Or alternatively, they want the justices themselves to bypass the lower courts. Take up this issue themselves and render a decision by the end of June. Abortion medication continues to be used by a majority of women seeking abortions today. The Supreme Court is going to consider a couple of things that look at whether the doctors have the legal right to be in court. They'll look at the scope of the FDA's authority in this area. It all comes of course, as it's been less than a year since the High Court reversed Roe v. Wade.

And then will transport them in a graph that you're about to see that's been provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Will then transport them to Mexico to secret labs where they typically are then cut down into powder, pills. From those labs, the cartels move that fentanyl into the United States where it's sold wholesale.

Closing transportation hubs, schools and government offices and completely submerging streets and access points. Over two feet or a month's worth of rain fell in about an hour on Wednesday closing down the airport, in fact in Fort Lauderdale for multiple hours stretching over a couple of days and then trapping frustrated travelers inside in fact.It has since reopened and cleanup is underway. And there's a clear picture emerging of how the climate crisis is not just a matter of getting warmer or colder. The reality is we now live in a series of extremes. CNN's Bill Weir shows us how one critical spot in California went from nearly bone dry to drowning. BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In California Central Valley farmers have spent much of the last 20 years praying for rain. But then came this winter of relentless rivers in the sky, enough to bring a long dead lake back to life and drought over 150 square miles of farmland and counting. So now, they pray for the water to stop. WEIR (on camera): It is mind blowing to realize that if you'd stood here for the last couple of generations, you'd be watching the sunset over dusty fields of cotton or alfalfa or pistachio of trees. And now it is waterfront property. I had no idea Tulare Lake was once the biggest freshwater body west of the Mississippi but it was dammed and dived and drained to build a $2-billion-dollar agriculture industry. And now it's back. It's proof that water never forgets. And this may just be the beginning because behind those clouds over there, the Sierra Nevadas are so packed with snow. 260 percent above normal and sooner or later that's going to melt which is only going to make this flooding worse and last longer. WEIR (voice over): The last time it flooded this dramatically here was 1983. And it took two years to dry out. WEIR (on camera): You were telling me about the effects in '83.",

Federal prosecutors have told the family of Shanquella Robinson, they don't have enough evidence to file charges in the case. The 25-year-old died in October while staying at a luxury rental property in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. video posted online appeared to show a physical altercation inside a room between Robinson and another person.But it's not clear when that video was taken or if the video depicts the moment that she suffered a fatal injury. The death certificate classified her death as accidental or violent. Joining me right now is Sallamondra Robinson. She is the mother of Shanquella Robinson. And Quilla Long, Shanquella's sister. And also with us, Sue Ann Robinson. She is the attorney for the family. Thanks to all of you for joining me but my deepest condolences on the loss of your daughter, your sister. I mean, this is heartbreaking. And this was last October. I'm -- I am almost confident that this feels still so very fresh. So, I wonder if you could give me an idea on Sallamondra, what -- what did investigators tell you when they said there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges? Did they say what was missing in order for them to proceed further on investigating her death?",

And of course, CNN cannot verify the names that you're sharing, we have not been privy to the names of the people involved, or the identities and the video, but we appreciate, you know, your point of view here. So, I wonder, you know, Sue Ann, you are not happy with how this is going?I mean, that investigators say they can't go any further. And you're hearing from Quilla here, who talks about, you know, being able to identify the people in the video with her sister. Why isn't there enough in your view? SUE-ANN ROBINSON, ATTORNEY FOR SHANQUELLA ROBINSON'S FAMILY: Well, there isn't enough because the investigation was delayed. The FBI unfortunately dropped the ball and did not take the case serious from its initiation from when the family first reached out and started saying we're having a problem. So, they started investigating and becoming involved and preparing a secondary autopsy, which is what they said in the meeting that we were all in, after the body had already been embalmed and transported back to the United States. So, if they would have taken the case seriously, from the beginning, obviously they could have intercepted, they could have done their own secondary autopsy in Mexico, or ordered the bodies to be transported a different way so that the autopsy would not be compromised for the purposes of their criminal investigation. But they didn't open a criminal investigation or speak to any of the witnesses until after their second autopsy results came in. So, by that time, witnesses' memories fade, actual physical evidence will be gone. Obviously, the body was compromised for the autopsy because it was in a different condition. But the parties, the witnesses were in the United States at large, able to talk to each other, they had access to their own cell phones. All of the things that we all know that the most critical point in any criminal investigation, especially in a transnational criminal investigation, the first 48 hours are the are the time to jump on it, to keep all the evidence safe. And that just wasn't done in this case. It wasn't prioritized. And they didn't take it serious from the beginning.",

The issue is that every day that passes, which is why we had a press conference, which is why we've been saying from the beginning, there's so much urgency on the case, and we're asking for a high level of diplomatic intervention is because as with any case, if there's multiple parties involved, and they're all at large in the United States, and able to communicate with each other, they can talk to each other, they can delete evidence, they can, you know, hide evidence, they can do anything, because they're just at large sleeping in their beds at night. So that's kind of the problem. And these are seasoned investigators, obviously. This is -- this is the Charlotte branch of the FBI. So, they know those things. So, to say that they're going to conduct a secondary autopsy after the body has already been embalmed and then transported to the United States, they know it's going to be compromised.It's our -- it's already going to have -- they already have the body in a different condition. And then when you're going to talk to witnesses and people that were in the villa, people that were in the room at the time, people who leaked the video that we all saw, all of those things, time has passed since October. And so that delay is going to cause discrepancies in the evidence. That's the only reason why I bring up the 48 hours because these are seasoned investigators that know these.",
