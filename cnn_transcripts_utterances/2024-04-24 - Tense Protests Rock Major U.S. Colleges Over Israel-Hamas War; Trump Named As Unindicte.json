And that requires significant amount of change.We only have three weeks left in the semester. And so I think rather than asking for university presidents to resign, we have to do one thing, request more accountability from our universities, request more transparency.",

But clearly, the school is unhappy with this encampment that is set up right here on the main lawn because this is in violation of the school policy.Right now, there's about 20 or so tents that just were brought up this morning, about six in the morning, with over 100 students gathering here throughout the day, chanting, singing, saying from Columbia to Brown, Gaza, we will not let you down. And they made it very clear to me that they have two major demands, and that is for Brown to divest, cut any ties that the school might have when it comes to financials, whether that's connected to the Israeli government. They want those ties to be cut loose. And second, to protect free speech on campus. They're asking for 41 students that were previously back in December arrested during a sit in for those charges to be dropped. Now, earlier in the day, we saw the students in a circle right here in the main lawn. And then we saw university police escorting a school employee with a machine. And they were having each protester, one by one by one, scanning their IDs. Now we know from one of the organizers who has forwarded us an email that they are getting their first real taste of this disciplinary action. They've received an email from the Student Conduct Office indicating that there is a disciplinary case that is being processed against them. That is what they told me. The school, meanwhile, tells CNN that they needed to verify that these are actual students and not outsiders. And this is for safety reasons. I spoke with several organizers that say that they understand very well that they could potentially face an arrest in the future or a suspension or expulsion and say that time will show that they are on the right side of history -- Boris, Brianna.",

There was a pretrial hearing in the case earlier this morning, and one of the lead investigators in the probe was on the stand testifying about their investigation.He was asked, under oath, who are the other unindicted co- conspirators, people who have been implicated in this criminal conspiracy but are not facing any charges at this time. And he confirmed for the very first time that that list includes former President Donald Trump, Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani, Trump's chief of staff when he was in the White House, Mark Meadows, and then finally Jenna Ellis, who was a Trump campaign attorney. What this means is that state prosecutors in Michigan believe that those four people were co-conspirators in this fake electors plot, though I want to, of course, stress they are not facing charges in Michigan at this time. They were all charged in Georgia. You remember that big election interference case down in Georgia? They were all charged there. Ellis pleaded guilty. The other three deny wrongdoing -- guys?",

He said for him to go to New York this week was the right thing to do. He also said that he wants to look into potentially revoking federal funding from some of these schools that are not protecting the Jewish students who are on campus. And he also goes as far as to say that he would suggest revoking visas for those students who are here on these campuses that are not United States citizens who are protesting.",

What they don't have the right to do though, and we have to be emphatic about this, is to talk about violence, to upset folks, to target students who are Jewish just because of the foreign policy decisions of the United States.

Eighty percent of them, maybe 85 percent of these kids are going to go back home. You're not going to see these widespread protests certainly that we have seen in the coming months on these college campuses.I think for President Biden, who's supposed to be in New York this week, I think for him to go to Columbia would be a huge mistake. I don't know what he brings to it other than bringing more chaos and more focus on an issue that his administration right now doesn't seem to necessarily have the answer to resolve.

There's a lot of -- there's, I would say, a lack of confidence among those independent voters who -- or rather just right- leaning voters who opted for Haley over Trump.How does this issue play out amongst Republicans in specifically that the focus that some voters on the right will have toward President Trump and whether he will best handle the situation overseas?",
