Their star witness has been indicted, for lying about the Bidens and bribes, a big embarrassment, for House Republicans, who are still vowing to push ahead, tonight. Also, an uproar over a first-of-its-kind ruling. The Alabama Supreme Court says that frozen embryos are children, and destroying them could land you in prison. How it could impact fertility treatments for people who want to have a baby. And tonight, President Biden is weighing going in alone, to address the border crisis, after Republicans tanked a bipartisan border deal, an executive action that would make it harder for migrants to get asylum, and easier for the U.S. to deport them. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, the impeachment investigators are back on Capitol Hill, just in time to interview their first member of the Biden family under oath. The President's brother, James. And they're preparing to haul in Hunter Biden to testify a week from today. They believe that they've got President Biden right where they want him, or so they had hoped. Instead, it has blown up in their faces, in a very public and embarrassing way. The apparent centerpiece of this inquiry, as we now know, a now former FBI informant, says that his claims about the Bidens, and the millions of dollars in bribe money, actually came from Russian intelligence. So, it would appear if the newly-indicted ex-informant, Alexander Smirnov, is telling the truth? And we don't know, given his history. House Republicans did exactly what Vladimir Putin was hoping that they would. At this point, if the impeachment inquiry is not dead, yet, it is certainly on life support. But just don't ask the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee that. Listen to what Jim Jordan said about this, just a few weeks ago, about what the claims of this very informant are, compared to what he's saying today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

It was a deal that they had demanded, in exchange for more aid for Ukraine. But then, after had been negotiated for months, they killed it, at the behest of Donald Trump.
