Just ahead, Israel retaliates with strikes on Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon after a deadly rocket attack, raising fears of further escalation.Venezuela's authoritarian leader will serve a third consecutive term as the opposition claims election irregularities. And with just 99 days until the U.S. presidential election, the Harris campaign sees a surge in funding and support. And we begin with the breaking news from Venezuela, where longtime strongman Nicolas Maduro has been declared the winner of Sunday's election. That is according to the country's National Electoral Council. The government-controlled council reports Maduro won more than 51 per cent of the vote, with more than 80 per cent of the votes counted. This marks Maduro's third consecutive six-year term. Maduro suggested there would be bloodshed if he lost, but sang a different tune after being declared the winner. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICHOLAS MADURO, VENEZULEAN PRESIDENT (through translation):  I said it, there was peace before and there was, during and we have it. And there will be peace, stability and justice after the 28th of July, starting from today. Peace, justice, respect of the law and justice. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on the electoral authorities to ensure transparency and accountability of the vote counting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We've seen the announcement just a short while ago by the Venezuelan Electoral Commission. We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people. It's critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay, and that the electoral authorities publish the detailed tabulation of votes.

I think that the next few hours will be crucial.It will be interesting to see what the rest of the international community, not just the United States or other countries in Latin America, but big political and diplomatic powerhouses around here, such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, will have to say about this election. And then, one more thing, there is an independent body that has come here with an observation mission to observe and monitor this election. It's the Carter Center, based in Atlanta. They've sent a team of 17 people to monitor the election and they will hold a presser on Tuesday morning. What they will say will be heavily watched by many countries around the world, by the Venezuelan opposition, and by everybody who cares about this country, to decide and to understand whether this election, which has not been free or fair by any standard, could at least have been called competitive.

Dozens of children were playing on this soccer field right behind me when suddenly sirens rang out. Seconds later, a rocket made impact just right here, where in its place now stands this black flag of mourning.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Thousands and thousands of acres look a lot like what you see here behind me. So much destruction caused by this fire. And what fire officials are telling me is that the center of the fire is still very active. It's still in very steep terrain where it is difficult to access, but there are two things that have helped this weekend. One, lower temperatures and the second is resources. When it comes to lower temperatures, it is still hot, but the lower temperatures also caused higher humidity. And that has been very helpful. And then the other thing is boots on the ground. We now know that about 4,000 firefighters fighters are here battling this fire and it's been giving them the opportunity to make assessments, to go to areas like where I am now and thankfully they say now that the number of structures destroyed has gone down to 66 after these assessments. The other thing that they say they were able to do is a direct and aggressive attack on the flames and that's what has brought the percentage of containment up over the last couple of days. It is the first time that we're hearing sort of optimism from firefighters who now say they are making progress there, saying that the priority is to get people back into their homes. They say they're very sensitive specifically, two people of this county because they already went through the deadliest fire in California history back in 2018. So they know what it's like for these people who were struggling and who are remembering what they went through in 2018. Anecdotally, I can say that people are taking evacuation orders and warnings more seriously because of what they lived through.

So that really goes to show you how quickly it spread. But it's not just the flames, it's also the smoke. You have a lot of states under air quality alerts just because of how thick that smoke is unlikely to cause some problems, especially for folks that already maybe have respiratory conditions or illnesses. Now one other thing to note, we got brie reprieve over the weekend in terms of temperatures that helped firefighters out a little bit able to bring those containment numbers up by a little bit, but it will be short-lived. Notice Sacramento here, those temperatures get right back up into the mid to upper 90s and even triple digits by the time we get to the end of the week.
