That's four counts of reckless murder each.And I really want to, before we go any further, I absolutely want to thank this community and the information that was provided. And I also want to reiterate how important it is going to be for you to continue to do that. Please understand with the scene in a violent act, with the violence that went on and the magnitude of what happened, we are absolutely still in the early stages of this investigation. OK? This is absolutely the beginning. This is not the end. There is a tremendous amount of work that is yet to be done. We're going to continue to do exactly what we've been doing. We're going to be very careful with everything that we say, with everything that we do because we absolutely are going to stay focused on the families and the victims. But we're going to need the public's help when we do that. The other thing I want to point out if you were at the venue that night, so if you were physically at the venue and you have not come forward, meaning you have not contacted law enforcement, please hear me. I absolutely want you to do that. We need you to come forward for these families for these victims, OK? And I want to be clear, OK? Make no mistake:  this is Alabama. When you pull out a gun and you start shooting people, we're going to put you in jail. OK? We're going to do that because we're thinking about the families. We're concerned  about the families. We were in the beginning and we will be through the remainder of this investigation because somebody's got to start thinking about Mom. Because I know I'm tired of it. And everybody behind me is tired of it. We're tired of going to the mothers and having to tell them that these kids are not coming home. So that's what we're going to be concerned about. We're not concerned about the headlines. We're not. We're worried about Mom. OK? So that's going to be our focus. And we are. We're going to stay laser focused on this investigation throughout the duration. But again, it's going to take personal courage. It's going to take personal courage of the individuals if that they were there that night to come forward, come talk to law enforcement, tell the truth. We need that information, OK? I'm now going to turn it over to the 5th Circuit district attorney, Mike Segrest, for his comments. Thank you.",

And it's a traumatic thing for them.And if they need help, our services are available for them as well. And talking about the victims, I'll share something with you. I'm going to try not to get emotional and I'm not going to be taking any questions because I probably would. But one of the victims that wasn't injured was Lexi, Lexi Dowdell. It's Lexi 16th birthday party, sweet 16. There's an uncut cake and unburned 16 candles that never got lit. Lexi's brother was one of the victims. On her 16th birthday party, she's knelt by her brother as he took his last breath. That's what we're dealing with here. Those are what these victims went through. The message that I want to send is I know some of these victims personally. Some of these kids are kids of friends of mine, people that I went to school with, people that I play ball with and against in the community back in high school. And these are my kids. These are our kids. Don't mess with our kids. Do not mess with our kids. Thank you.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, everybody. I'm Jonathan Floyd, the police chief of the city of Dadeville. I want to echo what has already been said concerning our victims. Victims who were physically injured, our victims who were there -- andeven though they may not have receive physical injuries they have emotional scars and injuries that will carry them for the rest of their life. To our families, we love you. The Dadeville police department is going to do everything we can to make sure that we have a successful prosecution for you. One of the decisions I made very early on was to get our state and federal partners involved. The resources that they have provided have been invaluable. I ask for patience. As you've already been told, this is the tip of the iceberg. This is the very beginning. But we have one chance to get this right. In a few days, most of you are going to be gone. Our community is still going to be here. Our victims, people that are affected, are still going to be here. We're going to be here with them. As the police chief, as a member of law enforcement, we owe it to every person affected to make sure that we're very slow but sure we're very methodical, because, as I said, we have one opportunity to get this right. Because this case is not just about making an arrest; that is not the finish line. If we hurry, if we're careless and we do make an arrest but it does not result in conviction, it does not result in ultimate justice for our victims, we have failed our victims. So I ask each of you to please be patient. Please be understanding. To our victims who might not be Dadevillians but were here that night, I got news for you. Now you an honorary Dadevillian whether you want it or not, because we love you. And you're part of our city and you're part of our family. I want to thank every one of you for your interest, for your concern for our families, for our children, for being here. There are too many partners to name them all.",

As you say, the hearing that just took place lasted all just for about just a few minutes.The judge overseeing the hearing, David Hennessy, basically just wanted to make sure that he heard verbally from Teixeira, 21 years old, that he understood what was happening and that he was OK with this detention hearing being postponed. And during, once again, this very short hearing, we heard the judge say, had he, in fact, signed the waiver to postpone the detention hearing. Teixeira simply said yes. And with that, it was done. As you know, both sides had asked that this detention hearing be postponed. Teixeira, his attorney, saying they needed more time to prepare their arguments for the detention hearing. So what happened here is the judge had suggested a date of May 3rd. This hearing ended without them setting a new detention hearing date, so we're still going to wait to hear what happens with that. And finally, just to say that Teixeira's father was actually here in court. You remember that last week, he shouted out, \"I love you, Jack.\" Today during this hearing, he was silent. John.",

He's now kind of ordered a deadline of when he wants to see a review done of May 2nd actually, to have it completed to try to figure out how to plug the hole from this leak.

The normal bureaucratic response is something like this is to do a review, which turns into a 18 month review and, you know, some document ends up on top of the bookshelf.And then it falls behind the bookshelf and you never think about it again. He's putting feet to the fire here, saying, I want recommendations and I want them now. So what are -- what is the universe there is to limit the number of top secret clearances. Are too many people given that kind of access? Or to leave the number of clearances but to electronically limit the access that people have to only things that are within their job description? And this is a tough balance because limiting the need to know is what brought us to 9/11. People weren't in the loop who needed to be. So we went from need to know to need to share. But expanding the need to share increases the risk for things like this.",

So the real question is the mechanical piece.It is 100 documents or 300 documents? Or is it 500 documents? And do we even know yet? And the answer is we don't quite know yet. But the larger question is, what's in those documents? And what we are starting to realize now is there is reporting on the Egyptian president considering selling arms to Russia, to fight against the Ukraine. That's a U.S. ally. There's reporting about the UAE, a key U.S. ally. There's reporting about Turkiye and the Wagner group possibly working together. That's a NATO country. The intelligence world is supposed to be a hall of mirrors. And it's, you know, collecting these secrets gives you opportunities to deal with them behind the scenes diplomatically, not having it spill onto the floor of Congress and public debate or limiting aid to countries that we're friendly with, by diverting things like this or sabotage. I mean, there's lots of options. And when you're the leader, knowing what everybody else is doing and thinking, why that is secret is because the bull's eye here is decision advantage. I know what everybody else is doing. I can make decisions that give us the advantage. Once you go into the hall of mirrors and start marking where the mirrors are, you lose decision advantage. And that's the risk of the level of sensitivity of some of these documents that a 21 year old kid with an important job of keeping those computers running did by sharing them with his friends and having it spill outside.",
