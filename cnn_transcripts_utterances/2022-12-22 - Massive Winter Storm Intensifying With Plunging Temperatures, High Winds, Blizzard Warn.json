John Berman here, in for Anderson, already nearly half the country's population is shivering under Windchill Alerts or has seen temperatures drop as much as 70 degrees overnight. Just take a look at this. This is Sioux Falls, South Dakota. You know it's cold there when the falls at Sioux Falls stop falling because they're frozen solid. You know just how widespread this Big Chill could get when places as far south as Tallahassee in Florida are now forecasting lows in the low 20s. And if that weren't enough, we're already seeing countless Blizzard Warnings and Watches, Flood Watches, Wind and Ice Advisories, and of course 1000s of flight cancellations, nearly 2,400 already today, that's according to FlightAware, and more than 2,000 for tomorrow already. All of this smack dab in the middle of the Christmas travel rush. More now from CNN's Omar Jimenez in Chicago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  It's not just snow, it is wind and cold as part of a huge winter system descending onto the US just days before Christmas. Over this week, more than 80 percent of the country's population will see at or below freezing temperatures. Some places way below like Denver, where the temperature dropped nearly 40 degrees in just an hour hitting negative 15 by Thursday morning, or Wyoming where a State Trooper took this video, zero visibility and temperatures 60 degrees below zero. Elsewhere, parts of the Midwest are doing what they can to keep up. JIMENEZ (on camera):  One of the biggest concerns in a winter system like this is the roads and this dome is part of what it takes in a city like Chicago. You're looking at 50,000 tons of salt inside that crews come in and out of over the course of the day to try and help keep these roads somewhat manageable. JIMENEZ (voice over):  The city has about 400,000 tons of salt and more than 300 vehicles in its arsenal to fight back on this second official day of winter.",

It really details this intense pressure campaign from her Trump world attorney, Stefan Passantino to repeatedly say in her testimony with the Committee that she didn't recall certain events or conversations around January 6th, and it also shows how in her perspective, Trump World kept dangling possible job opportunities in front of her every time she was about to testify to the Committee, perhaps to influence her.So Cassidy Hutchinson in her testimony that was released, this was sort of just a few months ago with the Committee. She said that Stefan Passantino said this to her saying: \"I want to make this clear to you,\" she said, \"Stefan never told me to lie. He specifically told me, 'I don't want you to perjure yourself, but I don't recall isn't perjury,' They don't know what you can and can't recall.\" And then she said, he summed it up by saying, \"The less you remember, the better.\" So Passantino, that's what Cassidy Hutchinson says that he told her, but you know, he told our team earlier this week that he believes he was ethical when he represented Hutchinson, of course, she later got rid of him, and he believes that her initial rounds of testimony were truthful and cooperative. But of course, she did ditch him in favor of nonpartisan attorneys. But John, really, her testimony just shows how much pressure she felt to not betray anyone from Trump's orbit especially because initially, they were paying for her legal representation. In addition to Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony, we've also seen several other transcripts released throughout the day into tonight, and it includes one from Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews. She detailed how the former President Trump tried to get then Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, to hold press conferences in the wake of the election about fake claims of fraud, tied to Dominion Voting Machines. Of course, she refused. Those were fake claims of fraud. But all of this, all of these transcripts we are now seeing, and of course, waiting for the report. It just punctuates the months of testimony that we've heard publicly, and it adds maybe drips of new evidence here, John, as the Committee gets prepared to really sunset its Committee, and then the Justice Department, of course, decides whether and who it might charge in relation to January 6th, including former President Trump. So all the waiting game here, including for the final report, and then ultimately what DOJ decides to do here -- John.",

Please keep us posted.Similarly, on the other side of the border, officials are also warning migrants to stay in a shelter or stay home due to the extreme cold. Many are waiting, hoping to eventually cross and request asylum. Some have been waiting for weeks, living on the streets and abandoned homes or in large makeshift camps. That's because the Supreme Court is still considering the fate of the Trump-era immigration policy, Title 42. Let's get more from CNN's David Culver who spoke with two migrants who were stuck at the border after making a dangerous journey. This is his report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There are those who cross illegally streams of people every day, every hour. And then there are those who watch, wait and face the unknown. Here in Ciudad Juarez. This is what the U.S. looks like for Ulexi Fernandez and Lucy Bastillas (ph). We're not criminals, we're good people, they stress. The two met while serving in the Venezuelan military. In October, they started their trek north, fleeing political turmoil, hiking through jungles rafting, murky waters, riding a train from on top. So close to their final destination until policy and this halt their journey. Before sunrise Tuesday, we watch as Texas law enforcement mobilize sealing off this popular access point to American soil, one of the state's efforts to stop the flow of migrants. But it only reroutes them a short distance down river, creating a new bottleneck for illegal crossings and a tense standoff. The setting sun utters in freezing temperatures. By nightfall, migrants settle in on the U.S. side of the river, building campfires to keep warm. Hours later, some rush another border entry point about a mile away. Under Title 42, they can still be immediately expelled on the grounds of COVID prevention. Lucy and Ulexi, determined to enter legally. She wants to do it the right way, she tells me, and knows exactly where she wants to go. (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CULVER (voice-over): Far from their Big Apple dreams, unable to return home, stuck in international purgatory. I'm here with my partner, she says. Discriminated against, they say, because they're migrants, they're women and they're a couple to be safe, they avoid public displays of affection and traveling groups. Another reason they want to get to the other side? (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CULVER (voice-over): When we're there, we're going to help all of our family, she says. The very mention of family triggers emotions Lucy's carried since leaving Venezuela. Lucy missing her mom and siblings. Ulexi, her ten-year-old daughter. We hurry across traffic, about a half mile from where we first met the couple and arrive at this local shelter with nowhere else to go, families line up, hoping to escape the freezing cold. (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CULVER (voice-over): Lucy and Ulexi among the fortunate. This is home, at least for now. We meet some of their new friends, fellow migrants from all backgrounds. (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CULVER (on-camera): And how many people altogether are usually in here at night?",

So that's why they're hoping Title 42 comes down. They'll have a chance to claim asylum the legal way. John.",

The flag was signed by Ukrainian troops on the front lines in Bakhmut. President Zelenskyy today thanked President Biden for his assistance and leadership and said he is returning home with, quote, good results, results that will really help.A different tone, of course in Moscow, a Kremlin spokesperson warned that the United States supplying patriot missile systems to Ukraine would prolong people's, quote, suffering, which rings hollow considering the almost continuous Russian missile strikes on civilians. Joining us now is CNN national security analyst and former CIA chief of Russia operations, Steve Hall. So, Steve, that response from Russia, the varied response that you've heard from Russia and the Kremlin here, do you think that this meeting Zelenskyy's trip has changed Russia's calculus here?",

It is, of course, you know, all viewers should understand the obvious, which is that it's absolutely ridiculous for Russia to say, hey, we've invaded another country, and now people need to take into consideration our concerns, which is what they said. But you know, there's a really interesting good propaganda line that the Kremlin is starting to develop. And if you read some of the stuff that's coming out of the Kremlin, they're saying things like, the United States is waging an indirect war against Russia down to the last Ukrainian life. So that's clearly pointed at the Ukrainian people who are suffering terribly this winter as a result of Russian aggression.",

So, Russia invades a country and then says, wait a minute, we've got concerns that everybody needs to focus on. But I think one of the things that Zelenskyy did really, really well in that speech, in my view to Congress, was is it, he said something that I'd really like to hear more out of American politicians. And that is when you ask the valid question, how come billions of dollars are going to Ukraine when my school system or bus system or infrastructure isn't getting paid for here in the United States? Why is that worth it? The answer is because this is a fight for democracy. This is something that benefits the United States globally when democracies win over autocracies like Russia. It's a valid question, but Zelenskyy addressed it directly, saying, we're not asking for donations. We're asking for an investment in your own future. And that's absolutely correct, in my view.",

And so, now I think the Russians are seeing how much more difficult this is going to be. And so, they're talking about negotiations. Now, I mean, you know, oftentimes wars do end in negotiations, but it's quite clear that the Ukrainians are saying, yes, those times have not arrived yet because there are still invaders on our territory. And until our territory is secured and we have expelled all of them, only then can those talks begin.

You know, If I'm going to be in groups, I'm still testing every day. But I think that's in the minority on that. If you're fully boosted, the risks are not gigantic, and people absolutely should stay completely boosted.COOPER (on-camera): In terms of developing vaccines that are more effective, I mean is there -- that clearly there's room for improvement. I mean, the vaccines I think people were surprised that they weren't as effective as some had believed they were, as we'd been led to believe they were. Obviously, they're better than nothing.

Some people say if you're above 70, you should even get boosted every four months or so. So, duration we want to work on. The other thing is that the vaccines don't prevent you from getting infected. They do for a bit, reduce the chance of infection, but then infection itself, because that requires antibodies up in your nose, that's not where the vaccine succeeds. It's more protects your body, your lungs, which is where severe disease and death come from.So, we're trying to modify we may have one of the doses of the vaccine be an inhaled vaccine, which causes the immune system to focus on protecting the upper respiratory tract. And because we're not infection blocking, the benefit to other people of your taking the vaccine is not as high as it would be if were completely infection blocking, like a lot of vaccines are. And it'll be a few years, though, before we get that new feature. COOPER (on-camera): You've put another $20 billion into the Gates Foundation endowment this year. And for those people who don't know as you say in your annual letter. The foundation is really, you say, designed to help poor -- to help people in poor countries stay alive, help them not die because they shouldn't die, and especially children. The childhood death rate has been cut in half since you started the foundation in 2000. How does that get cut even more?",
