It's a decision that delays the potential for a huge increase in unlawful crossings that officials have been bracing for.In this brief, unsigned order, the justices of the Supreme Court halted a trial judge's ruling that would have lifted the measure; and, in effect, granted a GOP request to prevent the winding down of Title 42. Thousands of migrants who are desperately waiting at the border are now facing months of more uncertainty. They were hoping for the chance to enter the United States legally. CNN's Rosa Flores is live in El Paso, Texas. Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington. Priscilla, I want to start with you, because we got this 5-4 decision from the Supreme Court. It was very brief. But basically, it means this is going to stay in place until they hear the decision in the coming months, in 2023. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. They're essentially saying these restrictions are going to remain in effect while legal challenges play out, a process that takes months. Now, this is an order that is ultimately a victory for Republican-led states who had intervened in the case and tried to block the termination of this authority. Now, some justices said that they would deny the application, including conservative justice Neil Gorsuch, who in a dissent, siding with the liberals, said, quote, \"The current border crisis is not a COVID crisis, and courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency, only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency.\" This is something that we have heard from immigrant advocates.

Now, the reason why their impact is different is because the individuals who have those documents can actually travel out of these border areas. For the other individuals, there are checkpoints before you leave the border areas, where immigration officials ask everybody, including myself whenever I drive through that area, you have to declare your citizenship. So at that point in time, Title 42 could be imposed on those -- on those migrants who enter the country illegally, or they could also be processed under Title 8, which means they could be not only expelled but they could be deported from the country. So it's -- it depends. Now, the migrants that I've been talking to here, they're very confused, because they don't quite understand the process in the United States.

Now, these considerations are being made in consultation with U.S. health officials. And one U.S. official told me that a decision about a -- adding a possible testing requirement for those travelers could be made soon. Now, I want to read you a bit more of a statement from U.S. officials, who said, quote, \"There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing COVID-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data being reported from the PRC.\" They added, \"Without this data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for public health officials to ensure that they will be able to identify any potential new variants and take prompt measures to reduce the spread.\" Now, these considerations are coming as some other countries like Japan and India, have imposed some new steps for travelers coming from China. In both of those countries, travelers from China will be required to show a negative test upon arrival. The U.S. is looking at those measures, talking to partners around the world, and also public health officials. And U.S. officials say that they are considering what options they might be able to take here in the U.S. But certainly, the end of the zero-COVID policy and the rise in cases from China is something the White House has been watching very closely.

She told the January 6th panel in newly-released transcripts, quote, \"So throughout the day, he would put more logs on the fireplace to keep it burning throughout the day. And I recall roughly a dozen times where he would throw a few more pieces of paper in it when he put more logs on the fireplace.\" Our Kristen Holmes joins us now to talk about this.

You can actually see them going back and forth bickering. At points he stops her. And it shows why it was that she felt she needed to get a new attorney. Now, when it comes to the burning, as you mentioned, I mean, obviously, this is not the way to get rid of these kind of government documents. And she notes that this happened roughly a dozen times. Two of those instances, at least, were after she met -- after Meadows met with Republican Pennsylvania Congressman Scott Perry, who was been linked to trying to use the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election. So that is pretty fascinating. The other thing that really stood out to me was something that Meadows told several White House aides, which was that they should keep some of the meetings that were happening in the Oval Office on a, quote, \"close hold,\" meaning potentially, that these didn't get onto the actual Oval Office diaries. \"Let's keep some of the meetings close hold. We will talk about what that means, but for now we will keep things real tight and private so that things don't start to leak out.\" And of course, Poppy, as we know, there's a reason that the Oval Office has a diary.

Johnny McEntee, who was a personal aide to the president, ran the Presidential Personnel Office, who talked about -- which, you know, we heard from multiple aides, that he witnessed former President Trump often tearing up documents after meetings when he was finished with them.Again, we've heard this before, but it is always stunning to see that this was just practice of how they dealt with these documents that, you know, again, as Kaitlan said, have a very strict way of processing. So they go to the archives. We're talking about the president of the United States here.",

From the -- from the lowliest staffers, all the way up to the president himself constantly talking about things like tweets. What should the president tweet? And there's, you know, the vision of three different types of tweets that they talk about putting out.And they're constantly talking about massaging the message and how should the -- how should the president, you know, talk to people. Nowhere, not one place, is anyone having a conversation about what should we do to stop this attack? Every one of those people swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. From the transcript of Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony, there's no indication that anyone took any steps to pick up the phone and call the FBI, call the military, call the police, call the mayor of Washington, D.C., or the head of the Capitol Police to try to figure out how they could help stop the attack on the Capitol. It just did not happen. It's striking, and it's just confounding.",

So -- and it's helpful, I think, to read this transcript after we read the previous one that was released in which she talked to the committee about her struggles with attorney Stefan Passantino.So one, knowing what was going on in the background during this interview that we got yesterday, it's really fascinating. I should say, however, though, that some of those interjections by Mr. Passantino are the sorts of things -- excuse me -- that you would expect to see from an attorney who was engaged in protecting their client, going to make sure that their client doesn't step beyond the -- the authority they have, makes it clear that they are maybe guessing about something or providing an opinion, rather than a statement of fact. So some of that you should expect to see, but it's seeing it, understanding the -- the emotional kind of hand-wringing that she was going through at the time, her concerns about how Mr. Passantino might be communicating what -- what she's telling him and what he's saying in the interviews to people back in, as she says, Trump world. It's really a fascinating example of an attorney and a client whose interests are dividing or splitting going in opposite directions. And of course, we know she solves that problem by hiring Jody Hunt.",
