      "sentences": "Hello there, I'm Kristie Lu stout live in Hong Kong.And ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, the U.S. is the latest to put new restrictions on travelers from China with COVID cases surging following the country's rapid reopening. Plus, Zelenskyy's defiant message, the Ukrainian president resist no one will ever be afraid of Russia during his annual speech to Parliament. And Pope Francis urges Catholics around the world to pray for his predecessor with new concern about the health of Pope Benedict. Those stories in just a moment but first, we are hearing horrific eyewitness accounts about a huge fire that killed at least 11 people at a casino in Cambodia. Officials say flames engulfed the building, which includes a hotel on Wednesday night. One rescuer says some people died after jumping off the building as they tried to escape. The Casino is located near the border with Thailand and officials say hundreds of emergency workers from both countries rushed to the site after the fire broke out Wednesday night. Rescue workers are still searching for more victims and we will continue to follow the story and bring you more updates when we have them. Now, with COVID cases surging in China, the United States will soon require all travelers from that country, including Hong Kong and Macau to test negative for COVID-19 before flying to the U.S. That new rule begins on January the fifth. Now, U.S. health officials say that travelers must be tested no sooner than two days before flying. And they'll have to show proof of that negative test before they can board. This applies not just to Chinese citizens but anyone who's been to China within 10 days of flying. And this new restriction comes after Beijing dismantled its strict zero COVID policy following weeks of public outcry and protests. And the resulting rise in new infections has left U.S. officials concerned with China's transparency and exactly how many people there are sick. China's foreign ministry is urging countries to work together in safe travel instead of imposing more restrictions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG WENBIN, SPOKESPERSON, CHINESE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (through translator): The current COVID situation in the world continues to call for a science based response approach and joint effort to ensure safe cross border travel, keep global industrial and supply chain stable and restore world economic growth.

He was Cardinal and Pope during the years when the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandals came to light, and he spearheaded the Vatican's efforts towards a zero-tolerance policy. However, after his retirement, he suffered a reputational blow when the Church commissioned report found he knew and failed to act against a pedophile priest while he was archbishop in Munich 40 years ago. Benedict denied the allegations. Even after his resignation, he continues to be a towering figure in the Catholic Church.
