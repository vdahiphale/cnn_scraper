It was about the same Memorial Day weekend a year ago. And Aixa Diaz of AAA says gas prices really aren't playing much of a factor. So many people are just budgeting for travel. They have to do it post pandemic, being so cooped up, they call that revenge travel. And now it's really just something that people do automatically four years away from the start of the pandemic. The big bottom line here is to make sure that you leave early. And today will be especially tricky, especially in the evening hours, because that is when this holiday traffic also meets normal commuting traffic for folks who are also going to work on this normal workday. Here's what AAA said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AIXA DIAZ, AAA SPOKESPERSON: You're going to have a mix of commuters. There's people going to work and travelers trying to hit the road. So leave as early as possible, avoid those rush hour windows. Maybe midday might be a good time, but avoid that like 8:00 a.m. timeframe and then avoid when people are leaving work.

The NCAA and Power Five conferences, they hope by reaching this settlement that they can stabilize college athletics after just years and years of lawsuits.But we still have lots of questions remaining even with these settlements, but any athletes who played a Division One sport from 2016 to the present, they have a claim for some of that $2.7 billion. Now, how they plan on paying the star quarterback versus the pole vaulter, that's still not clear. The $2.7 billion expected to be paid out over a ten-year period. Now, if athletes opt into the settlements they have to agree to not sue in any further antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA. Now, a big part of this deal is the news that schools will now for the first time ever directly pay athletes in the future. So each school in the Big Four conferences moving forward and I say four because the PAC-12 is no longer. Those conferences in those schools, they're going to the ability to spend a maximum of roughly $20 million per year on direct payments to their athletes. And it's going to be up to each school on how much to allocate that money to each athlete while remaining compliant with Title 9 laws. Now, the direct paid athletes, it could start as soon as the fall of 2025. The deal it still has to be approved by the federal judges overseeing the case and Amara, like I mentioned still so much to be determined with this settlement like, for example, what's this going to do to the roster size, you know, particularly in football? They're likely going to have to have less than 120 players if they're paying everyone and you know, what does this mean for all of those Olympic sports out there that typically don't make any money for schools, will they keep those around? So, you know, we have a settlement, but like I mentioned, Amara still so many things to be determined with it.",
