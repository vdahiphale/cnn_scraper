We'll bring you an update on that story in just a bit. It is 9 am in New York, 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. Hello and welcome to \"Connect the World\". I'm Eleni Giokos. Now the resolution, which the U.S. has been working on for weeks calls for quotes, and immediate and sustained ceasefire in connection with the release of all remaining hostages. Work is underway to ensure the resolution passes, according to diplomats, but Russia has in the past threatened to use its veto. This is consequential and of course, this vote comes almost 5.5 months since the October 7th attacks that killed more than 1200 people in Israel. Now more than 250 people were kidnapped and taken hostage into Gaza. And the death toll is approaching 32,000 Palestinians and the vote comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the war cabinet. Here's what he had to say yesterday in Cairo about the ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: There's a clear consensus around a number of shared priorities first, the need for an immediate sustained ceasefire with the release of hostages that would create space to surge more humanitarian assistance to relieve the suffering of many people and to build something more enduring.

We got CNN's Paula Hancocks in Doha monitoring the hostage talks, and we've got CNN's Jennifer Hansler in the State Department, as well. And of course, we're keeping a very close watch on the UN Security Council. That meeting is set to get underway in just a bit. Jennifer, I want to start with you, Israel and the U.S. relations have been strained of late if we could call it that the messaging from Washington has been a lot more stern, and also warning against an offense of interest. So what is Blinken hope to get out of this meeting?",

      "sentences": "Well, Eleni throughout the five and a half months of this conflict one thing we've heard consistentlyfrom U.S. officials that it takes this in their face, person to person diplomacy for anything to get done for Israel to act on any of these U.S. requests. So we are seeing Secretary Blinken back in the region for the sixth time to press the Israelis on these key issues that he has been raising throughout the course of this conflict. Number one he wants to see more humanitarian assistance reaching those in need in Gaza. Blinken said yesterday in Egypt that Israel needs to do more. They need to open up more crossings, more land crossings for this aid to reach those in need. So we expect this to be among the key topics of his conversations that just wrapped up there in Israel today. Another thing we expect him to push is the need for Israel to not move forward on this offensive into Rafah, the U.S. has called this a mistake. Blinken said yesterday it would be a humanitarian disaster if they were to move forward on this offensive that Netanyahu continues to threaten to push forward even despite this U.S. international condemnation. Now, the also the key issues that we expect to be discussed in Israel is this hostage deal is this need for an immediate ceasefire to get the hostages home. Now Eleni, it's important to note that Blinken's trip did not just stop in Israel. He was also traveling throughout the region over the past several days. He was in Saudi Arabia two days ago. He was in Egypt yesterday. He met with his Arab contact group leaders from countries in the region to talk about what comes next once the conflict does, in fact, come to an end. They want to have plans in place on security in Gaza, on governance in Gaza so that they are able to take advantage of any sort of stoppage in the fighting. So we don't necessarily expect a lot of concrete deliverables coming out of today's meetings out of this week's trip. But we do see Blinken laying out the political groundwork, the path forward when things do come to an end Eleni.",

We've just heard from the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, responding to Russia vetoing its draftresolution when it comes to potential ceasefire in Gaza release of hostages, and also allowing more humanitarian aid in the U.S., Ambassador says are two reasons for that one is cynical, and one is petty. There's a lot that's going on here. But most important to note is that this is a very big shift and move by the United States. It has vetoed other similar draft resolutions brought forward by other nations and this time, the U.S. taking the lead on that. Interesting to also note that the U.S. had consulted with other Security Council members in creating this draft resolution and now -- Russia of course, one of the five countries that do have veto power have objected to this draft resolution. We've got Paula Hancock standing by. She's been listening in from Doha. Paula, we've just heard from the U.S. Ambassador. We heard from the Russian side as well. Interestingly, Russia has voted for similar draft resolutions brought forward they've abstained once, but this time, using the veto power against the United States. And frankly, just hearing some of the commentary from the Russian Ambassador saying, look, you know, the U.S. has, has stood by and watched on for so long, then bringing this draft resolution is an interesting sort of development from the U.S.'s side and yet coming through and obstructing this from actually being put through as a resolution in itself.",

Of course, we'll bring you an update on where we stand and whether they can reach that 40k today?  We're just below as the markets started trading day, but they still have many hours left.

We mentionedthat 40,000 level but let's see where we are right now. We're at 39,769. We're down slightly, but -- you know, the trading day has just begun. Big question on whether we'll see a breach of that 40,000 and whether it'll be able to sustain that level? The Industrial Average reaching record highs this week, and closing just shy of course of that milestone. The NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 also having very good weeks, as the U.S. Indices continue to fly in 2024. Someone that likes touching the stars is Anna Stewart, she joins us now. Look, you know we get hung up on these milestones rights of 40,000 or any round number. You know, the question has always been -- you know is that significant?

I mean you know from the Dot Com -- you know crash to what we saw during the -- you know, 2008, great financial crisis, of course, pandemic was pretty dramatic.

And you can just see there, but it is a price weighted index, this one. So essentially, the moves from the higher priced components move it more so than the lower priced stocks. So in that sense, it's a slightly different index to look at. Whether people in the U.S. will actually feel good as a result of this, if you're investor? Sure, but inflation is still rising, albeit at a slower rate, interest rates are still high. So anyone with a mortgage or a loan is feeling the cost there. I am sure though some U.S. politicians may be very happy that this will be a good news story, and I'm sure it will get owned by both sides in the U.S. as the good news.",

It says that water is often a tool and a target when it comes to warfare and regional tensions over water. The report says that more than 2 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water. It also says three and a half billion people lack access to sanitation that safely managed. And with the climate crisis nearly one and a half a billion people have been affected by drought between 2002 and 2021. Now the report concludes the world is not on track to meet the United Nations' goal of ensuring everyone has access to safe and clean water by 2030. Now the Brazilian ex-footballer Robinho was arrested on Thursday and is set to start a nine year prison sentence for rape. The former international was driven away from his home in the City of Santos after Brazil's Supreme Court said he could not remain at liberty while appealing his conviction. A court in Italy found him guilty in 2017 of taking part in the gang rape of a woman in Milan four years earlier. Robinho has always said he's innocent. Ukraine's football team is one step closer to reaching this summer's European Championships. On Thursday, they picked up a crucial win over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the playoff semi-final to set themselves up for a key clash against Iceland on Tuesday.

And I have to say over the course of thelast couple of years, every time we've spoken to a Ukrainian athlete from whatever sport they've talked about the importance for them of winning not only in a sporting context, but for what it means for people at home since Russia's full blown invasion in February 2022. They haven't qualified as a football team for a major tournament since then. So this is a huge milestone moment. They had to come from behind to do it after an own goal that put Bosnia ahead but 2-1, they booked their place in that final against Iceland, as you mentioned on Tuesday. It's a match that sets we played in Poland because it's not able to be played in Ukraine. And I have to say the bookmakers are pretty confident for them. Iceland 500-1 for their chances at the European Championships finals in June and July. But Ukraine 150-1 to win the entire thing so it's not probably not a bad bet but yeah, still 90 minutes of football and another win for them until they get to that point. We've got lots of football coming up with just a couple of minutes in \"Worlds Sports\" Eleni -- not great though. I'm sorry.",
