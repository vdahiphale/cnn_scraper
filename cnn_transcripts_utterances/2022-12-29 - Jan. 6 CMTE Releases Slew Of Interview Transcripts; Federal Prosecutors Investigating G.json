I'm Sara Sidner.We're now getting a look at even more witness transcripts from the January 6 investigation, 19 to be exact. The January 6 Committee released key interviews from members of former President Donald Trump's family and staff and conversations with people involved in the state level effort to overturn the 2020 election. In one interview, Donald Trump, Jr. gave more context around text that he sent to Mark Meadows about plans to keep his father in office days after the election that he lost. And Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, detailed a conversation with Sen. Lindsey Graham in which he pledged to become a \"champion\" of Trump's election fraud claims. Our Sara Murray now with more details, I know there's a lot to go through, I know there's a team of people going through them. But what else stands out to you?",

And he does lay out a little bit more about his text messages with Mark Meadows as the riot was unfolding.At one point Don Jr. texted Meadows saying he has to condemn this. And so the Committee said, \"He's got to condemn it ASAP. When you said 'condemn this expletive,' condemn - condemn what?\" And Don Jr. says, \"The violence that's going on. Again, you know, I think I made it pretty clear in my speech, we can do this peacefully. You know, use your First Amendment rights; do it that way. But, you know, violence has no place in this situation.\" The other thing that was really notable from this Don, Jr. Transcript, obviously he wanted his father to condemn the violence at the Capitol that day. There was a whole lot that Don Jr. could not remember that the Committee asked about when it came to his conversations directly with his father, a lot of I do not recall or I don't exactly remember it.",

Our ability to get this information from you has expired. The Trump team certainly takes that as a victory. They had sued to block this subpoena. And they did successfully keep the Committee from getting records, from getting testimony from the former president. But, of course, the Committee didn't end by saying Donald Trump did nothing wrong.

And stay with us, I think we'll be coming back to you in a bit with all these new details.Embattled Congressman-elect George Santos is now facing scrutiny over his finances after facing a wave of criticism for lying about everything from his religious heritage, work history, his education. CNN has learned that federal prosecutors in New York are looking into claims that include loans totaling more than $700,000 that he made to his own campaign. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty joins me now with more. Give us a sense, remind us of where things stand because every day there's another lie that has been uncovered. SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Sara, and this controversy for him just keeps growing. There are new fabrications that were uncovered from CNN's KFILE team, fabrications that were previously unreported. First, Santos claim that he attended an elite New York City private school called Horace Mann prep. He says he had to leave the school when his family's real estate assets fell on hard times. But those claims are false. According to the school, they have no evidence that he ever attended that school. Santos also says that he represented Goldman Sachs at a financial conference where he says he spoke out against the company during that panel about investing in renewables. Now, not only there's no record of him appearing on a panel, but there was no record of him even attending the conference he claims he did. And, of course, there are no records of him working for Goldman Sachs either. There's also a new additional false claims he's made about his family history. KFILE finding that Santos said his mother had historically Jewish name, but genealogists who work with CNN on this, they found no evidence of that name, no evidence of Jewish or Ukrainian heritage in his family tree either. Now, all of this comes as Santos - as you referenced - is facing investigations on the federal and local level. And specifically federally prosecutors in New York are looking into Santos' finances. Big questions here over how and where he got his money, $700,000 he loaned to his campaign. And locally, the probe from the Nassau County District's office, that has been launched they call the fabrications, in their words, nothing short of stunning. And just a short time ago, there was a press conference in his district where local Democrats and activists slammed the incoming congressman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ANNA KAPLAN (D-NY): To allow George Santos to be seated as a member of Congress would be a further knife in the heart of this community.",

The Brazilian soccer star is the only man to win three World Cups and some of the greatest plays ever.His daughter just posted online, \"Everything we are is thanks to you. We love you endlessly. Rest in peace.\" CNN Sports Anchor and Correspondent Patrick Snell is here with the latest. Patrick, Sao Paulo Hospital has just released Pele's cause of death. Tell us what's - what it is. PATRICK SNELL, CNN SPORT ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: They have, absolutely, and it is - what is - what I'm taking from this, Sara, is this is extremely, extremely sad news. Condolences, of course, to the family, first and foremost, we've been keeping Pele and his family in our thoughts and prayers. But the hospital earlier confirming that he passed away peacefully and I think that's the biggest takeaway for his fans that we've been hanging on updates, we've been waiting updates all over the Christmas period and we've been getting them from his families, most notably, one of his daughters, Kelly, as well. But just for context, you said it, this is the only player ever in the history of the sport to win three World Cups. Just imagine winning your first ever World Cup at the age of 17 years of age, the 1958 tournament in Sweden, he would win it again with storied Brazilian national team four years later and then one more time in 1970 in Mexico. Three World Cups, he played in four in total. He won three of them. But his life story is so incredible. It is so powerful. This is someone who transcended sports, a global icon who made an impact not just during his storied career, but off the field of play as well. After retirement he cared so much, he grew up in poverty. He played the game with socks molded into a football for goalposts. There were boots when they had boots his youth team actually didn't even have boots to play in initially, it is no wonder that we've been getting reaction coming, such a storied global icon. I do want to get to something. A really emotional posts from Pele's official Twitter account within the last few minutes. If I can get to that, these words resonating very powerfully, indeed, \"Inspiration and love mark the journey of King Pele, who peacefully passed away today. Love, love and love, forever.\" And also he was so generous in his praise of others, Sara. I want to tap into something that he had a special bond he had with French World Cup winning superstar, Kylian Mbappe, from 2018. These two forming a special bond in the last few months of Pele's life. Mbappe a short while ago taking to social media, \"The king of football has left us but his legacy will never be forgotten. RIP KING.\" Rest in peace, King. Emotional day, absolutely, but a celebration of an incredible life as well. Such a powerful and impactful one as well, no question. Back to you.",
