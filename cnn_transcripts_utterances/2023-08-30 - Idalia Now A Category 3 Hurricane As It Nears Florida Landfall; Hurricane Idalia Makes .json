We now have the latest update that we want to give you.You're looking right now at pictures of Steinhatchee, Florida. Just north of Steinhatchee, within the hour, is when the expected landfall will occur for this now-Category 3 storm. Winds about 125 miles per hour. A very significant concern about storm surge that could go up to 12 to 16 feet, winds, tornadoes. The outer bounds we've been covering up and down the Gulf Coast region of Florida over the course of the last several hours -- we've been seeing -- what we've been getting from the outer limits of that hurricane. We are now planning and waiting for that direct hit. And Sara, I know you're in Crystal River. You've been seeing a lot of the flooding, a lot of the kind of effects of the outer bounds up to this point. What are you seeing right now?",

You are much closer than I am to the eye of the storm. And you said that there is debris, and that's one of the things that people really must watch out for. The winds are going to pick up debris. They are going to -- at a Category 3, they can start to shred some roofs and take some tiles off roofs and throw those around. Knock down power lines, which is really, really dangerous. Edgar, can you let me know -- are you seeing people who have decided to stay even though that's an evacuation zone? Because that often happens in these hurricanes where people say you know what, I'm not leaving my house. I'm going to figure it out from here and what will be will be. Have you seen folks who have stayed around there and in the danger zone? O'NEAL:  I have seen some people say. I was in Cedar Key earlier and there were about 40 residents that were staying here -- right here in Cross City. I've seen a few people out. It's mainly law enforcement and first responders that are out right now. So it's really -- it seems like people here in Cross City are staying indoors.",

I know you said you made it to Cedar Key as well. That will be hard-hit from Hurricane Idalia. I am now going to toss it back to our Phil Mattingly who is in the studio.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, thank you, Sara. That is the on-the-ground view.I want to take things back -- a little bit more of a macro view in terms of the preparations and what should be expected both on the state and local, but also federal level in the hours to come as that storm, now a Category 3 hurricane, approaches land in Florida's Big Bend region. Joining us now is former FEMA administrator Craig Fugate. Sir, appreciate your time. I was struck a couple of hours ago when we were talking to a local official who said this is kind of the wait-and-see moment. It's very anxious. You've done all the preparation and now you have to wait and then deploy assets afterwards. Take us into this moment on the federal level where you're waiting for landfall and you can't really do a lot. CRAIG FUGATE, FORMER FEMA ADMINISTRATOR (via Skype):  Yes. I mean, right now, it's -- everybody is staged about as close to his as you can. And what they're going to be waiting for as the storm begins to move through. They won't wait until the sun is shining. The state is going to launch the search and rescue teams that go into the targeted areas where they expect to have the greatest risk from storm surge and wind damage. And so, FEMA has sent teams in to support the state. They have basically surrounded this area. And so, again, the -- on the federal side, it's really supporting the state search and rescue operations. That'll be the first part. The second part will be beginning to get an assessment of how much damage are in these areas. For the people there this isn't good news what's going to happen. But from the standpoint of a federal response, this is about the least populated area of Florida you could actually take a hurricane through. So it's very rural. You've got clusters of small communities that are spread out. There's no real focus area that you can -- you base out of. So you're using Tallahassee, maybe Lake City, Gainesville, and places like that but -- as this storm moves through. And it's not going to be just Florida. It's going into Georgia. So they've already sent teams into Georgia. They've got people with Georgia emergency management, and they're looking up in the Carolinas. (Feed frozen).",

I am live here in Crystal River, Florida where the bands of wind from Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 storm, are hitting once again.Now, we know that the storm is very, very close. In the next hour or so that's going to make landfall very soon now. I want to go to Allison Chinchar who is tracking this storm for us. What can you tell us and how soon might this storm hit landfall?",

      "sentences": "I would say, honestly, Sara, in just the new few minutes. Likely, in the next 10 minutes, we're going to get that official call from the National Hurricane Center because we are now starting to see that official eyewall begin to cross over land as we speak. You're starting to see a lot of the thunderstorms on the northern side also intensify. A lot more lightning bolts starting to pop up with this.So again, I would say at this point, landfall is underway. We are really going to see that announcement from the National Hurricane Center here likely in the next few minutes as this storm continues. One thing to note, though. These impacts are still going to continue over the next several hours. You've got this extreme wind warning that has since expanded into new territory and it now extends until 10:15 a.m. this morning. The emphasis there is just on the intense, incredibly strong winds that we are going to get in that area over the next few hours. You're looking at sustained winds in a lot of these areas up around that 40- mile-per-hour range with some of those wind gusts between 60 to 70 miles per hour. And those will continue to increase here in the next hour or two. We also have the tornado watch in effect for portions of both Florida and Georgia. We've had about a dozen tornado warnings already so far today. That number is going to go up. Keep in mind when we talk about tornado warnings the safe place is always the lowest level of your house -- say, a basement, for example. But a basement is not where you want to go if your home is being inundated with floodwaters. You want to go up. So do keep that in mind because that makes your safe place very tricky on a day like today. Here is a look. Again, we do -- repeat that for me one more time. Monica, I believe -- yes, we do have landfall. They have just confirmed it. We have landfall as of right now. So the center of the storm has officially crossed into Florida as we speak as a Category 3 storm near Keaton Beach. So repeating, we do have official landfall near Keaton Beach, Florida as a Category 3 storm. Again, these impacts are going to continue as this storm continues to slide off to the north and east. Those outer bands are going to continue to push very heavy rain, very gusty winds. And yes, the potential for some tornadoes also exists across these areas as well. Back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. You know, Sara, with the National Hurricane Center just calling landfall in Keaton Beach, this is the strongest hurricane to impact the Big Bend region in over 125 years. And get this, folks -- this is the third landfalling hurricane in Florida in 12 months -- wow. What does that have to say about people who try to insure their homes within this -- within this state? That's a whole nother topic.But where I'm located -- this is Bayshore Boulevard, a major artery -- a thoroughfare for Tampa, which is over my right shoulder. And I think the pictures speak for themselves. This area has completely flooded and it has encroached on homes as well. I'm going to have my cameraman just walk with me and help paint this picture because the surge is still coming in from Tampa Bay. We checked one of the tidal gauges near where we're located. It is currently at record levels -- 5 1/2 feet of storm surge near the tidal surge gauge that is closest to me. That is incredible. Records go back to 1991. So we're in record territory. And this is all working together almost in a symphony of cataclysmic events, right? We have not only a powerful major hurricane pushing up the water across the eastern sections of the Gulf of Mexico -- a very shallow water basin, by the way -- but we also have inland flooding that is moving from the -- from it -- from the ground towards the ocean. So these working together in conjunction. They meet in the middle and they rise up the water levels. That is also being combined with the impacts of a full moon, which is a supermoon, and that just has that great tidal swings with the highs and the lows. So even though we're nearing a low tide in Tampa Bay, we're still getting the surge and the impacts from this storm that is 200 miles away from us. Just incredible -- Sara.",

We're out of power. The storm surge is -- has overwhelmed our downtown, our Dock Street, our boat ramps. The bridges on the way into town. It's going to be a while before anyone will be able to get on or off the island. We're effectively cut off from the world now.",
