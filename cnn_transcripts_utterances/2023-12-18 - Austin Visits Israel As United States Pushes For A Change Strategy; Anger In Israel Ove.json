The U.S. Defense Secretary LloydAustin, meeting with top Israeli officials today, as the Biden administration presses for a more targeted approach in Israel's offensive against Hamas. And the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza, telling CNN, more than 100 people were killed in Israeli attacks and Jabalya, in northern Gaza, just in the past 24 hours. And on the humanitarian front, a senior Israeli official say, some 478 trucks passed inspection and entered Gaza on Sunday, and aid entered the enclave from the Israeli Karem Shalom crossing for the first time since October 7th. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon for us, Jeremy Diamond will join us from Tel Aviv in just a moment's time.

And that is because, of course, this high intensity stage of the military operations in Gaza against Hamas have killed thousands and thousands of Palestinian civilians, something that the U.S. really wants to see be avoided, to say the least. And so, Secretary of Defense Austin is going to be speaking to his counterparts, the Israeli Defense Minister, as well as Israel's war Cabinet, about their assessment of what their remaining military objectives are in this current phase of the operation and how realistic it is for them to move into a next phase, a more targeted phase that really goes after senior Hamas leaders using intelligence driven analysis that allows them to spare civilian casualties, which of course, we've seen on a very, very large scale over the last several months. The secretary of defense is expected to say in his remarks today, of course, that he stands 100 percent behind Israel, that the United States continues to support their campaign to eradicate Hamas and to degrade it to such an extent that they cannot launch an attack on Israel like they did ever again on October 7th. But, at the same time, you know, Austin has said repeatedly that the Israelis have a moral imperative as well as -- as well as a strategic one if they want to be able to get to any kind of lasting peace to really try to protect to the extent possible, the civilian population in Gaza. And so, that's going to be really the priority for Austin when he finishes these meetings today. And we expect to hear a bit more from him during a press conference that's expected very soon.",

The U.S. said last week that they were not necessarily optimistic about that, but it seems as though there could be some more movement because the head of the Mossad, Israel's military intelligence agency, he has been meeting with the Qataris as well to try to get these back on track. And so, there are more than 100 hostages, including Americans that are believed to still being held -- being held in Gaza. And this all comes, these tensions over the hostages released after Israel mistakenly killed three hostages during a military operation in Gaza on Friday.

Thousands of people marching on Israel's defense and military headquarters in Tel Aviv to demand that the Israeli government reach another deal to free the more than 100 hostages, who are still captive in Gaza. And the Israeli prime minister, in particular, is coming under intense pressure, but also intense criticism, including from several former hostages who have accused him of lacking sufficient intelligence and information about the whereabouts of hostages, of not doing enough, not prioritizing the release of hostages enough, and instead, being more focused on his own political survival, and of course, on the war effort that he is undertaking inside Gaza. And so far, we have heard the Israeli Prime Minister really try and claim that the military campaign in Gaza is helping to pressure Hamas to release more hostages. But we also saw, of course, on Friday, the pitfalls of that military campaign, which really made the worst fears of a lot of hostage families come true, as they have been concerned for weeks now that this military campaign could put their loved ones in danger. And not only have former hostages described coming under artillery, shelling and bombardment from the Israeli military while they were being hostages -- held hostage, but now of course, we also have this incident from Friday.",

There is the risk premium, as you said, there is also the real risk to life. Now, the issue is to try and get from Europe to Asia, this was a lucrative shortcut. And to go the long way round, I think we have a map where we can show you just how much longer it is. It's around 40 percent longer to go around the west coast of Africa, around the Cape of Good Hope. That means a huge pressure on shipping capacity, of course, much more in terms of the cost of fuel that it would take to do that, because that trip is going to take a week or more longer. So, this has implications for all of these companies for shipping rates, for freight rates, that feeds into inflation. This is the sort of scenario that if sustained, will impact us all worldwide, as it could cause increase the cost of all sorts of goods.",

On Sunday, the French foreign minister was in Tel Aviv to talk about prospects for a, \"new humanitarian truce\", which she says could facilitate the release of hostages and the flow of aid. The Israeli public too is losing patience. Protesters have been turning out to plead with their government to bring the more than 100 remaining hostages home from Gaza. Their angst amplified by the IDF's accidental killing of three hostages as we've been discussing already. Some relatives of the captives fearing their loved ones could now be next.
