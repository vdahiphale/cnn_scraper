      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, the list of contenders to become theBritish Prime Minister will likely feature a familiar face. We'll tell you who all is throwing support behind Boris Johnson. Then, President Zelenskyy is warning that Russia is about to sabotage a dam that could flood huge portions of Ukraine. And the January 6 Committee has just issued a subpoena to Donald Trump the same day his former adviser Steve Bannon's is sentenced to four months in jail for contempt of Congress. More on those top stories in just a moment. But first, in Britain, the race is on once again for the next prime minister. In the last few hours, House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt declared she is throwing her hat in the ring. This as the halls of power really reel from Liz Truss' resignation on Thursday. Two other lawmakers appear to be emerging as frontrunners for the Conservative Party leadership. Former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, who narrowly missed out on the top job during the last race, just over really a month ago. And even former leader Boris Johnson is garnering some early support from MPs, you'll remember he stepped down not so long ago in July, in fact, amid a wave of scandal. I want to bring in CNN's Bianca Nobilo who is live for us outside 10 Downing Street. So, Bianca, good to see you. Penny Mordaunt officially throwing her hat in the ring. The first one to do so, how do the numbers stack up though in terms of the support behind each one?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Penny Mordaunt, the first ever female secretary of state for defense here in this country, currentlyholding the prestigious position of leader of the House of Commons, is now our only official candidate so far. She said that she was encouraged by colleagues to stand for the sake of the national interest and unity of the party, and says that she wants to win the next general election. In terms of where she stacks up with the big three that people are talking about at the moment. Well, Rishi Sunak, he was the MPs favorite last time, this was all going on not that long ago, is still the MPs favorite according to recent tallies. He's got around 70 MPs declaring for him at this stage. Then, Boris Johnson, will he return or won't he? Has around half that number. And then trailing behind them is Penny Mordaunt who hasn't quite reached the support of 20 Mps I understand. But there's still some time left because the nominations and the vote from MPs will happen on Monday. So this weekend, you can imagine that supporters will be hitting the phones, they'll be having plenty of backroom discussions. Because it will depend quite a lot on if anybody else comes out of the woodworks, because these candidates are candidates from different wings of the party. Mordaunt is more in the center. She gets a lot of her support from that part of the party. She could steal votes of both Johnson and Sunak for that reason. But what if another right-wing favorite candidate like Suella Braverman or Kemi Badenoch comes forward? That would split votes of other candidates too. So, a lot to look out for. But of course, the big question of the evening for everybody here is, is Boris Johnson going to stand? And the consensus is that if he feel like he can get that number of a 100 MPs, he will, because if he won't, he doesn't like to lose.",

Well, as Ukrainian forces close in on the occupied city of Kherson, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns Russia is planning a new and dangerous false flag operation. Now, he says Russia is placing mines at a critical dam in a hydroelectric plant on the Dnipro river. If those structures are destroyed, you can imagine, it would send a huge wall of water into southern Ukraine washing away people's houses and would deprive the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant of cooling water. Now, Russia says Ukraine's accusations are nonsense, claiming there's no point in destroying the dam now. Nic Robertson joins me now this evening from Kyiv. And Nic, this dam is, you know, very near the city of Kherson where we have seen one of the fiercest battles as Ukraine tries to push its counteroffensive. So how plausible is this claim, and critically, what is Ukraine doing about it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and the battles are still ongoing there. The Dnipro River and how to get across it is ahuge strategic issue for both sides. The Russians potentially to retreat back across it, and if they were to blow it to stop the Ukrainians advancing onto them on the east bank of it. And for the Ukrainians, for it to be intact, to be able to get across it and chase the Russian forces further, it was only a few days ago, it seems, perhaps at the beginning of this week, that the Russians were actually saying it was the Ukrainians that were going to blow the dam, and they were using that as an excuse to tell and force the civilian residents of Kherson that they needed to evacuate and get across the river before the Ukrainians blew it up. And the Ukrainians were saying, that was rubbish. You know, what we've seen in this war until now is that often times, Russia will say something, say the other side is going to do it, try to blame them, and then do it. A false flag operation. But the stakes which you say are so high here. If you blow this Novakivka hydroelectric power plant dam up, you do, you potentially wash out towns and villages that are close to the river, kill people, injure people. But it's perhaps the upstream effect that is the most worrying. And that is because this Dnipro River is a big lake, obviously, above the dam. That's a huge river. And that river is used for cooling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. And without that vital cooling, I think it's very clear that the nuclear power plant itself could become unstable, and that's a very dangerous scenario. And that's what the Ukrainians are worried about. Partly, because or exacerbated by the fact that Russians were trying to blame it on them earlier in the week. And I think that adds the concerns that this could be a real thing that happens. And they're saying right now they believe the Russians have got trucks, two military trucks full of explosives sitting right on top of the dam. That's the Intelligence Ukrainians say they have.",

This is a peak time, it will stress the system. What they're trying to do is encourage people to use less power so that they have time to repair the infrastructure that's been damaged. But some of it is very hard. And if you go south of here, to the city of Kryvyi Rih, a big city, a big industrial city in the center of the country, there are actually police who are monitoring electricity consumption at night. If they see somewhere that's got a lot of light on outside a commercial premise, maybe that has a lot of lights on, they will go there and find out why the lights are on and why they're not switched off, and try to enforce some of their requests for people to back off on their use of power.",

What does the committee say, what is it asking for? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, the committee is with this subpoena, they're asking for two things. They're asking for documents from Donald Trump, and they're asking for testimony from Donald Trump. This isn't the first time a president or former president has been subpoenaed. But this is really such a unique situation with this House Select Committee investigating January 6. They have done months of investigation, talked to hundreds if not thousands of witnesses, collected many documents. And there is a lot more that they still want to learn. And what they want to do here, Isa, is they want to put Donald Trump at the center of everything. They believe that he has the key pieces of information that could explain everything that happened after the election and everything leading up to this attack on the Capitol on January 6th, his supporters overrunning Congress, blocking the ability for several hours of them to certify the presidency of Joe Biden. And they really want to ask questions that only Donald Trump would know the answer to. They go through lots and lots of topics that they have researched, that they've gathered information on, that they want information from him, how he was interacting with the Justice Department, with members of Congress, what he was doing with electors, that would be certifying the vote in their states, what he was doing in the court system. All of it comes back to Donald Trump. And that is the point that they make here. There are some options he has now, whether he could comply or not.

But in court, he let his attorney speak. Whenever a defendant is sentenced, whenever they come to court, they often do want to apologize to the judge, show remorse. That was not the approach that Steve Bannon took at all. His attorney David Schoen instead spoke for about 30 minutes, just railing about the House Select Committee and the process. Essentially saying that, you know, Steve Bannon doesn't need to make any apologies here. What the judge should do should be specific findings under the law to give him an easy sentence.

A militant group has claimed him as a member. Israeli security forces say they came under attack and responded with live fire. Israel has intensified raids in the West Bank following deadly attacks on Israelis. More than 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces this year. We are also following a rise in violence at the hands of Jewish settlers. The Israeli daily \"Haaretz\" says there have been hundred attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank in the last 10 days alone. But the victims aren't always Palestinian. A 70-year-old Israeli woman was injured on Wednesday, reportedly suffering broken ribs and a punctured lung. She and other activists were helping Palestinians harvest olives when settlers attacked them with rocks as well as clubs. Five people were also injured. And just yesterday, a settler, if you remember, we told you this story, attack drew an outrage response from the highest levels of the Israeli government.

And some specific stuff that we are anticipating in season five of The Crown, which will be around Prince Charles, now King Charles's relationship with his mother, some comments that he makes throughout the season, which are getting people upset really. And preceding Judi Dench saying that, John Major, who was the Prime Minister at the time, and as reflected in season five of The Crown, he also made comments very critical of The Crown and both are fearing almost that a new generation of people will watch this drama on Netflix and believe that the events took place in exactly the way that they are represented.

So the reason -- I think that we'rehaving this conversation today, the hook for all this is that the YouTube trailer, which came out yesterday for season five, in the comments at the top of the description of the trailer, it now does provide this sentence that people have been calling for for a little while. So it now says inspired by real events. This fictional dramatization tells the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the political and personal events that shaped her reign, and it's that bit at the start, this fictional dramatization. People want Netflix to go further. They want every episode to flash that up at the beginning. And this isn't new, by the way. This has been something that some have called for for a good couple of years since the previous season, the fourth season. Netflix were, when I was writing about this today, Netflix were keen to point out they do use this fictional dramatization line on social media. They use it in marketing materials around the show, they had this ready already. And it's the comment in the trailer that has been updated as of today. So an interesting -- it will be interesting to see what happens between now and the launch of the show, which is November the 9th.",
