I mean, I've served on the Judiciary Committee with her. We have introduced legislation together. She is one of the people on the Judiciary Committee who I think sincerely wants to work on bills with Democrats. And so, for her to be the person to change her vote from McCarthy to present, I think is a really bad sign for Kevin McCarthy. And also, you know, she is someone who is from a district that at least in 2020, Democrats were competing in. I mean, I remember being on a zoom with Ron Klein and others during orientation where Ron Klein said directly to her that he had been supporting her opponent in 2020. And so, I don't know how our district may have changed in this last cycle, but we would think that she would be one of the people who would be supporting Kevin McCarthy pretty staunchly.",

I think it just goes to show that his standing in the House is not what it used to be.And I was on Capitol Hill and in the White House for fights where a call from Donald Trump could move mountains within the House Republican Conference. And that's not the case anymore. And it's fascinating because Kevin McCarthy did everything to stay in Trump's good graces to keep this endorsement until this day, but the problem is, is he so diminished the endorsement does not matter on January 3, 2023?",

Ken is known to be more on the far-right of our conference. He's right though when concessions are made to get votes out of those 20. It could upset the apple cart. It could upset some folks who are already supported with Kevin McCarthy.Look, I talked to Brian Fitzpatrick, who was one of those, and that animated conversation on the center aisle not too long ago. Ken reiterated what Brian told me when he said there are some of those 20, they want rules changes. Those are things that Kevin McCarthy can do to get those votes back. But there are still going to be a number of Republicans that are not going to ever support Kevin McCarthy. But when Ken Buck stands up -- and he does not represent a good chunk of the 201 others that are holding up for McCarthy, but when Ken Buck gets up and starts talking about alternatives, and ending this tonight, you got to wonder if there's some more that he's already talked to that would make this more of an issue for Kevin McCarthy.",

He and Congressman, I think, it was Troy Nehls were two that we thought might vote against McCarthy on the first ballot, but he hasn't. He's gone with McCarthy for five.

I mean we had one week -- the last week of the election. There were 8000 gross rating points in one medium market. So, the money was there.The outside groups were coming from all over. And these are things that you can nuance. If somebody really wants to get to yes you can figure out a way to give them a seat at the table so that they can make decisions. But the key is how many are willing to get to yes, and how many are just hell no on Kevin.",
