So, tell us -- there are a lot of parents watching, I'm a parent here -- tell us what we know about this phenomenon. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: This is fascinating. And I've got to tell you, I've learned so much working on this podcast season. As you both know, I have three teenage daughters. So, part of this was a very personal sort of reporting mission as well. But it's exactly what you said, it's called the selfie effect. This is a term that was coined by Professor Sinclair-McBride, who basically was looking at this idea of people scrolling through oftentimes heavily filtered photoshopped images of unfathomable looking people, unrealistic-looking people, and then in real-time compare them to your own selfies. And what that does to one's brain, what that does to a developing brain, the feelings of inadequacy that sort of come up as a result of that, that's sort of the real selfie effect. And it's real, not only in terms of how people feel, but also, again, what is happening in their brains. What was interesting is that, you know, people are aware that the images they're looking at on social media are often not real in the sense that they are filtered, photoshopped, et cetera. But it doesn't really insulate them from comparing those images still to their own images in real-time. And that's what's happening more and more as more and more selfies are out there and they're paired with these other images, you get that selfie impact, selfie effect, which can be a negative impact.",
