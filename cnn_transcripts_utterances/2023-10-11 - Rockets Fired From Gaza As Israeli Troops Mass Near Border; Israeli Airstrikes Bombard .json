      "sentences": "Events are moving on the ground here in Israel quickly. The nation, of course, preparing for war, a nation at war already. Positioning hundreds of thousands of soldiers near the border with Gaza. In the five days since Hamas's terror attack, Israel and Gaza are now each reporting over 1,000 deaths. Officials are urgently trying to negotiate ways to get civilians out of areas likely to be hit hard during any kind of ground operations. A senior Israeli official tells CNN that talks are on to try to allow U.S. citizens who are in Gaza and Palestinian civilians to be able to leave the Gaza Strip into Egypt. That's something Egypt has always resisted in past years ahead of a possible Israeli ground invasion.And then, of course, there are the hostages. Up to 150 people believed to have been captured by Hamas and other groups like Islamic Jihad, including an unknown number of Americans. Sources tell CNN that the nation of Qatar has been mediating in talks with Hamas to try to release women and children that have been kidnapped. America's top U.S. hostage official is accompanying the Secretary of State as he leaves for Israel. So there's a lot of moving parts to this. Joining me right now is Daniel Flesch, a former spokesperson at Israel's mission to the United Nations. Daniel, thanks for being with us. You've said that Iran may have wanted to poison the developing normal relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia. I've talked to other people, Thomas Friedman and others, about that. Can you talk about why any potential deal with Saudi Arabia would be so threatening to Iran? DANIEL FLESCH, FORMER SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL'S MISSION TO THE UN: Well, certainly Anderson. So a deal will be threatening to Iran because Saudi Israeli normalization efforts would signal as paradigm shift and change in the Middle East. It would effectively end the 70 plus year Arab/Israeli War, Arab War on Israel. The Abraham Accords from a couple of years ago were only approved because Saudi Arabia gave sanction to them. It's the peace relationships between Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, and clearly the great white whale for Israel and the Middle East is Saudi Arabia. [15:35:00] So the question is being asked, why did Hamas attack Israel today? Or last -- this past weekend? Why is it happening now? It's because last month, for example, at the UN General Assembly, Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, announced publicly that the peace negotiations or normalization talks are going positively. So Iran fears a new Saudi/Israeli rapprochement and they are doing everything they can to interrupt that.",

There is now concern -- though the White House denies it -- that Iran was directly involved in these attacks. The White House has said that there's no evidence yet of a smoking gun at this stage.But certainly blames Iran broadly for their support of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. There's a lot of questions. Jake Sullivan was peppered with questions yesterday about is the White House going to rethink the unfreezing of those 6 billion? They say none of it's been spent. Do you think they should and what impact might that have on events?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly Iran has had a hand. Well, there's no smoking gun found yet. Iran has had a hand and orchestrated this entire event because Hamas is a wholly owned subsidiary of Iran. Similarly with Hezbollah in the north. So even if Iran did not give the order to Hamas. It's been providing funding for providing munitions, providing training, et cetera. So whether relates to the $6 billion, that's only a small drop in the 10s of billions of dollars that Iran has recouped throughout this administration from oil exports and from other measures and means.So if the administration were able to stop the transfer the $6 billion, that's phenomenal, but does not change the fact that Iran, for the last couple of years, has felt incredibly emboldened in the region. And so anything going forward needs to realize that Iran again, even if it did not directly order Hamas to initiate the attack, the atrocious attacks on Israeli civilians, Americans to mind you from this weekend, it certainly has been instrumental in key in planning it.",

      "sentences": "If Egypt was to allow not only American citizens in Gaza -- who are currently in Gaza living there with family, whatever it may be -- and a certain number of civilians in Gaza to leave and to cross over into Egypt. From a military standpoint, I assume that would actually help Israel to have fewer civilians on the ground in Gaza itself during any kind of ground operation. But what would that look like? I mean, do you think that is logistically possible because there are a lot of people in Gaza who would like to leave Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Well, people forget that you point out though, Gaza has two borders, one with Israel and another one with Egypt. So there's no reason why, for example, the Egyptians shouldn't be allowing Gazans to leave. And that's a different policy issue on their end. But it's not very difficult to get from areas of the Gaza Strip to Egypt. And certainly, you know, whenever there's a war, it'd be great if the wars were conducted in isolated rural environments. But it's not going to be the case and particularly not here because Hamas is embedded among its civilian population.We can't forget Hamas perfected the use of human shields. And it will want to use every civilian they can to retard the advance of the, you know, of the Israeli Defense Forces and to make a PR campaign of the offensive that's to come. So certainly any civilians able to get out of Gaza through Egypt should be making their way there. But ultimately, whatever happens to the population in Gaza Strip is a responsibility of Hamas.",

The first shipment of advanced munitions from the U.S. arrived in Israel today -- you see that video there.Let's discuss with Major John Spencer. He's an army veteran and chair of urban warfare studies at West Point. He's also the co-author of \"Understanding Urban Warfare.\" Sir, thank you so much for being with us. Among the challenges you say that the IDF could face in Gaza as we take a look at some drone footage from that area. You mentioned rockets, drones, tunnels, even civilian human shields. What's your concern about a ground operation there? How do the Israelis combat all of that? MAJ. JOHN SPENCER, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Yes, I mean, have thought through a lot of that and there's lots of ways, especially the human shield, right? That's the, that's the big giant concern of the operation in any of the urban areas in Gaza. But the idea know how to tell the civilians to leave. They have already issued videos, photos, text. But it's hard because Hamas also is very known in all past operations to keep those civilians in those buildings, to keep them on the streets and then air their deaths as a pursuit of their objectives.",

Because we've gotten reports that there was some Hezbollah activity here in the border with Lebanon. There are obviously a lot of groups in Syria that are anti- Israel.

An operation into Gaza will take 100 plus over that thousand forces actually in the fight. So yes, a different front, a second front, a third front. Would call it a stretch the idea thin. It would be really challenging and that's why this is a very sensitive situation. It does look like Israel plans to execute the Gaza mission, but it'll be trying to keep that second front and the third front from opening for sure.",

It's still not clear how many people living in Nir Oz, were murdered or wounded or kidnapped.
