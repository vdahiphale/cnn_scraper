Blinken heads to Israel next where he will discuss the Hamas response with senior government officials. We still don't know many details, but Blinken appears cautiously optimistic. Have a listen.

The court thoroughly weighed all of his arguments and on each critical question, they disagreed with what he had to say. They said in one unanimous voice, the three women on this panel said unanimously that there is no absolute immunity for a United States president. Let me read for you something that they wrote, in this opinion, we've been going through it all day. There is so much in here. They said, \"It would be a striking paradox if the president, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity.\" Isa, they were saying that the whole theory of immunity just doesn't make sense under our system of government with checks and balances.

I think the world's gaze has moved so far away from here. And there's a pragmatic reason why that is so wrong. There's a moral reason, of course, because such a child is a child, and they are suffering greatly here. But we are not just talking about the potential loss of so many lives. I have met, Isa, dozens of children in the last week, 20-year-olds who -- you know, who just were born in those last massacre of 20 years ago. They studied engineering, they studied medicine, they studied economics. They are this vibrant force, desperate to be a part of their communities. And as one said to me, I simply cannot dream, James. I cannot dream here. So, it's one thing that we are threatened with this catastrophic loss of life. We cannot lose this generation, this opportunity of a generation who have an education. That's why they feel forgotten, and to a degree they are. That's why we are trying, again, to sound alarm bells on their behalf.",

And it's like you said, a crisis on top of a crisis. And on -- you know, one other crisis that you are focused, that you and I've spoken of here on the show is Gaza. I mean, how hard is this for NGOs to balance?",

You can do a simple cost onsaving a child's life and you will know very much so that it is both affordable and it gets more and more expensive. So, there's a great difficulty into being spread too thin. An agency like UNICEF is fortunate. We are on the front lines in Afghanistan, in Gaza, here. But it's the resources. We are literally, at a time now, as you rightly point out, with so many children in need. Talk about displacement, Isa, literally, if you look at how many children have been displaced, imagine 500 classrooms of children in Europe or the United States. 500 classrooms of children. That's how many children are displaced every day here. Every single day. And this is the same time that donors are moving away from Sudan. That can't happen. That's not right in practice or in principle. And this is a regional -- a region that is very, very important. It goes beyond the children of Sudan.",

We are getting some official findings -- this just coming into CNN from an investigation into that terrifying doorplug incident, if you remember, on the Boeing 737 plane in the U.S. Northwest. In its preliminary report, the National Transportation Safety Board says, four bolts that hold the door plug in place were missing at the time of the incident. More than 170 people were on board when a passenger door flew off midair just more than a month ago. The newly released findings echo reports by two U.S. airlines that operate the MAX 9. They said, inspections of their fleet revealed loose bolts. Now, the preliminary report is saying that four bolts were missing. We'll have much more on their story in about 10 minutes or so in the next hour of \"Quest Means Business\". Well, in Germany, thousands are protesting against right wing extremism. The rally in Frankfurt comes after weeks of demonstrations against the far- right alternative for the Germany party. Prompted by a report that two senior party members had attended a meeting with plans for mass deportation of migrants. The AFD has denied that the proposal represents party policy. Now, as Seb Shukla reports, the rise in the AFD is dividing Germany. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEBASTIAN SHUKLA, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over): It's boots on the ground in Freienthal for the alternative for Deutschland, the AFD. In this tiny Brandenburg village, Germany's far-right party are doing what many say their government aren't, talking to them. But as night falls, protesters spring with a message. Germany has been down this path before. Never again means now. ADAM SEVENS, PROTEST ORGANIZER (through translator): The AFD's plans only reveals the xenophobia, hatred and bigotry that exists in this country. SHUKLA (voice-over): Views that are not hard to find across the road in the village hall. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I'm glad that someone is taking care of all this scum that has spread in our country, in our beautiful Germany. SHUKLA (voice-over): Pro and AFD curious supporters have gathered to hear from party officials. The message even has Trumpian undertones. Our country first, posters say.",
