It comes after Israeli officials have agreed to daily humanitarian pauses after facing pressure from the White House. This morning, we have been seeing thousands of Palestinians, including families with small children, streaming through Gaza City as they make their way south. The window to get out is about to close in an hour. The fighting has not stopped everywhere. A new video into CNN this morning shows Israeli tanks at a hospital in northern Gaza. You hear the sound of explosion, heavy gunfire. The hospital's director is pleading for help to evacuate doctors and patients as the fighting intensifies.",

It really -- this diplomatic cable really speaks to the profound concern among some American diplomats and U.S. officials about the frustration that has been bubbling up in the Arab world over the U.S. support for Israel's campaign in Gaza.This diplomatic cable was sent from the embassy in Oman to the National Security Council, FBI, and CIA. And in that cable that was obtained by our colleagues Priscilla Alverez and Alex Marquardt, an official in Oman working for the United States said that the robust U.S. support for Israel's actions is being seen as, quote, \"material and more culpability\" in what they consider to be possible war crimes. This comes as the president has really been facing growing pressure since the beginning of this conflict as you have seen these dire images of the situation in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis that has been playing out there. Of course, there are not just concerns on the world stage, but also back at home, just yesterday, President Biden was in Illinois and there were pro-Palestinian protesters outside of his event. One audience member at the president's event related to unions, actually, interrupted the president, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Of course, U.S. officials refrained for calling for a ceasefire. Instead, they've been pushing for additional pause to get more aid into Gaza. But it does come as the president is grappling with this growing concern not just here at home but also in the Arab world about the U.S. support for Israel.",

My advice and opinion on this this is to do a clean C.R. with aid to Israel so we can move the ball down the field here, make sure that Israel has the support that it needs in the immediate, and that we give ourselves more time to finish the appropriations work.Obviously, governing can be messy, and when you're going through an appropriations process that has been broken over 30 years with omnibus after omnibus after omnibus and everything jammed into it, we are trying to unwind that. And it takes time to pass these single subject appropriations spending bills. And as you can see, there is debate even within the Republican conference about some of the measures that are in them. But ultimately, we need to get to a point where we can pass these appropriation bills, force the Senate to do the same, and conference them. You need more time. Obviously, the speaker battle and fiasco that ensued over the last month wasted a lot of time on that 45-day C.R. So we need to get back to the process here. We started passing bills. We did a lot of amendment work. But there is still a lot of work to do. And so from my vantage point, let's pass a clean C.R., extend the timeframe a bit, get aid to Israel, and focus on the real fight, which is on appropriations, the border, and, obviously, Ukraine.",

Coming from a state legislature, nowhere else in America can you put forth a bill and not show how you are going to pay for it. And in Washington, they just want to spend without any means to pay for it. That doesn't work. This administration increased spending by other $5 trillion in the first two years. We are facing a $34 trillion debt, national debt. Republicans got elected to serve as a check and balance and to start to rein in the reckless spending. Obviously, I and my colleagues support aid to Israel, and I want to see that get done as expeditiously as possible. I also support aid to Ukraine. But you have to pay for these things.",
