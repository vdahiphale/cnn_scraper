But let's look back a year ago, almost exactly to the day, December 1st, 2022. That's when it really kicked off this Southwest scheduling crisis that started with a winter storm in southwest major hubs, in Chicago midway, in Denver. And then caused a behind-the-scenes meltdown of Southwest Airlines' scheduling system. We are talking 16,900 flights canceled, two million people stranded. I just spoke to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. He says this is all because Southwest did not properly communicate with its customers, did not give the best possible customer service. And that they did not give refunds quick enough, even though Southwest has already given $600 million in refunds and reimbursements to customers. And the big thing here, Buttigieg tells me, is that this is really to send a message to other airlines. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

High wind warnings of up to 60 miles per hour still right now. The storm will move away this evening and the winds will die off. There will still be some gusts through the Great Lakes where there has been some snow in the early morning hours. I know how we've talked about how bad on the east coast this was. There was quite a bit of difficult driving across difficult parts of Chicago earlier today. But this is what Patterson, New Jersey, looked like. People being removed from the cars. Still 40 million people with flood alerts going on right now because it is still raining, and because the wind is still pushing the water, the salt water on up into these estuaries. But look how this rainfall came down here in parts of the low country of South Carolina. This is Horry County, South Carolina -- Georgetown, Myrtle Beach, North Myrtle, Murrells Inlet, all of that. Up to 10 inches of rainfall, plus the storm surge pushing that water backup into Surfside, back up into Charleston. This was a saltwater flood for Charleston. Some of these numbers are as high as they have been without a tropical name to a storm. So this was a big wind event, pushing all that water on up into Charleston as well. I hate saltwater floods because they do so much more damage than freshwater floods. Nothing is savable really when you get saltwater in electrical wires. It just has to all be pushed away.",

They do not want this war to expand. The U.S. has been the principal first responder, if you want to call them that, in these attacks. And they're shooting down a great deal of the missiles and drones, et cetera. But some get through and the risk is so high that you have shipping companies just saying we are out, right? I mean, major ones, like Maersk is not going through there, a big container ship company. B.P. is not shipping its oil through there. And that's impacting the amount of oil going to the canal. It's an effective blockade, right, not just for a lot of the oil and products going through there but for the Israeli port in the southern part of the country. So they have not figured out a solution. Shooting down a lot of missiles is not stopping the Houthi's from firing the missiles and some get through. But it seems that part of Austen's goal on this Mideast trip is to get the allies together and say, OK, we will respond to this together. But among the allies, there are differences in how they want to respond. The UAE is for more forceful military action. Saudi Arabia favors diplomacy. Diplomacy is not working right now.

DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, the good news is that we're not where we were last year at this time, which was much worse. Last year, there was an earlier season and we were also seeing this triple- demic of RSV, Covid and flu, which we are seeing again this year. It appears that the level of RSV this year has probably peaked. But we're seeing an increase in flu. We're seeing an increase in Covid. And it probably is going to get worse coming into the holiday season when people are gathering more, going indoors and so forth. But that said, this is not that much out of the ordinary compared to before Covid. It is now that we have an additional virus to contend with. So people should take the steps that we have been talking about all long to try to reduce the risk of infection, including opening windows and doors, getting fresh air in, making sure that we wash our hands really well. And if people have not yet gotten the flu shot or if you're a particularly vulnerable persons, you have not gotten your Covid shot or a flu shot if you're 60 and older, for example, make sure you do it now ahead of the holidays.",

So we're dealing with a whole panoply of viruses here. People should get tested for flu and Covid if they are going to be able to seek treatment. So there are people who are eligible for Tamiflu or Paxlovid, these antiviral treatments. They should be sure to get tested. Everybody else, probably less important that they get tested. Because otherwise, we should be testing all the time because people just have runny noses all the time. So most of these symptoms can be treated at home. But the things that probably should count medical attention would include shortness of breath or chest pain, a very severe cough and high fevers that don't go away. And also individuals at the extremes of ages. So newborns and elderly individuals, as well as people that are immunocompromised or chronic lung and heart problems, they should seek medical care sooner. And also seek medical care sooner if you're eligible for the antiviral treatments. Because the sooner that you can get the treatments, the more it can help to prevent severe disease.",
