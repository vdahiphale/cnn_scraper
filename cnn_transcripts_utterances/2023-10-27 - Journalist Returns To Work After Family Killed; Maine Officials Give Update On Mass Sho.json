Right now, I want to show this footage coming into us from Israel. Officials say earlier on Friday a building in Tel Aviv was hit by rocket fire, injuring three people. They say one of the victims suffered head wounds. Meanwhile, the IDF says the focus is on continuing its aerial bombardment. More on this as we get it. I just want to take you to Maine in the states now. We're going to get an update on the mass shooting there in the past 48 hours. Let's listen in. CHIEF DAVID ST. PIERRE, LEWISTON, MAINE POLICE: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, members of the media and the public who are watching closely as law enforcement continues to work diligently on this rapidly evolving investigation. The safety of our community remains paramount. I want to assure all that a tremendous amount of law enforcement, manpower, time and effort is being utilized around the clock, literally around the clock, in every effort to apprehend the suspect as well as to safeguard this community. As the chief of the Lewiston, Maine Police Department, I am extremely thankful for the community's outpouring of support being offered during this tense and trying time. I extend my deepest appreciation for all of our law enforcement partners who have responded from literally, literally around this nation. Again, I will ask the community to be as patient as possible with this process, realizing that there are many, many moving parts and coordination of efforts involved between multiple agencies. We will attempt to provide as much information possible as this investigation proceeds forward. We would also like to acknowledge and thank the many businesses, restaurant owners, individuals who have provided meals and other essential items to support an investigation of this magnitude. Following this press conference, details will be shared regarding counseling locations, where somebody can make a donation if necessary or asked, and the hosting of several different vigils. I'm sorry. On behalf of hundreds of law enforcement officers who have descended upon our great city over the last three days, we want to extend our heartfelt support as well as our sympathies to the victims and families involved in this senseless tragedy. Thank you, and I'll turn it back over to Mike.",

Eleni Giokos is in Abu Dhabi.Well, diplomatic sources are telling me that even with what they are calling significant progress in the hostage talks led by Qatar with Hamas, issues still remain. But the word breakthrough is being used. And I am told talks are ongoing. Now this follows the high-profile release of two hostages earlier this week. So what do we know at this point? Well, there are still at least 220 Israeli and foreign nationals being held in Gaza according to the Israelis. At least 220. The negotiations are centered around the release of civilians as we understand it. If successful, that could mean the release of as many as 50 or more. In an interview with the \"Washington Post\" on Thursday, one Hamas leader in Beirut is reported to have said that the group is demanding a five-day cease-fire in these negotiations and the opening of the Rafah Border Crossing for injured people in Gaza to seek medical help in Egypt, and for more aid, fuel, medical supplies, for example, to come in. That is certainly what is being reported to be the position of Hamas. Qatar, where I am of course, playing a pivotal role is interlocutor in these negotiations and the negotiations for the release of the four prisoners, the four hostages that we have already seen last Friday. Remember, an American mother with her 17-year-old daughter, and earlier this week on Tuesday, the release of two elderly Israeli ladies. So the Qataris at the center of these negotiations. The senior negotiator on the Qatari side has said that the mediators in all of this need a period of calm and that the situation in Gaza is, as described by Mohammed al Khulaifi, very critical, verging on a disaster. Let's bring in Nic Robertson, who is down in Sderot, and get a sense from Nic as to exactly what he believes is going on. We had the Israeli defense minister on Thursday insisting, Nic, that his forces are preparing for the, quote, \"next stages.\" He also said his forces would do, quote, \"everything needed\" to bring back those hostages being held by Hamas. We also, just a caveat here for our viewers, it does seem clear that Hamas doesn't hold all of these hostages, all of these 220 odd hostages at this point. Be that as it may, we know the families of those being held are demanding that Israeli forces take or the Israeli government takes action to get these hostages released. This is a very difficult situation, isn't it, for the military at this point? What is your sense of what is going on as we hear more about a breakthrough in these negotiations, about the potential that the demands from Hamas are for a, for example, five-day cease-fire? What are you hearing on the ground about what may happen next?",

I think that if the president had a shred of decency, he would get on television and apologize for his remarks. It is of course in keeping with the line of this administration which is more Israeli than Israelis. It sometimes seems like the president is reading from an Israeli teleprompter in his remarks.

And I think we have to understand we're talking about young peoplewho are still learning and who in some cases are not fully mature politically, or otherwise. And I think that you have to cut them some slack. And I think that if you accept the freedom of speech and academic freedom of values that we cherish, then people -- even people crossing the line have to be, there has to be some slack cut for them. But the point I would stress is that, in particular, students and others who are supporting Palestinian rights may not necessarily be supporting Hamas per se. I mean, certainly I hope and assume supporting the killing of innocent civilians. However, they are operating in an entirely hostile environment as is typified by the president's remarks from the beginning of this conflict until the end. In fact, he didn't have the decency to talk in any detail about the thousands of Palestinian casualties, civilian casualties. 3,000 children have been killed. And I would expect the president, even as he talks about the poor, innocent Israelis who have been killed, to talk about the poor, much larger numbers of poor innocence Palestinians who have been killed. We are operating in that environment. And the media and the United States, institutions like universities, have taken a very one-sided position. And government officials at the local and state level have done the same. So I think you have to understand the situation of almost feeling besieged that many students feel. On the other, hand it should be said that support for Palestinian rights is very strong on most American campuses. And I think it betokens the fact that most young people feel very sympathetic to the Palestinian people and to the struggle for their rights.",
