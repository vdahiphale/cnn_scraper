Here's where we begin. In a few hours, the first televised hearing in the Georgia election interference case will begin. This again is the first televised proceeding of any of the former president's criminal cases. Judge Scott McAfee says that he is going to address critical scheduling matters for the trial. It could begin as soon as October 23. There are 19 defendants. They have all entered not guilty pleas. They've waived their arraignments. The hearing will also look at possibly breaking up the case and trying some of the defendants separately.",

So we don't know exactly what they are asking for. But what it seems to me is they are trying to find some workable middle ground, because Donald Trump is taking to social media daily and making aggressive, perhaps over- the-line pronouncements.I think prosecutors understand they do nothing. They can't sit idly by and let this happen without asking the judge to do something. I think prosecutors also probably understand they can't ask to lock up Donald Trump just given the reality that he is running for president. Fair or not, special treatment, which it would be, I think they have to be aware of that reality. So my best estimate here is they are asking the judge to take some sort of middle ground. I will say one thing judges can do, is they can impose financial penalties. If you are -- if a defendant is violating an order of a court, then a judge can say you are in contempt and I am going to fine you a certain amount each day. They may be. But they need some middle ground. They need to do something here.",

I'm glad to be with you. Today is nothing unusual that doesn't happen in courtrooms every day in Georgia. It's different only because of the players sort of in the play and the media interest in the case. The judge will talk to the lawyers. He will have a lot of lawyers there because of the number of the defendants, and he'll say, look, I want to find out how we are going to try this case. Madam District Attorney, what's your plan to try the case, or do you have a certain number of defendants that you are willing to separate off, or are you still insistent that you push forward with this sort of a joke October date? He will also hear from the defense lawyers about the need to be prepared, the fact that there is no possible way they can get prepared. They will be building a record, the defense attorneys will be building a record to make sure that any appellate court will know that if they are pushed to trial in October that there was no way they could provide effective assistance or counsel to their clients. We've had a little bit of the drama removed because the defendants will be there. It sort of minimizes some of the circus a little bit, since they have waived their arraignment. But this will really be almost like a status conference and scheduling conference with the judge. The difference, of course, is the magnitude of the case and the significance of the parties involved.",

Again, now, we are talking about Mar-a-Lago, the classified documents case down in Florida. And remember, what Donald Trump is accused of doing is essentially hiding those documents from not just the grand jury and the FBI but from his own lawyer. He intentionally duped his own lawyer, Evan Corcoran.And there comes a moment, according to the reporting, where Corcoran says to Trump, hey, you got a subpoena. We need to comply with this. This is serious. We need to turn everything over. And the reporting is that Trump essentially flipped out and basically became defiant. And I think if you are trying to explain to a grand trial jury, how do we get to the point -- or to a trial jury, how do we get to a point when Donald Trump was obstructing justice, was hiding documents, this is the setup for that.",

The difference would be if, in the attorney-client scenario, if there is some type of effort to commit a crime and to involve a lawyer in a crime. So if you think about it from simple terms, you can't ask your lawyer where can I bury the body and get advice on where to do it and somehow claim that's attorney-client peripheral. There'd be a way around that.So I do think it raises some interesting questions. We have seen courts kind of go across the line and back and forth as they've navigated the attorney-client privilege aspects in some of these cases. I think this is one that will likely wind its way into some appellate brief at some point, but it's one they will have to deal with now as they try to move forward.",

That's what that note is in reference to. The Kentucky senator later made his own passing reference to his freezing episode on the Senate floor yesterday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

So, what people will do is say, look, I have a high level of concern for seizure.They'll actually monitor the EEG for a period of time, not just one EEG. They might even do what are called challenge tests to do things to see if you can elicit a seizure and find that on EEG. Important to do, mainly to make sure that this doesn't keep happening to him.

We know he was exposed to someone with COVID-19. 1st Lady Jill Biden's CDC guidance has constantly changed, especially early in the pandemic.

And I think that that's understandably very confusing to your first question. Let me tell you what the CDC guidance is. Now, if you've been exposed to COVID, which basically says day zero through ten, you should be wearing a mask and watch for symptoms.If you develop any symptoms, you should test immediately. That's what the guidance is now, one caveat there is that if you're testing regularly and you're getting a test known as an antigen test, that can give you a good indication of whether or not you have enough virus in your nose and your mouth to actually spread it. So he's probably had those tests done. And if you have those and those are negative, that can be a reason not to wear a mask. But I think, again, what was confusing about President Biden, he was wearing a mask, and then when he got around the individual in close proximity is when he took it off. That didn't make a lot of sense either. In that case, you wear it or you don't wear it. And again, if you've been tested and the tests are negative, especially if you've had two tests over 48 hours, then you really don't need a mask because you're not likely to transmit at that point.",

It is organizing as we sit here and analyze this satellite imagery, currently at 65 miles per hour winds, of course, you need 74 miles per hour plus to be considered a hurricane. And clearly and explicitly the Hurricane Center showed the strengthening of a tropical storm into a hurricane, into a major hurricane by this weekend.And look at this. Leeward Islands. Yes, you are not included in this cone. But remember, the average error from the center of the storm is roughly 150 to 200 miles on day four and day five. So, if that deviates further south and west, you bet you Puerto Rico into the Leeward Islands, you'll feel the impacts of this. At the very minimum, we will have high surf rip currents and large waves, potentially some coastal erosions in those areas. This is moving into an area of above-average record temperature water, so that is fuel for strengthening storms. That's exactly what we anticipate with this particular incoming hurricane, which will be a major hurricane by this weekend. So where does it go? Well, the consensus is clustered in the near term, but in the far term, the long term, we're talking day five and beyond. Well, it's all about what's happening in the upper levels of the atmosphere. A ridge of high pressure to the north is helping steer this to the west. And whether or not that breaks down, does it interact with a trough over the eastern US? That is going to be a big deciding factor on any potential impacts along the eastern seaboard of the US. For the second half of next week.
