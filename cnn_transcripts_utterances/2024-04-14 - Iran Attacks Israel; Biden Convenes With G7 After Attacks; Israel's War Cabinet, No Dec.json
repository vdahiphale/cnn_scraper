We begin tonight with breaking news and fears of a wider war as Israel considers its next move following an unprecedented attack on Israel by Iran.Late Saturday night, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles and drones against Israel, calling it a response to a deadly Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus earlier this month. Israel's military says with the help of its partners, including the U.S. and the U.K., it intercepted some 99 percent of more than 300 missiles and drones and other projectiles launched by Iran. The Israeli war cabinet ended a meeting today without reaching a decision, but determined to act, one member saying Israel will quote \"exact a price at the time of its choosing.\" President Biden met virtually with G7 leaders today to discuss what he calls, quote, an urgent diplomatic response. And late last night, Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu over the phone, reaffirming the U.S.'s ironclad commitment to its ally, but making it clear the U.S. will not participate in any Israeli attack against Iranian territory. Right now, the U.N. Security Council is holding an emergency meeting. The U.N. Secretary General called for restraint. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Now is the time to defuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's a very difficult question for the Israeli war cabinet at the moment because it gets to the heart of how Israel has handled all threats in the region until now, which is to deter the opponent from trying again. And this is precisely what the White House is guiding against, which is an escalation which Iran has said it will respond to.So, the war cabinet, when it met today, a very small war cabinet that it is, Benny Gantz along with the prime minister and Yoav Gallant, the defense minister. The head of Mossad, David Barnea, was there as well. We also saw that the army chief of staff, General Herzi Halevi, was present. I think this is a slight broadening of what we normally see in the war cabinet. And of course, three others were there as well in the sort of observer status. But what the resolve is at the moment appears to be to bide time a little bit and consider the move. And I think this indicates that any impetuous sense that there was a need to respond immediately, that's been set to one side to consider how allies and partners might be brought on board. And that was something we heard separately from Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, speaking separately after his conversation with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, talking about building a broader coalition of partners in the region. So, it does seem to be that whatever the next move is going to be in the war cabinet is determined that there will be a move against Iran. But the scope and scale of it, should it be the maximalist deterrence style that Israel has used in the past, which is to show absolutely sort of break all the crockery, if you will, or will there be something that's more defined and definitive that will perhaps try to as we've heard from Israeli officials today, to encourage allies and partners to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization and try to build a coalition around Iran's bigger threat to the region, Jim?",

And this situation seems to be no different at the moment.There are those that wanted a very immediate response. But the clear pressure coming from the White House and President Biden's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu does seem to have sort of brought in a level of pause and consider the next move. But precisely the breakdown within that cabinet, it's very hard to know. But the fact that they still need more time to make a determination, I think, is indicative of the lack of unity of opinion, Jim.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's certainly the case, Jim. A senior administration official telling reporters that Israel doesn't want to escalate. That is what they have told U.S. officials. And the focus at the White House for months now, but especially in this moment, is for the conflict not to escalate in the region, for there not to be a broader regional conflict.And that is the risk that they are trying to contain. It was part of the discussion that President Biden had with G7 leaders earlier this morning when they discussed a united diplomatic response. In other words, trying to find nonmilitary actions here. Let me read you part of the statement that was released by the G7 leaders. It said, quote, \"With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. This must be avoided. We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation.\" Part of that, of course, is that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive action that is taken by Israel. That is what President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his call with him last night. It is also what senior national security members have relayed to their Israeli counterparts because the assessment from the U.S. up until this point is that Israel was largely successful here. There was no major damage on their infrastructure. And so, they are essentially saying, take the win here and let's not escalate the situation any further, especially when tensions are already so heightened in the Middle East. But the big question is whether the Israeli prime minister decides to take President Biden's guidance. There's an acknowledgement that he is also facing political pressure back at home. And as we have seen with the war in Gaza, there have often been rifts between President Biden and the Israeli prime minister on next steps. So, the big question at this hour here at the White House is what Israel decides to move forward. But the message that the White House has been sending out, at least today, is that they certainly do not want to see this escalate and that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive action here.",

Why first? Because as time passes, we'll be under more and more international pressure not to do anything. And more importantly, if we do it now, it will sort of combine with the Iranian attacks so that the Iranians will not have to retaliate again for our counteroffensive. And then we can try and like sort of conclude this incident all in one piece and prevent an escalation.

This is how we got to this regional security architecture that started over the last year of the Trump administration, continued and strengthened during the Biden administration.

A diplomatic source says that Iran informed Turkish officials about its options for retaliation last week. Turkey then informed the U.S. This likely played a key role in the coordinated response and defense against these strikes.Israel says, with the help of the U.S., Britain and France, as well as other partners, nearly all the missiles and drones fired at Israel were shot down. CNN national security correspondent Natasha Bertrand joins me now from the Pentagon. Natasha, we just learned that U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with an IDF official today about this joint response. But I'm curious about this advance warning, in effect. Is the reporting here that Iran, in effect, telegraphed that these strikes were coming? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, senior administration officials on a call earlier today with reporters, they pushed back very strongly on the notion that Iran issued any kind of warning to the region about just what it was going to do, because according to U.S. officials, Iran intended for its missile and drone attack on Israel to cause significant damage and injuries on the ground. And so, officials are saying that Israel or that Iran did not intend to send any kind of warning to allies or to partners in the region or anyone in the region that could then allow them to move out of the way, for example. But of course, our new reporting suggests that Iran did tell Turkey what some of the options might be for a retaliatory strike, and then in turn, Turkey informed the United States. Now, we know that leading up to this attack, the U.S. had a really good picture, intelligence picture of what Iran might be planning to do. That picture shifted a little bit as last week wore on. Earlier in the week, U.S. officials predicted that it was likely that Iranian proxies were going to play a very large role in some kind of retaliatory strike on Israel, but that it was unlikely that Iran itself would get directly involved. However, as the week wore on, it became clear as the U.S. began seeing missiles and drones being moved around inside Iran, that Iran was clearly planning for something, whether that was going to be a first strike or planning for some kind of retaliation by the U.S. and Israel in response to its strike. And so, the U.S. became convinced later on in the week that Iran was planning something that included perhaps an attack from its territory. So, you know, the timing of this, the scope, the parties involved, the weaponry involved, including the drones and missiles, the U.S. had a pretty good idea of well in advance, and that is why they were able to position some pretty key assets in the region, including U.S. Navy destroyers, including additional fighter aircraft to help take down whatever came Israel's way, Jim.",

And whatever they do, they would then have to send it back to the Senate where, again, there's a question of whether it would pass.Now, Johnson did say he is going to put some type of Israel aid bill on the floor this upcoming week, but he has said those details are still not yet finalized. I was checking with sources just before I came on, and they said he still not made decision yet. We should also know that Johnson did have a call with the other top four congressional leaders with President Biden to discuss the ongoing situation in the Middle East. So, he is facing competing pressures from all sides right now.",

We had a good chat last night. I want to ask you where things stand in your view in terms of how Israel is likely to respond to this. You have some quite public pressure from the U.S. president saying do not strike Iranian territory directly. The U.S. will not be involved. It will not help you through this.

There's a consensus on the need to respond among the five, the three decisionmakers, the other two are observers. I think there's some discrepancy or disagreement over the timing of a response and the scale of the response.Benny Gantz made a statement today, earlier today, in which he said he wanted a regional response. I think he used the word alliance in an effort to isolate Iran. What that means is unclear. I think the greatest sort of argument that the Israelis will probably make in terms of why they would need to respond was tied to a statement that the head of the IRGC, Iranian Revolutionary Guard, made today, in which he said, we've created a new point of departure here. Any Israeli strike on any, the word any, Iranian asset, interest, citizen or official, I think that's an exact quote, will be met with an attack by Iran on Israeli territory. Now, is that bluster? I think the Israelis somehow feel the need to restore, if it's even relevant any longer, I don't know if it is, some measure of deterrence and to remind Iran that this cannot become the new normal. Against that are all the arguments you and I know, possibilities of escalation, deepening of Iran's efforts to -- they're already a nuclear weapons threshold state. Possibility that an Israeli attack, if it's large enough, could push the Iranians to actually weaponize. I suspect they'll wait a while. They're riding a pretty positive diplomatic wave right now.",

Fred, we're also learning that Russia and Iran, their foreign ministers, discussed the situation during a phone call earlier. That is quite a close relationship. What do we know about that?

There was very little mention, actually, of the actual attack by the Iranians against the Israelis.So certainly, it doesn't seem as though the Russians in any way, shape or form critical of the Iranians. Of course, we know that there is military cooperation, apparently, between Russia and Iran, Iran supplying some things that the Russians badly need in their battle against the Ukrainian forces. And so, they are very close allies indeed. And if you look at the readout, Jim, of the call between Sergei Lavrov and the Iranian foreign minister, then you compare that, for instance, to the readout of the call between the Iranian foreign minister and the German foreign minister, the two of them spoke by phone today as well, the German foreign minister, actually, the first opening line from that readout is that the German foreign minister absolutely condemned Iran's attacks on Israel, saying that it was dangerous for the entire region. Certainly, the Iranians have been saying today, we've been following very closely some of the messaging that we've been getting out of Tehran, Jim, and I think that there are three main messages that the Iranians are trying to send now. They were saying that this retaliation is now over and it's up to the Israelis where things go next. But they're also saying that there actually has been a strategic shift on the part of the Iranians and that if their forces or any of their personnel are attacked by Israel again, that once again, there will now always be retaliation coming from Iran. I want to listen into some of what the head of the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had to say. Let's listen then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOSSEIN SALAMI, COMMANDER, ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS (through translator): We decided to create a new equation, and that is if the Zionist regime attacks our interests, assets, personalities and citizens at any point, we will attack them from the Islamic Republic of Iran.
