Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He would ban abortion nationwide, yes, even here in Wisconsin, and he would restrict access to birth control, put IVF treatments at risk, and force states, listen to this, force states to monitor women's pregnancies.

She is the author, and the co- founder, I should say, of Lift Our Voices, and Lance Trover. He is the former spokesperson for Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum's 2024 presidential campaign. Good to see you both.But, Lance, let me start with you. Is it counterproductive for Trump to be trying to appeal to women but then say things like that, whether women like it or not, the conversation there? We hear him saying that his advisors literally told him it's probably not a good idea to say things along those lines. What are your thoughts? LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, DOUG BURGUM 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, I think that Donald Trump tries to speak to a broad swath of voters, and you've seen that over the course of the last 48 hours, and by making -- taking these garbage comments and taking them on the road and making viral moments. Look, the last person the Harris campaign wants front and center right now is Joe Biden because he has got a 35 percent approval rating and she is unable to distance herself from them. I would argue that Donald Trump is making a plea to all voters saying, look, I've been saying this for eight years. The system is rigged against you. People like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think you're deplorable. People like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think you're garbage. And the only way to fix this problem is to root out the system in Washington and clean it up. So, I think he just speaks to a broad swath of voters any time he is out there across the country.",

There is 90 million reasons why he is paying E. Jean Carroll, and it is because he did something to her, whether she liked it or not. Lance brought up crime. You have somebody who is an adjudicated criminal in Donald Trump. You have somebody who is an adjudicated sexual assailant, which a jury of his peers found Donald Trump to be. Whether women liked it or not, he did things to them that they did not like. And he is not just saying, my bad, I learned my lesson.

I will comment on the former President Donald Trump's remark about women and whether they like it or not. And listen, it's just -- it actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.And this is just the latest on a series of reveals by the former President of how he thinks about women and their agency, whether he has said, as he has, that women should be punished for their choices, whether he has talked about his pride in taking away a fundamental right from women, whether it be how he has actually created a situation in America where now one in three women lives in a Trump abortion banned state and has legal restrictions on the right -- she rightly should have to make decisions about her own body. The other point I will refer to about in the last many hours is the Speaker's comments about the Affordable Care Act. Look, I have been saying throughout this campaign, be very clear that among the stakes in this election are whether we continue with the Affordable Care Act or not. It has been a part of Donald Trump's agenda. For a very long time, he has made dozens of attempts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and now we have further validation of that agenda from his supporter, the Speaker of the House. And what that would mean for the American people is that farmers -- that insurance companies could go back to a time when they would deny you coverage for health insurance based on pre-existing conditions, pre-existing conditions such as you being a survivor of breast cancer, asthma, diabetes. And what I know is that the American people, regardless of who they are voting for, know the importance of the Affordable Care Act, as it is also called Obamacare, in terms of expanding people's coverage to healthcare. Based on a fundamental principle that I hold deeply, access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. So, there is still a lot of work to do. But, each day, I think that there are also indications that we are receiving from my opponent that verify, validate and reinforce the fact that, one, he is not going to be fighting for women's reproductive rights. He does not prioritize the freedom of women and the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives and bodies, and healthcare for all Americans is on the line in this election as well.

It's not what he said. You can keep implying that and taking things from it, what you want from the Dobbs decision, but those are not things that he said. He said he wouldn't pass a national abortion ban. Johnson said he wanted to reform it.And let's face it. Healthcare costs are high. I don't think you can go to anybody in this country and say that healthcare costs are low. And so, if there are things that needs to be done to lower healthcare costs in this country, I don't think that's a bad thing. My reaction here is, I see what she -- I see what they're trying to do. Donald Trump's advisors told him not to do it. Do I wish he had said something else? Yes. I wish he would had framed it differently. But, at the same time, the last 24 to 48 hours have been dominated by these garbage comments from the President of the United States. And so, I understand the Harris campaign does not want Joe Biden to be front and center, because if he is, she is going to lose next Tuesday. And so, part of this is straight up politics by creating distractions and getting it off of these garbage comments that the Vice President made the other day, and that's just the politics and how we get in the last five days of a race.

It was a remarkable feat for a Democrat at the time, hadn't been done since President Clinton in the 1990s.

Lawyers for Elon Musk have criticized the Philadelphia District Attorney in court today, accusing him of orchestrating what they call a publicity stunt. DA Larry Krasner filed a suit against Musk, alleging that his million dollar a day giveaways to voters in swing states violate Pennsylvania's state law. Musk was ordered to appear in court over an hour ago. He did not show up. Lawyers representing the DA vowed to keep fighting the case. OK. Let's bring in CNN's Marshall Cohen, who is in Philadelphia following the development. So, Marshall, it seems like this is going to federal court. Walk us through what happened today.",

The practical impact of that legal maneuver was a delay, and this hearing that did take place in state court behind me was short.But, there was a clash between the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office and Elon Musk's lawyers. The DA team said that it was, quote, \"cowardly and irresponsible for Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, to try to avoid showing up and avoid this hearing by moving it into federal court.\" In response, Musk's attorneys said that this whole thing was a big publicity stunt by the liberal, progressive Democrat District Attorney here, Larry Krasner. They, of course, strongly contest the idea that this is an illegal lottery. Rahel, the whole situation revolves around a daily giveaway from Elon Musk and his super PAC to registered voters in battleground states. The Justice Department warned already that it might violate state law. The DA here in Philly believes that it violates state law. The Justice Department thinks it might violate federal law. Elon Musk is not backing down, Rahel. Just before the hearing, they announced on their super PAC's page on Twitter or X, they announced another winner, $1 million to a registered voter in North Carolina. So, while all this wrangling goes on in the courtroom, these lottery winners are still being named, and there is a dwindling number of days, of course, before Election Day next Tuesday. So, it's gummed up in the courts, and Elon Musk continues doing what he wants to do to try to get Donald Trump back in the White House. Rahel.",

This comes as two U.S. envoys are expected in Israel today to talk about the situation in Lebanon. Lebanon's Prime Minister says that he is optimistic a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could be struck in the next few hours or days.Meanwhile, CIA director Bill Burns and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi met to discuss a push for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, as well as the need for humanitarian aid. The visits follow devastating Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and Gaza this week. Lebanon's Health Ministry says that at least 19 people were killed Wednesday near the historic city of Baalbek. The Israeli military says that its forces were targeting command and control centers in its fight against Hezbollah. In Gaza, meantime, the director of the only operational hospital in the north is urging the international community to act to stop the bombardment after multiple Israeli strikes overnight. UN data shows that aid entering Gaza has fallen to the lowest level since the war began. Let's get to our Jeremy Diamond, who is live for us in Tel Aviv.

And we saw an expansion of the cooperation that we would expect to see in technology, in military, larger-scale exercises, and perhaps you got a bit of that with the large-scale aerial exercise between the U.S. and South Korea that we saw in response to the North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launch.So, if that was military focus, now we can expect to see that expansion in the diplomatic realm, as we have Blinken and his South Korean counterpart joining here. We can also perhaps expect to see the U.S. be a bit more forward-leaning on North Korean troops here. So far, it's been the South Koreans and the Ukrainians sort of leading the way here. They said there were thousands of North Korean troops training in Russia, perhaps being deployed or preparing to deploy to Ukraine. The U.S. took a bit longer to get there and a bit longer to be sort of open and public with their information.

That is towards the battlefield in Ukraine.According to Western intelligence officials, a small number of North Korean troops are already in Ukraine. The Pentagon said earlier this week there are a number of those in the Kursk region of Russia. That's where Ukraine had a successful offensive. It was able to seize some Russian territory there. The question, do they essentially simply become bodies in Russia's war? Are they all destined to be deployed to Ukraine? And that's something the U.S. and South Korea are watching very closely. One of the other questions, of course, is, what does North Korea get in return? And that's where South Korea's Defense Minister said yesterday, it is, quote, \"very likely that in exchange for bodies to feed Russia's war, that Russia would be willing to provide North Korea with technology, for example, on nuclear weapons.\" That's where North Korea has tried to make advances on satellite technology and other areas where Russia has the ability to provide, is that sort of information, those sort of capabilities, to North Korea.

The Dow is actually solidly lower, off about eight tenths of a percent, or 350 points, perhaps on the back of earnings, because we've actually gotten some pretty good economic data this week. This is on the heels of that brand new inflation data report. That's out this morning. So, this is a report known as the Personal Consumption Expenditures or the PCE price index. It's the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, and it showed this morning that inflation cooled even more in the month of September, which likely still advise more interest rate cuts.And of course, we're just days away from the U.S. election, and one of the biggest concerns facing voters is the state of the economy and what the candidates are proposing and how it impacts them. Joining us to discuss all of this is Justin Wolfers. He is a Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Michigan. Justin, great to have you. I always love reading your insights online. I want to start with the Harris endorsement from The Economist, pretty stinging rebuke out this morning. I'm going to read it for you in part. So, on Trump's economic plans, they say \"These policies would be inflationary, potentially setting up a conflict with the Federal Reserve. They would risk igniting a trade war that would ultimately impoverish America. The combination of inflation, out-of-control deficits and institutional decay would bring forward the day when foreigners worry about lending the U.S. Treasury unlimited money.\" Justin. It doesn't get more dire than that on the economy. What are your thoughts? Is that too strong? Do you agree? Where do you land on this? JUSTIN WOLFERS, PROF. OF ECONOMICS &amp; PUBLIC POLICY, UNIV. OF MICHIGAN: Well, it's important to note that endorsement and description comes from The Economist newspaper, which is historically both conservative and libertarian. And I think actually real conservatives, conservatives that believe in the value of American institutions, like the rule of law, conservatives that don't want to see our economy run out of the White House, they would be -- it's a strange world we're in, but that kind of conservative should be all for Kamala Harris, because Trump wants to put his big footprint all over the economy in ways that would centralize power out of the White House and in ways that we've seen tried and failed by many, many strong men in the past.",

An amazing fact about the Trump tax plan, he talks a lot about how he is cutting taxes, and he may well get less revenue, but it turns out, he manages to cut total revenues, while the most calculations actually raising the taxes paid by 95 percent of all Americans. It's the richest five percent who get a tax cut. But, in fact, everyone else is going to pay higher taxes. You might say, how does that work out? It's because what he is proposing is very sharp cuts in income tax for the wealthy paid for by a tariff hike, and a tariff hike hits everyone who spends money, the working class, the middle class and the wealthy in roughly equal measure.Now, the Harris tax plan is, in fact, the mirror image. Almost everyone ends up with higher income paying lower taxes in the poorest 95 percent of the distribution, but actually there are some people who are going to end up paying higher taxes. That's the richest five percent. And so, really the question is, which group are you in, and that will help you figure out which candidate is going to deliver you a tax cut?",

But, Justin, critics say that's making the problem worse, because you're driving up demand when it's actually inventory that's the issue when it comes to the housing market, but there just aren't enough homes, which is part of the reason.

Certainly, correct me if I'm wrong. There was some debate about how many times they've been able to do it before. But, in any event, they did it, and yet, a lot of folks still feel like the economy is just not working, or they feel like the country is on the wrong path.

WOLFERSIt's only when you ask the question, how do you think the economy is doing, that people sound more miserable? And there, I think what's happening is partisanship has led people to no longer think how is the economy doing, but rather to say, does this favor my side of politics or the other side of politics?
