Good evening tonight.A Russian human rights group says more than 400 people have been detained while trying to mourn Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny all across Russia. From Moscow to St. Petersburg, Russians are gathering to honor the life of the man who stood up to Russia's Vladimir Putin. Navalny's family is calling his death a murder and demanding Russian officials hand over his body immediately. A growing number of countries, including the U.S., are blaming Putin. President Biden saying this tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, the death of Alexey Navalny has had a chilling effect on the willingness of people in this city and others across the country to come out and protest. But, nevertheless, there have been thousands of people across Russia that have violated the laws, essentially, in this country, to pay their respects and to give off their sympathies after the death of Alexey Navalny. In this city alone, more than half of the 400 people who have been arrested so far, rather than detained so far, were detained here. So, it just gives you a sense of how many people in St. Petersburg are behind Alexey Navalny. It's a very relatively liberal city within the context of Russia. But, there have been vigils, flowers being laid in cities across Russia. And as I say, that human rights group, monitoring group saying that more than 400 people have been detained for violating the regulations and coming out to pay their respects. This as the whereabouts of the body of Alexey Navalny is still uncertain. His mother, Lyudmila, has traveled to the polar region, to a small town where there was a morgue of where she was told originally by his penal colony that the body was located when she got there. It's about 1,000 miles from Moscow. She was told the body is not there. And now, the government is saying, that the authorities are saying that the initial autopsy on Alexey Navalny's body was not conclusive. And so, they're having to keep that body to carry out more tests.And of course, Alexey Navalny's campaign and this family are suggesting that they're hiding the corpse to prevent the real reason for his death being uncovered. And so, still no relief in sight for the family, and still no resolution, really, as to what actually happened, what was the cause of death to -- for Alexey Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader.

I mean, just like a mob boss, that's party to a -- an assassination, even if he is not the one pulling the trigger, he is responsible. I think Vladimir Putin bears the same responsibility. He murdered. I was very quick to call him out as a murderer for the death of Alexey Navalny. With regards our actions, I hope we show a fraction of the courage that Alexey Navalny has shown over the course of his life, coming back after an assassination attempt. I don't know if we're there yet. I just do not perceive the resolve from the European community to make the kinds of investments in their security to double down on support to Ukraine, the Germans failing to provide long-range attack munitions, the U.S., we should follow through on what was -- what amounted to a red line from the Biden administration when he said there would be dire consequences. My sense, and I've talked to some folks so far, is that there is no action. I mean, if I were in the White House, I'd be generating a list of options that we could undertake with regards to punishing Putin. There is a whole bunch of things. Assets seizure and transfer to Ukraine would be one of the basic ones, doubling down on training, make sure that the Ukrainians have the best trained force. We could actually transfer equipment out of our stockpiles. It would be -- there is a little bit of risk involved because this is for our own troops. But, we could be transferring some weapons out of our stockpile to make sure that the Ukrainians don't suffer huge reversals, and, of course, maximum pressure on the Republicans to show up and vote for supplemental. The President does have the means to recall Congress and compel them to take a vote on this and put -- make them -- put their money where their mouth is and live with the consequence. And right now, I'm not seeing the will to do that. I hope we do show some fraction of the courage that Navalny has done now.",

You have this news this past week of Russia developing a space weapon that could take out satellites and cause all kinds of chaos.But, the other pressure point is their figures on the right, like Tucker Carlson, who had that incredibly fawning interview with Vladimir Putin so much that Putin was mocking Tucker Carlson. I mean, we saw that in recent days. And then, there is this bizarre video of Tucker going out doing, I don't know, it looks like he is doing Putin's grocery shopping. I don't know what he is doing. But, he is spending time in the supermarket to show how great life is. But, listen to what Tucker Carlson had to say when he was asked about some of this. And we'll talk about on the other side.

It's just ridiculous. But, I see you shaking your head as we're watching this video, Eugene.Y. VINDMAN: Yeah. So, I mean, this is outrageous. And I think if we think about the timing here, you had Donald Trump last week and basically saying that -- encouraging Vladimir Putin to attack our NATO allies. [20:10:00] Before that, you had Tucker Carlson as a sycophant to Putin, a dictator. And this week, I mean, on a high, I think is when Putin -- if he didn't give the order, it's certainly very coincidental timing Navalny is killed. And this is just weeks before his own election. So, I think Putin looks at events around the world. He looks to see what the environment is like, and he sees a very welcoming environment from Donald Trump, from Tucker Carlson, and, frankly, from the MAGA side or the Republican Party. I mean, the Republican Party, Mike Johnson gave a very sort of weak statement today, attempting to criticize Putin. But, the biggest thing and that he can do is pass the funding bill for our allies, and he has failed to do that. And these are critically important issues. Actually, this came up, I just came from a campaign event, and we talked about this. The constituents in Virginia's 7th District care about these things. I spoke to a woman that is the child of Hungarian refugees, and she cares about this. I spoke to another woman that's, frankly, embarrassed by Donald Trump, and are standing in the world degrading. And so, people care about these democratic issues. They care about the pocketbook issues, undoubtedly, but they care about the democratic issues. And that's why we need to fight hard to get this spending bill passed and really fight against this MAGA extremist movement, isolationist movement.",

Now, he is gobbling up real estate in Ukraine, as the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition right now.A. VINDMAN: Yeah. I'm going to have a lengthy article coming out in the next couple of days on this. But, I would say that we are facing a unique set of dangers that probably have emerged over the past couple of -- a week or two. The fact that Donald Trump welcomed an attack on NATO has really probably done more to endanger our troops, endangering U.S. national security than any recent action I can think of. Why do I say that? Well, because Putin pays attention. Putin paid attention to when Trump and the Republican Party was welcoming or cheering for Russia, and damning Ukraine before the war started in February 2002 to the latest phase. Right now, he saw the President United States welcome an attack on NATO. What does that mean? That doesn't mean that he needs to wait until Trump is in office. It means that today, because of the Trump captured Republican Party, he believes he may have a license to attack NATO, and the Republicans would just sit out too fearful to challenge not Putin, but Trump. And now, we are in a world in which Russia is shifting its calculations about NATO, the he viability of collective defense, Article Five, and this is because of Trump. He is posing a grave danger today, not in November, not in January if he wins, today, by inviting Putin to attack U.S allies and in fact the U.S.",

RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, &amp; SENIOR EDITOR AT THE ATLANTIC: Yeah. What he is doing here has enormous implications, not only for this election, but what a second Trump term would look like if he gets it. The students of authoritarianism will tell you that strong men will break the rules while in office, push against the boundaries of law, and custom. And then, if -- when they are out of office and if they are held accountable, they will say the justice system, the legal system is being weaponized against them, and that becomes not only a way to rally their supporters, Jim, but as we've seen with Trump, it becomes a predicate for arguing that you should do the same thing if you get back in power. His claims that there is this vast conspiracy of grand juries in multiple states and attorneys and district attorneys, and federal attorneys who are all conspiring against him, and that's what's produced his legal challenges, becomes the basis for him to argue, well, I am explicitly going to do the same thing. It's a pattern that's been seen in other countries.

Many around the world are mourning the defiant Putin critic and questioning the circumstances surrounding his death.And CNN's Clarissa Ward has more now on the life and incredible legacy of Alexey Navalny. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For three years, Alexey Navalny had been languishing in Russian penal colonies, sentenced on charges of extremism. His real crime, taking on Russian President Vladimir Putin, and exposing the rampant corruption of Russia's political elites. Navalny's lawyers warned that the brutal conditions in solitary confinement were taking a toll on him. Still, he managed to communicate to his followers and loved ones through social media. On Valentine's Day this year, as he had done every year, he posted a message to his wife, Yulia, \"Baby, everything is like in a song with you. Between us, there are cities that take off lights of airfields, blue snowstorms and thousands of kilometers. But, I feel that you are near every second, and I love you more and more.\" Hours after the shocking news broke, Yulia Navalnaya addressed world leaders at the Munich Security Conference. YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S WIFE (Translated): I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country, with my family, and with my husband. They will be brought to justice, and this day will come soon. WARD (voice-over): Defiant and determined, just as her husband always was. A staunch critic of Putin for more than a decade, Alexey Navalny had dodged death before, collapsing on a plane from Siberia in August 2020 after being poisoned with the deadly nerve agent Novichok. The flight was diverted. Two days later, a comatose Navalny was flown to Berlin and saved by a team of German doctors. The CNN investigation with Bellingcat found that a team of FSB operatives had been following Navalny on trips across the country for years before poisoning him. We located one of the men accused of the poisoning and tracked him down to his apartment in Moscow. WARD (Translated): My name is Clarissa Ward. I work for CNN. Can I ask you a couple of questions? Was it your team that poisoned Navalny, please? Do you have any comment? He doesn't seem to want to talk to us. WARD (voice-over): Despite the attempt on his life, Navalny vowed to continue his work and return home.",

And definitely, which I -- especially now when this actually crime is cracked open, revealed, I understand the whole operation. I would never give Putin such a gift.WARD (voice-over): Before boarding the plane to Moscow, Navalny posted an expoze on YouTube about the $1.3 billion Black Sea villa he claimed belonged to Vladimir Putin. It was viewed more than 100 million times. The moment he landed back in Moscow, he was taken into custody. Yet, even in prison, Navalny never stopped criticizing Putin, never lost the extraordinary charisma and courage that made him popular. Russia's opposition has now been crushed. But, in prescient words from the Oscar-winning documentary \"Navalny\", he had a clear message for the Russian people. You are not allowed to give up, he says. If they kill me, it means we are incredibly strong. Clarissa Ward, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
