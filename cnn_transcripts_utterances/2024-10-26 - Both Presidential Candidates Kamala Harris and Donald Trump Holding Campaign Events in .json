I'm also joined by Jim Sciutto, who is in Jerusalem, also following Israel's overnight strikes against Iran.But first, it is a key day in the race for the White House. And we begin this hour in battleground Michigan. Both candidates are holding major campaign events in that very important swing state today. right now, former President Donald Trump holding a rally in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. Vice President Kamala Harris also just arrived in the state. And in a few hours, she's going to hold a get out rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where she will be joined by former first lady Michelle Obama for their first joint campaign appearance. Today is a very important day in Michigan. Right now, voters are heading to the polls for the very first day of statewide early voting. We have a team of correspondents covering today's campaign developments. Eva McKend is with the Harris campaign. But first, let's start with Alayna Treene. She's at the Trump rally. Alayna, the last time we spoke to you a short time ago, Trump had just started talking. What have we heard from him so far? What's he been saying?",

Well, Rahel, he's now about an hour into his remarks, and he's spoken on a number of topics, some directly targeting voters here in this Detroit suburb of a Novi, but also spent a lot of time and attacking Vice President Kamala Harris. Actually, some of the first things that he said at the start of his speech were going after her for having Beyonce at her Houston rally last night. He also argued that she was booed because Beyonce did not perform, although I will say we have reporters there who said that that is just not true. But take a listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Last night my opponent had one of these, and they bused in people. But you know, they got Beyonce, and Beyonce, you know, Beyonce. They got Beyonce. So Beyonce went up, spoke for a couple of minutes, and then left. And the place went crazy. They booed the hell out of everybody. They thought she was going to perform. Now, I would have no interest in that, but they said -- and what happened is my opponent got up in started speaking. They booed the hell out of her. It's crazy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Last night he claimed that Beyonce, or excuse me, that the Kamala Harris was out partying with just 11 days to go to the election. Look, this is something Donald Trump does often. He actually gets very fixated on celebrities. We've seen the way that he has sharply criticized Taylor Swift, but also many of the other performers who have been endorsing and coming out to support Kamala Harris, people like Bruce Springsteen or Meg Thee Stallion, all have become fixtures of some of his attacks during these types of campaign rallies.But also, I just want to point your attention to something else he brought up, which was he actually mentioned how he received some backlash for when he was in Detroit a couple of weeks ago speaking to the Detroit Economic Club and said that he believed that Detroit was a developing city and more developing than China. Again, making those remarks in Detroit. Tonight, he said, look, a lot of people didn't like that. They said I need to be positive. But then he added did that I can't be positive. I don't think Detroit is a great place. I'll be positive in two years when I win and I make it better. So he's clearly not moving away from some of that rhetoric that he has received a little criticism, of course, from people here in Michigan. Rahel?",

One is that to Trump's, one of the things when RFK Jr. was running as an independent, Donald Trump and his campaign had gone after him very hard, criticizing him for his environmental policies, arguing that he was way too liberal on those. But at the same time, I will say on the health care stuff, when I talked to Donald Trump's campaign right now, they actually think that the health care policies that RFK Jr. had been pushing as a candidate but is continuing to talk about are things that really could help Donald Trump make inroads with women, of course, a key demographic that they have been looking to gain more support with. So that's one thing.The other thing I note is that Joe Rogan has long been a supporter of RFK Jr. Over the summer, he had actually shared that out of all of the candidates, he liked RFK Jr. the best. It's something that actually drew the ire of Donald Trump at the time. However, of course now he is on Joe Rogan's podcast, speaking to him. They seemed to smooth things out there. But I will note that that interview, that three-hour interview, a very long interview, was something that the Trump campaign had been working for -- toward, I should say, for several months now. They really believed that it could help him in this final stretch to turn out more of those low propensity voters as well as young male voters. Rahel?",

What's different about this rally in Kalamazoo is this is the first time we're going to see the vice president on stage with former first lady Michelle Obama. And when Michelle Obama addressed the DNC back over the summer, she leaned on voters essentially not to be too delicate if you don't hear from the campaign directly, leaning on you to vote between now and November, that essentially the stakes are too high. And so we suspect to very much here that message from Obama again today.But this is how the vice president is framing this issue of reproductive rights.

It is President Biden's hope, he says, that this would be the end of the back-and-forth that we've seen between Israel and Iran in recent months.Now, President Biden did convene his national security team for a call this morning. Also on that call was Vice President Kamala Harris. And the White House in this call said that they received latest updates on the developments in the region, but that President Biden also stressed to ensure that American interests and people are safe at this time, and also will be closely monitoring whether Iran will decide to make any moves in response to Israel's strikes overnight. Now, one thing that the administration is saying in this moment as they're really putting the onus on Iran, saying that it is up to them to end these attacks that they've been lobbing towards Israel, really trying to end the cycle of fighting between in the two countries and trying to prevent any further escalation.
