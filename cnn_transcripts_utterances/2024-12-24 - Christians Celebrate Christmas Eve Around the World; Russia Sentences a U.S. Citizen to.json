We are looking at live images from the Vatican and we'll have more on celebrations later this hour.Now, let's start off with the day's news, and we begin with the prison sentence for a U.S. citizen found guilty of espionage in Russia after a secret trial in Moscow, a court today ordered Gene Spector to be held behind bars for 15 years. And that's according to Russian state media. Spector was born in Russia, but he later moved to the U.S. and received citizenship. He had previously been sentenced to four years in prison on charges of acting as an intermediary in a bribe. Now, I want to get   more, we've got Oren Liebermann standing by for us. Who is Gene Spector? What more do we know about these charges and his fate?",

      "sentences": "Well, Gene Spector has already been imprisoned for several years now in Russia. And this 15- year sentence is a combination of two different cases here and two different sets of charges. As you mentioned, he'd already been imprisoned for being an intermediary in a bribe, that several years ago.This latest sentencing, which came on Tuesday morning in a Moscow courtroom, according to Russian state media and an independent Russian media outlet that was inside the courtroom comes on top of that, now bringing his prison sentence to a total of 15 years. This latest on espionage charges. He was sentenced to serve that sentence in a maximum security prison in Russia. So, that total now 15 years here, as you pointed out, he is -- was born in Russia, Gene Spector, but moved to the United States and gained American citizenship. In some respects, this is like so many of the other cases we have seen, a heavy prison sentence handed to a U.S. citizen. And again, as we have seen so often, Russia tries to use that prison sentence and the imprisonment of an American citizen to gain leverage in negotiations in a prison swap. We saw that in the case of Brittney Griner, the WNBA star who was traded for Viktor Bout, an arms dealer some time ago. We also saw that in the cases of Evan Gershkovich, a \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who was detained, and Paul Whelan, who spent more than five years in a Russian prison. The two of them were freed in a prisoner swap that involved not only the U.S., but several other countries as well, Norway, Slovenia and other countries, as Russia was able to secure the release of a number of Russian prisoners held in U.S. and western prisons. But it is worth noting that Gene Spector has not been determined as wrongfully detained by the U.S. and by the State Department, so, that may fundamentally affect how this plays out and whether and how the U.S. decides to pursue some sort of prisoner swap to secure his release here.",

But at this high level of alert, effectively since the beginning of the Ukraine war, because detaining and arresting U.S. citizens, holding them, charging them, sentencing them to long prison sentences in Russian prisons, this has been a tactic of Russian President Vladimir Putin as he tries to secure the release of Russian prisoners overseas, or tries to gain some sort of leverage on the United States no matter what the issue.This is from the Russian playbook and from the Putin playbook. And that's why that warning is out there and has been out there from the State Department warning American citizens not to travel to Russia because it is possible that Russia will try to find or create some reason to detain, to charge and to imprison, to gain leverage in what they hope is a prisoner swap or some sort of other back-and-forth between Washington and Moscow.",

There are no special fees. They also highlight that they just underwent a big expansion of the canal to accommodate larger ships. So, the fee is the fee for everyone, it's based on the size of the vessel.So, there's no clear -- also what any concession can Panama do on that area, especially the other thing here it could be for Donald Trump is the risk of alienating somebody who could be key on Donald Trump's immigration policy, because Panama is a country from where many of the Venezuelans who have been coming north to try to get into the United States have been crossing. So, he has the power to control the flow of migrants. So, whatever Donald Trump wants to say or do about the canal could have also an impact on immigration.",

Firstly, the suspect. We are learning that his name is Sebastian Zapeta-calil, he's 33 years old and he is originally from Guatemala. The authorities here tell us that he entered the United States in 2018. At one point, he was deported, but he made it back into the country and has been here ever since. Now, police say that he approached a woman who was sleeping inside of a subway car early on Sunday morning, walked up to her and lit her on fire. As you said, when she began to burn, he stepped outside of the subway car and watched as she was burning alive.Now, the victim, we are told, police officials believe that she too was homeless, and that she was likely taking shelter from the cold at the time. This is something that happens a lot here in New York City, especially on very cold days. People who are homeless are forced to take shelter inside the city's subways. Now, the suspect, also believed to be homeless, in fact, the last reported address was a homeless shelter for men who struggle with substance abuse issues here in New York City. Now, the suspect was arraigned just a few hours ago, he is facing murder in the first and second degree as well as arson charges. He appeared in front of a judge in Brooklyn Criminal Court just a short while ago. He did not enter a plea, and he was remanded back to custody. He is expected to appear back in court next Friday. But this is an issue that just has put so much focus on it and attention on a really difficult issue here in New York City, and that is public safety, specifically in the transit system. It has, in fact, significantly improved since the pandemic. But we keep seeing these very high profile incidents that put a spotlight, a spotlight back on the issue again, namely homelessness, mental illness and public safety, especially when it comes to the transit system.",

      "sentences": "Well, Gloria, thank you so much for staying on top of this story for us. Gloria Pazmino there. Well, right now, mankind is getting as close as we ever have been to the sun. A NASA spacecraft called the Parker Solar Probe is passing less than 4 million miles, about 6 million kilometers from the sun.Now, that might sound like a lot, but it is closer than any man-made probe has ever gotten. The Parker Solar Probe is flying at a super- fast speed, so fast that it could travel from Tokyo, Japan to Washington D.C. in less than a minute. Just a short time ago, I spoke to former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao about what the Parker Solar Probe is looking for in its fly-by. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEROY CHIAO, AMERICAN CHEMICAL ENGINEER &amp; FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT:  The sun is a very turbulent body. It looks, you know, like a big point of light to us here on earth. But there are a lot of sun-spots going on, a lot of activity, and there's something called the Solar Max and a Solar Min. It's about an 11-year cycle. Parker was launched in 2018, kind of right in the middle. And so, it saw the transition from a solar minimum to now the solar maximum, which occurred just two months ago. And so, it's going to come the closest any probe has to the surface of the sun. As you pointed out, about 3.8 million miles. It sounds like it's pretty far, but in perspective, if the distance from the earth to the sun were a football field, you'd be inside the five-yard line, right? So, it's going to be -- we're hoping NASA scientists are hoping that there will actually be a solar flare during its fly-through, and so, we can observe it up close and look at it up close at the sun-spots and other activities and help to better understand the dynamics of the sun.",

Without that magnetosphere, life on the earth would not be possible.And so, what we see during solar max and solar min are variations in the shape of the magnetosphere. And counter-intuitively, at solar max, the magnetosphere is such that it actually deflects more particles away from the earth than at solar minimum, right? So, a little bit counterintuitive, but it helps us understand those things, and the whole field of study is called space weather, not weather as we know it here on the earth. But how these different magnetic fields and fluctuations in the sun, how that affects us here on the earth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
