Ahead right here on CNN NEWSROOM.Russia launches the deadliest attack on Ukraine in months, killing and wounded dozens in a crowded market as the U.S. Secretary of State makes an unannounced trip to Kyiv with another billion-dollar aid package in tow. Mexico Supreme Court decriminalizes abortion right across the country, extending a recent Latin American trend. Plus, mass protests in South Korea. Why are tens of thousands of teachers taking you to the streets of Seoul? The audacity of evil and utter inhumanity is how the Ukrainian president is describing a deadly strike on an open market in the Donetsk region. Now, this surveillance video showing the explosion that killed at least 17 people and wounded dozens more. Everyday people just going about their business and doing their daily shopping. The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine said it is another example of the suffering Russia's invasion inflicts on civilians. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian terrorists destroyed shops, a pharmacy, people who did nothing wrong. The attack came as Ukrainian counter offensive moves into its fourth month now and as the top U.S. diplomat began his third visit to Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion. Antony Blinken announced a new infusion of aid worth more than a billion dollars. And meantime, the Kremlin said the U.S. is intent on keeping the war going \"until the last Ukrainian.\" CNN Frederik Pleitgen picks up the report from there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The moment the powerful missile hit a market in Kostyantynivka in eastern Ukraine. Chaos and carnage in the immediate aftermath. And while Russia has not commented on the strike, the Ukrainian say this was the work of a Russian surface to air missile use to hit ground targets. Dozens were killed and wounded here, Kyiv says. First responders trying to help the wounded while already clearing the bodies of the dead. An angry Ukrainian president slamming Russia's leadership. Whenever there's any positive offensive step by Ukrainian defense forces, Russians targets civilians and civil infrastructure, he says, wherever their missiles and artillery can reach. This is what Zelenskyy means by positive steps. Ukraine's army is pressuring the Russians both on the Eastern Front. This video Kyiv says showing fighting at the crack of dawn near Bakhmut and in the south where Ukraine says its forces are pushing the Russians back after taking the Robotyne village and fortifying their own position. One soldier who fought in the Robotyne recalling hiding in the village alone from the Russians ready to kill himself if they found him. I carried a cartridge in my pocket, he says. I don't know if I could do it. But I carried the cartridge I would not surrender to capture. On a visit to Kyiv, Secretary of State Antony Blinken praising Ukraine's recent advances on the battlefield.",

Very significant increase upon the already massive levels of donations coming from the United States and others but the Americans are way ahead in terms of their support for Ukrainian war effort.But the critics in the United States are pointing to these very small yellow and white dots here on the map. These are the very small incremental gains that the Ukrainians have been making. Now, their critics are saying they're not getting through those American -- the Russian frontlines hard enough or fast enough. The Ukrainians are responsive -- response to that and indeed, more sensible voices, frankly, within NATO, as saying, well, this whole front line here has been a long anticipated and indeed all of this stuff down in the south too. The Russians have had plenty of time. Many months to reinforce. They've got at least three lines of defense in some areas, possibly five that includes minefields, tank traps. It's now up to infantry to infiltrate these areas, clear the mines by hand, and then get that armor that the United States and others have been donating into the battlespace. This is going to be where the concentration at the moment of the future operations of the Ukrainians are likely to be. And that is because they want to expand this area. So they can use that as a bridgehead to go forward into Crimea and indeed cut the Russian supply lines to the east and west. But the Russians get a vote in this. If we take a look at what's going on on the Eastern Front, we'll be able to see much more closely, first of all, where these Russian gains have been made, but also where the Ukrainians have been pushing them back. Particularly here south of Bakhmut. But of course, just in the last 24 hours, the Russians have struck back killing a large number of civilians and others here in Konstantinovka in a missile attack with at least 16 killed, more than 20 injured. Now that is part of the steady state of this war. The constant attacks on civilians behind the frontlines as part of the Russian effort to try to drain the energy out of the Ukrainian war effort. Now, of course, the new Ukrainian commander is saying that every single inch of Ukrainian territory as far as they're concerned will be liberated as part of that campaign. But again, the Russians are counterattacking particularly here up near Kupiansk and all along this northern front here. They've actually made some minor gains there. The Russians have but they've been assaulting with very severe and heavy numbers of armor, tanks in particular being put to use there. They are being held by the Ukrainians but all of this is adding up to a degree of frustration among the Ukrainians, allies in the West, very often derived from a lack of understanding of the what this battlespace really is like. And speaking as somebody who's been on the ground here, the NATO doctrine is you need three to one advantage in terms of troops from the Ukrainian perspective. Indeed, the troop numbers are actually the other way around. So, any kind of Ukrainian advance under those circumstances particularly without air cover, and they have none so far, is nothing short of something close to a miracle.",
