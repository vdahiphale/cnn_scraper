That's right, 14 days from today, Americans can start casting their votes, just days later, we'll see the first debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. And widespread early voting that starts in less than a month. Now, fresh off their convention, Democrats hope to build on their momentum with the Harris campaign announcing the Obamas, the Clintons will be hitting the campaign trail to make the case for the Harris-Walz ticket. Her team says Harris will continue holding rallies, but not necessarily the same pace as the last couple of weeks she turns her focus to debate prep. This weekend, Harris and Walz are off the trail. Over the course of the last week, Donald Trump has been holding rallies in key battleground states, including Nevada and Arizona this afternoon. Arizona also where another move that could impact the election just took place. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. officially suspended his campaign this afternoon. And has announced he's going to, quote, throw my support to Donald -- President Trump. A source tells CNN RFK Jr. will campaign with Trump in the coming weeks.

What I've been seeing in polling about RFK is that over the last few months, it has shifted to be more of a draw from Trump than from Biden.Initially, it was a threat to Biden because you had disaffected Democrats who loved the Kennedy name. They saw the iconography of RFK's Super Bowl ad, they really felt like, oh, I like this guy, maybe instead of Biden, I go with him. That's now fallen away. And instead, the voters that had been gravitating toward RFK in recent months have been those that felt like he was the real outsider. He was the one that would speak truth to power, say the offensive things other people wouldn't say, frankly, in focus groups, people talk about RFK Jr., like they would talk about Trump, say, eight years ago. So, with him dropping out and endorsing Trump, it's just consolidating voters who are interested in the Trump vibe, but may have had some questions about him.

She had to appeal to this incredibly wide and diverse coalition of people and she had to tell people not just what her policies are going to be, but sort of what her vision of America is.

The Biden-Harris administration took the unprecedented position of saying we are Biden-Harris, they co-branded this administration. And then she had the position of casting 33 votes, tie-breaking votes in the Senate more than any other vice president in the entire history of the country. So she doesn't really get to say these aren't my positions. This isn't my administration. I'm new -- I'm the outsider.

Look at this map. This is the CNN forecast, 270 to Win, where you see yellow states, those are the states that CNN rates as toss-up states as battleground states, the states where the candidates are focusing. How do you know they're focusing? Well, just watch where they've been. Vice President Kamala Harris and Tim Walz leading up to the convention, pretty much hit every single one of those yellow states. In primetime last night, before the vice president gave her speech, you saw the governor of North Carolina speaking, you saw congresswoman from Georgia, you saw the governor of Michigan, you saw several key voices from Arizona. They know what they're doing. It's intentional and they're not the only ones, the Trump campaign as well. Throughout the course of this week, think about where the former president has been -- well, he started the week off on Monday in Pennsylvania, then he went up to Michigan, then he went to North Carolina. Today as we've seen and talk to Alayna -- Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene on the ground for us in Nevada and Arizona, where they're going tells the story. Wait, there's two others that I didn't talk about. Oh, yeah. J.D. Vance was in Valdosta, Georgia, and also in Kenosha, Wisconsin, earlier in the week. They're traveling because they know turning out those voters in those states matters enormously. Georgia, well, Joe Biden flipped that in 2020, only won that state by a little over 11,000 votes. What about Arizona? Just over 10,000 votes, razor thin margins, every visit matters, every dollar spent matters. Where are we talking about when we say dollars spent? Well, let me pull this up and show you the spending right now in terms of where things stand right now, presidential spending in battleground states, Pennsylvania, obviously everybody talks about how all roads go through the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, huge sums there, over 70 million for each campaign. But you tick through the seven battleground states, tens of millions of dollars. They know those seven states and possibly just tens of thousands of voters could decide this election. And that's where everybody is he's going all in. What do these types of ads looked like? Well, let's take Nevada where the former president just gave his remarks at a tax on tips event.

Personally is a key point at the end of the convention, we are all looking around going, wow, I've not, I've never seen the Republican Party this unified. They felt like they were on a glide path to 270 plus a lot, everything has changed. What hasn't he still has a 50/50 at worst shot at winning, what about the campaign? The campaign is, I think finding its footing once again, obviously, Biden had President Biden had promised that he was going to stay and there was no way getting out. And so, to have that kind of flipped on its script really did put everything aside. But I think when Vice President Harris named Walz, I think that kind of put everything back into perspective. You saw very strong pushback on his record on the questions that his comments continue to raise. They were a little more prepared, I think for that announcement and to come back and show the American people more the truth of Governor Walz and where that lies.

Joining, us now is Republican congressman Brian Mast of Florida. Congressman, I always appreciate your time. I want to sort of -- I was at a Trump campaign event in North Carolina, was about national security -- something you know very, very well -- on Wednesday. And it was interesting, the former president addressed what I think it'd been a lot of the private concerns we've heard from Republicans about don't do personal attacks, stay away from -- from the vice president on personal issues. And he polled the crowd. Basically, he was very clear, he was frustrated with these advisers who had been telling them, stick to policy. Don't talk about personal attacks. How do you feel like the campaign and the former president has handled this moment over the course of the last month? REP. BRIAN MAST (R-FL):  But I think sometimes, what's going on with the country is personal for all of us. The president takes it that way. Whether you're talking about border, whether you're talking about military personnel, different policies, they touch us all personally. And that comes out in the way that he speaks. He is an authentic individual that sees the teleprompter once in awhile to say this is a subject that means he might speak on. But after that, he is an off-the-cuff individual just talking to a crowd of people like you might speak to people in a diner somewhere. And he's always going to speak what's on his mind. And I love that authenticity every single day.",

They are there by the thousands. I think the question I have though, with this event specifically, you have the vice president, presidential candidate J.D. Vance, was there, gave a very kind of well thought out coherent speech about the former president's first term foreign policy. Keith Kellogg, former general commander and 82nd Airborne Division, who is an advisor to the former president, did so as well.When people listened to the former president, what people took away was stuff like that.

And again, I just go to the point that he's going to speak what's on his mind, and that's the authenticity that we love and we want to see that continue. You don't want a rehearsed president when it comes to somebody that you want to see strong foreign policy, because that means if they're rehearsed, all of those foreign intelligence agencies, they're going to look at somebody that can't think on their feet. That's not going to be able to make an impromptu decision. They're going to read them like they read President Biden right now. Instead, when you see President Trump, they know a red line is a red line for that man. They know if he says, you know, you're roll the dice and you're going to pay for it. If they roll the dice, they are going to pay for it, that's what Russia's intelligence assesses about him. That's what Chinas intelligence assesses about him, Iran, North Korea and everybody else that makes him the strongest national security president.",

He had the conversations with them about what they went through and what he's saying is actually very reflective about the cost that it has on the service member, that it's not something that you want to see your friends come, come home underneath flag-draped coffins. It's something important to reflect on.
