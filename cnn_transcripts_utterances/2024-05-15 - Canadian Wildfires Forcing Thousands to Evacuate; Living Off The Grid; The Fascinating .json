Heating and cooking is done with wood, harvested from the land. Electricity comes from solar panels, hydroelectric and a wind turbine. Here`s some goats. We milk the goats twice a day.

On average people work one to two days a week doing other work because we are paying rent here. There are challenges here but then there are huge challenges in terms of what people are going through in their everyday life out there. And anyone could learn the land skills. Anyone could learn the decision-making process. Anyone could choose to live in a way where you`re making being in harmony with the being in harmony with the other people around you the priority. There are many, many ways in which people could live which would give more to the world than they`re taking from the world. This is just an example of it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If you believe the answer was root, soil or leaves if you said seed then it`s time to turn up because you are correct. Most plants start as seeds which contain a plant with leaves stems and roots. Now, let`s dive into the fascinating world of medicine where it all begins. Believe it or not a lot of the medicines that we use started in nature. Plants create special chemicals to protect themselves from pests and diseases and many of these same chemicals can help us too. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

When I look at a plant I`m looking to its chemistry and trying to understand the secrets that may unveil new medicines. The use of plants as medicines goes back to the very origins of humanity. 34,000 species have been documented as being used in some form of traditional medicine yet scientists have only looked at around a thousand of these plants. I`ve traveled to some incredible places across the world in my search for nature`s next medicines. We`re looking for the next type of antibiotic. The work that I do is deeply personal to me. I was born with multiple congenital defects of my skeletal system which required the amputation of my leg at the age of three. I developed a hospital acquired infection that nearly took my life. Luckily back in the 1980s we still had antibiotics that worked against some of these really bad bacteria. Today we`re not so fortunate. CRAIG HOPP, NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY &amp; INTEGRATIVE HEALTH: A lot of our antibiotics have been around for a long time and the pathogenic bacteria continue to develop resistance to them unless you come up with a continuous supply of new antibiotics. Acting by new mechanisms is not just enough to have a new antibiotic.",

We collect plants in the field. We press them and deposit them into an herbarium which is like a library of life. We also take samples back to the lab where we pull out the chemistry from the plant. Some of our most exciting discoveries have come from plants like the American beautyberry, the European chestnut, and the Brazilian pepper tree. We`ve discovered molecules in these plants that are very effective in the treatment of the worst drug-resistant bacteria including MRSA or drug- resistant staph. We`ve also discovered fascinating molecules from the American beautyberry plant. These molecules restore the activity of antibiotics against very dangerous resistant bacteria. The next phase of our research involves moving these discoveries from the lab to human clinical trials.",
