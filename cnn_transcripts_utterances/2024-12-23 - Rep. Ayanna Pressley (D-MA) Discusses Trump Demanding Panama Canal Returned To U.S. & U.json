Listen, the Greenland stuff we heard during his last administration. The Panama Canal comments are of note. What do you think President- Elect Trump is trying to do with these demands?",

I have every reason to believe that they will dismantle the Department of Education, defund Head Start, seek to privatize Social Security and Medicare and much more. So I'm bracing for the impact of wholesale harm of a hostile administration, representing one of the most unequal districts in our country that felt the disparate impact of the policy harm of a Trump administration. Including the fact -- I just want to lift up since, again, on the President Biden's decision today to commute those 37 sentences for those on death row to life without parole. In the final days of Trump's first presidency, he executed more people than had been executed for the last six decades. So again, I commend President Biden. He saved lives.",

The 26-year-old is accused of fatally shooting health care exec, Brian Thompson, earlier this month.He is being held in one of the nation's most dangerous federal jails, the Metropolitan Detention Center, in Brooklyn, or MDC. It's the only federal facility which operates in New York City. One judge has described it as having, quote, \"dangerous, barbaric conditions and an environment of lawlessness.\" For more about what things are like there at MDC, Justin Paperny joins me now. He's a prison consultant who served more than a year in federal prison for investor fraud and conspiracy, and also the founder of the firm, White Collar Advice. Good to have you with us. I mean, this is -- my colleague, Kara Scannell, has also done some reporting on this. To say it doesn't have a great reputation, may be putting it mildly at this point. There have been a number of issues and concerns about this jail. What is it like inside? JUSTIN PAPERNY, PRISON CONSULTANT &amp; FOUNDER, WHITE COLLAR ADVICE &amp; SERVED TIME IN FEDERAL PRISON: Well, it's so bad there's an interagency operation taking place right now to investigate all of the problems in New York. And it's understaffed. It can be difficult to get people to work there, together with the violence and suicides. And with the Bureau of Prisons not wanting any risk, they're going to confine him 23, 24 hours a day. I can tell you, my partner served 26 years in prison, including eight years in the penitentiary and one full year in the hole. And he said after he got out of the hole, life was measurably easier. So it's difficult and the hardest part of the experience, going through detention and just serving so much time in segregation.",

He is now in a predatory environment. So for that reason, the prison system cannot have any additional issues following the Epstein debacle and all of these investigations. So we have clients right now in this detention center who will say, even though you're allowed to shower a few days a week, it may be one shower a week, brush your teeth once a week. Many don't know if it's morning or night. So this will be a very difficult experience for him, and he has to learn to focus on what he can and cannot control. But he should expect to spend a great deal of time in segregation and learn to enjoy his own company and somehow, some way, to find meaning through this very difficult environment he allegedly created.",

And we tend to be enamored by celebrity in this country anyway. And we have to own that's what he is, a celebrity. So some prisoners are going to be enamored. They're going to like it. Some are not going to care. Others are not going to like that he's getting this attention. So there will be all -- I say, when I went to prison, it was easy. Nobody knew me. All eyes are on him, so he should adjust accordingly, not try to manipulate this environment to his liking. A lot of prisoners do because they're used to getting what they want whenever they want it. Especially if you've been raised with some privilege and background, which is something I can relate to. So if he ever makes it to population, they could offer him an iPhone, drugs, things that can make his state easier. And I would tell him, understand what follows every decision you make on the inside because, certainly, people could be looking to exploit and take advantage of you. That's prison.",
