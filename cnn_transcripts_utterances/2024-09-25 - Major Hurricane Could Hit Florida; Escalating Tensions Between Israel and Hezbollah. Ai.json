We`ve got Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles on the show today answering some of your questions. Cannot wait to share that with you in just a bit. I`m Coy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we`ve got an action-packed show for you today. So let`s get to it. First to the Gulf of Mexico, where a tropical storm is developing into a major threat for the Southeastern United States. The National Hurricane Center says a system in the Gulf will pick up pace and rapidly intensify into Hurricane Helene. Florida is bracing for what could be the United States` most powerful hurricane this season. Tropical storm-force winds could begin as early as this afternoon for the Florida Keys. The storm is expected to make landfall in the state late tomorrow. Helene would be the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. this year. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared an emergency in more than 40 of the state`s 67 counties. That will help speed up preparations and coordination between the state and local governments before the storm`s impact. Meanwhile, Hurricane John struck Mexico`s southern coast earlier this week as a Category 3 storm after rapidly strengthening in the Pacific. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph as it made landfall in Mexico. John has since weakened to a tropical storm, bringing catastrophic rainfall to parts of Mexico. That deluge of rain is triggering warnings of dangerous floods and mudslides. Thousands of people have evacuated the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and many businesses in tourist areas along the coast have paused their operations. Next up, we head to the Middle East, where the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, a paramilitary group in Lebanon, are escalating. Both sides are trading waves of airstrikes over Israel`s northern border, and the United Nations says the number of displaced people in Lebanon is set to rise as tens of thousands flee their homes. CNN`s Jeremy Diamond has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Israeli airstrikes battering southern and eastern Lebanon. It is the most intense Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since the 2006 war, and the deadliest. Hundreds were killed and many more injured, as the Israeli military said it targeted Hezbollah weapons depots and rocket launchers. Meanwhile, Israeli air defenses springing into action as Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets and drones at Israel, targeting the city of Haifa and aiming further south than usual. At least two rockets hitting the West Bank, more than 60 miles south of the Lebanese border and just east of Tel Aviv. As Israeli fighter jets carried out airstrikes, the country`s leaders say they are deliberately escalating, hoping to change the equation.",

If you said irregular galaxies, put your hands up. They have unusual shapes like toothpicks, rings, even little groupings of stars. All right, let`s get to some news from out of this world. NASA is preparing to launch its SpaceX Crew-9 mission to the International Space Station tomorrow. It was originally set to carry four people, but now only two will be in the capsule. That`s so astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore can grab a couple of seats back to Earth early next year. Remember, they got stuck on the ISS after their ride home, the Boeing Starliner, had complications with its thrusters. And check out the moment a NASA astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts landed safely in Kazakhstan on Monday. A Soyuz capsule carrying them undocked from the International Space Station before heading back to Earth and touching down safely. Welcome home. Next up, The GOAT, the Gold Over America Tour. A resplendent show featuring Simone Biles, she and fellow Team USA gymnast Jordan Chiles are headlining 30 shows in 30 cities over the next month and a half.
