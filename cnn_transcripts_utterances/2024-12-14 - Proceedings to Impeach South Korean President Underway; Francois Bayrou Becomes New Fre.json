      "sentences": "They're moving very quickly right now. Kim, just seconds ago, the officials in the national assembly completed the count of the vote. And all 300 lawmakers voted. So this has moved very, very quickly.And it's quite different from what we saw a week ago in the same halls of the national assembly, when there was not effectively a quorum, when the president's political party abstained from participating in the vote. And so the impeachment effort failed. Here we see that the ruling political party, the People Power Party, has participated. So you have 300 legislators that have all participated in this vote. We are waiting to find out whether or not the president has been impeached. Again, it is just 1.5 weeks ago that President Yoon Suk-yeol made a short-lived attempt to impose martial law on South Korea. It was overturned within a matter of hours by this same assembly body. And there has been widespread condemnation of this, what many, I think, in South Korea see as having been an unconstitutional power grab by a president who was frustrated with opposition in the very halls of this national assembly. So we're just waiting right now to get the results of what could potentially be an historic vote. In 2016, Kim, another president at that time, Park Geun-hye, she was impeached amid allegations of corruption and stripped of her office, then subsequently by the constitutional court and then ultimately ended up in jail. President Yoon right now is in a lot of hot water. He's had police raid the presidential offices in the last couple of days. And now we're learning, waiting to find out what his fate has been just moments ago in this vote in the national assembly. Kim.",

Appreciate that.I want to bring in from Seoul Kenneth Choi. He's the deputy managing editor of the \"Chosun Ilbo.\" Thank you so much for being here with us. So now that the voting has ended, I mean, this is all about the math. Will they get to the 200? I mean, the fact that the voting happened so quickly, do you have any sense of which way the wind is blowing? KENNETH CHOI, DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR, \"CHOSUN ILBO\":  Well, I think right -- the whole thing tilted toward impeachment because the seven members of the ruling party stated out that they will vote for the impeachment. And then there are more shy, ruling party members who would come out and vote for the impeachment. So I think, most likely, even though the ruling party this morning said that, OK, we'll participate in the voting. But you know, the party rule, party opinion is that we will not impeach the president. But I think there will be rebel parliamentarians who will vote for the impeachment. So I think it is almost, I would say, more than 90 percent that the impeachment will process as it is all expected.",

I mean, it's hard to speculate now but any sense of what might happen?Would the ruling party pay a price?

And this shows that nobody is above the law in this country.And if this president is ruled by the constitutional court, that he needs to be removed from the office, it will be the second president who's going to be removed from the office as a result of this impeachment. And I think this shows that the Korean democracy is really ingrained in our society. And even though it's a disappointing -- the fact that we all have to go through another big political tussle. But I think, after this, Korea will be standing up again as a very solid democratic institution -- I mean, state in the world. And we will continue to progress in the future.",

So I want to explore that a little bit here. One of the members of the PPP said he would vote for impeachment, quote, \"for the sake of swift stabilization of people's livelihood, economy and diplomacy.\" So I want to talk about those last two. What are the effects here? I mean, on the economy, there was -- there was so much at stake. It's Asia's fourth largest. Take me through what the considerations were there. And then, diplomatically, South Korea is such an important country, has such an important role in the region in terms of countering China, its alliance with the U.S. So certainly there were plenty of things at stake here in terms of how it might shake the allies' faith in the country. Perhaps some of that reassured today.",

And when the president Trump is coming in, in January 20th, he has stated that he'll put tariffs all over the place. So that will be a very big uncertainty ahead of Korean economy. So we have to -- I mean, somebody has to deal with this issue. But you know, without having a president, I'm not sure whether the acting president will have the mandate to deal with all these external uncertainties. So that's the number one issue right now that Korea faces economically. I mean, diplomatic -- diplomatically, the president -- again, president Trump is coming in. He has mentioned that, he's going -- getting along very well with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. And South Korea is sort of the bedrock in the security in northeast Asia. And right now, we are not so sure, if we don't have the president to negotiate with president Trump, to deal with this whole issue, then, again, the Korean diplomacy is -- are up in somewhere in the cloud and we are lost, will be lost in this region. And all the diplomatic efforts for the past 2.5 years, getting along well with Japan and try to set up this trilateral U.S.-Korea-Japan relationships to deal with the free flow of navigation in the Pacific and so on, all these things will be put on hold. And which, again, will put us on a back burner and the Korean diplomacy will be turmoil. So, for those two things, a lot of Koreans are worried about it.",
