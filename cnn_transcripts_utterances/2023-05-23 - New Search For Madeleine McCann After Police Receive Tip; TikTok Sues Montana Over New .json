      "sentences": "Fantastic reporting. Thanks, Nic.All right, police in Portugal beginning a new search for British toddler Madeleine McCann. She was just three years old when she vanished from her bedroom while on a vacation with her family in May 2007. Now a recent tip is prompting this new investigation, which is expected to take place at a reservoir for up to two days. CNN's Scott McLean has more. Oh, this story, Scott, and that picture of that beautiful little girl. What new information do investigators have in this case?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So the reason that they're going back to this area is based on a tip from German prosecutors who are investigating a suspect named Christian Bruckner. He is a known pedophile and a convicted rapist.Why they're going back to this area in particular though is unclear. This is a mountainous, sort of bushy scrubland area about 35 miles or so from Praia da Luz, the resort town where Madeleine McCann went missing from. It is also an area that police had actually searched back in 2008 in the reservoir there itself. In that case, they found animal bones but nothing else. We understand from our colleagues in Portugal that this time around this two-day search will be focusing on the land area. Now, Christine, this case from the get-go, back in 2007, has been filled with twists and turns. The McCanns, themselves -- the parents -- were initially viewed as suspects. There was a lot of criticism about the initial police response to this as well. And it wasn't until 2020 that German prosecutors announced that they had a suspect named Christian Bruckner, as I said. And it seems like they have a lot of circumstantial evidence against him. His cell phone was in the area at the time. He tried to re-register one of his vehicles a day later. His story has also changed. Initially, when he was interviewed as a witness in 2013, he said he was out of the country and then later, he said that he was with his girlfriend that night but prosecutors haven't found any girlfriend to support that at the time. The prosecutor in this case has also refused to deny the suggestion that they found something belonging to Madeleine McCann inside Bruckner's trailer where he was living. Under German law, though, prosecutors have to prove to a judge that they actually have enough evidence to secure a conviction; otherwise, they can't lay charges. And the clock is ticking. Bruckner is jailed right now for seven years for the rape of an American woman in Portugal but he is more than halfway through that prison term -- Christine.",

Who use it to learn about the outside world.And so, TikTok is saying not only does it violate their First Amendment rights but it violates a number of other federal laws that sort of single -- sort of singling out TikTok here.",

It seemed like everything was going in. Look at this. Aaron Gordon couldn't believe it. The most points in a playoff half in his career. Thirty-eight years old, year 20, unfathomable. But Gordon -- he couldn't believe this either. He didn't seem to do anything wrong. LeBron just full of attitude and passion here. The Lakers take a 15-point lead into halftime but the Nuggets two-time league MVP Nikola Jokic erupting in the second half, scoring 20 of his 30 points. He had 14 rebounds, 13 assists. His eighth triple-double of the playoffs breaks the great Wilt Chamberlain's record for the most in a post-season. In the final seconds, LeBron had a chance to tie it to send it to overtime but Aaron Gordon got the last laugh, blocking that shot. Denver completing the sweep 113-111.

A short-term one you can take your cues from what happened in 2011. The markets going to correct but it will kind of work its way through and then sort of bounce back. But the real concern is whether or not it's going to be long and protracted. That is where you get some unprecedented downturns. Really, the market could tank more than 40 percent. So the issue with your 401(k) is don't stop that because you're saving weekly. But when it comes to maybe cash, cash is going to become king. Gold will do well.

You wanted to just kind of close your eyes and ride that.But this other scenario -- this 40 percent scenario you're talking about if things get really ugly, that concerns me. What if you have a kid?

Of course, if you don't need money for a long time, that will become another buying opportunity. But other things will do well.
