      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, sandbags, school closures and a race to get out of its way. Hurricane Idalia prompts millions to drop what they're doing and prepare for a life-threatening storm surge that's now just hours from the Florida coast.Plus, just doing his job or aiding and abetting an alleged criminal scheme. Mark Meadows spends three plus hours on the stand, trying to show his actions were just normal chief of staff things and not part of a conspiracy to subvert the 2020 election. And a campaign clash over foreign policy turns uglier. Vivek Ramaswamy calls Nikki Haley a liar, and then calls her by name she chooses not to use. Some see it as a thinly veiled dog whistle. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, Florida eyes a monster, a major hurricane swirling off its shores. Forecasters warn that hurricane Idalia could be a once in a lifetime storm that will gain strength as it barrels towards the panhandle. Already officials have ordered evacuations across much of the Gulf Coast. They've told residents to expect widespread power outages for days and they warn storm surges as tall as two cars stacked on top of one another. And that of course that poses a life-or-death risk to anyone who stays behind. Let's get straight to CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam who is in Clearwater, Florida. What are you seeing so far, Derek?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. It's the calm before the storm. And listen, what we've got behind us is a record warm ocean and that is not what we want to see, this time of year with a strengthening storm. It is going to feed off of that warm water and that means we are expecting a strengthening hurricane Idalia upon arrival right, Wednesday morning, that is what we're eyeing for the Big Bend.Look at 85 mile per hour winds that is still a category one, but we are forecasting a powerful category three teetering on a category four, splitting hairs when you start talking about the potential destruction that storm of that magnitude can actually bring. But it is over the open waters of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and it is pushing up the storm surge as we speak. There's the latest information from the National Hurricane Center, 125 miles per hour. That's just a tick short of a category for status. And you can see how it exits Florida and enters into southern Georgia and the Carolina as you need to be watching the storm very closely as well. Wonderful resources here at CNN, we have the ability to show you from the air why this coastline is so susceptible. And you can see the approach of some of the first rain bands here into the greater Clearwater Beach area, Tampa Bay within the next hour, so we expect tropical storm force gusts. But these numbers have been updated from the National Hurricane Center in terms of potential storm surge. Again, this is above normally dry ground as we zoom in to the great the Big Bend of Florida. This area has the potential to see up to 15-feet of storm surge. We have all seen this story play out before we are reminded of what happened roughly a year ago in Fort Myers Beach with the storm surge and the catastrophe that unfolded there. But this is the worst-case scenario for a highly vulnerable coastline. And you can see why it is just so shallow in this part of the world. The intercoastal to the barrier islands, they're standing roughly five to 10 feet above sea level. So, if you're talking 12-feet of inundation, the potential to have that water come up and over these areas is certainly a possibility where we're located and also in the Tampa Bay, four to seven feet that will still cause problems across the immediate coastline. And we're going to monitor that very closely as well. Dana?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And they've said it over and over. We spoken to the mayor of Clearwater, we spoken to the sheriff of St. Petersburg. We have talked to the head of the FAA. All of them speaking with one voice. If you are in a mandatory evacuation area, get out now, save your life, worry about your stuff later.It looks like nothing is happening. There is a little bit more wind that we've noticed, come upon us from the seaside. But this is going to change and when it changes. If you are not already out of harm's way, you may not be able to get out of harm's way, especially because, yes, this is going to be a strong wind event. But as you just heard Derek saying, this is really about the storm surge. That is where the danger to life is. That is where the danger for structures are. When that surge happens, it's not just as if it's a slow trickle, it is a rush and it is coming at you fast and furious. And it is just not something that you want to mess about with. We heard from Governor DeSantis. He's just added 49 counties that are all under an emergency order at this point in time. And he did mention something that is particularly interesting, and particularly something to pay attention to. He says, you know, you'd have to go back to the 1880s or the 1800s, since the area that's going to be hit here has really seen a hurricane on a path like this one at this strength. We are expecting it to be by the time it hits landfall, a category three that's packing a whole lot of winds, but mostly it's bringing up that water. And I just want to remind you of something because of the day that it is, it is August 29 today. In 2005, August 29 is seared into a lot of our memories because that is when Hurricane Katrina made landfall. And that too, was a category three storm. And what was that all about? It was about the water. That's what was so deadly. That was the problem, and everyone needs to be aware of that if they are in a mandatory evacuation zone. Dana?",

We will be checking back with you throughout the day, even the hour if you see something changed there.Right now, I want to show our viewers some live pictures of Key West. You can see winds are already whipping around as a dahlia lumbers towards the coast there. And in Cuba, already it's getting a brutal glimpse into what Florida might see in mere hours. People are wading through knee high water as evacuation buses idling in rapidly rising storm surge. You see those photos there, that video. I want to go to Cuba.

And of course, when a dalek skirted (Ph) Western Cuba, it came as a much weaker storm that would have Floridians will face. It was a tropical storm and then it turned into a category one hurricane early this morning.And while it would seem like Cuba missed the bullet. You know, there's images of people walking through flooded streets. Some of the rain that we felt all throughout the morning was just lashing people who were trying to go to work. We didn't expect it would be quite this bad, Dana, but we hours this morning, where the rain absolutely pounded us, and that we saw how quickly the streets can flood, how the wind can just pick up out of nowhere. It actually knocked over some of our camera equipment, kind of out of the blue this morning. So, the situations can change very, very quickly. And of course, Cuba got a much weaker storm than what Floridians are going to face because as Idalia travels into towards Florida, it is going through warmer waters and that is the fuel for hurricane. So, Floridians are going to face a much, much stronger storm than we faced here in Cuba.",

And it could really have a nationwide impact. You know we're hearing from Southwest Airlines, which is especially well leveraged out of Tampa, and it could be disproportionately impacted by this storm.The Tampa airport closed at 12:01am today. A preemptive strike really, because they're mostly concerned there about the storm surge. The airport is right on the bay. And they're also concerned about projectiles, the infrastructure trying to move airplanes out of the way. It's really causing a trickle-down effect to cancellations nationwide. These are the latest numbers from flight aware about 491 cancellations. That's the latest from flight. We're checking it right now. 1083 delays nationwide. These numbers are going up by the moment. The FAA is monitoring this from its data center. It's command center in Warrenton, Virginia, and it says it has had a teleconference earlier today. There was another one being planned for later on today. There is big concern here that this storm is going for some major hubs. St. Pete/Clearwater, it closes at 3pm this afternoon. So, we're only hours away from that. What's interesting is that Orlando International Airport will remain open. Thankfully, at least right now, at least the airport is saying that it's inland and won't be too impacted that badly. But we're seeing airlines already tried to make it easier for passengers to change plans. So many people anticipated to travel for this long Labor Day weekend. And we know that behaviors have changed. A lot of people really start traveling on Thursday just because of the fact that they can work from home. So, this could have a really big impact you, Dana?",

It is still up in the air at this point whether Meadows will get his wish to move his case to federal court. But we learned a lot Monday about how the former White House chief of staff plans to defend against a sweeping indictment in Georgia.He spent three plus hours on the witness stand and his attorney led him through a carefully orchestrated story of his last few months in office. The main takeaway that Meadows said politics was central in his federal role as Trump gatekeeper inside the White House. CNN Sara Murray is live for us with more on that.

But that's what they did with Meadows because they wanted to drive home this notion that everything he was doing, even if it may have seemed political was actually part of his work as White House chief of staff, and therefore it should be moved to federal court.So, calls involving Rudy Giuliani, who was then Trump's personal attorney, that was all part of his official duties. The call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where Trump asked Raffensperger to find the votes. They said that that was part of Mark Meadows' official duties. He said that these voter fraud suspicions were a roadblock to the peaceful transfer of power and that he was trying to just land the plane on this whole peaceful transfer of power to incoming President Joe Biden, which of course, didn't go well considering January 6. His lawyer went so far, Meadows lawyer as to say essentially, everything was within the scope of Mark Meadows duties as White House Chief of Staff except if he, you know, went to Lafayette Square Park and shot someone, Dana?",

He would think everything the president told him to do that was his job, and he was acting within the scope of his job. But that's not necessarily the way a judge is going to interpret what he was doing under color of authority.Technically, color of authority means the acts that you undertook that were authorized by the statutes or the constitution that gives you the authority you have. So, I think he is on very shaky ground in terms of whether or not this judge is going to go along with his incredibly broad interpretation of his duties, or whether he's going to draw lines around things like the Hatch Act. No, you do these things as a federal high -- ranking federal official, and you did other things that were political, those two don't mix and therefore no removal.",

He tells me do something, I got to take care of it. That might have some jury appeal, meaning don't blame him. He shouldn't have gone down. Might have had some legal strategy appeal to maybe cut a deal ahead of time to say, I was just trying to serve the boss, I didn't realize it was illegal. Where it doesn't work for him is to try to expand the job description to cover these accusations that were clearly outside a normal chief of staff's duty.

Maybe they don't know what a chief of staff's job is, talking about a jury specifically, do they see this as, OK, this was what the president was focused on.
