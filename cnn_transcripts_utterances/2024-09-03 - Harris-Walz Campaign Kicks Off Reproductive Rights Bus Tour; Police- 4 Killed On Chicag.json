In front of some audiences, he takes pride and credit for having gotten Roe v. Wade overturned. In front of other audiences, he wants to keep a distance. On the one hand, he tells you he wants more than six weeks. But then he tells you, within 24 hours, that he's going to vote no on Amendment 4. Well, he can't have it all ways. We're not stupid. And we don't forget. And he is going to be pregnant with the consequences, the horrible consequences of Dobbs, and he's going to have to carry it to term because, come November, women will remember.",

The suspect then opens fire, killing all four of them. The victims have not yet been notified. Authorities say that they're still waiting to make notification to their next of kin. Now, about 90 minutes after the shooting happened, authorities did, indeed, apprehend the suspect. They say that it was surveillance footage from inside the transit system that was key, allowing them to track this suspect, intercept him, and then take him into custody. You can imagine that the Chicago area commuters, they're certainly shocked. Police gave an update describing this as a tragedy striking yet another American community on a holiday. Have a listen.

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, Brianna, this basically amounts to the successful infiltration by a Chinese government agent into the New York State government for at least a decade.And we are learning the details. They were -- are outlined right here in this indictment, which we got our hands on earlier today. [14:40:02] And federal prosecutors are accusing Linda Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, of acting as agents for the Chinese government, enriching themselves, taking millions of dollars in kickbacks, helping their family members and their friends. And all of this while she was working as an aide to both Governor Kathy Hochul, most recently, but also during the administration of former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Part of what's alleged here is that Linda Sun was using her position of influence to help the interests of the Chinese government. Now you might be wondering, what does the Chinese government have to do with New York? But as you know, here in New York City, nearly every community is represented and they often look to their state officials for support and recognition. And that's exactly what the Chinese Communist Party appears to be doing here. And Linda Sun is accused of helping to make that happen. At one point, prosecutors say that she used her position even to block Taiwanese officials from having access to government officials who we're looking for connections around cultural events, cultural activity, which is so much of what a state government does. Now we do have a response from the governor's office, who responded earlier today to the news that Linda Sun and her husband had been arrested this morning. They said, in part, \"We terminated her employment in March of 2023 after discovering evidence of misconduct, immediately reported her actions to law enforcement and have assisted law enforcement throughout this process.\" Now, I do have to say, Boris and Brianna, this does raise serious questions just about how Hochul and Cuomo were vetting their employees, considering that Linda Sun worked in the office for several years and in other government agencies. That raises some questions about that as well, just how much access she had. And the fact that she was able to provide that access and information to the Chinese government.",

When you go to these campaigns, to get the crowd involved and get them happy about what they're hearing, they play music in the background. We'll show you Donald Trump dancing to the song, \"Hold On.\" He's done it several times. He's played it over 100 times at campaign events across this country. Isaac Hayes Jr --- or the III, basically wanted them to stop playing the music. He said it was copywrite infringement. For the last year and-a-half, maybe even two years, they've been asking the Donald Trump campaign to stop playing the music. And of course, you have licensing agreements. So you have to pay to use some of these songs if you don't have an agreement from the artist. So this back-and-forth has really played out not only on social media, but between the lawyers. I can tell you today, in that court, the judge basically told the Trump campaign they had to stop playing this song. The one victory for the Trump campaign was the idea that did not have to bring the videos down from online that have the song playing in the background as Trump dances along. But take a listen to Isaac Hayes III talk about this victory for his family today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
