      "sentences": "Well, the jury in Trump's criminal trial asked to rewind all the way back to day number one. The questions they're asking and what it might mean for the deliberations. Plus, there's new reporting on why the Trump team thinks there might be one juror on their side. And there's new trouble for Diddy. What investigators are now doing that could lead to an indictment. Cassie's former makeup artist is with me in just a moment. What she says she saw, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"Well, the legal drama that has been Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial is nearing its long-awaited finale. But before the jury can write the final script, it appears that they want to rewind and re- watch episode number one. Today, the 12 jurors ended their first day of deliberations by asking to review testimony from the very first witness who took the stand. For those of you who cannot remember, allow me to help you. His name is David Pecker. Remember, he is the head of the National Enquirer, the one who said that he would catch and kill stories to help Trump's campaign, Trump's so-called eyes and ears. The jurors asked for three different parts of his testimony. Now, one is about that 2015 Trump Tower meeting where Pecker says that he talked about how his magazine could possibly help Trump's campaign. The jurors, they want to hear more, though. They also want to get to Michael Cohen's testimony about that meeting. And the other is a phone call that Pecker had with Trump in which Pecker recommended that Trump buy that Karen McDougal story to keep it quiet. And the fourth one, because there are four separate ones they want to hear about, is Pecker's testimony about not finalizing that Karen McDougal deal. And tomorrow morning, the jury will get at least a half-hour's worth of that testimony read back to them, again, at their request. They also want to hear the jury instructions again. Whew, the same ones that Judge Juan Merchan gave them this morning over a period of a few hours, by the way. I want to bring in CNN's legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, Ellie Honig, also CNN legal analyst Karen Friedman Agnifilo. Karen is counsel for a firm representing Michael Cohen, but she does not have any contact with Michael Cohen and does not work on his case. Okay. First of all, help me to unpack for a second, Karen, what it means to have this court reporter read everything. This is not a quick process. There are no cameras in the courtroom, no audio. It has to be really Pony Express style, right?",

And what happens is it goes on this piece of paper, this long piece of paper, and into a computer. And the court reporter then reviews and edits the computer system and makes a final transcript that includes both admissible things that came into evidence and things that didn't come into evidence.It's really a transcript of the sidebars, the bench conferences of if someone says objection, that's in there, and if the judge says sustained. It has everything in there, including testimony. So, the reason the court reporter has to read back the information is when they find the portions of the testimony that are responsive to the note, they'll go through, and they will read that and then omit the parts if there's a bench conference or an objection. That's why they don't just send it back, because the transcript has all sorts of information in it.",

      "sentences": "Right. This narrative is spinning a little bit out of control, right? The talking point that seems to be taking hold is, well, the judge said they can convict him less than unanimously. That's not accurate. Now, let me explain the way it works, and I think we have a visual that helps us. The actual charge that has been brought is falsification of business records under New York law. Now, part two, which raises that up to a felony, is in order to violate a state crime. Here, the state crime is state election fraud, which says you cannot try to interfere with an election through unlawful means. And that brings us to part three.Now, the D.A. has argued there are one or two or three of three different unlawful means: federal campaign laws, tax fraud, and falsification of other business. Now, with that menu of three at the end, the judge has said, as long as there's a conspiracy to commit any one of them, and you don't have to agree which one, that's enough under New York law. That's probably a correct version, a correct reading of New York law. We don't know exactly because we're in a little bit of uncharted territory. And this will be grounds for appeal if Donald Trump gets convicted. Not saying he's definitely going to win. We don't know. But it is fair to say part three of the crime here, what's the other -- other crime, they might not have to all agree. But also, let's be real. The case here is federal campaign finance law. I mean, the D.A. barely mentioned tax in their case in chief or in their closing. The falsification of other records, to me, is sort of nonsensical. Ninety-eight percent of the focus has been on federal campaign finance law. So, if they convict, it's going to be on that basis.",

And all the other jurors would basically look at their feet or look away and not make eye contact. This guy would. And when the various congressional surrogates for Trump would come into the courtroom, this juror's face would -- quote -- \"light up,\" especially when he saw Ohio Senator J.D. Vance.So, he seems to be, at least in the estimation of the Trump crew, plugged into who these various political figures are, and he appears to admire or like them. Now, again, he could just be being nice or showing good manners or who knows what. But I think this also speaks to a certain level of almost desperation or worry, I should say, in the Trump campaign and in Trump's orbit that the best he could hope for is a hung jury. They're really bracing for a conviction. Who knows what happens then. But to the degree standing trial is sort of the stages of grief, looking at this one juror who makes sort of smiley eyes and thinking, well, maybe he's going to hang the whole jury and mis-try this, is sort of the bargaining stage of grief for the Trump operation at the moment.",

So, looking for those outliers, looking for those -- one person who's going to somehow throw a wrench into the works and is going to fold their arms and say, I'm not going to convict, that becomes important. So, the personality dynamic that you're looking for in jury selection is important. Are these jurors going to get along? Are they going to work together?

These two flags. Symbol used by the \"Stop the Steal\" movement. The upside-down American flag spotted flying days after the insurrection at Alito's home in Virginia. Then you have the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag seen flying last year at Alito's beach house in New Jersey. Now, tonight, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the chief justice, John Roberts, urging him to request that Alito recuse himself. Earlier today, Alito took the unusual step of responding directly to senators who want him to step aside from the cases involving Donald Trump on January 6. His message? He's not recusing himself. But he did confirm that his wife hoisted the upside-down flag -- quote -- \"in large part to a very nasty neighborhood dispute in which I had no involvement.\" There was the bus that went over her. There you go. The \"Times\" reports that the dispute actually did happen. But a text message and a police call confirmed by Virginia authorities indicated it happened in February of 2021. That'd be a month after the flag was spotted at Alito's home. As for the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, Alito insists he was -- quote -- \"not aware of any connection between this historic flag and the \"Stop the Steal movement\" and neither was my wife.\" With me now, former Obama White House senior director, Nayyera Haq, and former Republican congressman, Joe Walsh.
