And that'show Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the IDF is describing the situation. Yotam Haim was from Kfar Azar, one of the Kibbutzes very close to the border with Gaza. He was abducted October 7th, as was Samer Talalka. He was from Nir Am, another Kibbutz that was also near the border. Now, there was a third person also killed. The family are requesting his name or their name, not be broadcast. But the way that the IDF is describing this is that their troops face combat scenarios like this every day. That there were in an environment where they thought these three individuals prevented a threat, after the battle subsided, they were able to analyze the situation and realize that they needed to check and get better identification. And that process was carried out after the bodies were taken back to Israel and confirmations were made. And families were called and told about what had happened. Now, the IDF is saying that they are putting a very clear message out to all IDF forces in conflict, in Gaza about instructions and guidance about the possibility of hostages, and how to handle those situations. Because they say they don't want this to happen again. So the IDF describing it as tragic. And obviously, a terrible ending after all these weeks and months of worry and wait for the families.",

But you could weave in the challenges we've discussed, trying to carry out their operations to target Hamas in the face of still more than a 100 hostages that are there.

And you know, the first thing that I thought of was thefact that last week, one of the released hostages angrily confronted the Israeli prime minister, saying you have no information, you have no Intelligence, talking about the fact that the location where she was being held by Hamas was actually shelled by the Israeli military. Now, today's incident appears to be much more direct, much more within the line of sight of Israeli forces, and what it speaks to is, of course, the danger that this Israeli military operations -- that Israeli military operations can and in this case did indeed present to civilian hostages being held in Gaza. You know, and it also comes as the Israeli military as it launched this war in response to Hamas' terrorist attack on October 7th, it actually loosen the rules of engagement for Israeli soldiers. Allowing them to shoot with while conducting fewer checks that they normally would to distinguish between a threat and perhaps something else. And I have -- I talked to a number of Israeli officers and officials in the lead up to that ground incursion, who made very clear that especially as it related to northern Gaza, which was the focus of that ground offensive for the first several weeks, that they were effectively going to view anything that moved as a potential target in northern Gaza, because that had had civilians to evacuate south. And we know that as a result, a number of civilians have died, many of them in bombing campaigns by the Israeli military. But some perhaps in similar incidents to what we saw, what we are now seeing today. And so, it's clear that especially as we have the National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan here talking about what he sees as a disconnect between the Israeli military's intention to reduce civilian casualties to distinguish between military and civilian targets, and the reality on the ground. I think it's clear that, that mismatch, that has now applied not only to thousands of Palestinian civilians who have been killed, but also now to three Israeli civilians who were being held hostage in Gaza.",

To your point about Sullivan's message that they do want to see that gap close, and it's not a new message, we've heard it now for many days. Do you get the sense that there is a look that's going to be consequences or implications if we don't see that from the United States.

And they were all engaged, and the hostages were caught in the middle of it. As far as we know, it was like a mistake, an attempt for hostages to be released. It was an active combat situation. And more and more of this is at risk, when you put the forces on, when you try to operate with infantry forward, when you're in close combat as the Israelis are right now. So it's terrible tragic. It's regrettable. It's -- you're going to do everything you can to prevent it. But soldiers are going to shoot in their self defense. And that's just what happens.",

General Clark, is there -- is there -- do you think anything more, and that will be reflection I'm sure from the IDF at this moment, and going forward of ways that they can better avoid these circumstances as difficult as they are.

I even met with several of them during this week while they were visiting Kyiv or other things online. And they seem to be optimistic that eventually it will get through. But delay could be costly.

OK, Germany, formally arrested three suspected members of Hamas on Friday after they appeared before a federal judge. They and a fourth suspect were accused Thursday of making preparations to attack Jewish institutions in Europe. It happened on the same day Dutch and Danish authorities arrested four other people in a separate terror investigation. Fred Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  A lot of new developments after those anti-terror raids that took place here in central Europe. The Danish authorities now announcing that on top of the four people who had been placed under arrest on Thursday, that there are four other suspects who have also been placed under arrest in absentia. That means that these suspects are still very much at large. And that means that there could be further raids going on, not just in Denmark, but possibly also other European countries as well. The Danes themselves are saying it's still very much ongoing investigation. They so far have not mentioned the name Hamas when talking about these raids. However, Israeli Intelligence, namely the Shin Bet and the Mossad have said that this was a foiled plot by Hamas, thanks to these anti-terror raids that happened. Now, the Danish Prime Minister did come out and talk about the war that's going on in Gaza, saying it was absolutely unacceptable for anyone to bring that conflict to Denmark. So clearly, implying that what is going on in Gaza also has something to do with those anti-terror raids that took place in Denmark. Meanwhile, in Germany, the four suspects there have now formally been placed under arrest by the country's federal prosecutor. Of course, three people were arrested in Germany and one in the Netherlands. And all of them have now formally been placed under arrest. The German authorities have been a lot more open about talking to links with Hamas. They say at least, some of the suspects had very long ties to Hamas, and in fact, also apparently had very good contacts. The Germans say to the armed wing of Hamas, the Qassam Brigades. The Germans are saying that apparently, Hamas have been stockpiling weapons here in this country, talking about a weapons depot that apparently, some of these suspects were trying to find. They say that they were tasked with bringing those weapons to Berlin for possible attacks on Jewish institutions in Europe. Clearly, this is still a situation where the Germans are saying that they are very concerned about all this.  At the same time, they are praising their law enforcement authorities for coming to terms with this threat. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And U.S. regulators are also warning for the first time that the use of artificial intelligence poses a risk to the financial system. Sophisticated AI models have exploded in popularity in recent years, but authorities say they come with risks for financial firms, especially relating to cybersecurity and privacy issues. Matt Egan joins us now on this story. Matt, this is a fascinating one because we've had warnings left, right and center on the AI risk. But actually what jumped out at me from this report was it wasn't actually about the cybersecurity and the privacy risks. It was that financial market participants could start adopting AI tools themselves. And actually at some point something could happen and they actually don't know what's taking place. Fascinating.",

      "sentences": "Julia, it is fascinating. I mean, there's no question that AI is this breakthrough technology. If you play around withsome of these tools, it's almost mesmerizing what they can do. Writing stories and seemingly creating images out of thin air. So, there's the potential for so much good, but clearly there are risks there as well. And I do think that regulators here in the United States do sound increasingly nervous about some of the risks in the real world, including the financial markets that are really at the heart of the world economy. And so they have laid out a series of risks. Now one thing that they flagged is bias, where AI tools have a tendency to make bias decisions at times. And when you think about it, play that out in banking, that's obviously a problem, right? I mean, imagine getting denied a request for a mortgage or a car loan because essentially a robot is making a decision based on the color of your skin or gender. Cyber is another issue. There's -- some people have raised the risk that maybe some of these AI tools could actually get trapped -- tricked by hackers, sort of letting the bad guys into the bank. That's obviously an issue. Another one is this hallucination issue that some AI bots have, where they have a tendency to sort of make stuff up kind of like a toddler, but just way more believable. And so one recent example here in New York is there was a lawyer who filed the legal brief and that brief relied on six cases that turned out to be bogus. And the source of those bogus cases was an AI chatbot. So clearly, if you play that out into financial markets, there's some issues there. So, I think that the message from regulators is that they're on the case, they're looking at this, that they want banks to make sure they test out these models and don't introduce a lot of risk into the system. But Julia, as you know, this is a delicate balance, right? Because if they don't regulate this enough, then you could have a situation where they are introducing dangerous elements into the financial system, but if they do too much, they could stifle innovation in this AI arms race and really let other countries, including potentially China, leapfrog ahead of the United States.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and the IDF says it's got an investigation on going. And Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, who washolding a press conference, releasing this information, was asked questions about precisely how this happened if the three people, the three men, were actually freed. Were they on the loose escaping? You know, what was the precise scenario? And he painted a picture, Hagari painted a picture whereby he said that was possible, that the -- that the fighting in and around the area, they were in the Shijaiyah area, that this area itself, a lot of intense fighting that maybe the three men had escaped from whoever was holding them, or maybe they'd been released by the people that were holding them. But we don't know if this happened in daylight. We don't know if it happened at nighttime. We don't know if they put their hands up in the air and shouted to the soldiers in Hebrew. We just don't have any information, but what we do know is that the soldiers have been told, the IDF troops operating in Gaza have been told that civilians have been told to leave the area, and therefore anyone you come across could be associated with terrorists. So, from a soldier's perspective, an unexpected three men appearing, and you can't see where they're hands are, you can't see if they've got weapons. As Hagari said in his first statements, they appeared, or potentially appeared to be a threat. So, this is exactly why the families have been worrying. More than a hundred hostages still held, and these were two of them, at least, were young men who were on Kibbutz's near Gaza. They would have been familiar with the potential dangers, and probably themselves, quite -- one would expect, quite ready to take an opportunity if the chance of escape came about. But this just shows all those dangers, and tragically there may be more of this to come, although the IDF says that they're working to avoid it.",

Nic, it does play into the bigger conversation about Israeli intent, and we saw the National Security Advisor for the United States reiterate that Israel's intent is to protect civilians in this conflict, as they continue to try and target Hamas. What do you make of what we saw in the ongoing pressure, I think, that the United States is applying to further close that gap, going after Hamas, but also putting more emphasis on the protection of civilian life in Gaza and beyond, of course, and what the consequences are if they don't see a narrowing of that gap?",
