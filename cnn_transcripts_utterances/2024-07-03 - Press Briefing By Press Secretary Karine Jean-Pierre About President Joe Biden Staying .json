What was he doing? He was greeting supporters, hundreds of supporters that showed up to cheer him on after the debate. You saw him speaking at 9:00 or at night in New York in front of supporters. So, he's been pretty, pretty much out there after the hours of 4:00 p.m. and before, before 10:00 a.m. for sure.

JEAN-PIERRE: So, I'm going to be really mindful. Obviously, you're asking me about campaign numbers and data that's coming in. And look, what I will -- what I will note is that this is a president that looks at everything, takes in all the information, it's important to him to do so. I don't want to get into hypotheticals here. That's not what I'm here to do. What I can say is, in this moment, we move forward on building on this unprecedented record that the president has been able to lay out for the American people, and that's going to be our focus. I don't want to get into hypotheticals. I don't want to get ahead into anything else. O'DONNELL: It doesn't sound like closing the door to reviewing this over a period of time. JEAN-PIERRE: What I can say is the president is moving forward. He's moving forward as being president. He's moving forward with his campaign, as his campaign has been very, very clear about that. That's what I can -- that's what I can speak to, and that's what I can say, and that is the president's focus. The president's focus is, how does he continue to do that work. And anything else that we're hearing or that's being reported is absolutely false. O'DONNELL: Is the president telling people he's evaluating the -- JEAN-PIERRE: Absolutely false. That is absolutely false. I saw that reporting. We were not given enough time to get back to that reporting, just a couple of minutes, and we asked the president, the president responded directly when asked about this question, because we said that we would, and the president said it is no, it is absolutely false. That's coming directly from him. O'DONNELL: What steps would the president be taking, or would you as a team plan to try to prevent another episode in public that would be deemed worrisome? JEAN-PIERRE: I would not call it an episode. I would call it we had a bad night, right? It was not his best night. He had a cold. He was jet lagged. You heard directly from the president about this, and when we get back -- when we get knocked down, when he gets knocked down, he gets right back up.

Are these -- are these events very important for him to show to the American people that he still has the ability to be the nominee?JEAN-PIERRE: I would say that this moment is critical, regardless of the debate or not. We are living in an important moment right now. Everything is at stake. And I got to be mindful, because this is all connected to what's happening in November. And I think any leader would say they always have to prove to themselves to -- you know, to their constituents, right? It is a day in and a day out work. And yes, the president is going to have engagement. He's going to be out there speaking to the American people. Obviously, we mentioned Wisconsin. He's going to do an interview in Wisconsin as well. We talked about Pennsylvania. But the president was also out last week, Atlanta and North Carolina and New York, where he saw supporters. This is a president that has been consistently out there talking directly to the American people. He understands, as you all asked me about the economy and what people are feeling, he understands that they have to hear directly from him, and he has to continue to do that so that he can lay out his agenda. He can lay out what he wants to continue to do. It's always going to be part of, you know, the calculation, right, to continue to prove to the American people that he can continue to do the work and deliver for the -- for him on behalf -- deliver on behalf of the American people.",

If there are so many questions right now about whether President Biden can do this job, why are we not seeing the president out there every single day in an unscripted way without teleprompters?JEAN-PIERRE: Well, you're good. You're going to see him today, certainly. And I know you're asking about the teleprompter. You're going to see him tomorrow, right, Fourth of July. He'll have an opportunity to welcome active duty military and their families and certainly their loved ones here on the South Lawn, as he does every year. And I think that's going to be important. He'll be able to engage with them and thank them directly, and you'll see him in Wisconsin, and you'll continue to see him obviously in the upcoming weeks. Look, it is not unusual for a president to use a teleprompter. It is -- it is not unusual. That is something that presidents have done in the past. I think what we also have to remember, and I'll keep saying this, because I think it's important to not forget that he has the strongest economic recovery in modern -- in modern history. He has led a historic midterm win when everybody was talking about a red wave, and he was been able to defy that and deliver by leading -- by being a leader, right, obviously doing the midterms as a Democratic leader, and he's going to continue to work to get lower, lower costs. I think that matters. I think his record certainly matters. And you are going to see him, continue to see him, you know, having interviews. He's going to do ABC as you know, George Stephanopoulos, one of your colleagues, that's not scripted. And he has done more than 40 interviews that have not been scripted. Interviews do not have a script this year alone. So, you'll see him out there connecting with the -- engaging with the American people, and I think that's important.",

You asked when is he going to be unscripted? He has been when he went to visit a diner in a couple of days ago at the Waffle House, when he met with -- met with some of the supporters in Atlanta, North Carolina, where hundreds of supporters showed up. He certainly had an opportunity to engage on Friday, he's going to be taking some questions from one of your colleagues. I think that's going to be important. And we're going to continue to engage with all of you. We're going to certainly looking forward to doing that. He'll have a press conference next week at NATO press conference, a big boy press conference, as Justin from Bloomberg stated yesterday. And so, we'll do that, and he's looking forward to it.",

I don't have anything else beyond that. He is staying -- he is staying in the race. That is what the president has promised to do. That is what he wants to continue to work on the successes that he has had.

He said he wanted to speak personally about his concerns.JEAN-PIERRE: Yes. Look, I can't speak to the outreach that he made. I have not spoken to the Office of Leg. Affairs, so I can't speak to that. What I can say is the president certainly has looked forward to working with Democratic leaders and congressional members over the past talking about his record, certainly his record when it comes to legislation, getting things done. He couldn't have done it without Democrats like Doggett, and he appreciates his -- obviously, his support and his partnership. I can't speak to outreach. It's not something that I've spoken to the Office of Legislative Affairs about. And look, the president -- you want to take that? He seems like he just brought me up in a Briefing Room. I have something to say. I would also note that I don't have any additional calls to read out or to lay out. One of the reasons that I mentioned it at the top, because I know some of you were trying to confirm, and wanted to make sure that we got to you -- got back to you, all of you about that. And as you know, he's going to meet with Democratic governors, as I just stated at the top. So he's going to continue to do engagement. It is important against some of these leaders, he could not have delivered on this record -- on this record accomplishment that he's been able to get done without them.

Obviously, that's something that the campaign should respond to. But I would remind you that the day after in North Carolina, the president spoke to his debate performance. He did. He talked about it. He gave, you know, his thoughts. He also stated that, look, I'm not as young -- I'm not a young man. He said that. I'm not as smooth talker as I -- as I used to be. I don't walk easily as I used to be, and I don't -- I don't debate as well as I used to. He said this. And so, he owned up to it in -- on Friday, the day after the debate that afternoon.
