Our colleague, Brianna Keilar, has the day off.Today, Mexico's president is giving a starkly different account of her call with President-elect Trump after he pledged to slap hefty tariffs on Mexico over the issue of immigration. Trump posted on social media that President Claudia Sheinbaum, quote, \"Agreed to stop migration through Mexico and into the United States, effectively closing our southern border.\"",

She said, quote, \"Everyone has their own way of communicating, but I can assure you, I give you the certainty that we would never and we would be incapable of it, to propose that we would close the border. It has never been our approach. And, of course, we don't agree with that.\"Now, I will point out, as you said, Trump said that Mexico had agreed to, quote, effectively close the southern border. So perhaps that word effectively is doing a lot of heavy lifting for President Trump in that statement. It does show that there is, though, this chasm between the President-elect and the Mexican president over this - the future of trade between these two countries and how these 25 percent tariff threats that he has put in place or he is threatening to put in place would potentially play out. It is an early sign, too, of just how Donald Trump intends to conduct his trade policy via threats on social media, direct phone calls, very transactional approach where it's hard to pin down exactly what is hyperbole, what is a direct threat, what exactly would be effective and what a victory even looks like. Because after that conversation and after those posts on social media where Trump seemed to claim victory, it's not even clear what policies he has won and also whether he intends to take away that threat of a 25 percent tariff. And I've asked his transition team if that is the case and this 25 percent tariff would go away and I have yet to get a response.",

We've seen a number of people involved in the tech industry increasingly siding with Donald Trump, getting close to him. Obviously, Elon Musk is one of those individuals. It's kind of ironic that Mark Zuckerberg is not one of them. Remember, Zuckerberg and Musk at one point had threatened to get into a cage match with each other, but here we are where their two sides are now behind Donald Trump.And Meta spoke with our Hadas Gold yesterday and provided this statement saying, quote, \"It's an important time for the future of American innovation. Mark was grateful for the invitation to join President Trump for dinner and the opportunity to meet with members of his team about the incoming administration.\" It's also an interesting development given just what Trump had to say about Musk only months ago in a book he released. He accused Zuckerberg of, quote, \"plotting\" against him and even threatened to serve him with a life sentence if Zuckerberg got involved in the 2024 election in any sort of way. But now they're having dinner together, just a complete reversal from just a few months ago, guys. MARQUARDT: Yes, got to wonder if Zuckerberg brought up that very, very significant threat to throw him in prison for the rest of his life. Steve Contorno from West Palm Beach, thanks so much.

What do you make of Trump and some of his allies really claiming victory after this phone call with the Mexican president?NOMIKI KONST, 2016 DELEGATE FOR BERNIE SANDERS: I think it's part of the course for Donald Trump to have his own version of events and obviously put that out on Truth Social, his own social media platform, that he's making money off of as he goes into the next presidency. But with that being said, you know, yes, the top two issues polled up until the election were, of course, inflation, the economy and migration. But what's fascinating about this proposal, this tariff proposal to basically dismantle the UMCA if Mexico does not abide by what Donald Trump says, even though immigration is down over 40 percent in the last five months, is that the burden is actually going to be put on the United States. The people of the United States. We know that the UMCA is critical for - globally, it provides the framework for national and international investment. The costs of goods, of course, are going to go up for the American people. So if you think inflation's bad now, wait until he dismantles the UMCA and puts tariffs on China. We import 40 percent of our goods from China and Canada. So he's using a pretty much not completely resolved, of course, but an improved migration situation at the border as a tool, as a weapon to actually hurt the American people. And that is the brilliance of Donald Trump. I will give him that. He runs as a populist, but he operates as a capitalist who wants to deregulate, dismantle and, basically, destabilize the world by using very popular tactics as weapons.",

They don't trust that Hezbollah will abide by it. And they also don't trust that the Israeli government will actually enforce it.And so that is why Netanyahu is going out and making that point.

So I'm very concerned by that.But on the other hand, what the agreement brought is the fact that Hamas is more - is isolated more than ever at the moment. They are - they have no, their closest ally that joined their fight on October 8th have left the scene at the moment. And perhaps that will push whoever left in Hamas leadership in Gaza to understand that they need to stop sacrificing the life of their own people, sacrificing the future of the Gaza Strip and seal a deal.
