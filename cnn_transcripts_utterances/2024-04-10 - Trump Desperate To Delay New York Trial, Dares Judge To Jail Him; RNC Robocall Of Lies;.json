Trump rejected three times in three days, failing to delay his hush money case which starts in four days, as he openly dares the judge to call him out for violating his gag order. Also breaking, quote, massive fraud. Our KFILE uncovering a new robocall on behalf of the RNC's new co-chair, whose name is Lara Trump, spreading lies about election fraud to 145,000 people, and Andrew has the tape. And an OUTFRONT exclusive, our Oren Liebermann takes us aboard a U.S. bomber for one of the longest million military missions in the world, one that takes Oren to the doorsteps of China, Russia, and North Korea. You'll see for yourself. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: the breaking news, three strikes. Trump's legal team back in court, suffering another blow tonight with four days until Trump's first criminal trial is set to begin. His team trying yet again to kick Judge Juan Marshawn off the case and while Trump is trying every single trick in the book to get the hush money case delayed in New York. He is also daring the judge to call him out for violating a gag order. Today, Trump fired up a whole number of posts online, including one which was a response to the disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti, who formally represented Stormy Daniels. And Avenatti wrote about Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, two likely witnesses in Trump's case, and Trump responded to that by saying, thank you to Michael Avenatti for revealing the truth about to sleaze bags, who have with their lies and misrepresentations cost our country dearly. Lies, misrepresentations and sleaze bags. According to OUTFRONT legal analyst Ryan Goodman, who's with me in just a moment, this is a clear violation of Trump's gag order, which prohibits him from, quote, making or directing others to make public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding. Now, both of the individuals mentioned there, Stormy Daniels, obviously, the center of this, Michael Cohen as well, sleaze bag, lies, misrepresentation, pretty obvious there. Is the gag order that was put into place because the judge ruled Trumps past attacks against jurors and prosecutors were, quote, threatening, inflammatory, and denigrating, and all of this has had a tangible real effect and real life for some of the people who will be testifying in this trial, including Stormy Daniels, who recently in a documentary spoke about some of the threats that she's received.
