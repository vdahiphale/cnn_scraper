Tensions have been soaring along Israel's border with Lebanon amid fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, even as Israel continues its operations in Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas is now in its fourth month, and the military has intensified operations in southern Gaza, specifically in the city of Khan Yunus, where the Israel Defense Forces claims terror targets were hit overnight Monday, including infrastructure and weapons storage facilities.

Just last week a Hamas leader was killed in Beirut as well. A Hamas leader in Syria also being killed. So this is really widening, or at least raising the tension in that area. We've heard from the defense minister in that interview that their priority is not to increase tensions or to start a war on the northern border. Their priority, he says, is to put 80,000 Israeli citizens back along that border. They have evacuated those citizens from northern Israel for fear of them being harmed in this cross-border tit-for-tat, also saying that they will make a sacrifice, if need be, that Hezbollah knows that they can copy and paste what they are doing in Gaza in that area as well. So, pointing out that if they need to, that they could escalate the situation. Also saying that they're fighting against an axis rather than an individual or rather than one entity.

The Houthis suspended their attacks. It was a little quieter on the border with Lebanon.So it's clear that the militias are tuning up their attacks to be a retaliation for what Israel is doing. But the Israelis make the case that if their central objective in the war is to destroy Hamas, ending the Hamas operation or ending the Gaza operation before they've achieved that will undercut their long-term goal. I think what you're going to hear the secretary argue to them is that they can, at this point, do this with much more targeted operations and could suspend the overall bombing.

And then I think the third issue is this question of strategy and the degree to which the Israelis avoid the kind of bombings that have resulted in more than 20,000 civilian casualties.

It starts by increasing resources and capacity of the different agencies, more border patrol agents, additional presence of USCIS to conduct asylum screenings and of course added flights for removal and repatriation proceedings. But in this case, the money needs to go further than that by allowing more coordination between the agencies that therefore they can provide quicker process for migrants. The issue, or at least one of the issues at the border right now is that there's just not enough detention space for the number of migrants that are arriving and migrants who are seeking protection wait months or years in some cases for the first step to be able to go to their court hearings. That needs to be faster processed and it requires changes in how the money is allocated across the agencies. But also, there needs to be more significant additional resources for organizations that work on the border on both the Mexican and the U.S. side to try to help migrants address issues of vulnerability that we've seen from time before and that way many of them can be able to either be integrated better into communities once they enter the United States or in Mexico wait for a lawful pathway, for example, through a CBP-1 application that the U.S. has.",

And one of the reasons why is because between Democrats and Republicans, the key factor that hasn't been well outlined is what would be most efficient in the short term to provide a reduction in irregular migration versus what can be better in the long term to reduce what we're seeing of the flows that happen now. What makes the flows that we see at the border today different from before is that they come from -- migrants are coming from farther places that usually the United States does not have a repatriation agreement for, and also more families are coming, in which requires significantly different conditions for them to be detained, but also ones that are released into the United States. So, until that happens, until there's a compromise between what happens to migrants who are arriving versus what happens to them once they're in the United States, I think we'll continue to see difficult negotiations come ahead.",

I think what matters here the most is how or what possible policy changes he could make in the future if he was to become president again. And one of the key pieces that we continue to focus on, at least in terms of the research of the policy side, is what can be the capacities and how can they be sustainable so that there's an important shift in how migrants perceive coming to the United States lawfully versus how can they come between ports of entry. And I think either President Trump, if he was elected again, or President Biden, face in this case a very similar structural issue with changes in what we're seeing in terms of migration trends.

Her government faced criticism last year following controversial immigration and pension reform bills. Borne was the second woman in France's history to hold the country's second highest office. President Emmanuel Macron praised her work on social media. Borne will stay on until her replacement is appointed.Ecuador has declared a state of emergency after a high-profile gang leader escaped from prison on Sunday. More than 3,000 police officers and soldiers are looking for Adolfo Fito Macias. He is the leader of Los Choneros, one of Ecuador's most feared gangs. They have been linked to maritime drug trafficking to both Mexico and the United States. Macias was transferred to a maximum-security prison in August of last year and was reportedly serving a 54-year sentence. South Korea's parliament has voted to pass a bill banning the controversial and rare practice of breeding and slaughtering dogs for their meat. That practice is centuries old but is not common anymore as more people support animal welfare and keep dogs as pets. The bill also bans the distribution and sale of food products including dog ingredients. It does not include penalties for people who consume dog meat. And Marc Stewart joins us now live from Seoul with more on this. So, Mark, what is the significance of this change?",

Obviously, this is a measure that will force them to make a change. And there are provisions in place under this law to help them make that transition to go into other areas of business. There's also a grace period. But it is clear there is a big philosophical shift in South Korea on this issue.In fact, Rosemary, we talked to the owner of a cafe here in Seoul that sells dog meat and sells that to customers. He told us that he's moving away from this and perhaps will go out of business altogether.",

In 2016, Beckenbauer and three other German football officials became the focus of a criminal investigation related to their bid for the 2006 event. Swiss prosecutors alleging financial corruption, including fraud and money laundering. Beckenbauer and the others strenuously denied any wrongdoing. A trial would follow, but proceedings, having earlier been put on hold due to the global coronavirus pandemic, ended in 2020 without a verdict because the statute of limitations had expired. But it's as a superbly gifted and decorated player that Franz Beckenbauer will be best remembered, undeniably, one of football's all-time greats. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

It comes as we learn that part of the country's western coastline has actually shifted 250 meters towards the sea after the quake.Researchers at the University of Tokyo released a preliminary survey after measuring the coastline before and after the quake. A professor at the university says parts of the Noto Peninsula also rose by 3 to 5 meters, but the survey has not been peer reviewed yet. In the coming hours, we are set to get a new reading on the fight against the climate crisis. The E.U.'s Copernicus Climate Change Service will hold a news conference outlining their findings on global climate trends in 2023. Scientists already know last year was the hottest on record. Journalist Simon Cullen looks at what we can expect in 2024.

Given the scale of the challenge, many countries were hoping that global climate talks in Dubai would deliver the bold action needed to limit further warming. In the end, the agreement did put a sharper focus on the future of fossil fuels.
