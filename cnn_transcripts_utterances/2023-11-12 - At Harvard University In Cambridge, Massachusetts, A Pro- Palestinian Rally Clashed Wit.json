Since the October 7 terror attack on Israel and the war that followed, there has been a spike in antisemitic attacks around the world, including in the United States. The FBI recently warned antisemitism is reaching historic levels. Its data shows Jewish Americans make up 2.4 percent of the public, but they're the targets of more than 60 percent of religious hate crimes recorded in this country. Since October, Jewish day schools have closed or had to hire extra security. Synagogues have gone into lockdown and college campuses, in particular, have seen a surge in antisemitic incidents, including some assaults.Over the next hour, CNN's Dana Bash explores the roots of antisemitism in America and how they've spread. You'll also hear from some who personally experienced threats and attacks in the past month, and have started hiding their Jewish identity in public at a fear for their safety. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sunday, October 29, in southern Russia, barely three weeks after the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, an angry mob stormed the tarmac and rushed to plane that had just arrived from Tel Aviv. They were hunting for Jews. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH LIPSTADT, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR MONITORING COMBATING ANTISEMITISM: They weren't saying give us the Israelis, which would have been terrible anyway, but they were young. Where are the Jews? Where are the Jews? That was plain old overt antisemitism. I, Lipstadt -- BASH (voice-over): Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt is the U.S. State Department's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. She was sworn in in 2022, amid already rising hate around the world.",
