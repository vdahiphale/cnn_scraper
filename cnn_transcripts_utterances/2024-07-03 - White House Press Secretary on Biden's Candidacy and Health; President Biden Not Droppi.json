And I know you're asking about the teleprompter. You're going to see him tomorrow, right? For the July -- he'll have an opportunity to welcome active duty military and their families, and certainly their loved ones here on the South Lawn as he does every year. And I think that's going to be important. He'll be able to engage with them and thank them directly. And you'll see him in Wisconsin and you'll continue to see him obviously in the upcoming weeks. Look, it is not unusual for a President to use a teleprompter. It isn't. It is not unusual. That is something that Presidents have done in the past. I think what we also have to remember now, I keep saying this because I think it's important to not forget that he has the strongest economic recovery in modern -- in modern history. He has led historic midterm win when everybody was talking about a red wave, and he was -- been able to defy that and deliver by leading -- by being a leader, right? Adversely doing the midterms as a Democratic leader. And he's going to continue to work to get lower costs. I think that matters. I think his record certainly matters. And you are going to see him, continue to see him, you know, having interviews. He's going to do 'ABC\" as you know with George Stephanopoulos, one of your colleagues. That's not scripted. And he has done more than 40 interviews that have not been scripted. Interviews do not have a script this year alone.

He has been when he went to visit a diner in a couple of days ago at the Waffle House when he met with -- met with some of the supporters  in Atlanta, North Carolina, where hundreds of supporters showed up. He certainly had an opportunity to engage on Friday. He's going to be taking some questions from one of your colleagues. I think that's going to be important and we're going to continue to engage with all of you. We're going to certainly looking forward to doing that.

I see a president -- when I'm in -- sitting in front of him, you know, going through the day or talking about what he's doing next, he is someone that engages with us. He wants to know, he pushes us.

We've been listening to White House Press Secretary KarineJean-Pierre speaking to reporters and answering what can only be described as a difficult series of questions about President Joe Biden's debate performance, his health, and his candidacy for president. The headlines, she was asked directly this, is President Biden considering stepping down. Her answer was, \"absolutely not.\" She went on to say that he has not had any physical or doctor's visit since his regular annual physical in February, her explanation for his performance on Friday is jet lag and a cold, though she did say a number of times, this is not an excuse, it's an explanation acknowledging that President Biden's performance in that debate was below par, to say the least. I will say that the president himself has commented today on his campaign plans, and he said the following during a campaign stop to reporters, I'm quoting, \"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can and as simply and straightforward as I can, I am running. I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one's pushing me out. I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end, and we're going to win because when Democrats unite, we always win.\" Those are the words of the president. And you heard the words, as well, of the White House press secretary there. That said, the questions continue to linger, as do polling numbers that show some erosion in the president's support in recent days. I want to bring senior politics reporter Stephen Collinson, who is in Washington, D.C. Also, Chris Whipple, the author of \"The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden's White House,\" both were listening to that White House briefing. And Stephen, it's the second briefing in a row for the White House press secretary in which he has asked a series of questions about the president's health and his political future. Whatever the answer, those are not the questions that they want to be answering repeatedly at this stage of the race.",

      "sentences": "Right. I think the most important thing, as you were saying, is this idea that the president willnot fold his campaign. That was necessary for them to try to stop this runaway train of reports that saying that he is, in fact, doing the exact opposite, that he's evaluating his position and that the next few days will be decisive. But more broadly, I think that briefing showed the predicament that the president's campaign is now in. Almost every explanation for why the debate didn't go very well for him only ends up compounding the central issue, and that is whether he is fit to serve a second term. This new explanation or excuse or whatever that he had jet lag, that only puts the focus on the president's health and energy and stamina.",

She has the toughest job in the country for obvious reasons, but we really need a better answer at this point than things happen, which was what she said at first. Then she said that Thursday night's performance was because of jet lag and a cold. Well, nobody believes that that was caused by jet lag and cold. And I'm afraid that, you know, the sort of go-to playbook of this White House tends to be, let's say as little as possible and just turn the page and move on. We're going to need better answers. This is the biggest story in the world, and they haven't answered that fundamental question. But I think in answer to your question, Joe Biden's not going anywhere at this point. And color me skeptical about the report today that he told an ally that he was thinking about getting out.",

It would almost require that kind of intervention to talk Joe Biden out of running. And of course, nothing makes him more determined to run for a second term than a New York Times editorial saying he ought to get out. And that's --",
