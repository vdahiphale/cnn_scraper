They are suing two California cities that canceled their political events. Now, Eastman was forbidden from practicing law in the state after a judge recommended he be disbarred because of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Eastman is, of course, also one of the defendants alongside President Trump in the Georgia election subversion case. Angelina Jolie is accusing ex-husband Brad Pitt of a history of physical abuse in new legal documents. Jolie filed a motion yesterday as part of Pitt's 2022 lawsuit over the French winery that they once owned together. The filing alleges in part that Pitt was so concerned over his misconduct that he wrecked a deal to buy her stake in that winery all because she refused to sign an NDA. CNN has reached out to Pitt's representative for comment on the allegations. In Florida, a construction worker was killed when a crane broke off a building and fell onto a Fort Lauderdale bridge crushing two cars. Look at those pictures there. Three people were also hurt in that collapse there. The driver of one of those cars said this is about his most frightening close call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Democratic Party is strong and winning elections all across the country. And the Republicans have Trump, who is the ugliest political thing that we've ever seen in modern American history.And I think that when we push all these things forward as we get deeper into the general election, I think there's a quiet confidence with Democrats that as voters wake up and start paying attention that things will improve for us. And that's exactly what we're seeing in these recent round of polls, right? There's no question that Trump, two months ago, had a slight advantage. That's no longer true. Biden -- there are now 16 national polls taken since the end of February that have Biden ahead more than have Trump ahead. And so, we feel good about where we are. We have a lot of work to do. But at the beginning of this general election, I would much rather be us than them as we head towards November. BERMAN:  Well, Rina, I will note The Wall Street Journal -- not to be overly focused on polls -- just had a poll of seven swing states. Trump was ahead in six out of the seven. And inside that poll you also saw some weakness in the Democratic coalition among Black and Latino voters. Young voters upset about the situation in Gaza.

So that slight advantage we see in certain places is not unnatural to me but it's why, right? And what we're seeing with the trendlines changes, certainly with younger Black men or of middle age also tipping to be a little bit more conservative and right-leaning.And then also, the foreign conflicts really impacting that Gen Z sentiment. And let's not forget who delivered the White House for Biden-Harris. It was Gen Z. So, of course, both parties are going to try to turn out their bases. But when you're looking at the Republican side, what throughline are they really going to follow? That's the question for me because I'm not seeing exactly where the strategy is right now. I'm seeing a by- the-week shift. This week, it's talking abortion, which I disagree with. I think the Trump campaign would be better off to, again, keep going on the economy and the border.

Joe Biden -- I've been doing this for over 30 years. Joe Biden -- the party is very unified behind Joe behind. Look, we have work to do. I'm being Pollyannaish here. I mean, we're not every -- we're not exactly where we want to be and there are going to be challenges along the way. And I think the Israel-Gaza issue is a challenge and not a threat to Joe Biden. It's like any challenge in a campaign. You've to manage it and he's going to manage it well. I think he has. I think he's been very aggressive in trying to make tees (PH). Look what he's done with Bibi, right? He's broken with Bibi. He's put pressure on them. He's negotiated a ceasefire. So I think this is going to be one of the issues in a broad campaign.

Judges in two of his criminal cases rejecting his latest attempts to get those charges tossed out.Joining us right now to talk about this is former federal prosecutor, Renato Mariotti. He's also the host of \"It's Complicated\" -- the \"It's Complicated\" podcast. It's good to see, Renato. So these are a pair of kind of major legal setbacks for Donald Trump, at least for the moment. The judges in the Georgia case and the classified documents case both rejected Trump's attempt to have those cases thrown out. And earlier this week, the judge in the New York hush money case rejected another of Trump's attempts to delay that trial until the Supreme Court rules on his immunity claim. So the theme of the week seems to be for a variety of reasons, Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution. So the ends how -- would you describe -- for Trump on the legal front? RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, HOST, \"IT'S COMPLICATED\" PODCAST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, look, I think those motion denials were expected, Kate. When you're trying to delay many of your motions aren't going to be winners. And at this stage of the proceedings, a motion to dismiss is very, very unlikely to succeed for any defendant. I think for Trump, he has to be happy with the Mar-a-Lago case right now and where Judge Cannon is. He -- she may be favorably inclined towards him. But the bottom line is he is staring down the barrel of a criminal trial that's set to begin this month in Manhattan and that can't be a comfortable place for any presidential candidate to be or really anyone who is facing a criminal trial.",

Usually, jury instructions are something that is decided right around the time of the trial and the judge decides what the law is and then just -- the parties propose what the jury instructions are. Here, she was actually hinting that -- and asked the parties to come up with jury instructions for essentially, the argument that the Presidential Records Act gives Donald Trump unfettered authority to just take and keep classified documents. That would essentially immunize him. I mean, it's not tech -- he's not technically immunized but essentially, if that was presented to the jury that was the law, it would be very hard for the jury to not acquit him.What Jack Smith is afraid of is if this happens in the middle of the trial he couldn't appeal. Trump could be found not guilty. There would be no appeal. And that would obviously be a very significant result, to put it mildly. Jack Smith decided -- asked her to make that decision now. There's no -- there's no reason to wait until trial. She refused to do that. She's calling that unprecedented. The reason it's unprecedented for a prosecutor to ask a judge to rule at this time is because the judge usually doesn't tip their hand this early, suggesting that they are going to rule in an erroneous fashion.",

Yes, it's a combination of the barriers put in place by the Israeli government. A combination of that, plus a lot of the safety concerns as we saw with the death -- the killing of the seven World Central Kitchen workers. Those who did get in still don't always make it. Two hundred aid workers killed since the war began, 95 journalists, and 30,000 other innocent people. So I think if you look at the situation in Gaza it's not just one thing but what the aid groups point to is a pattern of inspections that leads them to believe -- and I think there's a lot of evidence for this -- that the Israeli government is not doing what it says already, which is that they say that they're letting enough aid go through and that the process is working. The process is not working. When you have million people on the brink of famine it's clear that the process is not working. And there's also a long record of the Israeli government not fulfilling these promises. These ports should have been opened months ago, according to the U.S. government. So I just think we have to be realistic about the fact that it takes many, many things to go wrong for two million people to be starving to death when there's no shortage of food. And to -- for -- to just say oh well, we're going to open one port and then we're going to open one more crossing and that should be fine I think woefully underestimates the severity of the catastrophic situation, which is it affects not only for the Gazans but for the Israelis, for the region, and for us as the guarantors of a world where things like manmade famines are not supposed to happen. And how can we point to other countries of the world where food is being denied from people in a war zone and have any credibility if we -- if the United States stands by and watches an ally implement these kinds of policies on the people of Gaza today?",

I didn't even know I was wearing a hat because when you walk into this town things just appear -- a hat, a duster, a belt, some boots. Maybe a horse.
