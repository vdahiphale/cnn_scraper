He clearly thinks he is the single best Democrat to be able to defeat Donald Trump because he did so once. We'll see if it plays out this way. I would also say, Jake, it raises the question, I know he's the big front runner. What if Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee?

Some of them were given Clonazepam right before they were freed by Hamas to make them seem happier and less anxious, less frightened in the middle of a terrifying environment. That's according to an Israeli Health Minister office.Also today, a private meeting with Israel's Security Cabinet got contentious as former hostages testified about their horrifying experiences in the custody after being kidnapped by Hamas. We want to show you some of the quotes that were released by the hostage and missing families forum which says it was not -- which, I'm sorry, which says it was present for the meeting. CNN cannot corroborate the testimony with the individuals themselves but one former hostage reportedly told the cabinet, \"They, meaning Hamas, touch girls and everyone knows it. I won't recount details but we had a procedure that no one moves without someone guarding them.\" Hamas, of course, committed acts of sexual violence against female hostages. This, of course, on top of other accounts of rape. Another hostage told the cabinet quote I was dehydrated for 51 days. They didn't give us water. They are inhumane. Hamas deprived hostages of life's basic necessities they said, \"I thought I was going to die. I wanted to be shot.\" Hamas made hostages wish for death, they said. Another hostage said this, \"They told us there's no Israel. We believe them. They made us believe there's no Israel anymore.\" Hamas used psychological warfare against the hostages they testified. This afternoon, President Biden spoke about the hostages at a fundraiser with donors where he said in part, \"Over the past few weeks, survivors and witnesses of the attacks have shared the horrific accounts of unimaginable cruelty reports of women raped, repeatedly raped and their bodies being mutilated while still alive of women corpses being desecrated.\" Hamas terrorists inflicting as much pain and suffering on women and girls as possible, and then murdering them. It is appalling.\" The President went on to say, \"The world can't just look away at what's going on. It's on all of us, government, international organizations, civil society and businesses to forcefully condemn the sexual violence of Hamas terrorists without equivocation.\" Last night, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces told CNN that killing two Palestinian civilians for every Hamas terrorist during their campaign in Gaza is a good ratio.

Nick Fuentes is a notorious Holocaust denier who was racist, was anti-Semitic. And he has been talking to people in the Texas Republican Party launch which resulted in the Texas State GOP Executive Committee, somebody's trying to propose a ban on associated with Nazi sympathizer and Holocaust deniers. And that was rejected that ban.You know, a prominent conservative activist caught meeting with Nick Fuentes. But Texas Republicans thought a ban on fraternizing with Nazis might be a slippery slope or too vague. And I have to say, I haven't gone around to every Texas Republican or every Republican in Congress to ask them what they think. But it doesn't seem too heavy a lift to say that you shouldn't be fraternizing with Holocaust deniers and fraternizing with Nazis.",

But this is part of a pattern, right? It's -- this is not just happening all of a sudden. We've seen a pattern of this, that there is a double standard. Even how Israel is being criticized in this war, look, Israel is not perfect.But I mean, Israel has to live up to the highest of the high standards that the United States cannot meet, or any other country could not meet. And so you know, that's just something that we deal with, in reality as being a Jew in this country, every single solitary day, around the world, and even in Congress is that there is just a different standard. We saw just a couple of years ago, we tried to pass an anti-Semitism resolution when Democrats had control of Congress. And we couldn't get that done by unless we put every other group in there simultaneously. And so there's always a watering down that, oh, it's not as bad or don't worry, it's, you know, it's just the Jews. And this is something that the Jewish community is starting to rally around and starting to amplify because October 7th show the Jewish community that, yes, the Holocaust was a long time ago, but there are people who will still carry those same sentiments today, around the world and in this country, Jake.",

Miles O'Brien is here. He's a CNN analyst and science correspondent for PBS NewsHour. Miles at the rate at which emissions are rising and the planet is heating, scientists warn it will be even more difficult for humans and ecosystems to adapt. So in the year 2030, how might our daily lives look different than they do today?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, the numbers are stark, Jake, OK? By 2034 now, it is estimated we have to get to net zero, which is to say we are offsetting whatever carbon we output with some sort of mitigation to get down to zero at the bottom line. And if we don't do that, or if we do that, we'll still only have a 50 percent chance of getting to the 1.5 degree maximum that we agreed to in Paris, we're already at 1.2 degrees and look at what we're dealing with all around us. So we're already well on our way to trouble and we're not doing nearly enough to reach that goal.",

Now critics argue this is expensive. It's unproven, and it's a distraction from policies to address fossil fuels. Still, do you think carbon capture is better than nothing?O'BRIEN: Carbon Capture has a place, Jake, in tough ones like the production of concrete or steel. But if you're using carbon capture simply as an excuse to continue drilling, poking holes in the ground to pull oil up and burn it in natural gas plants or continue operating coal plants, you're missing the point. We have a green energy revolution which is working. We have cheaper better ways to produce electricity and to spend all of this money to sis -- well, let's max out the fossil fuel industry once again continuing their outright lies.",
