It's the most powerful storm of its kind in more than 20 years and it's causing the northern and southern lights to dazzle many places that rarely, if ever see them.And have a look, this was the sky over Nashville, Tennessee, in the southern U.S. earlier. The time-lapse video captured the vivid hues swirling and dancing above Music City. Further south, this was the view for parts of Florida, a remarkable sight for the balmy state north of the tropics. The northern lights were also spotted across much of Europe and Asia on Friday night. This was the scene in Germany. Now in the Southern Hemisphere, the aurora australis were spotted over New Zealand as well as Argentina. And we'll bring you more images from around the world throughout the hour. The storm will likely continue through the weekend and potentially impact communications, satellites and power grids. Elon Musk's satellite internet provider, Starlink, says it experienced degraded service earlier. But Musk says everything's holding up. Now the geomagnetic storm started when the sun erupted with a series of solar flares and what's known as coronal mass ejections, which launched particles directly at the Earth. So what exactly is a coronal mass ejection, the solar phenomenon that's causing the storm? CNN's Chad Myers explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Some people report seeing some blue. This time with these spectacular colors, many people across Canada, who do not have cloud cover, will be looking toward the sky and continue to look to the sky because of those spectacular colors that we are not used to seeing. The other thing people are keeping an eye on is whether or not there will be any disruptions through anything technical, whether it's the electrical grid or anything else. In 1989 in the province of Quebec, there was quite a widespread power outage that scientists still study today. But back then, they did not have the satellite technology that they have now. They have reinforced those infrastructure grids. But also they have more sensors, more satellite technology. They know a little bit more about what is going to be happening with these solar storms and have a bit more of a prediction in terms of what will happen.

It says that there's not enough information that the U.S. has or has been able to gather to make that definitive conclusion. But it does say that you can reasonably assess that U.S. weapons have been used in violation of international law. It goes on to say that the volume of reported -- of incidents reported raises serious concerns, that Israelis have the knowledge. They have the experience to minimize civilian casualties. But that the results on the ground had been very different and the number of civilian casualties have been huge, suggesting that perhaps these weapons are not being used effectively. Now remember that the whole reason that this report was commissioned in the first time -- in the first place by President Biden was because of pressure coming from Democratic lawmakers. And there may still well be lawmakers who say this report maybe got it wrong. It did not find that Israel withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza, which would have been a violation of U.S. law.

The storm was raging for hours at the extreme level of 5. At that time, it was the most powerful solar storm in more than 20 years. Now this was the scene here in Atlanta, Georgia, in the southern U.S., a short time ago. Much of the Midwest and even northern California still have high chances of seeing the aurora before the sun rises. Now skies over the U.K. and Ireland lit up in vivid colors earlier on Friday night. Parts of Europe and Asia are likely to have another chance to view the lights tonight. Governments and electrical companies are monitoring the situation for potential disruption to communication satellites and power grids. The light phenomenon was caused by a series of solar eruptions that hurled particles directly at the Earth. Now CNN's Kristin Fisher explains how this historic phenomenon can bring about possible disruptions and breathtaking views throughout the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's called a coronal mass ejection and those highly charged particles have been barreling toward Earth at 500 miles per second ever since.

So when these charged particles filled that down through our magnetic fields, in the (INAUDIBLE) poles, they'll then interact with molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in our atmosphere.So on the top level of our atmosphere, it's predominantly oxygen. So the charge particles will hit those molecules, fill them full of energy, then they'll release a photon of light, which will correspond to the red and the green. And then further down, you get more interactions, which will be the nitrogen. And then you get the blues and the purples and you want to get the blues and purples when it's a strong storm, a very dense and fast speed storm. So that's why we're getting a lot more colors because there's a lot more particles coming in from the sun because of these storms.",

It might not be as strong as last night. It's likely that it won't be. But there will be something there. So as we're coming around it at nightfall in Europe, we should start to be able to see it and hopefully in the U.S., it will hang on in there and there'll still be more to see. So it might not be as far south as down to Florida way but in the mid regions in the U.S.. There's a chance that we will be able to see it again. So you definitely won't see it if you're sitting at home. So my advice is to go out into a safe (INAUDIBLE).",

He finished with 26 points but Indiana would find an unlikely hero, Andrew Nembhard, getting the pass from Tyrese Haliburton, with time running out on the shot clock, forced to give it up and nothing but nylon. Nembhard only had two baskets all night, both in the final two minutes. And Haliburton who added team high 35 points just in awe as the Knicks did have a chance to answer. But Brunson would throw up an errant shot trying to draw a foul. The Pacers hold on for the 111- 106 win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Evan Bouchard firing a worm burner that goes off a very unlucky Ian Cole's (ph) stick into the back of the net for the overtime winner. Edmonton's first win against Vancouver this season is a big one as they head back home with a series tied at 1. And in golf, Nelly Korda heating up in her historic chase for a record setting six straight LPGA tour win. The 25 -year old American, one of just three women to win five straight starts. She had her best round ever at the Founders Cup Friday and the lowest score of the day. Six birdies, no bogeys, shooting up the leaderboard into third at -9, entering the weekend, just four shots back. And the WNBA's popularity exploding right now, ticket sales soaring up 93 percent from last year. And now for the first time, they are expanding beyond the United States.
