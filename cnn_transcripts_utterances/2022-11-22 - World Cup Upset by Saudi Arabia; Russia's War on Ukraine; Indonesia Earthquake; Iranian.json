An off says Kherson's infrastructure is too damaged for people to survive the winter. Russian state media have often downplayed major losses in Ukraine. But at least some Russian troops caught in the fighting are being brutally honest. CNN has obtained this audio recording of a Russian soldier in Ukraine, calling his girlfriend. And, compared to the usually optimistic tone from the Kremlin, this soldier is blunt and candid in his comments about the war. Matthew Chance has the story -- and I have to warn you, parts of Matthew's report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As Russia's military highlights its barrage of Ukraine, CNN has obtained exclusive recordings of a Russian soldier describing the brutal of life on the front lines. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The commander's position was shelled, so he packed up and moved further back. But what about us? Aren't we humans, too? CHANCE (voice-over):  The Russian soldier was recorded phoning his girlfriend back home, according to Ukrainian intelligence, and telling her candidly about the severe military setback suffered in the two months since he arrived. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We had 96 people in our unit but now there are less than 50. You don't know what to expect here. Sometimes there's friendly fire and idiots shoot at us because they don't see our coordinates. CHANCE (voice-over):  But it is advancing Ukrainian forces that are the major threat compounding low morale with high bloodshed. Ukrainian officials now reacting to this extraordinary video of Russian soldiers, apparently surrendering, geolocated by CNN to a recently liberated town in Eastern Ukraine. \"Come on out, one by one,\" a Ukrainian soldier calls out. Then a short burst of gunfire before the video cuts off. Later, a Ukrainian military drone shows what appears to be the same men in pools of blood. The Kremlin says it's an execution. But Ukraine says the soldiers feigned surrender and fired at the Ukrainians, accusing Russia of its own war crime. No one disputes the horror. It's unclear if the dead Russians were regular troops or deployed as part of the Kremlin's partial mobilization, seen here earlier this year. But the soldier recorded on the phone indicates he was recently conscripted, complaining bitterly at being unable to leave the war zone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Being mobilized is crap. Nobody can go home until Putin announces the order. There's no way to return. And if we weren't here, they, the Ukrainians, would already be at our borders. They would shell Moscow, Yekaterinburg, shell everything. CHANCE (voice-over):  And that constant threat of Ukrainian attack is having a terrifying effect; in particular, drone strikes which appear to have left the soldier particularly nervous. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  My nerves are on edge. I'm afraid of every rustle, every bang. Every click makes me drop to the ground.",

I have to warn you, before we run it, that it contains graphic details of sexual violence.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Over these mountains is Iran. A regime that has succeeded in cutting many of its people off from the outside world. But disturbing stories detailing the authorities' brutal retribution, systematic sexual violence against anti-regime protesters, have begun leaking out. We've come here to the Kurdish region of Iraq to try and find out more. This is Hannah, not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of Iran. She fears for her life. After taking off and burning her head scarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian intelligence officers. HANNAH, IRANIAN REFUGEE (through translator):  They choose the women who were pretty and suited their appetites. Then, the officer would take one of them from the cell to a smaller, private room. They would sexually assault them there.",

Look here, on my neck. It's purplish. That is why I'm covering it. He forced himself on me. ELBAGIR:  Then, a fight broke out with another protester, drawing away Hannah's attacker. Hannah and others could hear screams and they believe a woman was raped in an interrogation room. Hannah sketched out the police station as she remembers it. She estimates 70 to 80 men and women were together in a main hall that accessed four private interrogation rooms. It was in these interrogation rooms, she says, that she was assaulted and others were raped. CNN was able to locate the police station through Hannah's description, eyewitness corroboration and geolocation, using key landmarks. It's in the Islamabad neighborhood of Irmir (ph). Based on this testimony and speaking to a number of sources, a pattern of repression comes into focus. Police centers used as filtration points, moving protesters from one location to another, often families left not knowing where their loved ones are held. One Iraq-based Kurdish militant opposition party, PAK, identified over 240 people who they believe are missing within this maze of detention centers. Human rights organizations believe the number is higher, in the thousands. Some of the victims as young as 14. Many are man, supporting female protesters. Their punishment, as severe as the women's. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  They brought four men over who had been beaten, screaming intensely in another cell. And one of the men who was tortured was sent to the waiting room where I was. I asked him what all that screaming was about. He said, \"They are raping the men.\" ELBAGIR (voice-over):  Based on witness testimony, CNN traced the location to an Iranian army intelligence headquarters. Voiced here by a translator, a 17-year-old boy sent CNN a voice note following his imprisonment. We are withholding his name and location for his safety. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  When a security guard heard me discussing the rape of the other inmates, he started torturing me all over again. They tortured, raped me from behind. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  Even as authorities visited sexual violence on protesters, regime figures accused female protesters of prostitution, of quote, \"wanting to be naked.\" Of the incidents of sexual violence against protesters, inside Iranian detention facilities, most occurred in the Kurdish majority areas to the West of Iran, home to a historically oppressed minority. Disturbingly, in some cases, the rapes were filmed and used to blackmail protestors into silence. There has been a real escalation, where female protesters are, as you can see here, being openly assaulted, often sexually. But the violence against women, like the protests, are not confined to the Kurdish areas. They're often focused on locations where the protests are most intense, like here in the capital, Tehran.",

Even that piece that you saw, it took weeks,including having to travel and try and find those who were able to flee the Iranian regime into Iraqi Kurdistan. What the Iranian government has done more, from what information is leaking out is that, even as we sit here and now, they are escalating the crackdown, especially within those Kurdish majority areas to the west the country. While they're doing that, while they're increasing the militarization of the crackdown against the anti regime protests, they're also cracking down on the communication means that protesters and other anti regime voices have been using to be heard. So it continues to be very difficult. But what little of it is emerging, what little we are able to verify is, unfortunately, really scary. So many people say that they are going to continue to be brave, continue to go out on the streets. While at the same time, we are seeing just this relentless response from the regime. They seem to be really continuing to be at this clashing point with no sense of how either side is going to emerge with minimum casualties -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "This is a moment of pomp and pageantry. A moment of royal tradition and history as would be expected for King CharlesIII's first official state visit. This is hugely symbolic given the historic and complex history and relationship the United Kingdom shares with South Africa. We saw earlier this morning South African president Cyril Ramaphosa arriving alongside the Prince and Princess of Wales. Earlier in the day we'd seen them meeting in the morning, staging pleasantries about the weather and how he managed to escape the torrential rain we saw over the last few days. He was then welcomed by the king and queen consort. This has been a moment weeks in the making, several days of preparations. We've seen the South African flag being raised along the mall leading up to Buckingham Palace. We've seen rehearsals by the household cavalry. Even the palace's culinary team working on a very special and tailored menu for tonight's state banquet. So this is a hugely symbolic affair for the royal family. This isn't just about that pomp and pageantry; this isn't just for the relationship of the royal family but also there is a political element here. This is an opportunity for the British government to cement and reestablish its ties with South Africa. In particular, newly appointed minister Rishi Sunak to cement his own relationship with the South African president. Today, we are expecting to see the South African president addressing Parliament. This will be a significant moment. We will be waiting to see what he has to say there. He's currently visiting, touring around Westminster Abbey. But tomorrow, he will sit down for bilateral talks with Rishi Sunak. A big focus is set to be the economy. We've already heard from the prime minister, saying that he has ambitious plans to turbocharge infrastructure investment in South Africa as well as economic growth as well as trade between the two nations. This is a trade relationship that is worth around US$12 billion. This is a significant relationship. The U.K.'s biggest trading partner on the African continent. The economy and those economic ties between the two nations will be high on the agenda at tomorrow's financial meeting -- Becky.",
