We are following all of that.And breaking news. The House Ethics Committee has just released a report on former Congressman Matt Gaetz, something Gaetz never wanted the public to see. What we are learning about numerous allegations, including illicit drug use and sexual misconduct. And with record-breaking travel numbers this holiday, drivers are getting a little gift -- the cheapest gas prices in years. I'm Sara Sidner with Kate Bolduan and John Berman. John Berman is off today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. All right, we've got some breaking news to begin with. The House Ethics Committee found evidence that former Congressman Matt Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex or drugs on at least 20 occasions. CNN's Lauren fox is live in D.C. Lauren, this is according to a final draft of the panel's report that CNN has obtained. What more can you tell us about what is in this report?",

They say, quote, \"The committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Matt Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\"Now, this report, like you noted, alleges that former Representative Matt Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for either sex or drugs over the course of years, and on at least 20 different occasions. This report, which is obtained by CNN, also says that Gaetz paid a 17-year-old for sex in 2017. Now, Gaetz has not responded to CNN's outreach for comment since we have published this latest story, but I do want to point out a tweet that he sent last week. When CNN reported that this final report was going to be released after Congress took its final votes, he tweeted, quote, \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated, even some I never dated, but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. I never had sexual conduct with someone under 18. Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court, which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\" Gaetz has also repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. We should also note that Gaetz regularly points out that back in 2023, the Justice Department declined to press charges against him. Sara?",

The federal laws are very steeped on the domestic side about if you're not connected with a designated foreign terrorist organization, then are you using weapons of mass destruction and things like that.

There are a lot of people looking online saying, I could be that guy. I'm isolated, I'm alone, I'm ostracized.

And you've often heard him say he exaggerates the numbers, frankly, as to how much the US gives versus how much Europe, because Europe has together, European nations have come up to just about match where the US is in terms of how much aid goes in. But Trump will often fudge those numbers, as you've heard him do before.So one, he's saying less is going. He has said quite publicly he does not like Ukraine, using US supplied weapons to strike inside Russia, which the Biden administration gave them the, okay, to do, only recently. I'll tell you this when I talked to Republicans on the Hill, pro- Ukrainian Republicans and I asked them, is Trump going to abandon Ukraine? They don't know, right? They don't know for sure. They hope. And the argument they go to him with and his team with is that if he abandons Ukraine, he will be the guy who lost Ukraine, and they will even phrase it in this way that you don't want Ukraine to become your Afghanistan, because Trump looks at the US withdrawal from Afghanistan as a lot of Americans do as a weak point for US foreign policy, the US abandoning an ally. And in those terms, Republicans hope that Trump looks at Ukraine and says, you know, as much as I want that war to end, I don't want to be seen as getting a bad deal, right? Now, we don't know if that's going to move him, because you and I have heard him speak for the last four years about how that -- last three years close, about how that war has to end, you know, virtually at any cost.

Sorry, guys, the Holiday travel rush is in full swing, and it is shaping up to be a record breaking week, 119 million people expected to fly or drive out of town through January 1st.And those driving can expect an extra little gift, a Christmas gift, a Hanukkah gift. Analysts with GasBuddy say these are the lowest Christmas day gas prices since the 2020 COVID pandemic. Joining me now is Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. Hey, so with gas prices this low, I mean, that is a silver lining, but does it actually make a difference in the amount of travel on the roads for the holiday? PATRICK DE HAAN, SENIOR PETROLEUM ANALYST, GASBUDDY.COM: You know, not a whole lot. It's certainly great news for many Americans who are traveling, but it doesn't make a huge dent or increase in the amount of Americans traveling. Of course, a lot of folks have very traditional holiday plans, and regardless of gas prices, they're going to get to grandma's house. A few anecdotally, there is a small percentage of Americans that may stay closer to home, but still, millions of Americans hitting the road and 32 states now where you can find average gas prices below $3.00. In fact, some areas of the Deep South, you'll find average gas prices even below $2.50 a gallon.",

That was to top emergency responders only, and so many of us were staying far closer to home.So the fact that we are only $0.70 kind of above that milestone, as we are talking about record travel, is rather astounding, and it's taken us a long time to get here.
