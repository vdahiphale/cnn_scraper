If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with some of today's top stories.The Palestinian Health Ministry again accuses Israel of targeting people waiting for food aid in Gaza City. At least 20 people are reported killed and more than 150 others wounded. Israel's military calls reports about the attack false and says it is assessing the situation. Meanwhile, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate is criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and calling for new elections there. Chuck Schumer says many Israelis have lost confidence in the vision and direction of the government and new elections are the only way to allow for healthy and open decisions about the country's future. Plus, Russians are casting their ballots in a presidential election where the outcome is practically settled before it even began. President Vladimir Putin is considered a shoo-in to win with many opposition leaders either dead, jailed, exiled or banned from running. And as CNN's Brian Todd reports, Vladimir Putin's iron grip on power is part of a long pattern and shows no signs of slackening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He's already the longest serving ruler of Russia since the dictator Joseph Stalin and he could easily eclipse Stalin's nearly 30 years in power. Is there any intrigue over whether Vladimir Putin will manage to win yet another election?",

Now, despite those numbers, on Wednesday, the Florida governor's office announced more than 250 law enforcement officers and members of the national and state guard will be deployed to southern Florida in anticipation of more Haitian migrants arriving. As for the situation on the ground in Haiti, sources tell CNN that armed men attacked the home of Haiti's national police director. We're told that they ransacked and set fire to the place. It's unclear if anyone was hurt. Now, CNN has also learned that the country's airport could soon reopen. We're told repairs in areas that gang members broke through last month are almost complete and that 150 Haitian police and military officers are guarding the grounds. Now, exactly when air traffic could reopen is unclear. It is also unclear if outgoing Prime Minister Ariel Henry will return to the country after agreeing to resign on Tuesday. His office told CNN that Haiti's constitution states that only he and his cabinet can appoint a council for the transition of power. Carlos Suarez, CNN, Miami. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Passengers were jolted from their seats after what LATAM Airlines called a technical event. Fifty of those people needed medical attention.The journal reports that a flight attendant serving a meal might have hit a switch on the pilot seat that apparently pushed the pilot into the controls, forcing the plane into a nosedive. The journal quoted U.S. industry officials briefed on the preliminary evidence. The plane is back in Chile's capital, Santiago, for further investigation. Chilean aviation officials say a preliminary report into the incident will be issued within 30 days. With a rapidly growing population, Africa needs to increase its production of food. Many countries are turning to fish as an affordable food source. As of 2022, the continent caught 7 million metric tons of fish a year. To maintain today's levels, it will need to catch 13 million tons per year by 2030. Among the nations turning to fish production is Zambia.

Because this is the rocket that SpaceX hopes will someday land the very first humans on Mars, will someday be used to perhaps even colonize Mars. But first, NASA is hoping that SpaceX will be able to deliver on its contract to land the first NASA astronauts on the surface of the moon since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972. So there are some big hopes for this Starship rocket. What we saw was a successful stage separation of the Super Heavy booster and the Starship rocket spacecraft on top. It then flew for 49 minutes. And along the way it beamed back these incredible HD live images thanks to some Starlink terminals that were onboard Starship itself. And we were able to see on entry as it was approaching the splashdown site this incredible footage of Starship like hitting the atmosphere and creating the plasma, this red glow, around the spacecraft. I'd never seen anything like it. I don't think anybody had really ever seen anything like it. And then Starship broke up likely just above the Indian Ocean, falling short of its ultimate goal, which is a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. But I should note that the overall objective, the primary goal of this mission, was for Starship to reach orbital velocity or orbital speed. It did that and then some. This splashdown in the Indian Ocean was always kind of like a dream case scenario. In order to get your FAA license, you have to say what the ultimate target would be. And so that was really the case here for folks that say, you know, is this a success or a failure? You have SpaceX, of course, calling this a success, but so is NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. And so is Blue Origin, one of SpaceX's primary competitors, headed by fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos. So far more went right than went wrong on this third flight test, and now SpaceX says they have four more Starships ready to fly. They're hoping that the FAA can move quickly to work through this fairly routine mishap investigation and then grant it its next launch license. Kristin Fisher, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
