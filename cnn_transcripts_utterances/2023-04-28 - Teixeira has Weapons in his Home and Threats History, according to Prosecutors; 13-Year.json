Prosecutors say Jack Teixeira had an arsenal of weapons in his Massachusetts home, and a history of making violent threats. And it all came to light in a bail hearing on Thursday.CNN's Jason Carroll has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CAROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The detention hearing got underway with Jack Teixeira's father first taking the stand. He told the court he would not hesitate to report his son if he was released on bail in his custody and broke any rules the court imposed. The defense argued that 21-year old Air National Guardsmen is not a flight risk nor a security risk and that Teixeira did not intend for the classified information to go beyond the chat room where he had shared it. Judge Hennessy challenged that notion, someone under the age of 30 has no idea they put something on the internet that could end up anywhere in the world, seriously? He had no idea that would go beyond the little people on the server? That is like someone arguing, I pulled the trigger, but I had no intent to kill him. Prosecutors argue Teixeira could still have access to hundreds of documents, the defense filing asserts Teixeira no longer has access to those documents, saying prosecutors are exaggerating their client's threat. Court documents filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office, Wednesday, argued Teixeira should not be released on bail, claiming he poses a serious flight risk, riding, he could take refuge with a foreign adversary to avoid the reach of U.S. law. Prosecutors claim the information Teixeira allegedly accessed, far exceeds what has been disclosed on the internet. The filing also includes pictures from the search warrant executed on Teixeira's bedroom. The photos show a gun locker next to his bed containing multiple weapons, including an AK style high capacity weapon, handguns, shotgun rifles, and a gas mask. Prosecutors say law enforcement also found a smashed tablet, laptop, and a gaming console in a dumpster at the home. Prosecutors say that Teixeira also obstructed justice by telling those that he was communicating with online to delete all messages. And that if anyone comes looking, don't tell them expletive. Prosecutors also questioned why Teixeira was a candidate for the Air National Guard, given his history surrounding guns. The Pentagon is defending its procedures.",

All of those conversations, he directly would have had with Donald Trump, the President at the time, at a time when Donald Trump was pressuring him to overturn the vote. Pence refused to do so.Pence has also spoken about those conversations publicly, he's written about them in his book, then he has been on a tour about, now he is talking about them really regularly. But never before has an investigation, has a grand jury and have prosecutors gotten Pence under oath to reveal exactly what he thought, what he felt, and what was said to between him and Donald Trump on those crucial days as part of this investigation. So this is a really significant moment in the January 6th criminal investigation being led by Special Counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department, it is also quite a momentous moment in history. There has never before been a vice-president called to testify in a subpoena about the President that he served alongside, and that did not happen in Watergate with Richard Nixon, it did not happen with Whitewater with Bill Clinton, which both had very active grand jurors. So this is different. It also is a very crucial moment putting Mike Pence here, because the Justice Department had to fight for this testimony. They went to court over this, Donald Trump tried to block the testimony, he tried to limit what Pence could say about the direct conversations, lost those court battles. Mike Pence also went to court to fight on this and did not want to testify under subpoena, but he did get a little bit of leeway from the court being able to protect what he was doing when he was the presiding officer on January 6th. But today, that federal grand jury did hear from Mike Pence for more than five hours, one-on-one, the grand jurors would have been able to ask him questions, they would've been able to piece him into the investigation. A very active investigation that they have heard from many, many witnesses on. And now the prosecutors will take that to testimony and see how it fits, tried and feet it into potential charges as they look towards the future. It will become, at least part of the record of what will now be known about January 6th to the Justice Department and potentially to the public later on. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

And you know, Donald Trump is taking up a lot of space. I mean -- you know Kim, the coalition that is supporting him in polls at this point looks an awful like -- lot like the coalition that he mobilized to win the nomination in 2016. I mean, he is winning about half of Republicans without a college degree, is winning a quarter and a third of the Republicans with a degree but that is essentially what he managed last time. You see Ron DeSantis fading, but still a very strong second place. And between the two of them, they are carving out about three quarters or more of the Republican primary vote. I think all of the Republican candidates face the same challenge. I mean, the evidence is very clear that most Republican voters do not view all of this as disqualifying, even though there are plenty of general election swing voters who are recoiling from the cumulative wait as we are discussing all these legal matters. And none of the other Republican candidates including Pence have been willing to make an explicit race to Republican voters about why they should not renominate Donald Trump. I think the evidence of the last six months is that strategy is not going to work. If they want to dislodge him they are going to have to give Republican voters a more explicit reason to do so. All of this is giving them plenty of ammunition, if nothing else, on that kind of expediency argument that he can't win, it will be difficult to him to win a general election, but so far they've been tiptoeing around it, and I think very clearly, Mike Pence or anyone else, they're going to have to tell Republican voters why they should not renominate Donald Trump.",

But there were other missiles that landed in Ukraine, though whether they hit their target is a completely different question. Because it is hard to understand what possible military value there would have been in some of the residential areas that we know were hit.There was, according to the local Mayor of Dnipro in the eastern part of the country, there were high precision strikes in his words overnight that resulted in the death of the three-year-old child and another young woman. There was also a missile strike that hit at least two-floors of an apartment building in the town of Ukrainka, which is essentially a suburb of Kyiv there, where a 13-year old was injured. We do not have any more information on who may have killed in that strike. But the most dramatic pictures that we are seeing thus far come from the city of Uman. It is about 125 miles south of the capital Kyiv, and it is nowhere near the front lines. So what we know from authorities there is that two missiles came down in the city, hitting a warehouse and damaging several apartment buildings and one in particular. Authorities there say that there are now seven people have been killed. There are more injured. And the death toll is very likely to rise because there are people who have been hospitalized, one in particular who is in quite poor condition. And we know from watching the live pictures that have been coming in throughout the morning, that there are still very much an active rescue operation taking place on the site there. And although there have been people rescued in the early hours following this missile strike, it is difficult to imagine anyone impossibly able to be pulled out at this point given what the scene looks like. It is essentially a smoking pile of rubble and you can see from those pictures, it looks as if the missile dropped essentially straight down out of the sky and destroyed every single floor on the way down. President Zelenskyy put out a statement in reaction to this, saying in part, that this Russian terror must face a response from Ukraine, and the world and it will. One other note to point out, Kim, and that is that the Ukrainian Air Force just released a photograph of its new Patriot air defense system, the second one that they say is now in operation across the country, but of course, as we know from these strikes the system is still far from perfect, far from foolproof here, Kim.",
