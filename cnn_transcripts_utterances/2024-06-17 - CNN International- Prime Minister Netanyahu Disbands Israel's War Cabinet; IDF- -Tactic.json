This is CNN Newsroom.Just ahead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disbands his war cabinet, as questions swirl around the tactical pause in the fighting in Gaza. We will have a full report. Plus, Ukraine in focus, U.S. President Biden has welcomed the head of NATO to the White House. Can all the diplomatic efforts help Kyiv win back momentum? And massive fires scorch California, while the northeastern U.S. braces for historic heatwave. We are live on the ground and in the CNN Weather Center this hour. And we begin with some new developments in the war in Gaza. An Israeli official says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has disbanded the war cabinet, which was responsible for key decisions relating to the Israel-Hamas war. It was formed in the days after the October 7 Hamas attacks. The decision comes after opposition leader Benny Gantz withdrew from the body last week. Meanwhile, Israel's military announced a daily tactical pause along a specific route and specific times to allow for humanitarian aid into Gaza. The IDF later clarified that it's still -- its troops are still fighting in Rafah and parts of Gaza. CNN's Paula Hancocks is joining us now from southern Israel. Paula, let's start with Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to disband his war cabinet. What's behind that decision?",

Now, of course, since Gantz has resigned, saying he is in protest of the fact there is no plan to get the hostages out, no day-after plan for Gaza and not a plan to get people back to northern Israel as well, who've been evacuated, it is now effectively a two-person war cabinet.So, what he has done is he has disbanded that and he has said, according to an official in his office, that the decisions, when it comes to the war in Gaza, will be made on a security cabinet basis, which is a wider cabinet basis, also saying that -- so, experts are saying that this kind of avoids the pressure that was coming from the far right of his coalition. Some of those far-right elements wanted to be part of the war cabinet. So, by disbanding it, potentially he has got rid of that problem as well. He doesn't have to accept or reject them because he does have a balancing act when it comes to his coalition at this point. But, they do say, and within the Prime Minister's Office, this won't make a difference to actually making the decisions on the war in Gaza, and if they have to, they will have smaller groups to decide tactical changes.

Thank you, Paula.Meanwhile, a U.S. Special Envoy arrives in Israel Monday, as tensions escalate on Israel's northern border with Lebanon. CNN's Ben Wedeman is joining us now live from Beirut. Ben, U.S. officials are warning that there is a very real danger of miscalculation escalating the conflict along the Israel and Lebanon's border. What have you learned? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we've been seeing is that certainly in the last few weeks things on the border have gotten much hotter in terms of the daily back and forth between Hezbollah and Israel, although I must add that it's currently a Muslim holiday and yesterday on the -- at least from Hezbollah's side, they didn't fire anything at the Israelis as far as we can tell. But, this envoy, Amos Hochstein, who is the Senior Energy Advisor at the White House, and he is really the point man in dealing with the sort of the Lebanon-Israel file for the United States, he is in Israel now. We assume, although it has not been officially announced, that he is going to be coming to Beirut in the coming days. Nonetheless, what is obvious, certainly from statements made by senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the signs we're getting from Hezbollah, is that both sides are primed for escalation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Every day, the message goes out from south Lebanon in slick propaganda videos accompanied by a stirring soundtrack. Hezbollah is ready to go from daily skirmishes to full- scale war with Israel. Mired in what appears to be an unwinnable war in Gaza, Israel has vowed to turn its military might on Hezbollah. Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border, saying, we are prepared for very strong action in the north. But, the Iranian-backed group is by far the most formidable battle-hardened foe Israel has faced on its borders since the 1973 October war. After its guerrillas forced Israel to pull out of south Lebanon 24 years ago, in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill, although the war left parts of Beirut and much of southern Lebanon in ruins. Retired Lebanese Army Brigadier General Elias Hanna knows the militant group well. GENERAL ELIAS HANNA, LEBANESE ARMY (RET.): Hezbollah is an exclusive club, well-disciplined monitor, and they have, which is the most important issue, a charismatic leader, Syed Hassan Nasrallah. WEDEMAN (voice-over): Since October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters, including last week high-ranking commander Taleb Abdallah, given a hero's farewell in Beirut. At the funeral, senior Hezbollah leader Hashem Safieddine warned, we will increase our operations in intensity and force, in quantity and quality. Analysts believe Iran has provided Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated long-range missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv and beyond. Until now, Hezbollah has mostly limited its strikes to military targets along the rugged mountainous frontier, hitting Israel's extensive network of surveillance posts. It also says it is taken out an Iron Dome battery, the backbone of Israel's missile defenses, and has used ground-to-air missiles to shoot down three top of the line Hermes 900 drones, in the process, forcing tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes in the north. Hezbollah is learning faster than Israel can adapt, says Hanna.",

But, Prime Minister Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the public in Israel to allow those people who fled the north to go back home. So, they're really in a bind.Now, the one solution and what has been seen before is that in late November of last year, when there was an eight-day halt in the fighting in Gaza and there was a release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, the border along between Lebanon and Israel was quiet. Hezbollah has made it clear, if the fighting stops in Gaza, the border will be quiet. So, probably a ceasefire is the best solution all around. Amara.",

Joe Biden and Jens Stoltenberg are expected to sit down together in Washington in a few hours from now, and it comes on the heels of a summit in Switzerland dedicated to finding a formula for peace in Ukraine. The talks wrapped up on Sunday, but not everyone agreed to the final statement. Some of the major holdouts were India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the UAE. All of them have close relationships, trading relationships, I should say, with Russia. CNN's Arlette Saenz is standing by at the White House.

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, President Biden will meet with the NATO chief Stoltenberg here at the White House, in the Oval Office, a bit later this afternoon, and it comes at a time when both the U.S. and its allies are essentially trying to safeguard aid for Ukraine, as the prospect of a second Trump presidency looms. You spoke about that peace summit in Switzerland over the weekend. Vice President Kamala Harris was there, reiterating that the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine in its war against Russia, while also trying to find ways to impose further costs on Russia.And President Biden just last week huddled with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the G7. The two men signed this 10-year security agreement where the U.S. would continue to provide training to Ukrainian soldiers as well as work on the production of military equipment and other types of weaponry. And it all comes as the Biden administration is really trying to cement this aid for Ukraine further into the future. But, key officials acknowledge, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, that this plan isn't exactly Trump proof. This is just an executive agreement. There is the possibility that Trump could scrap this proposal, this 10-year security agreement when he -- if he comes into office. But, Sullivan said that the administration is doing their darndest to try to ensure that they can get this aid to Ukraine in the long run. Now, there is great concern among President Biden's advisors but also some U.S. allies as well as Ukraine about the fact that Trump really has not said if he would further continue to support Ukraine down the road. He has simply said that he would find a resolution to this conflict very quickly. He has said -- he has really expressed skepticism about providing additional aid to Ukraine down the road. And Trump has also issued warnings about what he would do with NATO if he is reelected. Back in the winter, Trump had said that he would encourage Russia to do whatever the hell it wants to countries who are not meeting NATO obligations. So, that has caused some consternation among typical allies of the United States as they are watching this potential of a second Trump presidency and whether that will actually come to fruition in November. So, what Biden is hoping to do today in this meeting with Stoltenberg is further trying to shore up that support for Ukraine as its war against Russia continues. I will also note that the NATO summit is expected to happen here in Washington, D.C. in just a few weeks. So, that will be another opportunity for these allies to have a show of solidarity for Ukraine, as they are trying to push back on Putin's aggression in that country.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Amara. So, the biggest problem right now that firefighters are having is the wind. The National Weather Service forecasted wind gusts between 60 and 70 miles an hour overnight, and really, that's what's making it tough for firefighters. It's hard to even stand here right now. It's unclear exactly how much we're getting in terms of wind gusts and how fast the wind is going. But, that is what carries a lot of these embers. You see the hotspots here behind me. The fire already came through this area, but you still have some of those hotspots. And then, when you add the wind, that just carries it, and sometimes carries it across streets or across highways.And so, firefighters right now are doing everything they can to create that fire line to contain that fire. They're using crews on the ground and in the air. But, again, they're just struggled because of the wind. Yesterday, we were here all day, and we saw these crews using a number of aircraft, just going around and around, bringing water from a nearby lake to try to avoid the flames from spreading. But, we were at two percent containment yesterday. We're still at two percent right now, and we're only seeing the acreage increasing. So, unfortunately not a lot of progress here, and still a lot of work to be done. About 1,200 people are under evacuation orders and others are under evacuation warnings, because officials here saying you may have to leave at a moment's notice. So, they are telling people to be ready, to be prepared, because again, this wind can cause the flames to spread extremely fast, and that's when you may have to leave at a moment's notice. So, we will see more work from these firefighters around the clock today, but we are expecting a Red Flag Warning through the day and higher temperatures as time goes by as well. So, it's the high temperatures, the low humidity and then you add the winds, that's what's making it extremely difficult for these firefighters, Amara.",

Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said that during the altercation, someone produced the gun and began to fire, adding that police and fire rescue crews, who already were on the scene, immediately responded and began to render aid to the victims. 14 people were injured, including six who were transported to nearby hospitals.
