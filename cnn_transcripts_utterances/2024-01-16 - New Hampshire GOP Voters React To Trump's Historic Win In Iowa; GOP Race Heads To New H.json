That arctic air still sitting in place across much of the central U.S. We've got this cold front sliding its way through. That's bringing rain, snow, and even a little bit of a wintry mix.And it's all because of these temperatures. We have snow in places you wouldn't normally see it only because these temperatures are so cold across much of the country. Twenty percent of the lower 48 population looking at temperatures below zero. Eighty percent of that population looking at temperatures below freezing. And for some, it's still going to linger for several more days. Right now, yes, it is snowing in New York. That snow headed up through Boston and areas of Providence, Rhode Island as well. Rain on the southern side there, and even a little bit of an icy mix for some southern states, too. That's why you've got these winter weather advisories that run from Louisiana all the way up through Maine. Again, when we zoom in a little bit closer -- yes, you can see the snow coming down -- Hartford, areas of New York, up through Boston. Even areas of Upstate New York and Pennsylvania also looking at some pretty heavy snow at this time. Now, this system is going to continue to make its way off to the northeast and then eventually out to sea once we get later on tonight, so this is going to be a very quick burst that comes through. But yes, take a look at New York. So far, we're up to 701 days. That is likely to end today for the streak of not having at least an inch of snow there -- expected to get it. Right now, we are starting to see it come down but other cities have already broken it, including Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., which did finally end up getting at least an inch in the last 24 hours.",
