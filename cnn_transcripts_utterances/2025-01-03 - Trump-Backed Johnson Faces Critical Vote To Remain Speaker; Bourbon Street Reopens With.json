The congressman -- the speaker hoping to avoid an ugly, drawn-out floor fight today when his colleagues vote for who they want to lead Congress' lower chamber in the next Congress this afternoon. Repeated votes against Johnson could delay the certification of Donald Trump's presidential victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I think it's going to be OK, Larry. We'll have maybe one no vote, I think. I think we get it done on the first round. I'm certainly hopeful for that because as we noted we've got to stick together. We'll be operating with the smallest margin in U.S. history for much of the first 100 days of the Congress and perhaps longer into the year. So it necessitates that every single Republican, as diverse as our caucus is, can put aside their personal preferences every day and work together for the team. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But there is still roughly a dozen Republican members of Congress in the House who have not yet said how they stand on Johnson. Now, folks were shuffling in and out of his office yesterday having conversations, but this roughly dozen group really holds the fate of Johnson. If they decide to support him today then all is well for him, but if they decide to vote against him that could be a problem for the speaker. And I also reported yesterday that there were some demands that were being made among those hardline conservatives, asking for commitments on different spending issues and different process issues for how the House works. But also, folks are saying that Johnson is in -- has no intention of cutting any deals with some of these holdouts. We'll remember what happened with Kevin McCarthy. He cut a number of deals when he was first trying to win that speakership back in 2023. A lot of those promises he made ultimately led to his demise. Johnson very keen on not repeating those mistakes. So we'll figure out what's going on here in just a few hours.

You can't protect against everything, but you have to protect against those things that are foreseeable.It's important for people to recognize that Bourbon Street is an entertainment district that is part of the French Quarter, which is the original New Orleans. It goes back to 1718. So the significance of Bourbon Street is it's a cultural center and it's an entertainment center. But it is also a historic district with so much of the history of colonial Louisiana, indigenous Louisiana, the growth of jazz, the growth of the culture of New Orleans, the growth of civil rights in New Orleans. Bourbon Street represents certainly an entertainment district, but it represents so much more. So it's important not only for the city but for the nation to recognize that getting Bourbon Street back open quickly sends a signal to those that would attack us that we will not be deterred. And I think that is what is so important. Now, lots of work to go forward. But Kasie, the attack in New Orleans could happen anywhere. This is what's important. A message to mayors and police superintendents and communities across the nation. Evaluate security systems around any place where crowds gather for entertainment purposes, for sporting events, for cultural events. This is important because we haven't had this type of terrorist attack in some time in New Orleans, but it's happened abroad. It's happened in Israel. It's happened in Europe. We've seen it in a number of other places. So this is a time to be diligent and vigilant.",

He's a highly decorated combat veteran with five bronze star medals. The suspect in the New Orleans attack was also an Army veteran. Both men were stationed at Fort Liberty, formerly known as Fort Bragg, but there's not record that they were in the same unit or served during the same years. They also both served in Afghanistan in 2009. But according to Las Vegas law enforcement they weren't in the same province or the same unit. Joining us now is U.S. Army veteran and former senior adviser to the Defense secretary Bishop Garrison. Sir, thanks very much for being with us this morning. I'd like to just start -- we do want to underscore repeatedly that right now law enforcement is saying these things are not connected. But I'm interested to know what you think about the similarities here and what it tells you about radicalization in our country right now. BISHOP GARRISON, U.S. ARMY VETERAN, SR. FELLOW AND ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTE, GEORGE MASON LAW SCHOOL, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN (via Webex by Cisco):  All right. Well, thank you for having me. First and foremost, my condolences go out and my heart goes out to both of the communities. I know how hard it is -- what they're dealing with and what they're trying to maneuver through. It's really terrible in this type of situation in which you have so many people living in fear and they're living in terror because we just simply don't have more information than what's been provided at this time. I will say that look, we're talking about Camp Liberty. You have something of a magnitude of 50,000 active duty soldiers that serve at that base every year. You're talking somewhere in the neighborhood of almost 300,000 people within the population of those bases. So we can't just immediately start drawing lines and saying well, there is some -- there is some connections here because they're related in this regard. All of this is really just (INAUDIBLE) and it's given the size and scope of the population. What we really need to be discussing and saying is that law enforcement needs to go deeply into this so we can better understand some of the motivations for both individuals. With the special forces master sergeant, special forces are used extensively right now ever since the beginning of the global war on terrorism. We're stressing them to their absolute limits. And there seems to be more information that's slowly coming out about his life and about some of his operations and it's tragic. It seems as though he was going through a lot. There may have -- there may have been additional stressors, and we need to just get more information and data and understand that. And lastly, more than anything, it demonstrates a need to really be out there supporting our veterans. Whenever they transition from active duty, particularly, into the civilian world they can be susceptible to some of these types of groups that are looking to give them structure, a sense of community, a sense of home that they really enjoyed while they were in the military. So everything we can do to support this veteran community is going to be very important, and service members as well.",

But he also could have done a lot more damage. So we just don't know what his motivations are.We need for law enforcement officials to continue to be allowed to investigate. And most importantly, I think we don't need individuals online on the internet trying to do their own internet sleuthing. And all of that is going to create more misinformation, disinformation, and it further erodes the trust between the civilian population and a military in which approximately one percent of the population serves. And at a critical time in which a lot of these veterans -- a lot of these service members need more benefits. They need the ability to go into these communities where they can trust that they can get help without being ostracized and without have any type of negative impacts on their --",
