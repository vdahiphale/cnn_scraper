We just heard from the company that owns the support ship, which took the Titan out for this dive, but then lost communication with the five- member crew an hour and 45 minutes into the journey. Those underwater noises, by the way, detected by sonar, some Coast Guard crew describing them as banging noises, but they still cannot guarantee that they are from the missing vessel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD: We need to have hope, right? But I don't - I can't tell you what the noises are. But what I can tell you is - and I think this is the most important point - we're searching where the noises are and that's all we can do at this point. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

When asked about that, what happens when the clock runs out so to speak, I mean - and the Coast Guard making it very clear, this is a search and rescue operation and that's how we basically answered the question to that.But there was a lot of - there were a lot of questions specifically about the noises that have been heard, especially what we heard about yesterday, that Canadian aircraft dropping that sonar buoy and picking up banging noises, if you will. Those same banging noises, it was revealed this afternoon, were also picked up again this morning also by sonar buoys. And so then that raises the questions, what more can you tell us about these particular sounds. And so that's what I asked the captain there. And he said, \"I just don't know what they are at this point.\" And so then you have to ask yourself, so what are they doing about the sounds. Well, they've sent in additional resources into the area where the sounds were detected. And what they've done is they've taken that acoustical information, they've sent it to the U.S. Navy for analysis so they can go over it and try to determine: is it human sound, is it someone knocking, trying to indicate that they are alive or is it some other sound from the ocean, is it from the wreckage settling near the Titanic or some other noise. This is what the experts have to determine, which is why the U.S. Coast Guard is offering caution at this point. But as you - but you also heard offering hope, because that was also a question, what would you say then to the family members who are waiting to hear some sort of word and the word is they are going to continue to send as many resources into the area, continue to offer hope.

Good to have you on, sir. I wonder if you could help us understand the significance as we know it of the noises that have been heard so far. Because if you listen to that Coast Guard press conference earlier today, they say in so many words, they don't truly know what the noises are. They have hope. They had been described by some as banging although the Coast Guard Captain wasn't certain that's what it was, wasn't certain also the timeframe as described, was it every 30 minutes or some other indeterminate timeframe. Based on what you've heard, do you believe they have a reliable potential contact with the missing submarine? CAPT. RAYMOND SCOTT \"CHIP\" MCCORD, U.S. NAVY (RET.): Jim, I think I would agree with the Coast Guard captain that says that they don't exactly know what they have. So I guess I would leave it at that. They're all out there looking at it and we could put some conjecture into it. But if they knew for sure that it was someone banging on a haul with an SOS, they would have told us.

Again, there's very few things that can go down there to get them and it's a very time consuming to get all the equipment on site, put it on board a ship, secure it to the ship basically weld that down so that when you go out to sea these things don't fall around.

You have to get that 12,000 feet of cable to the bottom, then you have to get it on a reel to get it up to the top. How do we do that? There are so many unknowns here.Really, I think what's happened - the best thing that has happened over the past 96 hours really is that the weather hasn't been too bad. Three to six foot swells, I'm not talking about these sharp waves that you see on lakes. These are the ocean swells. And even though there are a couple of clouds out there right now, there's no real change in wind direction. There's no big frontal system, there is no big low pressure system there. We know the temperatures in the zone near this red square somewhere between 55 and 60 degrees. The closer you get to down here into the warmer temperatures, the brighter colors, that's where the warmer water is. Now the difference is when you get a little bit farther down than that, things change dramatically. Things change when it comes to temperatures from the top all the way down at the bottom. Something else that goes on when we get to this thing called the thermocline. I know you've heard it probably over and over and over today. Speed of the sound changes due to the temperature of the water and also the density of the water. So those sounds that they hear can actually be refracted. If a sound is made in the thermocline, it can go for hundreds, if not thousands of miles. They think that's how the whales connect, how they talk to each other or how they sing to each other. And then you get farther down to the bottom and all of a sudden another problem is that the temperature of the water is 39 degrees. So you're above freezing, yes, but you're in a fairly non insulated capsule, you're in a non heated capsule. I know people are trying to take all the ingredients and put them all into one. But even if we do get all the way down here and the time is running out, they need to really, really ramp this up and find it like now.",
