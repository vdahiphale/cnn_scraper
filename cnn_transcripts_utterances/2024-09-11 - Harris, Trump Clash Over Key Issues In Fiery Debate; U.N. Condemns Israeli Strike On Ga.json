(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people. So let's be clear about that, and clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that. I have traveled the world as vice president of United States and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you, and they say you're a disgrace. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Let me just say about world leaders, Victor Orban, one of the most respected men. They call him a strong man. He's a tough person, smart, Prime Minister of Hungary. They said, why is the whole world blowing up? Three years ago it wasn't. Why is it blowing up? He said, because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid. And I don't like to use the word afraid, but I'm just quoting him. China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him. He said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's a wide swath of voters that historically this late in the race, felt that they were undecided or did not know who she was.She had to introduce herself. She had to be presidential. She had to be reasonable. She had to be aggressive, appropriately aggressive. She also had to be defensive. She had to do all of this stuff while also being a very non-traditional candidate in the eyes of American voters, and she did it masterfully. It was just a remarkable political performance. Now, she was also aided and assisted by her opponent. I mean, Donald Trump did a very good job of continually lowering the bar, but I don't want to take anything away from the vice president. She did a really good job, and he did come off, as I mentioned, there's a Trump fatigue that is setting in with the voters on especially independent voters, where she did remarkably well tonight. And I think that we're going to see this reflected in the polls. And we're getting so late in the cycle now that a lot of this opinion is being, you know, dried into cement now, and the few undecided, few swing voters that exist, I think, are probably going to be breaking decidedly towards Kamala Harris after tonight.",

But as we proved with the Lincoln Project in 2020, Donald Trump is not capable of not taking the baits. And the key is, not only can you set the trap for him, but can you execute it when he when he does start going down that road. And she did it in so many ways. Again, she used the terms old and dated six times. She really got it when she started talking about his rallies like that's the most important thing to him, not foreign policy, not domestic policy, it's the size of the rallies that he's got, and there's just so many things. When you speak to his ego, it is so fragile that he's not able to respond normally. And I think people are the more they're reminded of why they rejected him in 2020 the more we're going to start seeing that vote solidifying in the opposite direction. So as masterful, again, as Kamala Harris's performance was she was absolutely aided by the fact that Donald Trump, his normal mental decline has been accelerated clearly by age. She alluded to that more than subtly. She also provided a very passionate defense about the issues that she believes in. And I think we're going to see a historic gender gap this election cycle that will all come down to which base is the most motivated, where her base is by double digits, polling far more enthusiastic about their candidate. And I think that this debate probably widened that gap even more.",

Why haven't you done any of these things? But those were completely eclipsed by her success at basically allowing Trump to be Trump and baiting Trump into being Trump, and behaving in a way that was both kind of strange and conspiratorial and angry and diminishing and, you know at the end when she kind of upbraided him for his history of racially inflammatory actions and, you know, at times open racism and argued, do we have to live this way.

And we are a closely divided nation in terms of our partisan balance. All of that argues against Harris being able to decisively pull away for two months. But in terms of what she had to do tonight of establishing a personal contrast of her as a younger, energetic, stable, sane, you know, kind of leader, and Trump is really the opposite on all of those counts.

And by contrast, Kamala Harris made just one false claim and some misleading ones.Here's the breakdown from CNN's Daniel Dale. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANIEL DALE, CNN REPORTER: I think a lot of Americans say, well, all politicians lie. No major presidential candidate before Donald Trump has ever lied with this kind of frequency. A remarkably large chunk of what he said tonight was just not true. And this wasn't like little exaggeration, political spin. A lot of his false claims were untethered to reality. On abortion, saying every Democrat wanted Roe v. Wade overturned though actually more than 80 percent of Democrats supported Roe. On crime, saying it's through the roof, though it's actually sharply down since early 2023. It's now lower than it was since Trump left office. On health care saying he's the one who saved Obamacare, the law he actually repeatedly tried to overturn. On Kamala Harris herself, saying that a Howard University grad black law student association president had claimed that she wasn't black at one point. Frankly I don't have enough time here to run through each specific Trump false claim. I urge people to go to our CNN Web site or our app to read our teams detailed fact checks on this and a whole bunch more. For now, though, let's dive into one false claim Trump made.

The city of Springfield and the Springfield police say there are no credible reports of this happening. And even J.D. Vance, the vice-presidential candidate who himself had promoted these claims, acknowledged this morning that the, quote, \"rumors might turn out false\", although he still encouraged people to spread these cat memes. Now I note that Trump himself added dogs to the equation. They had not even been part of these viral nonsense rumors before.
