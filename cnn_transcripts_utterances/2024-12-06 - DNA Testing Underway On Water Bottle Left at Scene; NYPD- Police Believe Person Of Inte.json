Again, it would be the first time we're hearing from New York police top brass sort of since their initial press conference in the aftermath of this. But then as far as what we do know outside of that so far, we know the medical examiner's office has now begun testing or at least has - is testing possible DNA evidence in the killing of this UnitedHealthcare CEO.And that evidence would come from a water bottle found at the scene that investigators believe this shooter may have sipped from leading up to this. Also, a cell phone was found at the scene as well. They're also looking for potential touch DNA that they could pull from it on top of that. So that's the DNA aspect of it. But another thing that we're learning as well, of course, is around the path to New York City for this shooter. Now, we know he arrived 10 days before the shooting, as a law enforcement source tells CNN. But another aspect of it is that we believe he arrived by bus, a bus route that originated in Atlanta. And that's where the bus originated. It's unclear where exactly the suspect may have boarded the bus. But interestingly, we are hearing from the Atlanta Police Department that said that they heard from the NYPD in the afternoon of December 6th today and that they are now assisting with whatever the New York Police Department might need. You see some of the timeline there. When this person arrived in New York, they checked into a hostel in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, stayed for a few days, checked out, came back and then stayed for the few days leading up to the actual shooting. And that all goes into the question of who this person was - is and what they might be doing. You see this picture here as well. The New York Police Department put this out as a person of interest they want for questioning. This was taken at the same hostel, though, where they believe the suspect was staying over the course of this. And you see the mask down, smiling right there. Law enforcement believe based on interviews they've done, that was a moment where this person was literally flirting with the clerk at the front desk there and that was why that mask was down. It could end up being one of the more significant clues in this case, Brianna.",

I mean, look, obviously there is no justification for this kind of violence, but I do think what we're seeing on social media is the sort of bubbling up of a lot of the pent-up anger and frustration and distrust that Americans feel towards the health insurance industry.Another example of this that I found really striking is this Facebook post from UnitedHealth expressing sadness over Thompson's death. It got tens of thousands of reactions from Facebook users, and the majority of those were laughing face emojis. We're also seeing a lot of these stories of people talking about claims that were denied, and experts say that is a big source of the frustration that many people feel over this industry. In one study, a majority of Americans, insured Americans, 58 percent say they've experienced a problem with their health insurance, including denied claims and pre-authorization request issues. And of those, 15 percent of those people say they actually experienced health impacts because of the denials. Those denials can cause anxiety. They can delay treatment. Another thing that I think is really interesting is that UnitedHealthcare in particular has faced scrutiny over its use of artificial intelligence, allegedly to deny claims. There was a lawsuit filed last year that claimed the company has used AI to deny claims from elderly patients, and UnitedHealthcare is seeking to dismiss that lawsuit. But I think what we're seeing broadly on social media is people expressing frustration over the sort of power that they feel this industry has in comparison to the individual patients that it's serving, Brianna.",

That's really been their bar so far for saying that they are still optimistic.And part of the reason Trump issued that Truth Social, one is to kind of put to bed any anxiety that people think he is having over Hegseth. But also Donald Trump has been, and I'm told this from a number of people at Mar-a-Lago, giving his team the directive to go out there and post in support of Hegseth, to publicly back him and show that they are not moving away from him. Now, we also heard the VP-elect JD Vance issue a statement of support for him as well, telling reporters this in North Carolina. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

Do you read this as, yes, there may be a chance that he could actually be defense secretary? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Not if the United States Senate does its Article I job and actually vets him thoroughly. Because if they do that, even Senate Republicans are going to have to see that he can't do any of the three core jobs of secretary of defense: One, be a manager; two, be a leader; three, be a foreign policymaker. I mean, he was a manager of two small non-profits, ran them into the ground. He has failed to meet the officer and a gentleman standards that the uniform code of military justice asks of military leaders. And he has zero foreign policy experience, so how do we trust him on the phone with the Israeli defense minister or the Ukrainian defense minister or the Taiwanese defense minister when snap judgment calls are the potential between war and peace.

I've voted against every defense budget since I've been in Congress, not because I don't want a stronger military, I do. It's because I'm so frustrated with how badly the Pentagon procures things. Instead of buying these expensive, exquisite weapons systems that only monopolistic vendors can provide, we've got to start building modular, commercial scale and autonomous systems that we can wage against China in the Indo-Pacific, things that are built by companies like Anduril or Hadrian or others.

And the jury has now just said for the second time to Judge Wiley, we cannot get to an agreement on the first count.Now, the reason that is important is because this jury cannot even begin to consider the second count until they get through the first. The first is the most serious of the two charges, manslaughter in the second degree. [15:15:03] Now, early in the day today, they said that they were deadlocked and Judge Wiley instructed them to go back into the deliberation room and keep at it. Keep doing the job that you're here to do. Try to get to a verdict. Try to get to an agreement. Review the evidence and try to get there was what he told them. They came back. They asked for a definition, a legal definition of what it means to be a reasonable person. So they're going through the details. But now, once again, a little bit after returning from lunch today, they're telling Judge Wiley they cannot get to an agreement. This is now the second time this jury is hung on this top charge. Now, before they were sent back to deliberate, while the parties were talking about what to do without the jury being in the room, there was a discussion about whether or not the prosecution in this case would consider agreeing to dismiss the top charge if the jury remained hung on it so that they could be allowed to move on to the second charge. The prosecution said that they were open to that. And right now the parties are conferring. They have not reached a decision yet. But there is a possibility where the prosecution here, led up by Alvin Bragg, the district attorney here in Manhattan, might say, we'll let the first charge go. But we got to move on to the second one. Now, you have to wonder how that may play for this jury. It's unclear, right? They could say, okay, good, we can now move on. But they could also say, well, if the top charge is something you're willing to let go, what does it mean for the second charge? So it's just a really intense moment of trying to figure out where this jury is at, trying to imagine what they're thinking. But at least for now, we can tell that they're really making an effort to understand what the law requires them to do and trying to get to a place of agreement. We don't know. There might be one person, two people in there who are just not in agreement with the rest and they're trying to work through that. It is Friday, Brianna. The weekend is around the corner. Perhaps they don't want to be back here on Monday. But on the other hand, they know that they have someone's life in their hands and it looks like they are taking that very seriously, as they should. In the meantime, throughout all of this, the defense has moved for a mistrial multiple times at this point, saying that this should not be such a complicated case, according to them. The judge has disagreed, telling them that it's not time to declare a mistrial just yet. Brianna?",

So the jury now deadlocking a second time on the manslaughter charge. And right before that, really interesting. The jury had asked for a clarification on one of the instructions relating to justification, relating to the self-defense argument. They asked the judge for clarification on what the standard is as far as justified self-defense. It's called the reasonable person standard and the judge read that to the jury. That is very relevant because it seems like now that we have a second deadlock, the jury is likely grappling with some individuals who believe that Daniel Penny's actions were justified versus other individuals who do not. And in that case, if justification is the linchpin here, that's what's keeping the jury from agreeing. The second charge, criminally negligent homicide, the same will happen because that is the same element to both of the charges, manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.
