And we're watching several crucial battlegrounds. CNN is going to bring you this projection right now. CNN projects that Texas will go to Donald Trump. The State of Texas, as expected, to Donald Trump, with its big bucket of 40 electoral votes. CNN also projects that North Dakota will go to Donald Trump, as expected.

South Dakota, as expected, with its three electoral votes, to Donald Trump. And CNN projects that Wyoming will go to Donald Trump. Wyoming with its three electoral votes. CNN is not making any projections in the following states that just closed their polls. Arizona, that's a big battleground. Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, battleground Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York and battleground Wisconsin. Let's look at the electoral map now.

A lot of votes there. Lot of votes in Raleigh, Durham, the Research Triangle again. And so you see that happening right there. And let's see. We go back here and come back up to Virginia, and we see 49.4, and 48 percent there. Again, pretty remarkable. 17,000 votes. Again, we got a long way to go. 45 percent of the votes still to be counted. But Joe Biden won it by 10 points. So if you're the -- in the Vice President's camp, you're a little nervous about that.",

Kamala Harris, as expected, will win Illinois and its 19 electoral votes. CNN can also project that Rhode Island will go to Kamala Harris, as expected. Kamala Harris will get the four electoral votes from Rhode Island. So where are we on the electoral map, as of right now? Donald Trump has 154 electoral votes. Kamala Harris has 53 electoral votes. 270 are needed to win. Neither of them is within spitting distance of that. Let's take a look at the actual votes coming in, from the battlegrounds that we have not projected. In battleground Pennsylvania, Kamala Harris in the lead, 57.5 percent of the vote. Donald Trump, 41.5 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with a 258,000-plus vote lead. That's with about a quarter, 23 percent of the estimated vote in Pennsylvania counted as of now.

That's with an estimated 12 percent of the vote counted in Michigan. Still very early in Michigan. In battleground North Carolina, Donald Trump in the lead. 50.7 percent of the vote. Harris with 48.1 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 75,000-plus vote lead. That's with more than half, 51 percent of the estimated vote, counted in battleground North Carolina. In battleground Georgia, Donald Trump still holding on to his lead, 52.9 percent of the vote. Harris has 46.4 percent of the vote. Donald Trump, right now, with a 249,000-plus vote lead. I'm sorry. Now, it's a 255,000 vote lead. That's with an estimated 71 percent of the vote counted in battleground Georgia. In Virginia, Donald Trump in the lead, as of now. 49.3 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has 48.7 percent of the vote. Donald Trump is ahead by more than 15,000 votes. That's with more than half, 56 percent of the estimated vote. But still a lot of vote to come in, in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In New Hampshire. Harris with 53.4 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with 45.9 percent of the vote. Harris with an 18,000-plus vote lead. That's with under a third of the vote counted in New Hampshire. 30 percent of the estimated vote counted in New Hampshire. In Ohio, Donald Trump in the lead, 54.3 percent of the vote. Harris with 44.8 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 332,000-plus vote lead.

I'm just getting off the phone with Gabriel Sterling, a key election official in Georgia. He says, give or take, there are 1.5 million outstanding votes, still in Georgia. Again, give or take, not a precise number, but around that. Let's zoom in here on Gwinnett. This is a Democratic stronghold. They are significantly delayed, according to Zach Manifold, who I just got off the phone with. He says, there's an issue with their adjudication software for the write-ins on the ballots. And so, that is why we're seeing such a low number. Now, overall, in Gwinnett, I'm told, there are 419,000 votes there. So, that was as of 06:30. He says that's likely -- that number is likely going to go up. Out of that breakdown, the at least 419,000, there are overall, 96,000 day of votes in Gwinnett, 322,000 early votes. So if you look at the numbers here, the rough estimate of 16 percent of the estimated vote in, there are still roughly more than 350,000 outstanding ballots, just in Gwinnett alone. And then, you put that into the bigger picture of what I just said, from Gabriel Sterling, that there's still 1.5 million outstanding ballots in Georgia, give or take. Jake.",

As Pamela said, it's a problem with the adjudication of some of those write-in ballots. We spoke with him, just a few moments ago, at the 08:15 news conference here, in which he said, there was some delay in processing those, and getting those 322,000 early in-person and absentee mail-in ballots to the state tabulation center, to that computer. It statutorily had to be there by 08:00 p.m. He says that it was just the computer system clicking down to identify the names in the write- in column for president, specifically, for that race, and there appears to be a problem with that system. So, right now, there are from Gwinnett County, about 72,000 votes. Still about 250,000 of the early in-person votes, and those mail-in absentee votes that were supposed to be in, more than an hour ago. And he's on the call, right now, to determine what happens next, and explain to the Secretary of State's office what they're doing, and probably look for some guidance on how to move forward, Jake.",

Now, no one is saying that this is obviously anywhere near over, yet. They are still watching very closely to the blue wall of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

And election workers are now reaching out to some of those folks, out there, who have signature issues. Your signatures need to match those that are on file with the state. And an interesting anecdote here. One of the problems that they're running into is that a lot of young voters don't know how to sign their names. And so, when they've signed their names onto some of these ballots, they are not jiving with what state officials have on file. And so, what they're doing at this point is sort of frantically reaching out to a lot of young voters, across the State of Nevada, to say, Hey, wait a minute -- hopefully they're looking at their texts. And saying, Hey, wait a minute. There's a problem with your ballot. You need to check in with the state, and make sure that your signature is verified, so your ballot can be counted. So that is one thing that they're looking at this point. There are about 14,000 of these ballot issues that they're trying to rectify. They do have several days to work that out. And as you mentioned, Jake, the polls are about to close here in Nevada. If you're still in line, you can stay in line. We heard out in Nye County, which is about an hour outside of Vegas, they've got a line about two and a half hours long.

Some of the states we talked about earlier that we thought were aberrations, or early votes, you see right here now, including Kansas. Kansas has gone back to being a Republican state. We expect it will finish out that way.There are some Democratic pockets of support here. They're mostly in the eastern part of the state, Manhattan, Kansas. Well, remember, it was Kansas that sounded the first alarm after Dobbs, when the amendment passed out there, protecting abortion rights. So, we'll watch the result margin. We expect Kansas will be a red state, at the end of the night. But you will keep an eye on that to see about that. Then you keep coming forward. Here's the one that's interesting, and it's staying interesting, but we're only at 31 percent of the vote. Iowa, which, again, has not been a state we paid much attention to since Barack Obama left the team -- left the scene. Donald Trump won it comfortably twice. The Harris lead is shrinking a little bit. But she's still ahead in Iowa, 51 percent to 48 percent. And if you look through I said earlier, we were at 83 percent in Polk County, we're still there. That's the bulk of your Democratic votes. You start moving down. You come over here to Cedar Rapids, which is Linn County, you're only a 34 percent of the vote here. So there's some business to be done in terms of Democratic votes for the Vice President, in what is an interesting state. If this one is competitive, it's just it would be a surprise. And Election Night surprises are always interesting. You see there, Dubuque County there. We'll see how that one plays out as we go forward. So now let's come over to some of the bigger battlegrounds. Again, if you're in the Harris campaign, especially because we're not done by any means. But if North Carolina and Georgia, Trump's ahead there? Then you'd rather be the candidate ahead in the blue wall states. And at the moment, the Vice President is. 34 percent, a little more than a third of the vote counted in Wisconsin. Again, you see Trump filling in, in the rural areas. Just want to check. I teed this up earlier. Brown County, Green Bay, blue-collar workers. Kamala Harris is not going to win Brown County. The question is, can she compete. When Joe Biden won the state. You see, she's at 33 percent. We're only at 12 percent. So, we have to do this a little bit later. But Joe Biden had 45 percent. So it's a key test of White blue-collar workers. Can the Vice President of the United States try to at least come close to where the President was? At the moment, she is not. But it's very early in the count, right there. Again, the foundation of any Democratic victory is down here in Milwaukee. We're almost at half the vote right there. She's at 67 percent there. Let's just go back in time and look. The President was at 69 percent. It sounds like not a big deal. 67. 69. Let's see. Right now, we're only at 48 percent of the vote. If at the end of the night, she's underperforming the President in Milwaukee by a couple points? That can make the difference in a state, Jake, that in two elections in a row, has been decided by 20,000 votes. Jake.",
