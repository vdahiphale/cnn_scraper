The shipment includes ballistic missiles and more attack drones.Our chief international correspondent is Clarissa Ward and she is live in Ukraine for us. Clarissa, good morning to you.

This was a residential apartment building. It was hit by a cruise missile just about three weeks ago. Three people were killed; another seven people were injured. No clear target here. Very hard to understand why on earth you would bomb an area with ordinary people living in a simple apartment building. But that's why potentially, the development of these Iranian weapons could be very significant, indeed. I should say we don't yet have a timeline on when they might arrive here. It's not just missiles, it's drones. You've seen how those drones have wreaked havoc in the last month, particularly on civilian infrastructure. And just yesterday, Don, more than 50 missiles aimed at Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force saying that they were able to intercept more than 40 of them, which is very significant. But it only takes a few, Don, to get in, hit their targets, and cripple civilian infrastructure.",

He's trying to threaten. He's trying to deflect from the fact that actually, Russia has suffered some pretty humiliating defeats on the battlefield and is facing kind of an uphill battle when it comes to maintaining control of some of the areas that they have.But there's no question that Ukraine is really struggling to keep up with these attacks on the electric plants, on the water pump plants, on the hydroelectric dams. We have rolling blackouts across the country -- yesterday, hundreds of thousands without power. The children's hospital here in Zaporizhzhia was running on backup power. That is clearly not a sustainable situation, which is why you see Ukrainian officials appealing for more materials to try to build back the grid and keep up with this wave of attacks. But also, appealing for more air defense systems to try to stop them from happening in the first place.",

I asked him about that just a few hours ago when he came to vote. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
