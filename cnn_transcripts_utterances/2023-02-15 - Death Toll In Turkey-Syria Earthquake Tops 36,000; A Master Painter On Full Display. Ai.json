And as you can see here, boxes and boxes are being filled up with life-saving humanitarian assistance, and crucial donations for those impacted by the earth (INAUDIBLE), clothes, blankets, to toiletries, anything that someone who has been made homeless, displaced by the devastation could need in order to survive over the next few weeks. And there are aid centers like this one you can see the sheer scale of this hangar where the aid donations are coming in. There are centers like this across the country because of course as we are still seeing the death tolls rising and we are still seeing miraculously survivors being pulled out of the rubble. This is now becoming more of a recovery effort than a rescue effort and there are of course thousands and thousands of people, of families, extremely vulnerable now, desperately in need, hugely dependent on that humanitarian assistance between aid groups from across the globe, traveling into Turkey to support in that effort. And here in Istanbul, it`s not just the international aid that`s coming in, and there`s Turks, it`s people from this country piling into centers like this one to provide those donations. There is a real sense of unity here, people really want to help and of course there are so many in need. The question of what`s also now relating to northwest Syria, getting aid across the border there, through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, there has been some logistical challenges as well as diplomatic challenges in getting the aid across the northwest Syria. That now seems to be coming through. And, of course, we are also now beginning to see evacuations. People and families being evacuated from the impacted southeast region of Turkey to even here in Istanbul where they will be sheltered over the next few weeks, many of them of course now displaced homeless with nowhere else to go.

Often compared to the \"Mona Lisa\", Johannesburg Vermeer painted \"Girl With a Pearl Earring\" in around 1665. That painting is now part of an unprecedented show at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The museum is putting on the largest showcase of Vermeer paintings in our lifetime. Twenty-eight of the artist`s 37 attributed works are on display, even Vermeer himself did not see that many of his paintings together all at one time. Tickets for the event are sold out, but lucky us, CNN`s Nick Glass is taking us inside the exhibit to check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK GLASS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For a glorious 90 minutes, we had the place to ourselves. Vermeer`s paintings, their beauty, their size demand intimacy and quiet. And here was an opportunity to spend quality time with his most famous creation. This is rare. I`ve been an arts score (ph), it`s -- one for something like 20 years, and to be alone with a painting like this \"Girl With a Pearl Erring\", it`s extraordinary and she`s not alone. The Rijksmuseum has pulled off an astonishing artistic coup, the greatest Vermeer show of this or any other lifetime, 28 of the 34 to 37 attributed works. Vermeer himself would never have seen so many of his paintings altogether in one place.",
