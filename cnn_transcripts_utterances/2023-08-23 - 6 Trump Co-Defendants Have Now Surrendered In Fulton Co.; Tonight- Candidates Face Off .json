And we've had multiple defendants in this diversion case, turned themselves in in the last 48 hours. So just in the last hour, the former Trump attorney Ken Chesebro turned himself in. Of course, he is the architect of the fake electoral scheme, not just here in Georgia but beyond. And Chesebro has argued through his attorney that he never once stepped foot in Georgia on behalf of the Trump campaign, but he did surrender earlier today. Joining Chesebro is Ray Smith. He's the former Trump campaign attorney who prosecutors alleged was in the room when fake electors met here in Atlanta in December of 2020. He was also vocal about spreading misinformation about voter irregularities and voter fraud in the state of Georgia. Chesebro and Smith of course, join David Shafer and Cathy Latham, who turned themselves in overnight.Shafer is the former head of the GOP here in the state of Georgia and was also instrumental in the fake electoral scheme. He has said in a court filing that he acted at the direction of the incumbent President Donald Trump, as well as other federal officials. And Cathy Latham, the former chair of the GOP in rural Coffee County, who was a fake collector herself, and also instrumental in the alleged scheme to access, illegally access voting data in Coffee County. Look, it's really interesting because we've been talking to defense attorneys here in Fulton County, to ask them about this process. And they say that their clients who have been much like these defendants in this case are treated much differently. Earlier I spoke to Suri Chadha Jimenez, he's a defense attorney who's tied to another high profile RICO case in Atlanta happening right now.

He is in this race to call to account Donald Trump to say he ought to be have to answer for his actions on January 6th, his actions in trying to overturn the election.

But I do think it's an uphill battle. I think there's a good chance the judge will say, look, what you're charged with doing here went well beyond the role of a federal law officer, you exceeded your official duties in trying to tamper with this election.

And if you are making arguments that either you know are totally unsupported by the law, or that a reasonable lawyer would know or impermissible or you're doing things that go outside the law, such as bringing improper pressure to bear on state officials to flip the results, that does exceed the notion of what an attorney can do, even within the sphere of legitimate advocacy.So again, tough argument to make, but I understand why he's doing it.
