      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're joining us. I am Erica Hill in New York.At this hour, in Gaza, Ramadan begins without a deal for a ceasefire. Israeli officials say a ground invasion in the southern city of Rafah is not imminent. This as President Biden warned such an operation would cross, in his view, \"a red line\". Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump hitting the campaign trail in the key swing state of Georgia over the weekend. Can Donald Trump win back that key southern state? We'll dig into that and much more with our political panel ahead. Plus, happening now in Michigan, the manslaughter trial for James Crumbley has resumed. Crumbley, of course, is accused of enabling his son's shooting rampage that left four people dead. We'll bring you the very latest. Ramadan bringing no relief for Palestinians during months of war in Gaza. Israel continuing with its attacks as the Muslim holy month gets underway. There is, of course, at this hour, no ceasefire agreement in sight. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden warned an Israeli offensive on Rafah would be, in his view, \"a red line\", other than immediately added he would never abandon Israel or cut off all weapons. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still vowing to attack Rafah to root out Hamas. Israeli and U.S. officials, however, tell CNN they do not believe an offensive there is imminent. It's important to note, more than a million Palestinians are sheltering now in Rafah, many of them virtually pinned up against the Egyptian border. Let's bring in Jeremy Diamond who joins us now from Jerusalem with more. So, Jeremy as we noted, Ramadan beginning, no ceasefire, no invasion of Rafah. When it comes to Rafah, however, the Prime Minister making it very clear in an interview yesterday that this really appears to be a question of when, not if.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. No doubt about it. Israeli officials, including the Israeli Prime Minister, are just as committed as ever to carrying out a major military offensive into Rafah where we know that about 1.5 million Palestinians are currently living. But, Israeli officials have told me that an invasion of Rafah, an offensive into Rafah is not imminent. And that's for a couple of reasons. First of all, the Israeli military has yet to build up the amount of forces inside of Gaza that it would need to carry out that offensive successfully. And secondly, they have yet to begin to carry out the plans to evacuate civilians from that city. In fact, those plans, we're told, have yet to actually be finalized or approved by the Israeli war cabinet.And I'm told that that evacuation would likely take at least two weeks. And so, as Israeli officials have repeatedly promised American officials that they will carry out an evacuation before moving forward with an offensive, that could potentially put that offensive at least a couple of weeks away. And again, Israeli officials have made clear that they're not going to rule out an offensive in Rafah during Ramadan, but it appears that at least for the beginning of this holy Muslim month, they will not be moving forward with that offensive.

He has remained defiant throughout all of this, saying that this has been an attempt by the government to go after him. In the superseding indictment, basically what prosecutors are saying, they're saying that what Nadine Menendez, the Senator's wife, and the Senator did is tried to cover up their alleged crimes by saying that the bribes that they had received weren't in fact bribes. They tried to make it out that they were loans, loans instead of bribes. They are now facing 18 additional accounts, which they have pled -- pleaded not guilty to, including conspiracy, acting as a foreign agent, bribery, extortion, and wire fraud. And again, the Senator and his wife have pleaded not guilty before to bribery charges, this go around. Again, what they're basically saying is they tried to cover up these bribes, saying that the money that they have received for the mortgage for their home, the money that they had received for a new Mercedes was a loan and not as -- and not these bribes. Also alleged in the superseding indictment, Erica, is that they lied to their former attorneys and that their former attorneys then gave that misleading information to U.S. attorneys when they had meetings with them last year.

He says -- when you think about him keeping cash in his house, keeping those gold bars in the house, remember, they found the gold bars and the cash stuffed in clothes in his house when investigators were there serving a search warrant, he says, culturally, it's not unusual for peoples of certain cultures to keep things like this in their home.

Definitely. I mean, we saw this past weekend initially the beginning of the general election. Right? It hasn't been made official yet. But, it's been clear all along that it would become -- it would be a Joe Biden and Donald Trump rematch. And we saw that, with Haley out of the race, Trump is able to refocus most of his energy on Joe Biden, on the guy that he is trying to defeat on his way to the White House. And as Margaret said, I mean, they're presenting very, very stark different views of the America that they would lead. And it is stunning. But, like Margaret said as well, most Americans are not engaged with this. I'm not surprised by that polling. I think both -- a lot of Americans didn't want this kind of rematch.

He is doing it because the polling shows that when voters say, well, why do you think Joe Biden is too old? They talk about things like the way he talks or how quickly he can make an argument.And Trump has just decided to lean into it to try to undercut people's confidence in Biden. Biden is looking now for another way to acknowledge the fact that he is older and sort of (inaudible) to voters, but to try to make the case for voters for why that shouldn't be the thing on which they base whether they'll vote for him, again, two starkly different approaches. It's impossible to imagine Joe Biden making fun of Donald Trump the same way.

They do not tie infrastructure, chips, the Inflation Reduction Act, any of the legislative feats.Like, it is really hard for Biden campaign to get the messaging across that this is Joe Biden's work, that this is the work of a Democratic President.

One passenger said people flew in the air inside the plane and \"broke the ceiling of the plane\". The Chilean airline LATAM is calling this a technical event. Boeing, for its part, says it is working to gather more information. At least 26 people are dead in Indonesia's West Sumatra province as the area faces flooding and landslides.

On Friday, the judge told jurors the trial was running so far ahead of schedule.

Now, remembering what happened in that trial, Erica, what did happen? Number one, the wife blamed him, saying that he was the one, James Crumbley, responsible for the gun, the purchase of the gun, the secreting or securing of the gun, right? And so, that's problematic, because if the jury sees that and they get evidence, which they have been hearing in terms of he is responsible, right, for purchasing the weapon, he is responsible for hiding the weapon, and he didn't take steps to do that, that's troubling.The other issue, though, which is not as clear as it was in Jennifer's case, is the extent to which he may have been on notice of these various text messages where the mother seems to have some indication that the school or others, right, her son was trying to reach out for help where the father may not have that knowledge. So, what if anything will the prosecution do to show that as the father, either you knew your son had some problems, or you should have known, right? They did a good job with the mother. Can they do that with him? If they do, then again it leads more towards a conviction than it would an acquittal.",

A person is charged and there is a whole process by which a person is brought to justice, and everyone has a right to defend themselves. But, I think the overarching issue was one of deterrence and one of accountability. Well, what does that mean? It means that if people, if with parents know that they can be prosecuted and convicted and face 15 years, as you're facing here, for not doing enough to recognize your child's problems or hiding a gun, that changes behavior immediately. Right? So, it has the deterrent effect.Number two, if parents can know that they will be accountable, then I think behavior is changed right off the bat. Right? And number two, I think prosecutors know that they can use this as an example to have people be more careful with the threat of prosecution if they are not careful. So, I think it's a sea change not only in this jurisdiction, but throughout the country of how prosecutors will approach these cases and how parents will approach their children.",
