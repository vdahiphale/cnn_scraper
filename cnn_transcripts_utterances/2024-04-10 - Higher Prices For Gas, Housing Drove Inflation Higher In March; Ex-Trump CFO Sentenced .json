Today, Alan Weisselberg walked out of a New York courtroom in handcuffs headed for Rikers Island after a judge sentenced him to five months for perjury.Weisselberg is the former chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, and he admitted that he lied during a deposition in the New York civil fraud case against Donald Trump and his co-defendants. That's the one with the $464 million judgment. Weisselberg gave false testimony specifically about the size of Trump's apartment triplex. And he's already served time in 2022 for tax fraud. Let's talk about this further with John Dean. He's a former White House counsel for President Nixon. He actually testified against President Nixon in the Watergate investigation. So, John, thanks so much for being with us. A five-months sentence for Weisselberg. Do you think that's fair?",

And it's really the latest signs of Republican disarray in this narrowly divided Republican-led House.Remember, typically, majority power parties approve what's known as the rule. That sets the parameters for floor debates in the House. It allows them to actually pass bills on a majority basis. But in this Congress, seven times the Republicans have been divided and actually scuttled this rule, rules from going forward. Essentially, the whaling the entire legislative agenda. Before this Congress, it hadn't happened since 2002 when a rule went down. This Congress alone, seven times. In this instance, it was a -- the centerpiece of this was a dispute over renewing a warrantless surveillance program the FBI conducts under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Donald Trump put out a social media post overnight saying that Republicans should kill it. And ultimately, 19 Republicans moved that route and sought to kill it. There was national security hawks we're warning that they -- that the FBI needs this powerful -- what they say is a powerful tool at this key time, before the president's signing of that. Speaker Mike Johnson himself. In fact, Johnson has called a 4:00 p.m. meeting for Republicans to regroup and try the way forward. Now the question is also about, well, how long can Speaker Johnson hang onto his job amid growing threats from one member in particular? Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has said that she will -- and may very see this soon -- call for a vote seeking his ouster. She met with them earlier today and she warned him not to move ahead on plans to renew that controversial provision under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and also said he should drop his plans to move forward on the Ukraine aid package, suggesting that could move are closer to calling for such a vote, seeking his ouster. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): There's two issues that are coming up that are extremely important, FISA and Ukraine. If he funds the Deep State and the warrantless spying on Americans, he's telling Republican voters all over the country that the continued behavior will happen more, spying on President Trump and spying on hundreds of thousands of Americans. Number two, the funding of Ukraine must end. We are not responsible for a war in Ukraine, Boris, we're responsible for the war on our border.

We know from our reporting, from our colleagues, Melanie Zanona and Kristen Holmes, that Johnson and Trump are planning a joint press conference Friday at Mar-a-Lago.
