Donald Trump's big return to Musk's X platform was riddled with lies and false claims about crime, inflation, and other important policy matters. There were plenty of softball questions and plenty of criticism and aggressive attacks against his rival.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Kamala wouldn't have this conversation.

Instead, it was the same airing of grievances and attacks that we have heard the former president make repeatedly on the campaign trail. He went after Harris. He criticized her position on the border. He claimed that she wouldn't do the type of interview, as you just heard, that he was doing with Musk. He also went after Biden and spent a lot of time criticizing his former opponents, something we've seen repeatedly play out over the last several weeks, and I know that it kind of shows Donald Trump still wishes Biden were perhaps the one that he was going up against. You also heard him make the same claims about Jewish voters. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  And I say, if you're a Jewish person or have you believe in Israel, if you're a person that is very pro-Israel, if you vote for her, its worse than Biden.

And what the convention next week is going to be about is saying that the party now stands together. Monday night, you're going to have Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton speaking. Tuesday night, Barack Obama Wednesday, Bill Clinton. Also Wednesday, of course, Tim Walz, and then all building up to Thursday when Kamala Harris will speak.There will be lots of other speakers, up and coming politicians, but that connection between the generations of Democratic politicians, all these presidents standing together saying they're united behind Kamala Harris is not only what the Democratic Party wants to -- excuse me -- put across here, but is in stark contrast to the Republican Party.

When it comes to the border, she's got a solution for the border. She wants to solve the issue. He wants to scream about the issue.

With us now is CNN's senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Andy, great to see you. You had a chance to look at the details here. What jumps out at you? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, I think, John, the first thing that jumps out is the evolution in the Iranians' tactics and sophistication. If you look back at the 2020 election, we know that the Iranians attempted to interfere with that election as well and their efforts were kind of a downscaled version of what they've done here. In that case, they were just going straight at the targets they wanted to collect on. This is kind of an evolution in sophistication. They've realized kind of employing almost human collection strategies. They're going after someone first who they think can guarantee them access to the targets they really seek. In this case, it looks likes that person was probably Roger Stone because of his ability to communicate with those people inside the campaign that the Iranians were most interested in. They used Mr. Stone as an access agent to get to where they wanted to be.",

MCCABE: Super complicated. I mean, at the top level alone there's a bit of, live by the sword die by the sword theme happening here, right? This is a guy who has meddled in elections his entire life. If you believe his biography, he is somebody who certainly was supportive of the Russians' efforts to steal information from the Democratic National Committee and from the Clinton campaign, and to try to use that information against her. So, now he finds himself on the kind of pointy edge of that sphere this time coming from Iran, not Russia. And Mr. Stone has a very checkered past about making misstatements and false statements and using opportunities with the media to kind of pump up his own resume. I'm confident the FBI is keeping all that in the back of their mind as they deal with him. They must deal with him. He is clearly a victim in this scheme and they deal with all victims in the same way. But at the same time they're thinking -- I'm sure they're thinking twice about the representations he makes.",

She stayed and then when the fire arrived from what her co-workers say, moved rapidly to the building and she lost her life. This is just one of the stories, Kate, it is one of those personal stories that really hit hard not only for residents here and for people that worked here, but also for Greece as a whole. You've got these fires that moved so quickly after moving around 40 kilometers to where we're standing right now, burning down homes and really difficult to get it under control. And finally today, we are seeing just the aftermath. People are trying to come to terms with their loss, the devastation that we've been seeing. But more importantly, they have a lot of questions. They're asking this, why wasn't it contained quickly enough? Was it the wind, I mean, is climate change to blame? Could government do more?
