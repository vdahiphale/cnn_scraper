      "sentences": "And they - presumably they will be making a statement soon about what their assessment is right now, what happened, if there were in fact gunshots that hit the former president on the right side of his face near his ear right now.It's a very, very serious situation that we're watching unfold, and as I keep saying history in the making right now. You don't often see this but unfortunately you see it once in a while and it's pretty scary every time you do. I want to bring in our senior medical correspondent and trauma neurosurgeon, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who's with us right now. Sanjay, what's your analysis? We all saw the former president speaking, all of a sudden we heard some noises, sounded to me like gunshots. But we haven't confirmed that. We haven't heard from the FBI or the Secret Service confirming that. But you could see him raise his right hand towards his face. Then you can see some blood and then he goes down. Secret Service agents rushed the stage over there and bring him over to a vehicle very, very carefully. But you heard from the crowd a lot of screaming, a lot of shouting, get down, get down, get down. What's your assessment, Sanjay? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, I'm seeing obviously the same thing everyone is. There was obviously an indication that he recognized something that happened, felt pain, whatever that was we don't know. Then goes down. He looks like he does that of his own volition as opposed to sort of collapsing. These are all sort of important clues. And then obviously once we see him finally raised backup, he does -- you see the blood all over the right side of his face. You also see him sort of pumping his fist into the air, walking on his own. It looks like they're covering him up, but he is walking on his own when they get him out of there. A couple of things. There's a lot that's unknown and so from a medical standpoint, that sort of broadens probably the work up. You've got -- you know, we see what we see. But was there something else that happened as well that we really didn't see and that he himself may not even be aware of? You know, we don't know again if these are gunshots but if they were, the sounds like there were several. Where else -- could there be any other injuries? Could there be an injury when he actually went to the ground as well? Well, separate from whatever caused the problem in the first place. But the point being, Wolf, that from a trauma standpoint, that's sort of just entails a very full workup. Let's make sure nothing is missed here. We all see what we see. But what about what we don't see or what we don't recognize or what the former president himself may not recognize in the moment in terms of possible injuries. It's not to say that there are any, but one of the things that has to happen is a very complete workup. I'll give you an example, even a -- let's say there was a grazing of the bullet, was that just soft tissue? Was there a skull fracture, anything like that? You got to look for these things to make sure you don't miss it. And again, was there any other injuries either in the initial moment or from the being on the ground, being led out of there, you've got look. So my guess is we're going to hear about -- you can do these workups fairly quickly, but they need to be done, Wolf.",

And what was especially scary to me, Sanjay, is not only when the former president raised his right hand towards the side of his face, but then you saw blood near the ear. I don't know if it was coming from the ear or near the ear, something happened that caused the blood to emerge. And then he went down. That was pretty scary stuff when I saw that.",

These are the sorts of things that the medical team is going to want to know. Was there a reason for him to have collapsed? Doesn't look like it to me, looking at that video. Clearly looks like he raised his hand. He recognizes something has happened that got his attention, got everyone's attention.But a couple of points to make again is that, was that the only thing? Was there something else? Was there an injury when he went to the ground? Was there an injury when he was transported out? Again, even the sort of escorting him out of there, getting him out of there, you got to like pay attention to everything in terms of possible injuries. It doesn't look like, you know, he's raising his hand. That's a good sign obviously. He's walking on his own. That's a good sign, obviously. But you've got be thorough in terms of actually checking for all these things from a trauma standpoint. The neurosurgeons clearly, but just the trauma surgeons as well.",

He is fine and is being checked out in a local medical facility. More details will follow.\" That statement from Steven Cheung of the Trump campaign. We're getting more statements coming in right now. The House Speaker Mike Johnson just posted on X that he is, quote, \"praying for President Trump, praying for President Trump,\" moments after the former president was taken off stage after he was clearly injured in an incident at this campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik also posted in that same X platform, \"Please pray for President Trump, his family, and all of the patriots at today's rally in Pennsylvania.\" So statements, reaction coming in very, very quickly. And I'll read one more time. The Secret Service's official statement that just came in from the chief of communications of the U.S. Secret Service, \"An incident occurred the evening of July 13th at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has implemented protective measures. And the former president is safe. This is now an active Secret Service investigation and further information will be released when available.\" That statement from the chief of communications for the U.S. Secret Service.

And according to the Secret Service, he's now in a medical facility getting some treatment and making sure that he's going to be OK. They say he's safe. We'll get presumably very, very soon.Jonathan Wackrow, you're a former Secret Service agent, any additional analysis, any additional points you want to make that was very impressive how the Secret Service reacted so quickly. And as you correctly point out, this is what they train for, God forbid, the shooting incident involving a president or a former president. And people might not know that former presidents of the United States get extensive Secret Service protection long after they leave the White House. JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST (via phone): You know, and I think, you know, there's one thing I want to just talk about the security structure that's put around the former president right now. There is an extensive security program. There is a detail that's with the president 24 hours a day, but also you have to remember the former president isn't that long out of office. So there are still threats that linger, that carry over from his time in office. And because of that, you actually see a robust structure around former president Trump. That, coupled with the fact that he is a presidential candidate, so thankfully today you actually saw a lot of those assets that usually are in the background actually come to the forefront and reacted very quickly. One of which is the tactical team, the counter- assault team. You actually see that tactical team come on to the stage. They provide a secondary ring of protection around the former president. Again, ensuring that they can, you know, suppress any secondary threat that presents itself. And then help move the former president safely from the stage, again moving off of the X, moving from the stage back to the armored limousine. And again, moving the president away from this site. So you're seeing a lot of things, a lot of actions by the Secret Service and assets of the Secret Service come into play that typically the general public does not witness. But here you're seeing everything, you know, fall into place exactly as every single one of these agents trained for. And again, I cannot stress enough the countless hours that these agents put into this exact moment, again, you know, focusing on an attack on the principal on a stage, making that principal safe. And then moving them to a safe and secondary location. And if there is any type of medical concern which in this case there is, there is the medical component that these agents are trained for in the near term until other additional medical personnel are able to examine the former president. So again, quick reaction by the Secret Service, quick reaction by law enforcement partners, really, you know, prevented, you know, what could have been a real tragedy today.",

We're now hearing from multiple law enforcement sources that the term that's being used by law enforcement is that the shooter, the person who fired the shot at the former president, has been neutralized.Now generally that word is used when someone is dead, that that person is no longer a threat. And that is the word that law enforcement tends to use when a threat to someone who is a protectee, in this case the former president, is no longer a threat. So that's what the word that is being used by law enforcement that he's been neutralized, that the person, the shooter, has been neutralized. Now we expect that we're going to hear a lot more in the few minutes -- in the next few minutes or in the next coming hours from the U.S. Secret Service because now they're trying to put together an investigation into the way this could have happened. Obviously, there's a team that is in place there with the former president. They're going to -- they're good at collecting evidence. They know how to do that. And so that's one of the first things that's happened is to try to secure the crime scene and to determine everything about how this came to be. Where did this shooter, this person, get access to the grounds? Is it inside? Was it outside? Was this person essentially a sniper who was firing at the former president? All of their background, all of that stuff is being done now as we speak. Now the FBI is also there in the case of Ronald Reagan, the former president Ronald Reagan, when he was shot by John Hinckley Junior, that became an FBI -- a Secret Service and an FBI investigation that obviously went to all of the parts of that case. And so that is likely what is going to happen here, Wolf, but right now, again, we're still just getting the basic information from the scene, and as you pointed out, the shooter is no longer believed to be a threat to the safety of that scene. And so now the investigation moves to another phase. So that's what we know at this point, that the shooter was neutralized and that's a term again that we hear from law enforcement when they mean that that the shooter is dead.",

So when we heard that word, \"The shooter is down\" was really important. That was a key moment for the detail leader to then make the call, we are going to move to the next terrain feature. We are going to take the protectee, in this case former President Trump. We are going to remove him from this stage and we are going to move him -- the immediate action is to move him to the armored limo, again, getting into a safe location as quickly as possible. Now, the question remains: Who addressed that threat? We know that there was a shooter, so who neutralized that threat? Was it a member of the Secret Service? Was it a member of law enforcement? And I think it is important to understand that when you think about the site dynamics here in the way that Secret Service, the protective methodology is actually applied to this type of event, it is actually concentric rings of protection. What we are witnessing on air in looking at the stage is the closest ring to the protectee, but that ring radiates out in terms of law enforcement, special agents, private security firms -- all of that combined create the security structure of this site. So what we don't know right now is who actually identified that threat in the moment and then neutralized it.",

Then there was a slight pause and then you heard rapid gunfire in response. So to me, not, not -- just listening to that audio shows that there was a shooter and then there was some response from law enforcement and now, we heard from Evan at that the shooter was neutralized. We heard from the agents on the stage that the shooter was down. So that was a key moment for the agents part of the shift to then be able to feel that it was a safe enough moment or there was a lull in the gunfire that they could -- they could move the president from the stage to the limousine when safe and when the appropriate assets were surrounding the former president to include that tactical team that we are seeing. You know, we are seeing the agents just create that bubble around the president as they are moving him offstage. What you're seeing again is if you look into the crowd, you're seeing special agents. Everyone has their weapons out, they are scanning for, you secondary threats. They are ensuring that that wasn't a distraction and that another threat was coming inbound. So you see a heightened sense of awareness, increased situational awareness by all members of law enforcement, even as the president is being moved off of stage, again, really important and great work by all law enforcement, including the Secret Service.",

I don't think the Secret Service was pushing him down at that point, although they did go down and then eventually lift him up and take him to a vehicle.

That's the safest area, and the agents are right there on top of them. So again, I think that in this moment, you could see the former president was looking towards the right, again the moment that he felt something hit potentially hit his ear or that he felt that he was in danger, he did the right thing by going down. Now, again, we don't know what other injuries the former president may have sustained in this moment. Again, the Secret Service came immediately on top of him. The detail leader would have been doing a rapid assessment to see if there were any secondary wounds, any other type of injury prior to moving the former president. We didn't get to see that because they were down behind that front shield, the bunting in the front of the stage.

What can you tell us? KIP TOM, EYEWITNESS (via phone): Yes. As you said, I was about 40 feet away to the right of former President Trump, and -- but I saw the gun smoke and I saw -- heard the fire immediately, that it was coming from the stands to the left of President Trump, towards the top because you can see the gun smoke about that time is when President Trump went down. It seemed like there was maybe six or seven shots a little bit of a pause and a person behind me about 15 feet was hit. I am not so sure he is the one that was killed, but then I thought I heard, there is a little bit of a pause and then I thought there were gunshots that came from behind me at the same elevation as across.
