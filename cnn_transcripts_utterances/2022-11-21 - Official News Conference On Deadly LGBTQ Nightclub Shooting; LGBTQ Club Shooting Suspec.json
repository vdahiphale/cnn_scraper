That's the mayor, the police chief, the district attorney himself, the U.S. attorney, the public affairs officer, lined up to say exactly the same thing.Meanwhile, the D.A. is giving us clues, recognizing, I think, that he's going to have to speak eventually about things like motivation, that he'll be speaking soon. For example, he mentioned the charging documents. He talked about red flag laws repeatedly. He used phrases saying, I hope to have or expect to have something else shortly. He knows he can't sustain forever the silence, but I thought very professional.

So, that has led to people around here questioning, well, how was he allowed to buy these handguns, -- these -- sorry, this handgun and this rifle? Because we have been told by two law enforcement officials that records show this suspect did purchase these weapons himself. So, people were asking why was there no background check? Why were red flags not raised by this previous interaction? Well, here is what we just found out. In 2019, the law here in Colorado was changed and no charges were ever pursued against the suspect for that summer of 2021 incident. So, therefore, under Colorado law, if a case is dismissed for whatever reason, those records are sealed. So, that would not have flagged him as a potential problem, as he apparently proved himself to be Saturday night here in the club. Wolf?",

How can you even think of things? We don't even have that many rights in this country as LGBTQ people. We have a few protections for employment and the right to marry.

We see that Senator Warnock and the Democratic apparatus is able to sort of fundraise and boost energy among Democrats by tying the former president to Herschel Walker.

And what he said was he brought up the subject of his own father. He said he thought he had made a mistake in encouraging his own father to retire too early. He said, I think if you've got the health and you've got ability to do the job, that's what matters. And I think you're hearing him talk about that question. He's trying to sort of push the discussion away from a number and says, as he often says these days, watch me, see what you think of my job performance. One thing I will say, running against Donald Trump, in some ways, may neutralize the question of age a bit because Donald Trump, after all, previously the oldest U.S. president and also would be 78 if he took office again.
