There are vows of revenge today for the dozens of people killed and wounded. Hundreds wounded in explosions in Iran. A funeral for a Senior Hamas Leader killed in Lebanon's Capital, heavier fighting reported in Gaza. The Commander of a pro-Iranian militia killed in a drone strike in Iraq. And attacks on commercial ships launched by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, the Middle East is staring down multiple tensions amid growing fears of a regional war. We're going to walk you through all of it over the next two hours starting tonight with those twin explosions in Iran yesterday Wednesday that killed 84 people and injured hundreds more as they visited the burial site of the Iranian Military Commander, Qasem Soleimani. The country has declared a day of mourning, there has been no claim of responsibility. But Iranian leaders as they have done in the past after similar attacks are blaming Israel. Here's what Iran's President is saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what we'vebeen hearing from the U.S. side from analysts is that's not the modus operandi of a state of Israel for example. We have seen in recent days that Israel carries out very targeted strikes. But of course, we have heard many times in the past when something happens, Iran will automatically blame Israel. Now the U.S. has said that there's no reason to believe that that is the case. And also saying that this actually bears the hallmarks of something like ISIS, some group like that, that is trying to increase casualties. The fact that they had one blast at 3 pm and then just 20 minutes later once emergency services, once people had rushed to the area to help the casualties, that is when the second and more deadly blast happened so all these factors point to for U.S. officials and for many analysts that this could be some kind of ISIS type group. But of course, that doesn't make a difference to the rhetoric that we will hear from some leaders and the concerns of these wider tensions increasing. And the fact that that this could potentially spill over more into the wider region, especially when you consider that just the day before you had a top Hamas Leader being killed in Southern Beirut. So this really does just add to the concern. I mean, we have U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken coming to the region again this week, showing just how concerned the U.S. is about this.",

It is according to the Foreign Ministerworking to convince Hezbollah not to wage war with Israel. As you mentioned, we have seen those continued skirmishes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military on Lebanon southern border, from the outset of this whole like almost continuous near daily exchange of fire across the border. That has certainly sparked concern. And just yesterday, we heard from Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. He spoke on the anniversary of the death of Qasem Soleimani, Iran's the Commander of the IRGC's Kuds Force. And of course, he also spoke about the Tuesday's strike which killed Saleh al-Arouri. He issued a warning to Israel. He was very clear that if Israel wages war seeks to wage war on Lebanon and the response from Hezbollah would in his words, be limitless. He was clear he said that Hezbollah is not afraid of war and that warning sign had certainly raised alarm bells. We are expecting to hear from the Nasrallah again on Friday, where there are indications that his focus will be more squarely on the situation in Lebanon, certainly all eyes will be waiting to see what he has to say. Then we have also heard those warnings from the Israeli side as well. Just last week, a member of Israel's War Cabinet Benny Gantz saying that time is running out for a diplomatic solution to the escalating tensions on the border and that urgent action isn't taken. The Israeli military may be forced to take action itself it may be forced to put the situation in its own hands. That was a warning as well, from the Israeli Foreign Ministry. But of course we also heard from the U.S. State Department Spokesperson Matt Miller, who said yesterday that the U.S. was concerned around the potential for the conflict in Gaza, the conflict between Israel and Hamas to escalate more broadly in the region. The U.S. at this stage following Tuesday strike is no more concerned than it has been from the outset of this war, Becky.",

I want to look two things, oil prices, which have just shown on the board by me, and then what is going on with regards Suez Canal and the wider global trade story? Let's start with those oil prices.

Far off the highs that we saw, I have to say last September when they were actually creeping towards that $100 benchmark. So they're off those highs. But I think what you're seeing here is the beginning really of a risk premium to oil, a result of just tensions in the Middle East, the regional conflict, but also the risk as you were mentioning earlier to oil supply thanks to this almost blockage of the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. Some ships are passing through but the longer this continues, and the longer it's considered unsafe, the more we'll see oil tankers, I think divert and take a longer route around. So that is why you're seeing a slight issue there. As you said yes, as you said earlier, you know the U.S. and 11 other governments released another joint statement. This one was really interesting yesterday, it said the Houthis (ph) will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy and free flow of commerce in the region's critical waterways. On Tuesday night two more anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into the Red Sea. They didn't hit a boat. But increasingly the sort of naval ships that are shooting down these anti-ship ballistic missiles, it is expensive, it is challenging. It is not always successful. We know a Maersk ship was hit by an unknown object on Sunday. However, while they are taking what seems to be a tough and stance, at least from that joint statement that we just saw. There is also concern though about escalating the situation and creating a broader conflict, given these militants are backed by Iran.",

We aren't seeing the regional players in this part of the world getting involved in this sort of multi country coalition to help try and secure these waters perhaps that will change going forward.

It's about foreign currency, how much foreign currency it brings into that economy, which is you say is in something of a pickle sluggish growth, inflation, last I saw was hovering around 35 percent. So the cost of living for people in Egypt is going through the roof. So this will impact Egypt, some ships are still transiting through, it's important to note that it's not a complete blockage, like we saw with the Ever Given a couple of years ago. But of course, it will hit revenues there. I would say in Egypt's favor in a way given it is a key player diplomatically in that region, it is perhaps more likely to get a big financial support package from the international community like the IMF.

Usually Israel is very targeted at either assassinates senior Iranian nuclear scientist or military commanders or sabotages nuclear facilities and military facilities. It doesn't really target innocent civilians in Iran. It hasn't happened in the past. Now of course we're on uncharted waters right now. And everything is possible. So I'm not ruling out any possibility. But if indeed is part of a pattern of Israel, killing senior IRGC officials in Syria, Hamas officials in Lebanon and yesterday basically U.S. also killing a -- official in Iraq, all of that together, could put Iran and its allies and the axis of resistance in a difficult position. Because if they don't respond, they would fear that it would be interpreted by U.S. and Israel as a sign of weakness and would only invite more of these kinds of attacks and assassinations.
