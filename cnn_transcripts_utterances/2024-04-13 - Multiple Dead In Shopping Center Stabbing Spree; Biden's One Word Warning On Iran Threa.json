Now, the prime minister of Australia spoke earlier, Anthony Albanese, and he said that the death toll would have been even higher if it wasn't for a heroic police officer, a policewoman who was acting alone, who was in the neighborhood when she heard about what was happening. She didn't wait for backup. She went into the mall. She confronted the man with the gun and -- with the knife, I'm sorry, and she shot him dead.

And the question has since been, what sort of a response are we going to be seeing from Iran? Is this going to be a direct attack by Iran on Israel? Is it going to be using its proxies to carry out attacks? Is it going to be both? And will this take place inside Israel or is it going to be going after Israeli interests elsewhere? And the questions remain unanswered. It is very unclear right now, although we are hearing from U.S. officials what they believe, what their intelligence is indicating is going to happen. At this point in time, no one really knows what Israel is going to do, Iran is going to do. But what the Israelis have been saying very publicly since is that they are ready and prepared for all scenarios. Yesterday we heard from the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who was speaking after a meeting with the U.S. CENTCOM commander, General Erik Kurilla, who is in Israel meeting with Israeli officials in anticipation of this potential Iranian attack. The Israeli defense minister saying that they are prepared to defend Israel, he said, both on the ground and in the air and would respond in close cooperation with our partners. We also heard from the Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, saying in a briefing yesterday that Israeli commanders had presented plans, both offensive and defensive, to the Israeli military leadership and that they are ready. And a short time ago, Hagari also releasing another statement saying Iran will bear the consequences of choosing to escalate the situation any further. Israel is on high alert. We have increased our readiness to protect Israel from further Iranian aggression. We are also prepared to respond. The Israel Defense Forces is prepared for all scenarios and will take the necessary steps together with our allies to protect the people of Israel. So, we are continuing to see these threats from both sides coming, these very strong statements. The question remains, what sort of a retaliation are we going to be seeing from Iran? CNN sources over the past week have indicated that while the Iranians want some sort of a major response to what happened, they also want to make sure that it is a measured response, a calculated one, because they do not want war. They do not want this to escalate into a war, a confrontation potentially with the United States, something the U.S. also doesn't want to do. But of course, Victor, the concern is not only about what sort of a response we're going to be seeing from the Iranians, it is how Israel will also respond to that. I can tell you that the region right now is really on edge. It is a very, very dangerous situation, perhaps the most dangerous since October.",

Yes, we're taking a look at two separate systems, but eerily similar types of weather that we can expect.Now, for today, all that's really left is kind of some lingering rain and snow showers across portions of the northeast. Not really too much to be concerned about. It's the next system, that one that slides in from Canada, will begin early Sunday morning before spreading all of that moisture eastward. So, states like Pennsylvania, New York could end up getting some rain. And trust me, the last thing Pittsburgh needs is more rain. They're already sitting at their third wettest April on record. Even if they only get an inch from this next system, they will likely top out at the wettest April on record. But it's not just rain. It's also the potential for severe. For Sunday, the main concern stretches from Philadelphia all the way back into Cincinnati. The main concern is going to be damaging winds, but we can't rule out the potential for a tornado. Now, once we get to Monday, an entirely different system takes shape across the central U.S. This one has more of an enhanced threat, although the threats themselves remain the same. Still looking at damaging winds and the potential for some tornadoes. Here's a look at that system. That's the one that begins over the Rockies this weekend and then continues to spread eastward across the country as we go through the rest of the week. Now, we talked about the severe threats. The main focus here really is from Des Moines all the way down into Texas. Again, main threats, damaging winds, the potential for very large hail. We're talking tennis ball size or even larger.

And so I think what the Trump team wants to do, by virtue of the 42 questions that we know will be asked of the jury, is to ensure that people don't have such firmly held and biased views against the president, such as to make a determination based upon who Donald Trump is and not what Donald Trump allegedly did. The essence is to decide the case based on the facts, the evidence, and the circumstances in that courtroom and to put all biases aside. That's what his team wants, Victor. That's what the prosecution wants. We'll see whether or not they're able to get it. And if they don't, you know we're going to see additional motions for changes of venue and delays of the trial.",

What happens is they'll be asked the generic questions, where are you from, what neighborhood do you live in without giving your address, what does your family do, what do you do for a living, all the generic questions, and then more specific, you know, did you attend Trump rallies, do you belong to any specific groups, have you attended fundraisers, et cetera.

Astead, good morning to you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Just quickly if we could start with Trump's criminal trial, because, you know, it's going to start Monday. It will be the first time that a former U.S. president will go on a criminal trial, and he is going to have to be in court four days a week as the court is in session for up to eight weeks.

And so, frankly, they are going to use this as an opportunity to politicize and poison the water about the justice proceedings overall. And so, this case, I think, we should see as a proxy for him to make a political argument and a personal argument that he -- the justice system has been weaponized against him. And he is going to use the theatre of this trial to make that case day after day after day. And so, if there is a silver lining in Trump's kind of political and legal predicament right now, it's that this case is maybe a better setting than other ones to do that in.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has made a lot of noise about making speaker Johnson's life difficult. We have certainly seen the ability for a small wing of Republicans to complicate and obviously vacate the House -- speaker chair, taking back to McCarthy. But we haven't really seen people join those efforts. And so, I think Speaker Johnson is trying to proactively show a sense of support with Trump. The problem, as we know with Donald Trump is that he switches his opinions every day. And so, this is a lifeline for Johnson in the short term and can -- and show he has some political support elsewhere. If this comes down to a head and Speaker Johnson because it's no longer useful for Donald Trump, the evidence over years and years of seeing these relationships is that this is, you should not expect the former president to save him.",
