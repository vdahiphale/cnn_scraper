      "sentences": "We just got a pretty sizable update from the governor of Maryland on the collapsed bridge that is blocking the entry to the Port of Baltimore. He says the U.S. Navy is supplying four heavy lift cranes, bringing the total to seven over the coming weeks.Other equipment coming in, 10 tugboats, nine barges, eight salvage vessels, and five Coast Guard boats. One of the cranes is actually the largest on the East Coast. It can lift around 1,000 tons. To put it in perspective, just the portion of the bridge that is dangling from the cargo ship right now is about 3,000 to 4,000 tons. We have CNN's Brian Todd in Baltimore. And that really illustrates what an undertaking this is going to be in getting this bridge cleaned up. What more did the governor say, Brian?",

It's about 140 feet wide.I believe the weight is about 116,000 tons when it's fully loaded, and it is fully right now. And of course, that 3,000 to 4,000 tons of wreckage and steel on top of it makes this all the more daunting and dangerous. I also spoke to a mechanical engineer at Morgan State University, Dr. Oscar Barton. He said, look, they're going to have to first -- what they're doing right now is probably just surveying this. They've got to do a very meticulous survey of this site with the cranes and with the other equipment that they're bringing in. Then they've got to figure out which are the biggest chunks that they've got to remove first, and then they've got to figure out how to cut those chunks into smaller pieces. They're going to have welders doing that. Brianna, you just mentioned all the other assets they're bringing, and what Brianna said, I'll just reiterate it. Seven cranes, 10 tugboats, nine barges, eight salvage vessels, five Coast Guard boats, and that's not including all the personnel and others who they're bringing to bear here. This is also extremely dangerous work. It is extremely windy out here. It's very cold. The water is very choppy. The weather has really been kind of up and down all week since this happened. It's kind of a tempestuous time of year in which to engage in this kind of an operation, so the weather is not going to be all that helpful, at least in the next few weeks. So, Brianna, that's kind of what they're up against, and let's of course not forget, they are still trying to find what they presume are the bodies of four people still unaccounted for, presumed dead. There is a belief that maybe they could be trapped or encased in something beneath the surface, and that is going to be part of this operation as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna and Kristin, we had expected this notice of appeal, this interlocutory appeal to be filed by defense attorneys in this case, and now we're getting that. The attorney here in Georgia, the Georgia-based attorney Steve Sadow for the former president, has filed along with seven others, including the former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and the former lawyer for the president, Rudy Giuliani, asking the Georgia appellate court to review the decision made by Judge Scott McAfee and reconsider removing the entire Fulton County DA's team here. That's including Fulton County DA Fani Willis.We don't have a full screen for this statement just yet as we've got it, but I have it here in front of me, and this is what they're saying, in part saying: While the trial court factually found DA Willis's out-of-court statements were improper and defendants proved an apparent conflict of interest, the trial court erred as a matter of law by not requiring dismissal and DA Willis's disqualification. This legal error requires the court's immediate review. So again, they're asking the Georgia Court of Appeals to take up their appeal. We should expect the Fulton County District Attorney's Office to file their own legal motion saying why they believe that the Georgia Court of Appeals should not take this case. After the Court of Appeals gets both those statements, they'll have 45 days to decide what they're going to do. In the meantime, we're also hearing from the former attorney for the former president, and this is what he's saying, basically saying, that the Georgia Court of Appeals should grant this application and accept the interlocutory appeal for consideration on the merits. Again, this is breaking news just into CNN. We're reading through this filing and we'll get back more as we get more. Brianna and Kristin.",

Taylor, 10 years ago, just said, you know, I'm kind of moving on from country, and now she's sort of an everything artist. And Beyonce had been that, and now she's gone even farther.Because, I mean, like I said, there are some really weird moments. One of the songs toward the end, it's like, you know, I think the chorus is giddy up, giddy up, but there are all these hip-hop trap beats underneath it, and these sort of weird sound effects. So like she just is really refusing to be defined.",

And when they were released, only a fraction of the country radio stations in the country actually played them.So I'm curious, from your vantage point, how does this avoidance affect things like, you know, the top 100 charts? And do you think that stations are going to take the same tact with the rest of the album?",

There may be -- you know, there's a version of \"Jolene\" with altered lyrics on there, although that may be sacrilege in some quarters. But even though it's got Dolly's cosign literally on the album. But, you know, I sort of feel like she's made her point there.You know, and it's not really clear how much this is actually going to help other Black country artists, because what happens when someone does that, no matter how good their attentions are, you know, radio stations will be able to say, oh, yes, sure, we're playing a Black artist, we're playing a female artist, and point to Beyonce. Instead of, you know, the other Black country artists, especially female ones. But to be fair, in country radio, it's not just Black artists. I mean, female artists get shunned all the time as well. So, I mean, I feel like she sort of made her point there. But like, this album's for everybody. And what's really interesting is -- what I try to do with albums sometimes, especially long ones, is just to get a different take on it, I'll start it in the middle after I've listened to it in the proper order a couple of times. You start this one with track 15 or 16, it feels like a totally different album. It's really, really a remarkable piece of work.",
