Investigators are scouring the wreckage for clues, and we have new details on the crash and the 29 people who survived.Plus, a series of storms is creating some messy travel conditions for people out west, while on the East Coast, New Yorkers saw their first white Christmas Eve, at least in more than a decade. We have your holiday forecast. And tourists in Hawaii are flocking to see an amazing lava spectacle. But it has scientists warning about the emerging threat from so-called supervolcanoes. We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Hello and welcome to all our viewers on this Christmas Day. I'm Danny Freeman here in New York. We begin this hour with that breaking news of a deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan. Authorities say at least 38 people are dead after an Azerbaijanian airlines plane crashed and burst into flames earlier today. Stunningly, nearly half of those people on board, 29 people, survived, including two children. Eleven are currently in critical condition. And we have to warn you, this next video showing dazed survivors pulled from the wreckage may be disturbing for some to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in this video, right here, posted to social media, you can see the plane descending to the ground in what appears to be the moment of impact. CNN Aviation Analyst and former NTSB managing director Peter Goelz joins me now. First, Merry Christmas. Thank you for coming on this holiday to discuss this really scary event. Russia's aviation watchdog said that the preliminary information suggested the pilot had decided to make an emergency landing after a bird strike. You've seen the video now. What's your assessment?",

And one of the strongest steps towards surviving these kinds of accidents is the requirement that seats be able to withstand impact of 16 Gs. That means that you're in your seat, you have a terrible wreck like this, you're not being thrown out, and you have the chance to walk away. That's just extraordinary.

And there's a treaty of which Azerbaijan is a signator and so is the United States. This aircraft had GE engines on it. The investigator in charge from Azerbaijan could ask for U.S. involvement, and the U.S. could request involvement because of that fact.And the - there's a cooperative approach to these investigations. The NTSB has a specific designated person who handles international, you know, accidents. And I think the U.S. will be participating.",

You know, these internal fan blades are going at 18,000 revolutions per minute. And if they rupture, these can enter the fuselage and cause a depressurization, which could cause the mask to drop.",

So, it's all a panoply of things, a lot that got thrown in, in addition to that spending fight by the lame duck Congress in the last couple of weeks.

There are likely more commutations and pardons that will be considered in these last couple of weeks. There are also some things related to student debt that the President has been pretty focused on over the course of his term that he might still do.And then you think about things on the international front. The biggest thing that Joe Biden would like to accomplish before he leaves internationally is to try to figure out some kind of ceasefire hostage deal in the Israel-Gaza situation. But it's three weeks. It's the end of a presidency. Usually not a lot happens. But at this point, with the way the world is and the way the country is, a lot can happen.

CHAD MYERS, CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENTThis is a rain event for the Mississippi Valley, and they will take the rain. They are in the middle of a horrible drought across the lower Mississippi Valley. Let me take you ahead to really the next biggest travel day. That will be Sunday. This is the area of cloud cover that will invade Atlanta, D.C., New York just in time for air travel on Sunday. There will be a lot of snow in the west still, and Seattle is going to be slow the entire week. But here's the problem, here's Sunday morning with the cloud cover, low clouds and rain all the way from Atlanta all the way up to the East Coast. That is going to slow things down. Now, the snow could slow you down if you're driving across these mountain passes, but it won't slow you down across parts of the Sierra that have picked up feet and feet of snow with one storm after the other. The skiers out here in Tahoe all the way down to Mammoth just really enjoying this added snow, natural snow, because it's a whole lot better than skiing in that snow cone. Danny?",

You know, we need to go back to head office, essentially, to brief them on some of the asks and some of the back and forth.Once those negotiating teams reached the various sides, then Hamas, Israel, the Netanyahu government both have started responding with these angry retorts, accusing the other side of trying to move the goalposts. Now, in any negotiation like this, every time you think you've got one part sorted out, then sometimes another part opens up. In this case, some of the dismay has been over the hostages. The Israelis want all the injured hostages, including the young men who have been injured. The Hamas fighters consider the young men Israeli soldiers. Even if they're injured, they want to keep them until the last moment. Also, there is a question over, does Netanyahu want to keep open the option of returning to fighting after this exchange, this initial exchange. Whereas, Hamas is still holding on to a stop in Israeli military operations. If not, you know, if they've given up on ending the war, that phrase, but they're still trying to push for as much of a stop of Israeli military operations on the ground as they can get. So, it doesn't look like we're going to get a resolution, at least this week.",

They want to keep building on that. They were about to sign some sort of deal under the Biden administration with Saudi Arabia when the attacks of October 7th happened.So basically, what Netanyahu is hoping is that once the Trump administration is back in power, they will be more understanding of Netanyahu's complaints about the need for security. They will allow continued military operation in places like Gaza, parts of southern Syria, and that they will also reach out to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries and get some of these negotiations back on track. My doubt about that is the Arab and Muslim public is very angry over what they've been watching on TV coming out of Gaza, coming out of southern Lebanon and Syria, destruction wrought by Israeli forces. And I think that public opinion is going to make expansion of the Abraham Accords a little bit more difficult.",
