Ahead right here on CNN NEWSROOM.Beijing cracks down, China's government tries to crush large anti- lockdown protests which has spread right across the country. Plus, threats of torture, sources say the families of Iran's football team face violence or prison if players protests at the World Cup. And warnings of a critical humanitarian situation in Ukraine as millions struggle without power as winter sets in. The Chinese government appears to be pulling out all the stops to try and keep protesters off the streets. Police are out in full force in Beijing where crowds had gathered through the weekend venting their anger and frustration over strict COVID lockdowns, censorship, and the ruling Communist Party. Now, CNN has in fact verified protests in 15 cities with dozens of others reported. The Chinese foreign ministry says media accounts do not reflect what actually happened and the government's fight against COVID they say we'll be successful. But coronavirus cases are soaring, more than 38,000 infections now, new ones on Monday alone. That's the first day in nearly a week that didn't break a record. Now, the protests in Beijing's response have spooked financial markets on Wall Street, the Dow fell nearly 500 points or 1-1/2 percent. The Biden administration meantime stop short of criticizing China but said the U.S. supports the right to protest peacefully. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was more direct. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What exactly is going on in terms of tightening security there now? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Paula in the wake of the sweeping anti-zero COVID protests, China is tightening security. Police are now out on patrol in the streets of Shanghai and Beijing. And Shanghai authorities there have taken down barricades on Lamouchi (PH) road, which is a sight of those defiant protests over the weekend. And you're looking at video of this new barricades in place in Shanghai. CNN has also learned that protesters are being rounded up. In fact, one protester who is detained in Shanghai and later released tells CNN that around 80 to 110 protesters were taken in and detained by Shanghai police after the demonstration on Saturday. The protestor also told CNN that the police collected their biometric information, including their fingerprints, including their photos and retina scans. It's unclear how many remain detained. And on Monday, there were no signs of protests on either Beijing or in Shanghai, quite in stark contrast to this dramatic scenes that we saw at the weekend. People across China have had enough of this zero tolerance zero COVID policy which has up ended people's lives and livelihoods. The trigger of course, the deadly blazes in Urumqi which that took place and took people's lives because of a COVID 19 lockdown that got in the way of rescue efforts there. And CNN has now verified 20 COVID related protests have taken place in 15 cities across China and we have a map of that. Let's bring it up for you so you can see this. And to emphasize the sheer reach and scope of these protests, just want to quickly name the cities where these protests have verified by CNN taken place in Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hotan, in Korla, Langzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai in Taiyuan and Tianjinm in Urumqi, in Wuhan, and Xi'an as well. And there was also an extremely rare vigil of protests that took place last night here in Hong Kong, where dozens of protesters took to the streets in the central business district of Hong Kong bearing flowers to mark the victims of the blazes in Urumqi.

Thanks to their earlier win over Serbia, they're now guaranteed to qualify for the knockout round alongside the holders France. One of the games of the tournament played out elsewhere in group G. Serbia came from behind to take a 3-1 lead against Cameroon. Aleksandar Mitrovic seem to have given his side an unassailable advantage. But the indomitable Lions fought back with two goals in just four minutes. Vincent Aboubakar and then Jean-Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting secured a thrilling draw for Cameroon. They still have it all to do though, in order to stay in the tournament, Cameroon will have to beat the favorite Brazil and hope that the other game goes in their favor. If Switzerland avoid losing to Serbia, they're through. In group A, another thrilling game involving an African side Ghana threw away a 2-0 lead against South Korea. Weak lies (PH) with a thundering header from Cho Gue-sung, but the Black Stars weren't rattled, and kudos to Mohammed Kudus who secured a famous win for his team.

Because his former man new teammate Bruno Fernandes was credited with the score, and he later made the game safe with a penalty. So, Portugal also joined Brazil and France in the knockout round.

So the Russian forces are just across the river. But the risk is one that has to be taken. What can we do, Tatiana asks. We can't live without water. There's no electricity either. And people are cramming into makeshift charging stations like this one just to stay connected. We found defiance here, too, in the face of hardship.

There's obviously a lot of political capital invested in it.But the reality is that life here on the ground is under zero-COVID is not a pleasant experience. I said earlier this month in an op-ed for CNN, actually, that it's difficult here to plan even more than 20 minutes in advance. You never know if you're building is going to go on lockdown. You never know if your workplace is going to shut down. You never know if your health code's going to change color. And it really makes living life here difficult. It makes running a business here difficult. The economy is obviously suffering as a result of that. Youth unemployment is at, you know, roughly 20 percent, which is -- which is, you know, deeply concerning. I would hope that they start taking measures to kind of wind it back and we did see earlier this month that they did announce a relaxation of certain measures. The problem is that on the ground, we haven't seen those measures relaxed. So hopefully, you know, in the not-so-distant future, we see some movement on that.",

And they're seeing fans unmasked in the thousand show up in Qatar and, you know, celebrate. And that's not something that we're able to do here.

All three major indexes saw declines, with the Dow down close to 500 points. And Apple stock, it had a wobbly day due to possible disruptions to the company's supply chain, which has key parts in China. Broadly speaking, investors are trying to figure out if China will start to ease some of the restrictions as part of its zero-COVID policy or if it will double down on them. The impact of China extends beyond the markets, the price of oil has also seen a dip amid concern that demand will soften. Marc Stewart, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Two volcanoes erupting on the island at the same time.Now, one of them, Mauna Loa, is the world's largest active volcano, and it's erupting for the first time since 1984, making it the longest quiet period in its recorded history. Right now, the lava flow, thankfully, is not threatening any communities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. JOSH GREEN, HAWAII LT. GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR-ELECT: Because it's going through the Northeast rip zone, that is a better way for the lava to flow. It goes into a flatter area. The lava becomes quite viscous, and it tends to slow down before it gets anywhere near our people, which would be Hilo. Hilo is the largest town on the big island. And it's where my in-laws live. We just are getting a little nervous from time to time. It's at least a week away, and we're hopeful that it won't make it all the way to the top. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
