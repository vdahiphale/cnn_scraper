Calving is the answer here and a nice shelf in Antarctica just dropped a tremendous chip off the old ice block. An iceberg that`s 600 square miles broke off in Antarctica on Sunday. That`s the size of two New York cities or nearly the size of greater London. This type of calving was one of the most major events we`ve seen in Antarctica in a long time. It broke free from one of the most closely observed ice shelves. An ice shelf is a large floating sheet of ice permanently attached to a landmass. Scientists had previously discovered cracks in this particular one, but two major breaks occurred in the last two years. Researchers say this event was expected not the result of climate change and they`re going to continue to monitor its every move to ensure it`s safe. (MUSIC)",
