My e- mail shall we say is rich in criticism. It's not easy, and these are not just -- how do I put it? These are not antiseptic intellectual issues? These are emotional issues. These are personal issues. A lot is at stake.For someone like me who cares passionately about Israel, it's very hard to watch when I see Israel doing things that I really believe are counter, are contrary to its own self-interests. And yes, I worry about the antisemitism that it's provoking here in the United States, and I can say all that without admitting in many ways that the people who are out there in the marches, I don't like their agendas. A lot of them don't know the basics of this. When I hear them chanting from the river to the sea I want no part of their agenda. This is a hard argument to have in private. This is a really hard argument to sustain in public. That's why I think President Biden has had some problems with it, trying to be sympathetic to Israel, yet distancing himself from Israeli policy. He's been reluctant to confront Bibi Netanyahu. But what we've learned over the last, what, five, six months is gentle persuasion, isn't working. The United States needs to carve out an independent path and is at times going to have to -- if it wants to stop settlements or wants to prevent Israel from using force indiscriminately, the United States may have to think about limits on economic aid of sorts or military aid. It's an uncomfortable place to be, but I would argue that is where Israeli policy has brought us.",

Now, whether you can attack an authoritarian state, you know, many ISIS attacks are suicidal. This one, the four attackers seemed to have gotten away at least for a little while.

What is it I found that led me not just to put my own views in here or how many judges have interpreted the constitution but to do more than that, to say this is not a good way to go about it?First, I think in a lot of cases, it will lead to interpretations that are very different from what the legislature or the founders wanted. Remember when this document was written, 1788, 1787, 1789, or after the Civil War there were an awful lot of people who weren't represented in the political process. Women weren't there. Much of the time, slaves weren't there. And so, they are not being spoken for though these are ideals that should apply to them. They weren't part of it. And we're just going to look at that period? No, that's a big mistake. And if you look at law, biggest picture, biggest, it is an institution created by human beings, in large part, to allow human beings, in large part, to live together more peacefully and productively. All right? I've always thought that. And now if all you're looking at is words, when you have a statute, there's a risk you'll move away from that. And if you have the Constitution, there is a risk you will move away from those words that allow us to have that democratic society, the John Marshall and Madison and Hamilton and the others thought would last. OK? Now, if we move too far away, people will say, why should I do this? Well, if you would have -- if you have a system where people are not willing to follow opinions they disagree with, by and large, you will have a system that moves away from the rule of law.
