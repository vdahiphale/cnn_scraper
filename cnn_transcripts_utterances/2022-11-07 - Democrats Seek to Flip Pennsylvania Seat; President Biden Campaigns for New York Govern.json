The candidates now making their final pitches ahead of election day.Up for grabs, all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. The outcome of this election will determine who controls Congress. And while Democrats currently hold a slim majority, it remains unclear if they'll be able to hang onto power, especially in the House. That's where race ratings by Inside Elections shows Republicans appear to have the advantage heading into Tuesday. A party needs 218 seats to control the chamber, and with 20 seats rated as toss-up, Republicans would only need to win a few of those to take back control. But in the Senate, control still appears up for grabs. Of the 35 seats on the ballot, only three are considered toss-ups, and those key races in Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania may end up determining which party will lead the Senate. CNN's Athena Jones is live in Allentown, Pennsylvania. She joins me now. Good to see you, Athena. Now, one of those crucial races, where you are. John Fetterman, he was well ahead. He then had a stroke. Dr. Oz caught up. He has his own baggage. What are the trend lines you're seeing?",

Pennsylvania is, of course, Democrats' biggest opportunity to pick a Senate seat. Republican Senator Pat Toomey is retiring. That is why the seat is open. It is now one of the most expensive races in the country. Pennsylvania's also been one of the few states where we've seen a lot of President Biden. He was born in Scranton. He has visited the state some 20 times as of Saturday. And this is a state that he flipped from President Trump back in 2020. It was a close race then, and this is always a close state where you see a lot of activity and campaigning toward the end of each race. There's a challenging climate, of course, for Democrats, given all of the concerns of voters about the economy and inflation. And voters who disapprove of President Biden's performance. But the polls suggest the race is close, that Fetterman's a bit ahead. Here is some of the message we heard from John Fetterman and from Dr. Mehmet Oz on the campaign trail the last couple of days. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA), PENNSYLVANIA SENATORIAL NOMINEE: Dr. Oz wants to try to portray himself now a moderate after, you know, going very right, right right, far-right during the primary. Now he's trying to pretend that -- you know, there's no moderate -- no moderate if you're willing to share a stage with somebody like Doug Mastriano. MEHMET OZ (R), PENNSYLVANIA SENATORIAL NOMINEE: I'm not a politician. I'm a surgeon. And what surgeons do is tackle big problems. And we do it successfully -- in my case, fixing broken hearts -- by working with everybody, by making sure we unify people in the operating room. Not divide them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Talking about Kathy Hochul taking action on day one after that Dobbs decision to protect patients. But what was interesting was also to hear the president talk about this issue of democracy.
