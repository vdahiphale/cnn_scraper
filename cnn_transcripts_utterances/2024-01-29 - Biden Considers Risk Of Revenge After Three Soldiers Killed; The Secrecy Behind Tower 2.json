And in just a minute, a CNN exclusive, my interview with Bernard and Francine Moffett, the parents of 23-year-old service member killed in a brazen attack on an American military outpost in Jordan. Their daughter, Breonna was one of three Army reservists who were murdered inside of Tower 22 when a terrorist drone evaded U.S. air defenses. Now, the deaths are first reported -- the first reported American casualties since the October 7th Hamas rampage and it propelled Israel and Gaza into a brutal war. Now, tonight, the president faces the most solemn choice, how to respond to that attack by Iranian-backed militants and if that response requires putting more of America's sons and daughters in harm's way. The president must weigh the risk of what happens next against the anguish of three families in the middle of mourning. And joining me now is Francine and Bernard Moffett. Their daughter, Breonna, was just 23 years old. Mr. and Mrs. Moffett, thank you so much for coming on the show tonight and I just want to say I'm so, so very sorry for your loss. This is, I know, a really painful time for you. It's a devastating time for you and the families of the other service members, but, Francine, could you just tell us a little bit about your daughter, Breonna? What was she like? FRANCINE MOFFETT, MOTHER OF U.S. SOLDIER KILLED IN JORDAN ATTACK: Breonna was always an amazing person. She just light up a room whenever -- whenever she walks in. She was my firstborn. And she was always there for like everybody. BERNARD MOFFETT, FATHER OF U.S. SOLDIER KILLED IN JORDAN ATTACK: Yes, she was. F. MOFFETT: She loved her friends, she loved her family, and she was just so amazing, just so amazing.",

Because if that's the route that she wanted to take, I wanted her to do that, and she earned her service as she was always proud to be in the military.

He's the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. And here's what he said about the need to respond to those attacks against U.S. troops without, as we were just discussing, inflaming tensions in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): To date, we have not been able to push back some of these proxies. We will have to balance that with not having an expansion of the war in the region or potentially take down what has at least been announced on your network in terms of the potential deal over hostages. So, how you thread this needle is really important, but I think the President will do that, and we do need to send a much stronger response than what we've done to date. But I would remind some of those most strong voices right now that under President Trump, there were a couple of times that he got up the line. A matter of fact, there was one meeting where he said he was going to strike. He thought better of it and didn't take that kind of action that might have then launched us into a war with Iran. We've got those same conditions, but even potentially more so now because I think all of us would like to see this potential deal move forward with the exchange of hostages and potentially a pause in the conflict in Gaza. Anything that ratchets up the conflict overall in the region would very well have the possibility of unraveling that announced deal that still obviously got some more negotiations ago before it takes place.

Now, House Republicans are predictably falling in line with all of this, basically arguing that the deal isn't perfect and so therefore it's dead on arrival. In fact, some Oklahoma Republicans are said to be looking to censure James Langford for even taking part in these talks. And joining me now to discuss all of this is former Minnesota Senator and Host of the Al Franken Podcast Al Franken. So what do you make of this? Donald Trump, basically, as we like to say, saying the quiet part out loud, he's just telling everybody what the playbook is. Don't pass a border deal so that he can run on an out of control border.

And so, this trial is because he has no impulse control. I mean, he has less impulse control than my 17-year-old daughter, whose frontal lobe is not quite yet developed.
