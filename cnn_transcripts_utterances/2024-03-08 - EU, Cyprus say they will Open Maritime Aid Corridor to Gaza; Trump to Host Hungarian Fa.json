Israeli officials, for their part, though, are continuing to insist that they are not imposing restrictions on aid going into Gaza that they are that there is sufficient humanitarian aid going in even denying altogether that there is a humanitarian crisis unfolding on the ground. Of course, we know from accounts on the ground, from multiple humanitarian aid agencies from the United Nations that there is a crisis on the ground. Right now that not enough aid is getting in, in fact, only a quarter of all planned U.N. aid missions into Northern Gaza were actually approved by the Israeli military.

Donald Trump recently said it is nice to have a strong man running the country.The country he was referring to was Hungary and that strongman is its Far- Right Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Will today Trump will get to show his admiration in person who's the Mr. Orban at his Mar-a-Lago home. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach in Florida. Mr. Orban was not invited to meet with President Biden on this visit. So should we read that as a snub? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: There was no formal invitation from the White House, but also Viktor Orban did not reach out to them. We did not ask for a formal invitation or a formal sit down now, Donald Trump's team senior adviser telling me that this is a social meeting. And if you're wondering what that means, it means that this is a casual and this is their words friendly meeting with no agenda. Now obviously, if you are talking about someone like Viktor Orban and someone like Donald Trump and it is, hard, to believe that there is a meeting with no agenda, but there is particular significance here. You mentioned the fact that Donald Trump has routinely praised Viktor Orban. Well, it's a two way street. Viktor Orban has time after time adopted some of Donald Trump's language, praised and at one point even said the war in Ukraine wouldn't have happened if Donald Trump was still in the White House. That might sound familiar to you, because that is something that the former president has said himself. Now this trip does mean something because it's not just a former president, former president who is now the presumptive Republican nominee and could be president, again, when you look at that, it gives you an idea of where Donald Trump is likely to align himself if he is voted back into the White House. He has always had an affinity for authoritarian leaders, he has always praised them. As you noted, the actual full quote was this. It was some people don't like him. This is from Trump, because he is too strong. But it's nice to have a strong man in control of the country. He likes that kind of leadership. And this kind of meeting here gives you an idea of how he would again align himself on a world stage if he was elected back to the White House. Now, we don't expect any sort of pictures of them in terms of a video, but look to social media, we'll see if there's anything that presents itself as well as a possible read up as what the two talked about, Becky.",

Again, when I'm talking to Trump Senior Advisors, they are painting this as a friendly meeting with noagenda, they're certainly not going to tell me ahead of time that there is a plan to talk about Vladimir Putin or the Kremlin, or the war in Ukraine. However, they have both publicly said over and over again, that the war Ukraine wouldn't have happened if Donald Trump was still in office. It is a common talking point for both of them. So the likelihood of it coming up seems pretty high. However, again, they are really trying to downplay this as any sort of formal sit down between two leaders, Donald Trump, of course, not actually the leader of the country right now. They are trying to paint this more as just two people who admire each other having a conversation. But Becky, we of course will be on this. We will be talking to people who are in the room. We will be looking for that readout to see if this does in fact come out and if they share that with us, because we are also at a point here where Donald Trump doesn't have to share anything. He is not the President of the United States. He is not having a meeting in the White House that has certain restrictions and you meet with foreign leaders, certain obligations that you have, this is technically a private citizen. So he doesn't have to share anything whether or not they do is that it's possible, but we'll keep an eye out for that.",

Ethan Crumbley alone wentto his high school, November 30th 2021 and he carried the gun in his backpack. And around noon time when all the kids are out walking the halls, he comes out and he just starts shooting point blank range at some of them. It's just horrific what happened. And this is the first case in the country mother and father both charged with homicide saying the judge saying the law saying prosecutors say that there can be more than one cause of death. And maybe your son did it. But you know, what you're responsible to, because of what you did and what you didn't do, how you stored that gun? Plus and here's the thing, you have to know that your son could commit harm to others of foreseeability. So there's a two prong approach there, you let you keep the gun non-secured. But you also know that your son's got mental issues and he could harm somebody else. And that's the clincher right there. Because the question is how much did James Crumbley know of his son's mental health? Because he would do it at night at home in his room, he would write in his journal and the parents never looked at that journal of what he was plotting and what he was planning which then gives us another issue right? Do parents have a duty when they have a minor child to look at all of their electronic devices, look at their journal, see exactly what they're writing? So the case is just about to start today but one thing that happened yesterday and it's a mystery. All right, but I'll just very quickly in jail, there is no privacy in jail.

But it is a little bit more than what analysts expected they were expecting about 200,000 jobs added in February 275, 275,000 is the number in this report. It also pushes the unemployment rate up to 3.9 percent is you have more people who are unemployed, more people looking for work right now. But we're still below a 4 percent unemployment rate, something we have not seen really for this long since President Nixon was in office. Also the sectors that added jobs in February they're the sectors that we've seen consistent job growth, so you're talking about healthcare 67,000 jobs added there, government 52,000. And actually food and that should be food and drinking is 42,000 jobs added. Also worth noting people keep an eye on wages. This report reveals wage growth, wage growth cooling on an annual basis to 4.3 percent. So for everyday Americans they're thinking well wait a minute, I don't want to see less wages in my paycheck. But it's actually good news for the job of the Federal Reserve who doesn't want to see wages outpacing inflation as much as it has been here in the U.S. The Federal Reserve wants to see wage growth annual rates growth at about 3.5 percent. So still a little ways to go in the Federal Reserve's mind. But clearly, Americans are not going to be too happy about their wages going down on an annual basis. Also Becky just to mention last in January rather we saw an eye popping jobs report here in the U.S. We saw 353,000 jobs added in January. That number actually has been revised down to 229,000. So January's number December's number which were over 300,000 jobs added here in the U.S. actually coming in 167,000 jobs added fewer than expected between the two months. So we are in a good trend right now robust job growth over 200,000 not too concerning. This is something that President Biden is going to tout, it is something certainly that the Federal Reserve is going to be looking at closely as they look to possibly entertain interest rate cuts this year, which would be further good news for Americans hoping to have people take out mortgages, credit card loans, student loans. So a very strong report, a good report, a Goldilocks report, some might say 275,000 jobs added in the month of February, Becky.",
