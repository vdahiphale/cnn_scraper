He made no bones about worrying about whether this was going to be explosive, how people are going to respond once the video is released. But he said they have been in talks, and he said he saw something that he has never seen before happen in this community. Activists had gone to the presser and then they went over and marched to the district attorney's office and they demanded to speak with the district attorney. And they demanded charges be put forth.And instead of what has happened in the past where they would call the sheriff's department potential on the folks and try to remove them, he actually met with them. He said give me 10 minutes, and met with the community members who had been out and concerned about all of this, and concerned about what has been happening with the police department over years. And they didn't just meet one time. Clergy met with them, members of the activist community and the community met with them. And so they feel like they have been allowed to see some transparency here.

He said they were just talking about, it was Paul Murdaugh and Alex Murdaugh talking about a dog killing a chicken. There was nothing nefarious about it, nothing threatening about it.

It's great to have you. Thank you so much. So what do you think big picture here, yes, it's a dramatic shift for Germany, but in terms of what it tells us about whether the west really fears Putin at all anymore? FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\":  I think this is one of those cases where the official line actually is accurate, that it really is about the unity and resolve of the western powers. It really is extraordinary, if you think about it, if you compare this war with something like Iraq which half of Europe was in violent opposition to the United States' strategy, here you have basically the entire western world plus a lot of nonwestern countries that have banded together. And they are ratcheting up as the Russians ratchet up, because Putin has fundamentally decided he can't beat the Ukrainian army, so he will try to defeat the Ukrainian nation. Those air raid sirens you were talking about, this is indiscriminate bombing into civilian parts of the city. Kyiv, I was there in September. It is not a military city. It doesn't have huge military bases. He is just killing civilians. And so in order to do something to break what is, what appears to be a somewhat congealed stalemate on the frontlines, the western countries are trying to ask themselves how can they move forward. I think it's a remarkable display of the fact that you have, with all the problems created by Putin's invasion, oil prices, energy crisis, that the west is united.",
