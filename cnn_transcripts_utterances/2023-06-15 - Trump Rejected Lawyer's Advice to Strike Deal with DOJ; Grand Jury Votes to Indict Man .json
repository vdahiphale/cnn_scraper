CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.

Here's what \"The \"Post\" found that Trump's lawyer, Chris Kise, wanted to quietly reach out to the Justice Department and negotiate a settlement back in the Fall. This is, of course, after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August and found more than 100 classified documents.

So I do think if a good lawyer had gotten to Donald Trump early, and if Donald Trump was receptive to the advice, which is a whole separate question, and gone to Archives and said, Look, he has these documents. We're going to deal with you. We're going to show you all of them. You take what you need. We'll work this out.\" I think we absolutely would have avoided this indictment. But I do agree with you. When you get to last summer. We've had the subpoena. We have the search warrant. By then, I think DOJ would have appreciated an approach, but I'm not sure they would have accepted \"we'll just take the documents.\" I think at a certain point, you say, fine, OK.
