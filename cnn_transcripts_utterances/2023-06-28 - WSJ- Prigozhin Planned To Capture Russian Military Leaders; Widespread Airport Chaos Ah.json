So, there's contexts in history to the allegation or the supposition of the intelligence services that he was going to try to capture them.When Prigozhin went to Rostov-On-Don, that big Russian military headquarters with all his troops, he said that that evening -- at 9:00 p.m. that evening, Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister had fled Rostov-On-Don. We're learning other details from other Russian security chiefs, the-- Zolotov, the head of the National Guard said that they had got wind of Shoigu's -- Prigozhin's plans to challenge the authority -- challenge the state. They got wind of those plans that there was supposed to happen from the 22nd to the 25th of June, and they had this from leaks. Now, Western intelligence says that they had picked up that Prigozhin was about to do something by an increase of the level of communications between -- internally on Russia's state security services. So, this picture that's being painted that Prigozhin was not just putting -- was not just going to try to challenge the authority, he was actually going to capture and kidnap it appears, we don't know to do what with, with the Defense Minister and the Army Chief of Staff. It's quite a staggeringly brazen plot, but apparently, people in his camp leaked to the Russian government what was happening.",

And it was always speculation, leaning toward confirmation bias, internal military rumors about what was going on in the Russian military from different channels, Kremlin power plays. And you mix that all with the deception operations, the so-called maskirovka, that the Russians do all the time would always be confusing. But that is now on steroids because of the actions over the past weekend. You have the personalities of Shoigu, Putin, Prigozhin, Surovikin, as Nic just mentioned, Gersimov, that Chief of -- the equivalent of the chairman of Joints Staff. You also have another guy that hasn't been mentioned all that much, a guy named Zolotov, who's the Russian National Guard Commander who's a Kremlin insider, all throwing out these rumors of how bad things are. But I got to tell you, Boris. This is more of an understanding that the Russian military and their government is a proverbial nesting dolls of dysfunction. But it is gone on steroids right now in terms of all the craziness that's happening. And yes, Putin is weakened by all that.

They're still conducting shaping operations. That would probably give the Russian soldiers on the front line a little bit more pause and cause an even decreased morale on the front. Russian morale has not been very good since the beginning 16 months ago of this operation, this invasion, so it can only get worse. It can't get better.",

The remaining debris from the imploded tourist submarine brought back to shore by recovery teams. These pictures at the Canadian Coast Guard pier workers unloaded some pieces of metal panels, some of them quite large, some covered under tarps, all part of that recovery mission.CNN's Paula Newton has been in Ottawa covering this story. And, Paula, essentially, the pictures that we've seen so far, for instance, this one here that seems to be from the outer shell. What's not clear is do they have pictures of broken pieces of the pressure chamber itself. What do you know about exactly what they've been able to bring up from the ocean floor, and then where this goes from here? PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: You know, the best indication, Jim, are the pictures that you see there. And I'm sure there'll be some disquiet in those family and friends that lost the five passengers there on the Titan. But when you look at those pieces, Jim, those are much larger than the indication we were given at first from the U.S. Coast Guard when they did confirm that the Titan had a very violent implosion. You know, what you see distinctly is that dome and then the viewport, and then the back end in the tail. You raise a very good point. We do not know what else they have salvaged, though, but Pelagic, who was the research company from New York that operated that remote-operated vehicle at the depths did tell CNN and a statement that they've now concluded their offshore operations. What does that mean? As far as they're concerned after they had mapped out the debris field, they have brought up as much as they're going to bring up right now. And then moves over to the Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Coast Guard. Jim, the Transportation Safety Board here in Canada telling us, look, we are not making any further comments on this as this investigation continues. I want to point out that there may be perhaps a criminal investigation both in the United States and Canada. They will obviously be looking to see whether or not the debris will contribute to whether or not they pursue that path. But again, I think those pieces will shock many. Remember, it was more than two miles down that they had to go in return -- retrieve these. They were retrieved by this remote-operated vehicle and then robots. So, quite a task. And no doubt everything that you see there will help in this investigation. A reminder at issue --",

Not just the kind of pressure they faced, but also who was putting them under that pressure. But it's clear that there's been a flurry of activity and it looks like they could be nearing a charging decision.
