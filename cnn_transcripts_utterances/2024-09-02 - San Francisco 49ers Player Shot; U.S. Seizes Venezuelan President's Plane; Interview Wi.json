How does she respond to that if a question is asked, if given the opportunity to lead the country for four years, what would be different then versus what you're currently doing now to tackle inflation or immigration or foreign policy? So I can see that as a potential issue for her. I would imagine Donald Trump's team is preparing him to go after the vice president very hard on those three points, where he appears to still have an advantage.",

How does Donald Trump answer the fact, particularly on Labor Day, that he is perhaps the most anti-worker president in recent political memory? He's the one that has is going to have trouble answering questions. And, lastly, on the point of immigration, how does he answer for the fact that he personally torpedoed one of the most comprehensive, moderate, perhaps even conservative immigration bills in modern-day history?

How big of a moment is that going to be, do you think? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION\":  I think it's a big moment. And I think it's going to outline their -- show how they plan to use President Biden going forward. We know there -- yes, there were some weaknesses that caused Biden to decide to step aside, but he also did have some strengths, particularly when it came to his outreach to unions, particularly where it comes to kind of his home turf, which is the Scranton, Pennsylvanias, of the word, Pennsylvanias, in those blue-collar type places. And so I think tonight we will get to see, A, that show of unity with he and Harris sharing the stage, but, B, this is a great sweet spot for him on Labor Day. And I think the only variable, of course, is how well Biden is able to do when he's on the stage delivering his speeches. But he tends to do pretty well with teleprompters.

But, Shermichael, when you compare those numbers to what President Biden was polling against Donald Trump, what, I mean, maybe two months ago, it is a pretty dramatic turnaround for the Democrats. I just wonder, what are you and some of your fellow Republican strategists thinking when you look at these numbers right now as we're heading into this last stretch?",

Whoever heard you get indicted for interfering with the presidential election, where you have every right to do it,you get indicted and your poll numbers go up.\" I mean, from a political standpoint, I mean, obviously that presents some challenges.

Donald Trump has no respect for the Constitution, no respect for those who serve in uniform, and certainly no respect for our democracy.That should -- his poll numbers should not matter in the course of that conversation. But, you see, all he cares about is his own political future. So one day, he's interfering in an election. The next day, he's saying that those who receive a Medal of Honor should be looked down upon. And the day after that, his campaign is literally muscling their way onto Arlington Cemetery and filming a political commercial, rather than paying due justice and honor to those who made the greatest sacrifice. This man and his entire campaign only cares about themselves.",

George Clooney is praising President Biden to reporters in Italy over the weekend, saying -- quote -- \"The person who should be applauded is the president. He did the most selfless thing that anyone has done since George Washington.\"Tia, this is the first time we have heard George Clooney speak out about this since that op-ed he wrote calling on Biden to step aside. He is a big donor. And, as we were saying earlier, you can't really argue too much with Clooney's political acumen here. I mean, Kamala Harris is doing better right now than the president was doing against the former president, yes.",

He was -- he's being genuine now when he's saying he thinks Biden did a good thing by stepping aside. But I think it's also part of the delicate kind of repairing that all the Democrats and donors who behind the scenes were kind of working to push Biden aside or at least encouraging him to step aside. Now they have got to back up with Biden personally, as well as kind of continuing to signal that they are on one accord, despite kind of the divisions that were laid bare after that disastrous debate. So I think Clooney and many others have been very deliberative of when and how they have spoken since Biden stepped aside, being very deferential to him. And it'll be interesting to see if the -- we will probably find this out for years and years to come, but whether these personal relationships can be prepared, because we know George Clooney was campaigning and fund-raising for Biden...",

Of course, there have been some cooperation between the two countries in terms of a prisoner swap that we saw recently. But beyond that is a really tense relationship, and the Biden administration making it very clear that they are not going to hold back.
