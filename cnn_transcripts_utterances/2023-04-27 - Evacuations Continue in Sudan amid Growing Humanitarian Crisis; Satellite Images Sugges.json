Clashes today in and around the capital areundermining that truce and making the prospects of extending it uncertain. Plus, Wednesday the general leading Sudan's armed forces said he's open to an extension. The rival paramilitary, Rapid Support Forces, has not responded so far. Thousands more people are fleeing Sudan or trying to leave, while those who remain face what one U.N. official calls a humanitarian catastrophe. Our David McKenzie is following the developments for us and joins us now from Johannesburg. Good to have you with us, David.

Potentially in this case north of Crimea,it's taking forces out of the way of where it might think they could get caught up in that counteroffensive. Or it's deploying them to use to repel that counteroffensive. In the north of Crimea, the moving of that equipment perhaps indicates that they think the attack will come along the Ukrainian coast, that the Ukrainian forces would cross from Kherson, across the Dnipro River from west to east. East is currently controlled by the Russians and try to come along the coastline, essentially cut off that land bridge that connects Crimea, the Crimean Peninsula to the rest of Ukraine. Ukrainian officials, of course, are not giving any clues about where a counteroffensive might come or even when it might come. I think the sense that the defense minister is alluding to there, the atmosphere around it is overheating somewhat, I think that's the general feeling here of, it's not quite the right time yet maybe. The weather certainly is not playing its part. The country is still sort of receiving a huge amount of rain. We're seeing a lot of flooding here in the north and, in the south, it means many of the roads close to what might become more active front lines are bogged down in mud. I think the phrase that you'll hear Ukrainian officials refer to, less than calling it a counteroffensive, they will call it a spring-summer campaign. They're sort of playing away from this idea that there will be this huge, massive, sudden operation and then all done after a few weeks. They know they've got a big job to do. They want to make sure they have all the equipment, most importantly all the ammunition that they think they need, in hand before they launch this offensive. Even if they were ready, they're not going to say where or when. And I don't think the weather is playing its part, as I said.",
