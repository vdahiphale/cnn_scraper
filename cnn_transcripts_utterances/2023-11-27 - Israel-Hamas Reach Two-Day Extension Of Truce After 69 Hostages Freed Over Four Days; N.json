And even as they were making their journey back safely today, we learned that the four-day pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas would be extended by another two days and more hostages would be freed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Now in order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days. We would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: Again, 11 women and children got out today. You see them here, all taken from a single community kibbutz Nir Oz, 11 out of the 77 who were abducted from there on October 7th. That's according to a statement from the kibbutz. Seventy-seven men, women, and children, 11 free today, the youngest just three years old. Now of the 13 freed yesterday, 10 were from another kibbutz, Kfar Aza, which, like Nir Oz was also the site of a massacre by Hamas gunmen. Saturday, another 13 were released including Noam and Alma Or, 17 and 13 years old. Their father is still in captivity, their mother was murdered October 7th. And for so many of the children so far, that must be the worst part of it, learning that they've lost a parent or both parents, or in the case of every single child released today, learning that their fathers are still in captivity. In a moment, a woman who welcomed back six family members then had to tell them one by one that their father, uncle, grandfather, husband was dead. Let's go first to CNN's Oren Liebermann in Tel Aviv. Oren, what's the current status of the 11 hostages freed today? Where are they tonight?",

We actually saw the helicopters flying up from the Kerem Shalom Crossing where they came into Israel, flying right up the beach around where we're standing right now and towards the hospital behind us here.They went through initial medical checks when they first entered Israel. For the first time in more than seven weeks, they are now at the hospital where they will stay for as long as is needed. We've got some pictures from the hospital earlier showing the lengths they went to, to be ready for these hostages to come in where they will through more comprehensive medical checks and they will start to deal with their physical condition and their mental health condition as well -- John.",

Hamas indicated that as well.But over the course of the past four days, it very much looked like the agreement itself might fall apart. There was a tremendous diplomatic effort to hold it together, especially over the weekend to get it to this point. There was also internal pressure on the Israeli government now that hostages have started coming out of Gaza to keep that process going, to bring all of them home now. So there was the international pressure on both parties, Israel and Hamas to keep this pause going, especially because it allows humanitarian aid to go in. There was the domestic pressure at play as well, and the possibility was always there. It was the countries, as the mediators, and the US who helped it get over the line, to the point where we now have another 48-hour pause in fighting, 20 more Israeli women and children will be released over the course of the next two days, in addition to 60 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails.",

And from the very beginning, Israel's War Cabinet and others have said, this is still a war. Hamas has said that as well.The moment this pause in fighting is over, the war itself is back on in all of its intensity and all of its horror. Clearly, Hamas and Israel are preparing for those next steps, and Israel's Defense Minister laying out what that will look like. It is worth noting, John, that at the beginning of this agreement here, Israel put out 300 names that could be released. Palestinian women and children, essentially saying, Look, this is the list we could put out if you release enough Israelis. Israel's Prime Minister's Office added 50 women to that list earlier on this evening and that's an interesting dynamic, because they seem to be saying, look, we have more prisoners we could release here. If you keep releasing hostages. The tools are there. The question is, can the diplomatic effort get it to that point? Right now, we're only looking at the next 48 hours for a truce and for a pause in the fighting. Getting it past that may be difficult, but clearly, the international effort, the mediators are trying to make that happen. We'll see if they're able to here.",

Dr. Levine, first tell me what you've heard from the returning hostages and their families, those who aren't requiring urgent medical attention. How are they and what did they experience? DR. HAGAI LEVINE, HEAD OF THE MEDICAL TEAM FOR THE HOSTAGES AND MISSING FAMILIES FORUM: It depends. Of course, I'm extremely happy to be here in Israel with the families to be treated by multidisciplinary teams, like your show, 360 degrees of all aspects, psychological, medical, nutritional. They have many deficiencies. And you know, it's amazing how strong they are, and we learned from them amazing solidarity. We saw over the last seven weeks, amazing solidarity between the families.

He is a Russian national and his release yesterday came as part of a separate deal distinct from the Doha agreement between Moscow and Hamas. This deal that went through was just between Moscow and Hamas.More on that now from CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Roni Krivoi pictured in this Hamas video showing the exchange with the Red Cross. Krivoi is also a Russian citizen and his brother thanked the Russian government for making the release happen. RONI KRIVOI (through translator): We see what Russians can do. They helped us, and we believe that they can help others, too. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Roni Krivoi's aunt told Israeli media that he escaped his captors after the house he was kept in was bombed, but that he was apprehended by Hamas again after four days. His release now was not part of the larger prisoner swap agreement between Israel and Hamas. It happened thanks to Moscow's good relations with Hamas leadership, Russian officials say. His release was possible following direct, intensive contacts between our diplomats and Hamas representatives, Russia's ambassador to Israel says. After Hamas's October 7th assault on southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and leaving more than 200 in captivity inside Gaza, much of the world condemned Hamas, but not Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Instead, the Kremlin invited a high level Hamas delegation to Moscow for talks. And Putin has ripped into Israel over its military response to Hamas's raid, which has killed and wounded many people across the Gaza Strip. Putin even comparing his invasion of Ukraine to Hamas's war against Israel. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): I understand that this war with Ukraine, death of people, must be shocking. But what about the bloody state coup in Ukraine in 2014, which was followed by the war of the Kyiv regime against their own people in Donbas? Is it not shocking? What about the elimination of civilians in Palestine, in Gaza? PLEITGEN (voice-over): For its part, Hamas clearly views Moscow as an ally. Hamas leaders making clear Russian hostages captured on October 7th will get preferential treatment and have good chances of getting released faster. MOUSA ABU MARZOUK, CHIEF DEPUTY OF HAMAS'S POLITICAL BUREAU (through translator): This request from Russia, we treat more positively and attentively than others due to the nature of our relations with Russia.

That's long needed, and that is going to save lives. So we certainly hope that that continues.",

This is a group that was a huge part of your base during your presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020.

We were horrified by Hamas disgusting terrorist attack against Israel and the slaughter of 1300 innocent people. I think we're horrified by Israel's response, which as I mentioned before, has killed 12,000 people.And what the real worry is here, is that some 70 percent of those people are women and children. So I think there's -- people are just totally disgusted about what's going on. And one of the things that I have called for is to say, look, we are friends of Israel, but Israel cannot disregard international law. They cannot kill women and children indiscriminately. And if we're going to give them money, and they need money to defend themselves, what if we're going to give them money? Then they have got to obey international law, and that means, among other things an extended humanitarian pause. It means making sure that we address the crisis in the West Bank, not only in Gaza, where Israeli settlers are killing Palestinians and throwing them off their land. It means that we have to be thinking long term about what the final -- how do we solve this problem. And that is, in my view, a two-state solution, which Netanyahu's right-wing government has not been sympathetic to. But I think they've got to start thinking about that big time if they want American money.",

And then earlier this afternoon, her casket arrived here at the Carter Center, a center that she helped found, and she used to say that the center she hoped would bring people hope.
