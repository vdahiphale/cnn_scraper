Paula Hancocks for us in Seoul, thank you so much for that.China is defending the actions of a Chinese fighter jet that flew directly across the flight path of a U.S. spy plane in international air space over the South China Sea last week. The U.S. military denounced it as unnecessarily aggressive. But the Chinese foreign ministry said overnight that U.S. reconnaissance against China is provocative and dangerous and the root cause of the Chinese jet's maneuver. CNN's Oren Liebermann has more from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This latest encounter between the Chinese fighter yet at a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft happened on Friday over international waters in the South China Sea, according to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. That's when a Chinese fighter jet, a J-16, approached very close to U.S. RC-135 Rivet Joint. That's the type of reconnaissance aircraft. And U.S. Indo Pacific Command, INDOPACOM, for short, put out video of this intercept, this encounter, from inside the cockpit of the U.S. aircraft. You can see the Chinese fighter jet off to the right, that it cuts or slices in front of the U.S. aircraft and you see shaking inside that U.S. aircraft. According to Indo-Pacific Command, that is when the wake turbulence of the Chinese fighter jet disturbed the flight path of the U.S. aircraft in what the U.S. is calling an unnecessarily aggressive maneuver to carry out this intercept. The U.S. goes to great lengths to point out it happened in international air space in the South China Sea. This is not the first time we've seen this sort of aggressive behavior from Chinese aircraft. We saw something very similar back in December. That's when a Chinese navy fighter jet, a J-11, came within 20 feet of the nose of another RC-135 Rivet Joint, according to the Indo Pacific Command, forcing a larger, heavier U.S. aircraft with some 30 people on board to carry out evasive maneuvers before the two got too close. The U.S. sees this as a pattern of more aggressive behavior coming from Chinese aircraft. It is worth noting the broader context in which this is all happening with a tremendous amount of tension between Beijing and Washington. In fact, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is in the Indo-Pacific Region right now, in a couple of days about to attend what's known as a Shangri-la dialogue, a meeting of some of the important countries in the region, including the U.S. and China. U.S. had been trying to set up a meeting between Austin and his Chinese counterpart, the minister of national defense, Li Shangfu, but the Chinese after essentially not getting back to the U.S. for a while rejected the offer of a meeting and that gets at the broader tension between China and the U.S., between Beijing and Washington right now. It is worth noting that President Joe Biden said earlier in May that he said he would eventually meet President Xi Jinping of China, but it's worth asking how, where, when and under what conditions such a meeting might be possible.

Then that Saturday morning, Bowers armed herself several handguns, an AR-15, and a shotgun, and drove to the synagogue. The prosecution said Bowers then methodically went through the synagogue, and hunted Jewish worshippers, sometimes shooting victims at such close range they had singe marks on the rifle that killed them. Ninety-seven-year-old Rose Mallinger was shot through the head while hiding behind a pew. Her daughter hid from Bowers under her body.
