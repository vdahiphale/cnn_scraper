The IDF already did release this video that we're showing you right here of soldiers delivering incubators and other medical supplies to the hospital today, they say. Now, CNN has geolocated the video, however, is not on the ground and cannot independently confirm what it shows. Also, right now, Egypt, getting involved. Egyptian officials are working, trying to spearhead and coordinate an effort to transfer 36 newborn babies in the neonatal unit out of the hospital to facilities in -- somewhere safer. But those talks, we are told, are reportedly going very slowly. CNN's Ed Lavandera, he's got more on all of this. Ed, what is the very latest that you're picking up of what's happening with the raid and what's happening with this hospital and these patients? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we are waiting to hear these crucial details from the Israeli Defense Force, this what has been described as concrete evidence of Hamas command-and- control structure and operations that exist, as Israeli military officials have been saying for weeks that it believes that the Hamas organization runs in large part in these areas underneath especially this particular hospital, the Al Shifa Hospital, which is the largest in Gaza and a very significant stronghold there inside of Gaza City. As you can see from the map that we have showed you, it's a large complex, a lot to it as well. And that is where about, almost 18 hours ago, Israeli forces went into those -- that hospital ground. We have spoken with a Palestinian journalist inside the hospital who describes that there has been intense fighting in there as well. But Israeli Defense Force officials say they deny that there has been exchange of gunfire inside the hospital. They said that there was some initial exchange of gunfire as they approached with the fighters outside of the hospital areas. This is what they had to say about that particular issue just a little while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, SPOKESMAN, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES:  There was fire exchange before we went into the hospital. We engaged with the enemy before we entered. And since we were in the hospital, there was no engagement whatsoever inside the hospital at this moment with the patients or anyone else. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so things like that are being brought up by members of Congress because of the concern that the border is porous, at the number of people coming across, and the ability of the Homeland Security Department and other departments to actually vet these people before they're allowed in. So that's the focus of a lot of the questions from Republicans. Obviously, this is a bit of a hostile bit of questioning, especially for Secretary Mayorkas, who some Republicans are -- have been trying to impeach for the last few weeks, John. Obviously, this is going to be a tough hearing for some of the members there on that panel.

The FBI has been seeing this significant increase in threats since October 7, is what he reported to Congress, and that a big chunk of that has been against the Jewish community.

The Israeli forces are inside the Al Shifa Hospital. They have said, look, we have found -- and just in the last hour, we have found, evidence that Hamas was operating from here, and they're going to reveal that, they say, evidence.

It believes there's a command center under there. And for the information war, it believes it has to show actual evidence to back up what it's claimed, what the White House has backed them up on. And they probably won't reach the Arab world, the Global South. People will say this is just planted information. But for key Western nations who are still backing them, whether it's Britain or France or Germany, they need to be able to show all these civilian casualties, as horrible as they are, were because we were being attacked from this location.

There was a text thread going on, or there is a text thread going on between the district attorney's office and current and former defense attorneys attached to this, and they were trying to figure out this week who leaked those videos, those proffer videos from those that have taken plea deals already in this case. And in an apparent admission and in a bizarre e-mail, Harrison Floyd's attorney, Todd Harding, said it was Harrison Floyd's team that leaked this e-mail. Then, in a subsequent e-mail, they called that admission a typo. All of it was bizarre enough for the district attorney's office to ask for this emergency hearing to try to seal materials. You would think that this would all have been taken care of by now. And, in September, the DA's office did file a motion asking for the judge to seal discovery materials in this case. But that motion just sat there. The judge never ruled on it. The DA never followed up on it. And it left the door open to leaks happening in this case. So bottom line is, even if Harrison Floyd's team did leak this video -- they're denying that, by the way -- they didn't break any law. But it's created enough of a headache here that the district attorney's office wants the judge to make a ruling on this today. That hearing will happen at 1:30. Meanwhile, all of this is happening while we're getting some new predictions from the district attorney in Fulton County, Fani Willis, who says that a trial for Donald Trump in Georgia, she predicts, will be under way during the 2024 presidential election and will take months, likely wrapping up in early 2025 -- Sara.",
