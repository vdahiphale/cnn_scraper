He had a bandage on his ear. He looked at times softer, almost as though he was going to cry. I spoke to a number of aides and allies, supporters, all of whom had not seen him yet, and they were shocked at what they saw. They believed that this was almost scary and also, again, incredibly emotional. There were a lot of tears in the audience here, people who felt like this was a patriotic moment. One of the things that we had heard from a number of people he had spoken to that Donald Trump himself has said over and over again that he feels he is lucky to be alive, that he believes there was some sort of divine intervention. And talking to the people in the crowd here tonight, they think they saw that in his face. A number of them saying they think he is now a changed man. Now, what we do know is that Donald Trump himself has been focusing on this concept of unity when he is talking to, again, aides, allies, supporters. But whether or not that holds, that, of course, is going to be the big question moving forward. Donald Trump has not really been one to focus on unity. There have been brief moments of this in the past. But right now, we are told that he scrapped his entire speech that he had written or at least had an idea of in his head before that shooting took place. And now he wants to focus on unity. And that was also really what we saw a lot of in the speeches today. Maybe not necessarily a big focus on the concept of unity, but really staying away from the more violent rhetoric that we have heard in months past, weeks past from a lot of these Republicans who were on the stage tonight. Now, of course, we don't know if this is going to be the only time we see the former president before he takes the stage again on Thursday. I know that he has been eager to be interacting with supporters and allies. And that was very clear here tonight, because at one point there was the question of whether or not Donald Trump would actually come yesterday to Milwaukee. But he did show up here. So very interesting to see how the rest of the week plays out. Of course, the big news again coming out of today was, one, the first time we're seeing him in public. And two, his announcement of Ohio Senator J.D. Vance to be his running mate. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So it seems to me that that gives a pass to Democrats who've been comparing the authoritarian Trump to the Third Reich. I'm not saying that that's accurate. It probably is extreme.But the fact that Trump's own running mate actually said that, as far as what he adds to the ticket, it's a generational contrast. He's 39. He would be the third youngest vice president in American history. And oddly enough, the very same age that Richard Nixon was when President Eisenhower, then General Eisenhower, chose him for the ticket in 1952. He doesn't have much experience, but that isn't important to Trump. He ran without ever having been in public office and got elected president. So a year and a half in the Senate, a bestseller, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" Yale Law School, a stint in the Marines, and there you have your nominee. I don't know that it brings much beyond that, because J.D. Vance is from Ohio, and Ohio is guaranteed Republican. It's now solidly Republican.

And that's what Democrats are really worried about.Right now, Biden would lose almost all the swing states, including the three absolutely has to have: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. So that's really what the Democrats are focusing on. And you're absolutely correct, Rosemary. They really still want for Biden to step aside. But he shows no sign of going. I think the question on a lot of people's minds, including mine, is are the Democratic pollsters and officials who aren't in that tight inner circle, are they really sharing the data, the unvarnished data, which are very depressing with President Biden, or are they sugarcoating it? I wish we had the answer to that -- to that question, because it really does matter. By the way, if Biden slips further behind, which he could after a very positive Republican convention, and there hasn't been polling since the assassination attempt against Trump. If Biden falls substantially behind Trump, this movement to get rid of Biden, to move him out of the ticket will only grow in intensity.",

And at that event, he said, look, I'm not for pulling out of NATO, but what I must be very, very clear with European leaders is that the United States really needs to and tends to pivot more towards Asia.And I think that's really seen, at least in these early stages, before perhaps more nuance gets added to that view, that this pick is really reinforcing concerns about a more isolationist United States. Of course, much of that will be up for discussion. President Biden has sort of built his alliance, building out NATO, building up support from European countries for that pivot to Asia, for greater presence, greater strength from these countries in the Pacific. So you can imagine a conversation in the future where European leaders will say, well, OK, you want to pivot more towards Asia, but if you actually need our support there, then that may come at a cost of our interests here in Europe.

And so therefore it violated the Constitution based upon the separation of powers. And it was an interference with the power of the courts to regulate certain things. It was a power grab by the Supreme Court. And she just carried it the next step on here in favor of former President Trump.",

It has four counts that include conspiracy and three others.In that particular instance, Judge Chutkan has already entered an order denying this same motion. I don't see her changing her mind. Judge Cannon's opinion and her ruling holds no precedential value whatsoever to any other court. It doesn't have to be obeyed by anybody even within the Southern District of Florida. It's her opinion and her opinion alone. There have been circuit opinions, those are appellate court opinions, that have in fact upheld the appointment of special prosecutor. And in fact, the Supreme Court has allowed the special prosecutor to appear several times in front of them. Resultantly, they have basically approved of the appointment and the standing and jurisdiction of Mr. Smith to represent the United States of America in this litigation.
