Plus, the CEO of a top luxury real estate firm says tonight the Trump can't sell his properties fast enough to pay half a billion dollars by Monday. She's my guest tonight. And banned. He once served as the ambassador to Russia under Trump. And tonight Russia says he is no longer welcome there. Ambassador John Sullivan is with me tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT this evening, the breaking news, Trump appealing to a man he placed on the Supreme Court in an effort to end the cases again him. And who is that? Well, that person is Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And in this 67-page filing of filed by Trump's team today, the former president's legal team digging deep into Brett Kavanaugh's past to make their case as to why Trump should not be charged with trying to overturn the 2020 election. And as they go through this, they point to several statements made by Kavanaugh, including this one. And they quote, a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president. Trump's team also going way back in time, going to a Georgia law article that Kavanaugh wrote in which he says, and quoting again, prosecution or non-prosecution of a president is in short, inevitably, an unavoidably a political act. Well, a political act. That, of course, echoes what Trump has been saying since the start of the investigation is that all of this is court cases are political and election interference in their own right. And Trumps filing today is his last ditch attempt to do two things. One, of course, is to delay the special counsel's election case altogether and two is actually to take a step back actually avoid being charged entirely for trying to overturn the 2020 election. And on that point, Trump's legal team says, quote, if immunity is not recognized, every future president will be forced to grapple with the prospect of possibly being criminally prosecuted after leaving office every time he or she makes a politically controversial decision. That would be the end of the presidency as we know it. Now, that argument was unanimously, of course, rejected by a federal appeals court. So just to be very clear here, what you're looking at in these 67 pages is Trumps last chance to make that case, and to end these cases. Katelyn Polantz is OUTFRONT live in Washington to begin our coverage tonight. And, Katelyn, what else stands out to you in this new filing by team Trump?",

      "sentences": "Well, Erin, we've had a lot of court filings over the course of this investigation about presidential immunity. But the language here is really aimed at scaring justices on the Supreme Court who want to protect the presidency and executive power, executive authority.Some of the language Trump uses, he talks about post-office trauma that presidents might experience if they could be prosecuted for committing crimes while they are in office. The he also talks about the de facto black mail and extortion that they could face while in office. He also writes, it could be the end of the presidency as we know it. That is a very stark phrasing of this threat that Trump's team perceives if there isn't some sort of immunity around the presidency. The other thing that stood out to me is that in one of these arguments over this 60 some page brief filing to the Supreme Court, Trump's team says, motive shouldn't matter. And its unfair to Trump if there's immunity for the presidency, but it falls away in a case like this, where Trump or others, could be accused of trying to hold onto power because they were trying to break a lot to stay in power. Here's the direct quote. The court should reject the D.C. circuit's alternative approach of denying a president criminal immunity when his conduct is allegedly motivated by the desire to remain in power lawfully. This approach risks creating the appearance of a gerrymandered ruling tailored to deprive only President Trump of immunity while leaving all other presidents untouched. So they're saying that even if a president is breaking the law to keep hold of that office, that is not a reason why there should not be a protection around the presidency. And thus, Trumps should be protected here as well. [19:05:06]",

Thanks, Erin. It's great -- great to be with you. Yeah. This has been a longstanding problem that the Russians, through their proxy organizations like the Wagner Group, have been working, do ingratiate themselves into these countries it undermines the United States counter-terrorism mission.
