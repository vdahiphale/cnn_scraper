And coming up this hour, newdevelopments in the case of Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, he's been released to the custody of the Supreme Court. Khan was dramatically arrested on Tuesday by paramilitary troops on charges of corruption and arrests the court has now deemed illegal. Ukraine is getting new weapons multiple sources telling CNN that Britain has delivered the Storm Shadow cruise missiles it promised which can reach deep into Russian held territory in Eastern Ukraine. These are the first longer range weapons to be provided to Kyiv. It is a third day of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say at least 26 people have been killed in Gaza since the strikes began including women and children. The strikes have killed two high level Islamic Jihad commanders today. Israel says militants have fired more than 540 rockets towards Israel since the recent flare up in violence began. The U.S. is bracing for tens of thousands of migrants to cross the Mexican border starting a few hours from now. That's when Title 42 of COVID era public health refused to quickly expel migrants has now expired. Right now we begin with new developments from Pakistan. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been released into the custody of Pakistan Supreme Court earlier the country's top court ruled that his arrest on corruption charges was illegal. But Khan won't be allowed to return to his residence in Islamabad due to security concerns. The order comes two days after Khan's arrest sparked nationwide violence, which has left at least eight people dead. CNN's Producer Sophia Saifi is live for us from Islamabad, what is the latest?",

He's been taken by his own personal security personnel to the police compound where he was already being kept. He's going to be staying at a guesthouse there. Overnight he's allowed 10 guests who can come and visit him even stay over into tomorrow. Tomorrow, he's been asked to appear before the lower court, Islamabad high court for a fresh hearing. And we'll have more details on that as that happens into Friday. Now, the Army has been called in to the country after the very violent protests that took place across Pakistan over the past two days. The Army has been called in to make sure that the law and order situation is calm and secure by the federal government and by various provincial governments. This does mean that there is a state of high security across the country. There weren't any protests across Pakistan today. There was some day early in the morning but none after that. Pakistan is still ongoing with the Pakistani government has imposed an internet blackout in the country. There's no way to really have any communication when you're out of your Wi- Fi zone. There isn't any data on mobiles. WhatsApp is down. Facebook is down. Twitter is down. YouTube, Instagram is sketchy. The Amnesty International has come out and condemned this continual blackout of communication within the country. There's still a complete state of unease. Pakistan needs stability. It's going through a severe economic crisis. Imran Khan is a very popular politician. The military has had a strong hold across all institutions within this country. And what we've seen over the past two days are striking images of protesters of Khan Supporters' coming out and actually attacking military installments homes of military officers. The Pakistani military took out a statement last night in which they said that they will have zero tolerance for any attack on military installations. And Pakistan's Prime Minister has called Imran Khan Supporters terrorists. Pakistan's Information Minister just before Khan was brought into court this afternoon, very explicitly said that the judges are favoring Imran Khan. And she said that if Imran Khan is released, then the country will continue to burn. Now we're just going to have to wait to see how this plays out as a sense of calm we're hoping it prevails, Eleni.",

But I see the Supreme Court decision as a step to lower the tensions in the country that have gone over the past three days. And tomorrow Imran Khan will be taken I would say he wouldn't go to this -- High Court rather, he would be taken to Islamabad High Court which will determine whether he remains in the custody or he's set free. So this is an evolving situation. And we'll have to watch out. I think they events of the past three days have left a lot for everyone to reflect upon the government, the military, and the political parties. This anger that we saw and was targeted at the military has been building up over decades now I would say not just past year, although people were afraid of expressing themselves. But what Imran Khan did over the past year or so was that he gave voice to those sentiments and broke those shackles of fear and people are now expressing themselves. Beyond that the other problem that the -- why we see such intense and ferocious protests across the country is the economic pain that the people have been suffering.

And as a colleague in Islamabad just said this that Marriyum Aurangzeb the Information Minister said that, you know, these protests or disturbances could continue if you release Imran Khan. So that is the defiance that the government is showing. I'm afraid that even if Imran Khan is released, the government will come up with procedural impediments to his release. They may book him in some other case. They may arrest him in some other case. I don't see Imran Khan being released unless there is explicit order by the Supreme Court. The government would not go to the extent of putting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's job at the stake, but they will try to defy it into the hills that are what I see in Pakistan. The problem right now, yes just to clarify the situation for the international audience.

The British Defense Secretary calls the donation Kyiv's best chance to defend them against Russia's continued brutality. It comes as Ukrainian forces prepare for a long awaited counter offensive in the south and east. And Ukraine's President has said his country needs a bit more time before launching that counter offensive though, as it awaits delivery of more military aid from the west.

With much shorter range surface to surface missiles like the High Mars is indeed, one of the reasons you alluded to there as to why they haven't been given longer range missiles. But this is a very important step change indeed, in terms of NATO nation supporting Ukrainian effort with its really very top end most sophisticated cruise missile technology. This is a strategic weapon. It's not a nuclear weapon, but it is a weapon that will be able to reach deep into Russian held territory inside Ukraine and go after no doubt the logistics infrastructure that supports and underpins the Russian offensive effort. And if they can be put to good use, they will be very, very useful indeed to the Ukrainians come the summer offensive or the summer offensive has been much warranted.

Some of these individuals have been sleeping on the streets of Brownsville. And in the case that you're looking at here, they're waiting on hope and news for their loved ones. Some of them had been separated after they crossed the border. That's why you see a handful of mostly Venezuelan migrant men hoping that those that come off the bus are among their wives and children. You know, there have been really sing about 800 to 1000 migrants per day to --team Brownsville, which is right across the street. It's a really well- oiled machine here. The migrants are dropped off here into the care of the city, they're processed, and then they're processed or brought right over to this non-profit organization that helps them with basic goods basic needs. I was talking to the mayor last night; I was in touch with the mayor's office. And they told me they're as prepared as they can be for the end of Title 42. They reminded me that they've been on the front lines of this immigration issue for decades. And they say it's not clear yet whether or not Title 42, although it's expected to bring a lot of people it's not clear if that will happen. And it's interesting because when I when I talk to team Brownsville here, they seem to think that they're already in the middle of it and have been for the last two weeks, they're not certain that they're going to see the increase that everyone has been talking about. And they're sort of downplaying it much like we're hearing from the border patrol chief. The city of Brownsville has declared a state of emergency to free up resources to try to make sure that they have enough money for shelter space for these migrants as I mentioned just panning around here. There's so many on the streets here of Brownsville because they really don't have any place to go. Some of them do have enough money to get on to their next destination. So the bus station is right across the street. They get on Greyhound and they go on to places like Chicago or San Antonio, but the city is also going to help them out get to those places. And I was talking to the spokesman of the city of Brownsville and he says that they're coordinating with airlines and buses to buy tickets for these migrants to get them to places that they need to go.

We've alsoseen what the one of the priority items is to figure out the refugee situation where Turkey has been feeling that it's the dumping ground for the European Union. You've been talking about ways to help get Syrian refugees back into Syria now that Syria has been accepted back into the Arab League. I mean, there are so many changes on that front.

And that is still on the agenda of the next government. The issue here is we have to resume the accession talks. And what is important is the process itself, because we know that Turkey has already a democratic deficit. And for several years now, Turkey has been criticized because of this democratic deficit. And that's the reason why the primary focus of the next government will be the re-establishment and re-institution of the rule of law, separation of powers. And we are also aiming to transform the existing regime, which is the presidential system into a strengthened parliamentary system. Now all these of course, domestic developments will simply change the perception about Turkey in the European Union. And we believe that this will also allow us to look at the Turkish membership bit and the Turkish accession talks again, favorably from the Brussels point of view that is the reason why we will certainly focus on that. And as far as the migration issue is concerned, I have the impression that we will probably review the existing agreement between Turkey and European Union, because it is a problem, which is bothering both sides, not only Turkey, but also the European Union. And if the European Union is going to develop a common migration policy, I think it has to be coordinated with Turkey, because Turkey is not only a destination country, but also a transit country. And that's the reason why we have to work together to find the solution to the migration problem around our neighborhood.",

It is the democratization of the country, because in the last 20 years, a growing authoritarianism has been the main problem in the politics in Turkey. And the confrontation between those forces who are favoring democracy against those forces who are actually favoring authoritarian regime is the main paradigm in Turkey. And all these parties of the six, the six parties of the National Alliance got together because they want to turn the existing system into a parliamentary system which will bring back democracy and which will bring all kinds of fundamental rights and freedoms including, of course, the freedom of the media, freedom of expression, that is what is uniting us. Of course, individual political parties may have differences of opinion on many issues.
