I mean we have seen some hints here and there. We know what witnesses are going in. And then suddenly, we have a Grand Jury that's meeting in Florida that has been meeting and has been taking testimony from multiple witnesses in recent weeks and we believe additional witnesses are scheduled to go down there.The question is why after using a Grand Jury or using Grand Juries here in Washington for several months to do this investigation again on the documents and on January 6th, why are they using one in Miami, which is the southern district of Florida, which is where Palm Beach is located. It's where Mar-a-Lago is located. Multiple explanations could occur to us, but one of them could be simply that they believe that there's a charge that they are considering to bring that may be more appropriately brought in that venue versus one here in D.C. So that, again, could be the simple explanation. KING: One of Trump's former attorneys, Tim Parlatore suggested the same thing, that Jack Smith is looking at this. They are getting close to decision point and thinking about how might we be challenged if we brought this charge against this person, and a venue thing. Is that the most likely explanation? Or do you something else here?",

And so, there's arguments with respect to the classified documents investigation that that could be here because documents were packed here, sent down, but also the physical search was executed at the Mar-a-Lago residence. And so, the retention of the classified documents was to down there.Another potential explanation that I have been thinking about is that there could be secondary cases --",

And if those interviews and those secondary types of cases, more took place down in Florida, then the southern district of Florida would be the more logical place to bring those types of secondary cases.",

We certainly wish the Pope the best.Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Saudi Arabia. Last night, he met with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for nearly two hours. That high-profile meeting comes amid a new strain in relations. The Saudis plan to slash oil outputs starting next month, likely leading to higher gas prices for Americans. And it comes as the Saudis are also central to blockbuster sports news. The Saudi LIV Golf organization is forging a controversial partnership with the PGA Tour. The PGA Tour in exchange is dropping its fight against LIV Golf. What it gets, a major investment of Saudi money. 9/11 families are among those voicing outrage at what they see as sports washing. A regime trying to buy legitimacy despite his history of human rights abuses and refusal to fully cooperate with September 11th investigations and lawsuits. Count Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut among the dismayed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

Then real politic took hold. You see the Secretary of State there. What are the big national security questions at the moment?

We've had to surge assets to the region to deal with the Iranian threat, which is growing. Their embolden-ness is growing. And we have leaked documents showing that Iran and Russia and Syria are coordinating to go after U.S. troops there. So we have major problems in the region. And this show isn't long enough to tick them down. But I also want to separate off the price of oil, which is of separate issue and based on Saudi domestic financial needs frankly.",
