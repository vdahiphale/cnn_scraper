Tonight, public health officials are sounding the alarm over RFK Jr.'s anti vaccine activism and other very provocative views after Trump vowed to let him, quote, go wild on health policy.Also breaking, pressure is building right now for the House of Representatives to release its ethics report on Matt Gaetz as the now former congressman faces a very tough confirmation fight to be Trump's attorney general. The Ethics Committee set to meet tomorrow as the fallout over Gaetz picks up very, very dramatically. Plus, new reporting that Trump's close ally, Elon Musk, met with Iran's ambassador to the United Nations about diffusing tensions in the next administration. We'll discuss this breaking story as Musk's influence is escalating dramatically. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And we begin this hour with the breaking news, President-elect Trump causing a firestorm for a third straight night by announcing a norm- defying cabinet pick. Tonight, it's Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a member of the Democratic political dynasty, turned Trump loyalist, tapped to lead Health and Human Services. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach, Florida, near Mar-a-Lago for us. Kristen, what more can you tell us about this pick that Trump announced just a short while ago?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, one of the most interesting things about choosing RFK Jr. is Donald Trump is following through on something that he said he would do, which was essentially give RFK a big role in the administration and have him oversee health.Now, one thing to make clear, there was a lot of speculation that RFK would not be given an actual formal cabinet role because this role would have to be approved by Congress. And there's a lot of controversy around RFK, particularly when it comes to some of his different stances on health. One of them being that he has said that vaccines cause autism, something that there are no studies that say that is definitively true. And it needs to be said that there was a lot of speculation that because he couldn't get through Congress, he'd be given more of like an oversight role, some kind of umbrella role where he would look -- manage the health -- manage the various health departments, but not actually be in of HHS. Now, when I talk to his advisors, they say that they understand that he might not get confirmed, but that they're putting it all out there, because Donald Trump feels emboldened, given the fact that he won the popular vote, to follow through on a mandate, to follow through with what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail. RFK Jr. was a big part of Donald Trump's campaign. He was with him, by his side, after he dropped out, after he endorsed Trump, really, the last week of the campaign, they really believed that he helped Donald Trump with a number of different groups, including suburban women, including independent voters that were critical to Donald Trump's win. So, Donald Trump putting it out there, we'll see what happens when it actually goes through the process.",

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think a lot of it does have to do with what Brian was talking about in vaccines specifically. He's talked in the past about COVID specifically being bioengineered to attack certain demographics of populations. But when it comes to vaccines and his, you know, continuously talking about the connection between vaccines and autism, for example. I think that's what probably gets the most attention. He's sometimes tough to pin down, Wolf, because he'll say one thing at one time and then say something else or say that he didn't say that. He has said in the past that there is no vaccines at all that are safe and effective. And then he said, there are some that are probably a good idea.

And to some extent, yes, he has every right to nominate who he wants, but it is also the constitutional duty of the Senate when unqualified and extreme picks are put forth to knock those down.And, look, someone like a Matt Gaetz for attorney general, someone who's been accused of having sex with a minor and was investigated by the Department of Justice, the department that he would then be leading for sex trafficking, that is someone that should immediately not even be considered.

Kennedy Jr., to serve as Health and Human Services secretary. For more on that, I want to bring in Dr. Ashish Jha. He's the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and a former Biden White House COVID coordinator. Dr. Jha, thanks so much for joining us.As you know, Trump has chosen this vaccine skeptic with no real medical or public health credentials to lead the nation's health policy. What's your reaction? DR. ASHISH JHA, DEAN, BROWN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Yes, well, first of all, thanks for having me back. I think this is an extraordinarily bad choice and it's not because of his lack of experience. A lot of HHS secretaries have not had health experience. Look, there is a reason why this nomination really puts the health of the American people at risk. Obviously, we know about his vaccine views, but the HHS secretary oversees Medicare, will determine what is covered and not through the program for seniors, that all seniors live under it. It oversees Medicaid that covers nearly half the kids in America. So, this is a very big job. And the way that previous secretaries have managed it in the Trump administration, Biden administration, others, is to let the scientists in those agencies make those determinations. RFK Jr. has given us all the signals that he does not plan to do that. He does not plan to lean on evidence and rigorous analysis to make decisions, but instead use his own ideas, which sound good on a bumper sticker, but really are not the policies we need in this country.",

The problem is that most of the ideas he has been eschewing or espousing, not all of them, but most of them, fail that test. His ideas on vaccines, certainly the way he talks about raw milk, the way he's talked about fluoride, but just a whole host of things that somehow this virus, SARS COV2, was created to spare Jewish people, like just really off the wall ideas that are not based on evidence-based science.And so I don't have a lot of faith that he will carry out that idea.

And it has definitely been one of the reasons we've seen the obesity epidemic.I would love to see concrete policy ideas on how we're going to reform those things. General vagueness like we're going to clean up corruption doesn't move the ball forward. He's talked about additives. My question is, how are you going to determine which additives are safe? Which ones are not? You need to use a scientific, rigorous process. If he's willing to do those things, I think we should all be open to hearing those ideas out. So far, his track record suggests that he's not going to use rigorous analysis to make these decisions. And that's what puts people's lives at risk.",

These three picks are truly as bad as you could imagine. If you were actively trying to do harm to the country, to destroy the country these are the kinds of people if not the people you would pick. And I'm going to say something here just to you know we're only n days into this we got four more years to go potentially here, I've spent the last years talking about Donald Trump's psychological makeup, that he is a narcissistic sociopath a malignant narcissist and that those characters, and you've heard me say this multiple times are inherently destructive. And I've talked to a lot -- I've written a lot about it. I've talked to a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists over the years. There's one additional thing about this kind of character and I learned this from a very prominent, Harvard trained psychiatrist here in D.C. five years ago, People like Trump, malignant narcissists, actually do subconsciously or consciously seek to destroy. And one of the things about people like Trump and a lot of humans generally is they like to accuse people of what they themselves are trying to do. You've heard it said about Trump many times every accusation is a confession. Well, that's what's going on here. Deep down, he's a destructive force. Deep down, he wants to destroy.
