It's either the subway or online classes. And the city doesn't believe that will change soon. They're building bunker schools because children here wouldn't even have enough time to get to an air raid shelter, the mayor tells me. \"The S-300 missiles reach Kharkiv in about 35 to 40 seconds,\" he says. \"Therefore, no air alarm can work and the only way out is to build such underground facilities, real underground schools.\" Back at the subway school, every day a minute of silence for those killed by Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine.

Since Trump became clearly MAGA in the 2017, 2018, you know Congress, Republicans have struggled terribly in elections.We had a great election in 2018. We had a great election in 2020. We unseated an incumbent president and won the Senate, which is hard to do in our system. And then, something very unusual has happened. And in our system, when the party -- the party in power always loses seats when they're -- when they have the presidency. They lose congressional seats. They lose Senate seats. They lose state legislative chambers all across the country. And in the last two years, the exact opposite has happened. Something historic. We've defied history. We had an extraordinary midterm where we actually gained a Senate seat. We gained governorships. We gained state legislative chambers all across the country. And then, in 2023, we actually did better than we did in 2022. And we won in places like Ohio and Wisconsin that are difficult places for Democrats to win. And so, since Dobbs -- and it's my view that something really broke inside the Republican Party in the spring of 2022. And that since Dobbs happened, the decision to end Roe v Wade there's been a basic fundamental dynamic in our politics that's played out again and again in election after election, which is that Democrats are overperforming expectations and polls and Republicans are underperforming.

Second is he committed massive financial fraud, which is about to be, you know, finalized here. Third is that he led an insurrection and he's promised now to end American democracy for all time.

Trump is not definitively ahead. I mean, if you -- just in the last 10 days, there have been four major national polls showing Biden actually gaining significantly. In three of them, he's actually substantially ahead. So, the way I view it is we're looking at a close competitive election today, which is not surprising, because one party is having a real primary, the other party -- our party, isn't really having a real primary. It's not surprising that Republican voters are showing up more in the polling. That there's more intensity for Republicans in the polling, which is, I think, making the polling a little bit more Republican than it would be -- than it will be in let's say three or four months when Democratic voters recognize that it's going to be Trump and Biden, and it's going to be time to engage. Joe Biden has a very strong argument to make for reelection. The country is clearly better off than when he came to office.

Their party is broke and out of money. They're having enormous issues with the operations of the party. He's getting crushed in the courts right now. And so, I think this is a sign of desperation because the biggest challenge the Republicans have right now is that all their major talking points against Joe Biden, the economy was terrible, that's not true. Inflation is too high, that's no longer true. Crime is rising, that's not true. He's waged a war on energy, that's not true, right?
