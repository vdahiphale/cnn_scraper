We're tracking hurricane Idalia that's expected to make landfall along Florida's Big Bend coast in the next few hours with life threatening storm surge of 12 to 16 feet, that's high enough to reach the second floor of an average building.Idalia is now officially a category two storm with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles an hour. But it's forecast to reach category four by landfall, which would mean winds potentially more than 130 miles per hour, extremely warm water in the Gulf of Mexico has helped fuel the storm. Its outer bands have been lashing Western Florida with heavy rain, causing coastal flooding in some areas. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is urging everyone in evacuation zones to leave as soon as possible. But for some, it may already be too late. DeSantis says first responders will not be able to get to people in hard hit areas like the Big Bend until after the storm has passed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R) FLORIDA: This is going to be something that will that will leave significant impacts and particularly in this part of the state. You really got to go back to the late 1800s to find a storm of this magnitude that will enter where this one looks like it's going to enter tomorrow. So, we don't really have a historical analog in anybody's memory. So it's likely to cause a lot of damage. And that's just the reality. So be prepared for that.",

This one came in we were fully expecting this to be category three. It's not. It's still category two is one mile an hour different than being a category three.110 miles per hour moving towards the north, at 16 miles per hour. What got our attention is that it's moving at 16 miles an hour. It is slowed down. That is not good news. We've watched this going from just being a mass of thunderstorms to having a clearly defined eye. And the more clearly we can see that eye the more it tells us it is ramping up. It's becoming a mature hurricane. It's now positioned just about 115 miles to the south of Cedar Key. It is on task to move into that Big Bend area. Where will it make landfall? Meaning where will the eye cross land? Well, as we all know, it's just not that one point, is this entire area because this hurricane is so broad. It is still impacting Tampa. It's still impacting Naples, Florida, and Coral Gables, Florida with heavy rainfall. There's a tornado watch until 6:00 for this west coast of the peninsula of Florida, and rightfully so here you can see some of the bands filling in right around this hurricane that are producing some of those bands that produce some tornadic activity or are capable of doing that. Here is the center of Hurricane Idalia. And now we're looking at that push of water not coming right now getting the rain bands, but as we see that storm surge, now the inclusion is 12 to 16 feet in these very low lying areas. Cedar Key has about a five foot elevation. Even for Tallahassee, Apalachicola. These are very low lying areas. The Big Bend area is not heavily populated, like a Tampa, like Naples, Florida, or Gainesville. This is a very rural area but people still have livelihoods. They have businesses. They want to protect those things. This has been hard for people to recognize this could be a category for when it makes landfall later on this morning. Omar, back to you.",

Just about five minutes ago, the rain had slightly led up but as you can see now it is coming down in sheets and the wind is whipping around. The trees behind me you can see how quickly they are moving. The wind here is strong and the rain when it starts to fall. It really there is a lot of water that is moving in this storm.Now the hurricane is continuing to gather strength and speed as it moves towards the coast of Florida on the western part, as the weather team was describing there. We are expecting that conditions here are going to continue to worsen by the hour. We are in Clearwater Beach. This is a part of Pinellas County, and there's a mandatory evacuation zone for this area. Now Omar, I just want to give you a lay of the land here. Directly in front of us is the ocean is about a half a mile before you get to the water. It's a pitch dark that way, which is where why we're not showing you. But here behind me is land, it's inland and that is the direction where people were headed. In earlier today I spoke to a man who lives in the area who told me he was not going to evacuate. He told me he was going to ride it out at home. But he said he was comfortable doing so because he lives in this direction away from that ocean. So we've been talking about the possibility of storm surge all night. And that is what we are worried about here as the storm continues to move in. And the storm surge comes in that is where we may see a lot of the damage, a lot of potential for property loss and possibly loss of lives because that water can be so dangerous and catastrophic when it moves in, it comes in really fast and there's nowhere to go. So in the next several hours, we're going to be looking to see if any of that water starts coming in our direction. Anywhere from four to seven feet is what we are expecting to see here in terms of the storm surge. In terms of if we travel a little bit up north, that's where the storm is expected to make landfall and have a direct hit in the area of Cedar Key just about is what we are expecting. That is about two hours north of here. But as you can see, conditions here are worsening. And we are certainly feeling the strength of this hurricane as it approaches the western coast of Florida.

I know you said that one man you spoke to did decide to stay because he felt he was safer further inland. Did you -- have you gotten a sense from people in that area that they are actually heeding the warnings from officials and not just for the folks that live inland but for the folks that live right along the water?

That's right in the hurricane's path, and it's a little bit further north than where we were just speaking to our reporter Gloria Pazmino.

Sustained winds, and it's going to slowly creep up from there to up to the 80s and 90s. And stay there for a good few hours. And that's where we get really concerned because that's when we can no longer start answering emergency calls and going out on the roads.So we'll have to stay in shoulder in place. And we have to take emergency calls and just triage from there our most critical to the least critical and once the storm moves out and out of our path, and we can actually start getting our trucks back on the road, we're going to have we know a large influx of calls. So that's number one. Our main concern followed then by the storm surge just going to follow as the other storm moves closer on the land and hits our coastal communities. So that's the two biggest things where we're really stressing right now about and making sure we're just ready to get boots on the ground as soon as we can once the storm moves on.",

The closest we've ever came to a storm surge like that on our coastal communities was back with Hermine and we got maybe four foot, five foot in some places and we're low laying in our communities down on the coast of Swanee and Horseshoe and Gina, and back during Hermine forefoot was devastating. We had a lot of major damage to residents and commercial structures.So, for us with a storm surge of a potential of 16 foot is just total, you know, catastrophe and devastation and there's no way people that stay down there it can survive that unless they get the elevated ground above that. And so we're really concerned what we will find in the morning once it moves on for those that we've got word that did not evacuate. And we do have someone that we know is down there that was just adamant they didn't want to, you know, evacuate. And when we talk about storm surge we're talking about on a normal dry ground where tide (ph) is at its normal. You're standing there looking out on the gulf and then you can add 15 or now 16 foot potentially to that of water. And you got to think that's moving with winds pushing and waves on top of that.

This is an area where there is a mandatory evacuation zone. But I want to show you this residential tower that is right here behind me. I spoke to a couple earlier this morning who was walking around the area here. They told me they live in this tower and that they were going to ride out the storm here. You can see a lot of the apartments are dark, but some of the apartments still have the lights on. The power is still on in this area, but that may go out as the hours go on and the storm continues to increase and conditions continue to worsen. So, that is going to be something we are going to be watching for here in addition to the storm surge. That is the primary area of concern here. Anywhere from 4 to 7 feet of water is what is expected in this area. The ocean is in this direction. If it starts to move inland, all of this residential and hotel property is going to be in the way, and that is catastrophic levels of water as mentioned, likely to create a lot of damage and potential loss of life, Omar.",

Then it turned into a Category 1 hurricane. Even though it skirted the farthest western point of Cuba we still felt heavy rains here in Havana. At this point there are still hundreds of thousands of people across the western portion of the island that are without power. Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes and, of course, returning to homes that have been under water that have their roads blocked by heavy flooding, where there are power lines, where there are trees down. That will take some time. The Cuban government says they are beginning the process of restoring power to this province that was the hardest-hit in the west, province of Pinar del Rio. But of course this is an area that is still recovering from last year's devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. So now they have this new hurricane damage on top of what they suffered last year. And of course this is an island with a lack of resources and even though this is not as strong a storm that Floridians are facing, much stronger hurricane is heading and expected to soon hit Florida.

Actually, yesterday morning, as the storm was approaching.And now, with it still -- with the eyewall south of our county, the water is being sucked out of Kings Bay. It is being sucked out of (INAUDIBLE) and everything out into the Gulf, and it's feeding this very intense storm that will continue to rapidly intensify as it moves northward towards ultimate landfall, where it's going to become a Category 4 hurricane in a matter of a few hours before the sun comes up, later this morning. And we have got about 2,000 folks on the Zone A evacuation zone for us and a good number of them did board up their homes, take their boats out of the water, and go to inland areas to get away from the storm surge. But when the stormwater comes back in after the hurricane passes through our north, and all of that southwest water gets pushed up into our bay, folks are going to run out of places to go, and run as fast as they can to get out of the storm surge that's going to be coming racing in like a Nascar race in a matter of a couple of hours.",
