Sources tell us that Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis is expected to seek indictments against more than a dozen people when she presents her case before a grand jury. That's going to happen next week.CNN's Nick Valencia joins us live from Atlanta. Nick, 12 people, potentially -- a huge number. What do we know?",

And look, this is more than just about Trump's infamous phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger after Trump lost Georgia in 2020, in which he asked Raffensperger to find more votes. This is about a  pressure campaign from Trump operatives on Georgia lawmakers, Fulton County election workers. This is about an effort to subvert the Electoral College by a slate of fake electors that tried to claim that Trump won Georgia when really, it was Biden that won. And this is about the illegal accessing of voting systems in the Trump-friendly rural county here in Georgia of Coffee County. This investigation, since it started over a year ago, has taken a lot of twists and turns but there seems to be multiple indications that it's nearing its end. Sources familiar with the matter tell us that Fani Willis, the D.A. here leading the investigation, plans to present her case to the grand jury sometime next week. That presentation could take up to two days -- Victor, Poppy.",

So this is their big fundraiser for the state party where Trump was the speaker. That, itself, was a kind of sign, right? And this was supposed to be a competitive primary. You're supposed to kind of see all the different have -- kind of representation there among the party faithful. This was all Trump. And so the event had been kind of organized around him and it was really a kind of group of people who were there to encourage him against these indictments. And so, you not only have the indictments really rallying people to his cause; they were actually seeing that as a reason that it would help him secure back the White House. Now, Trump kind of does his thing -- the thing that we expect in each of these speeches. But when you talk to people after they kind of know this -- that this is a more reserved Donald Trump, you know, in the kind of Donald Trump scale, of course. But they're saying, like, that he's not necessarily coming at things in the same way. He did actually mention the 2020 election and kind of claims it was a stolen election. He's only focusing his energy on attacking those D.A.s in the kind of forward-looking nature and so the folks are rallying around him because of that. But they're also noticing a kind of candidate who is not having necessarily as much fun as Donald Trump used to be on the trail. I think that is the reason why we've seen this political and legal strategy completely bend. It is increasingly clear to those -- increasingly merge -- it's increasingly clear to the people around Donald Trump that his route back to the White House is paramount for him to even -- to subvert these legal charges. It might be the only way he gets away with that.",

And the counterargument there is Walt Nauta is actually not charged in any of the document counts. He's only charged with obstruction.And so, I think prosecutors, rightly, are saying why does he need to see it? If there's some specific reason why seeing these documents relating to war plans, relating to national security -- if there's some reason that would impact Walt Nauta's defense on obstruction charges I think I would say, as a prosecutor, tell us how that connects.
