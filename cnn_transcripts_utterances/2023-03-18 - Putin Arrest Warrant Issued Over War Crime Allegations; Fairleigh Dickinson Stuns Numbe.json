But the point is, is that these were done forcibly often and separating in some cases, mothers from their children. Now, President Zelenskyy spoke about the scale of these alleged atrocities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is a historic decision that will lead to historic responsibility. More than 16,000 cases of forced deportation of Ukrainian children by the occupier have already been recorded. But the real full number of deportees may be much higher.

They say they're, number one, not a member of the court, and that it's essentially all political. And domestically, Russia and Putin are depicting this as saving children, bringing them out of a war zone and bringing them to Russia. But what in reality is going on is that these children are being turned into little Russians. They are Ukrainian children, who are whose language is now being changed. And their, you know, filiation, their country is being changed, and sometimes taken from parents who don't know where they are. So these are definitely war crimes. But I'd have to say, you know, Russia, and President Putin pretty much doubles down on anything when confronted.

China has been playing really a balancing act, because it would like to support Russia. But on the other hand, if it does support Russia, it creates huge difficulties with the United States, with sanctions, et cetera. And so they're not willing, at least to this point, to give up the markets in the United States and in Europe for Russia's economy, which is faltering at this point. So there's a lot of balancing going on. That peace deal that is a proposal that Xi Jinping brings, it's a 12- point plan is very, very vague, it probably is going nowhere. So, you know, I'm sure we'll hear words from him about peace, but there won't be much substance behind that. It's really they're talking about economics, Russia needs, the high tech products that China creates right now, because the sanctions are cutting off high priced, high tech products from other places, especially in the West.

And I doubt that you can encapsulate this in a punitive or lateral and criminal approach.The problem at Silicon Valley Bank and other banks has not just been mismanagement is being poor supervision. And I think the supervisory failure, frankly, of the Federal Reserve is pretty much the central piece of what we're talking about, so that's something I say with a heavy heart, I used to say, of the Fed as a very credible supervisor.

The really big question is why is it that the Fed was able to lets Silicon Valley Bank triple its balance sheet in two years, has this enviable business model and not take action? And this is a more difficult, more painful question. So said to its credit has reacted it has asked its Vice Chairman Michael Barr, to come up with a post mortem and a report to understand what happened and such will be published in early May.

You can't have several accounts for example in a household, but not beyond. So if you have, say, $300 million as some depositors had at Silicon Valley Bank, you cannot have the guarantee, the public guarantee of that big a deposit.So ordinary Americans, normal people don't have that much money in the bank, they don't have to monitor their bank. But the idea is that large depositors, corporate accounts and very wealthy individuals, they should be careful in which bank they put their money, and that contributes to market discipline and that makes the system more stable. The decision that was made last Sunday, is to basically get rid of that limit. Deposits are unlimited, are insured to unlimited levels, and that's of course, being done just for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. But of course, it will be done also for First Republic if necessary, and frankly, for any other bank going forward. So --",
