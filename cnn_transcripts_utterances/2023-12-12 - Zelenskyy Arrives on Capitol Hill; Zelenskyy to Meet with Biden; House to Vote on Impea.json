They say that those were proposals that the Republicans are pushing would harken back to the Trump immigration policies. So, the partisan divide over that issue, which has been going on for some time, for decades, if you will, Congress unable to deal with immigration, could go into next year.But what does that mean for the future of Ukraine? That is what the stakes that Volodymyr Zelenskyy will lay out behind closed doors in this meeting. I heard a round of applause from senators as he walked in, but does that changed Republicans' approach? Very unlikely at this moment. He's expected to meet until about the 10:00 a.m. hour, then go across the Capitol, meet with Speaker Johnson, that private meeting.

After the meetings on Capitol Hill this morning, Zelenskyy will be here for one-on-one meetings with President Biden, as well as a news conference with reporters.But it really comes at a time when the White House has been warning that there is no backup plan if the $60 billion in aid for Ukraine is not passed. This morning, National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby said it's a dire situation for Ukraine if the U.S. does not offer this further assistance. Now, both Zelenskyy and President Biden have warned that inaction on this front is simply playing into Vladimir Putin's hands. Officials believe Putin is watching all of this very closely in Congress as he is plotting -- also plotting his next steps in this war against Russia. But it really presents a very critical moment for both President Zelenskyy and President Biden. Zelenskyy, of course, needs to get more aid, supplies into his country as they are continuing their counteroffensive against Russia. And then for President Biden, he has staked so much of his arguments around the war this Ukraine, about trying to maintain western unity in the face of Russia's aggression. The president has also portrayed this as a national security interest for the United States, but also trying to send a message to other would-be aggressors about any actions that they might be considering. But at this moment, even as Zelenskyy is expected to make that appeal to Congress, is expected to be here at the White House with President Biden, as Manu outlined, the chances of that aid passing before the end of the year really appear to be slim right now.",

And after what they described as extensive deliberations, Harvard officials decided the latter. They're going to stand by Claudine Gay. They put out this statement pledging their unanimous support, calling her, quote, \"the right leader to help our community heal.\"But the statement from The Harvard Corporation did offer some criticism, including how Harvard responded to the Hamas terror attacks, saying, quote, \"the university's initial statement should have been an immediate, direct, and unequivocal condemnation. Calls for genocide are despicable and contrary to fundamental human values.\" And the statement did note that Gay has apologized for her testimony and committed to redoubling the fight against anti-Semitism. Now, this will come as a huge relief to the Harvard faculty, who spoke up -- hundreds of them in the last 36 hours spoke out in support of Gay. Clearly a lot of Harvard professors, they did not want what they saw as outsiders meddling in their internal affairs. I did already hear from Harvard Professor Jason Furman, who's a former top Obama economic official, and he told me that he's glad that The Harvard Corporation made its own decision here instead of, quote, \"outsourcing it to others,\" although Furman said he does hope that officials press Claudine Gay to move forward in a better way. Now, this, of course, is not going to silence Claudine Gay's critics. Billionaire donor and Harvard alum, Bill Ackman, and he already posted last night on social media his displeasure for this decision before the decision was even announced. We also heard last hour from New York Democratic Congressman Daniel Goldman on CNN saying that he is disappointed by this decision, and he's still calling for significant change. And, by the way, Sara, a conservative non-profit group told me that they still plan to send four mobile billboard trucks to Claudine Gay's home today and tomorrow demanding that she resign.

That was a big get for him.This is a state that the DeSantis team has gone all in on. They think it's a really good state for him with a lot of evangelical voters that they've been courting. And you can imagine that's who he will be talking to tonight. New Hampshire, of course, is a state that Nikki Haley has been very focused on. She and Chris Christie have their eyes on that state as a place that can really catapult them and give them even more momentum as we move through this primary season. But the fact remains, John, and you have seen this as polling comes out and in the important state-by-state polling. And we got new polling from \"The Des Moines Register\" just yesterday giving us a snapshot of where the voters are here. And in that poll you can see that the former president leads with 51 percent. It is a commanding lead that he has held onto for the entirety of this primary season up until this point. And then you see DeSantis at 19, Nikki Haley at 16. So, DeSantis here in Iowa, a state that has meant so much to him and his campaign, is kind of fighting a two-front war, right, against the former president as the frontrunner and then in this fight for this second place against Nikki Haley. So, we have seen him sharpening his attacks against both of those rivals in the past few days. Most pointedly on X. We actually saw -- the former president had said that he -- someone had told him that he was braver than those that serve on the battlefield by debating Hillary Clinton in 2016. And so DeSantis was responding to that and he said in part, \"debating isn't brave, it's the bare minimum any candidate should do. Hiding from debates, on the other hand, is an example of cowardice.\" So pretty direct words there. One thing to watch tonight, John, is just how sharply he does go after Trump and Haley. Trump in particular, because DeSantis has really tried to pitch himself to voters as essentially former President Trump but without the baggage. Someone that can, in his words, get the job done without kind of everything else and the chaos that follows the former president. But in doing so, you can't alienate those people who have voted for the former president likely in the last two elections. So, he is going to be talking to people in this room.

The reality is that Republican voters continue to rally around Donald Trump with each successive indictment, any sort of crowd out the rest of the field.

And so getting Sununu's endorsement is helpful.But, Kate, again, run it through the table.

That's a big dynamic.The second biggest fact, I think, candidly, is the third-party candidates. Donald Trump's support is so polarizing that there -- some people will never leave him. The people who I think were reluctant Republicans who chose Joe Biden in 2020, if they have other avenues, because there's more candidate on the ticket and they go there, I think that hurts Joe Biden significantly.
