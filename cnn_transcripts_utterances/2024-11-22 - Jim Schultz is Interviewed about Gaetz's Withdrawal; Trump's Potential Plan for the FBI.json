I mean we're kind of glossing straight over the fact that he seems to want to just fire Christopher Wray. What does that part mean? MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, yes, I think that's where you have to start because traditionally the Justice Department and the FBI have been independent from the president, and Donald Trump has made it clear that he doesn't believe in that and that he wants to end that arrangement. And he feels that he has a mandate to do that and to clean house. I mean, I think, to Brad's point earlier, the question is, does he want the DOJ to be neutral, to take away what he believes has been the bias and the weaponization against conservatives, or does he want to weaponize it in the other direction because he has said a lot about that, too. He has said a lot about wanting to go after his own political enemies, wanting to seek vengeance and retribution. So, is he going to - and so if he's going to put in someone like a Kash Patel, that would certainly be an indication that he does want to - that his problem is not with the weaponization of the Justice Department, his problem was with the direction of that weaponization and he just - and he wants to turn it against his enemies, against - instead of it being, as he sees it, turned against his friends.",

You know, I mean, when Obama came in, he brought Eric Holder in as his attorney general, who said he was his wingman. John F. Kennedy picked his brother. So it is, of course, normal for a president to want an attorney general who is close to him. I mean, Jeff Sessions, who was Donald Trump's first attorney general,was the only senator to endorse Donald Trump in the campaign. So, this is very normal. And I think Mike Rogers has a lot of credibility here in Washington. I think he is confirmable. I think he developed a relationship with Trump on the campaign. You know, he was running for the Senate in Michigan. Trump campaigned in Michigan heavily with Mike Rogers. I think there is a relationship there.

So, I think there may be a little worried that Mike Rogers would be a repeat of that.

We, you know, we want to stop the FBI from being a political weapon. But if you put people in place who then, you know, to Molly's point, who then kind of aggressively carry out your agenda, actually the American people don't love that. I mean this was one of the things that people were uncomfortable with in 2020. And one of the reasons they rejected Trump in 2020 because they felt like four years of watching Trump put people in place who were, you know, who were - who were carrying out his political agenda in institutions that have traditionally been separate from the president, that was one of the things people didn't like. So, there is - you know, it's easy in the moment after an election, when you, you know, you have won fairly handily, you feel you have a mandate, to feel like you can just sort of, you know, do whatever you want and there will be no political consequences.
