And these people found out the hard way. Look at this. Very deceiving sometimes, those floodwaters. That's why the National Weather Service has that slogan, turn around, don't drown, because you never know when there's going to be that drop in the roadway there and the water is deeper than you actually think it is. Nine inches of rain has fallen in some places of Texas. And there are flash flood watches stretching from Mississippi through Louisiana and the central Texas coast. This has just been issued through about 7:45 Central Daylight Time, a flash flood warning for Corpus Christi. About two to three inches of rain has fallen already this morning and another one to two inches of rain is possible. The bulk of the heaviest rainfall for the day today really located near the border of Texas and Louisiana. So, we'll look out for the potential of more flooding. The other big story we're covering, the heat building across the southwest. Sixty million Americans under heat alerts. But this is incredible. Look what happened in Phoenix yesterday, 100 consecutive days where the mercury in the thermometer climbed to 100 degrees or higher. That is just downright hot and it doesn't look like it's going to break anytime soon. Kasie.",

And certainly the ongoing suffering for the hostages who cannot be forgotten, but also innocent people in Gaza.

Our hearts mourn alongside the innocents who are suffering at the hands of - of terrorism. And there are steps that we need to take. I am going to be getting back into session next week in Congress. And I fully expect us to be taking some votes on - on this matter, holding Iran and Qatar accountable certainly for harboring some of the Hamas terrorists, placing blame on Hamas for the deaths of these hostages, and for starting this war.

And - and the dignity that they brought to this struggle in raising awareness about the problem.So, there should be angry. And I was pleased right before I came on the air, I was listening to your show, and you had a congresswoman from Michigan who said she wants to go back to Washington and she wants to hold those people to account. She wants to hold the government of Iran and Qatar for supporting and financing and harboring of Hamas. I think that's very important. I think it was important what the Justice Department did yesterday in saying they're going to bring charges against Hamas. Hamas is responsible for the plight of the hostages. We will be prepared to do everything we can to bring those hostages home. And we're still committed to doing that. We're working very closely, even in the last couple of days. We  continue to work closely with our American counterparts. We had negotiators who met with their counterparts. And hopefully there will be a deal that Hamas will agree to. Because up until this point they haven't agreed to anything. They haven't agreed to any proposal that was put forward. There are a lot of people who believe, unfortunately, mistakenly, that there's some deal on the table that Hamas has agreed to that the Israeli government does not agree to. That's simply not true.

And I believe everybody - or nearly everybody in Israel wants to see Hamas destroyed in Gaza. The question is, how do you achieve both of those goals? We are prosecuting this war and our - our goal in prosecuting this war is to dismantle Hamas' military capabilities, to end its political rule in Gaza, and to ensure that an October 7th never happens again, that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel. We have another goal, which is to bring those hostages home. We haven't fully achieved that goal.
