This is what I heard from council members, an urgency to make sure that people were represented. That injustice is how many of them have called it could be corrected. So they suspended a rule that would have slowed down this process and immediately nominated -- both nominated and appointed Justin Jones with in a manner of 20 minutes. Now, 70,000 people within Jones district have a voice, have representation again in the statehouse. And, Bianna, a truly a powerful moment of demonstrators, clergyman, Jones marching from metro council here to the state capital to cheers, to speeches, to even a moment where Jones is signing off paperwork seemingly being sworn on the steps of the capitol there. I did catch up with Jones before that council vote asking him what was it that he was expecting? And he was adamant that he was expecting democracy to prevail and for council to empower him to give voice to the people here of Davidson County again. He also delivered a fiery speech demanding the resignation of the Republican speaker of the House, the statehouse, Cameron Sexton, who led the effort to pass those resolutions and lead a vote to expel both Pearson and Justin.

REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL):  I think the message it sends is that they are completely out of touch with what his constituents want. You know, at first, they were saying there are, you know, they have decorum and etcetera, really showing that they don't understand what those constituents want, which is they want a fighter who's going to fight to end gun violence every single day. They want someone who's unafraid to work in an untraditional way to uplift the issues that are impacting their people. And that's why that county commission voted to reinstate Representative Joe Jones, and it's just an amazing thing to see. We'll see what happens with Representative Pearson. But I'll say, when they're both put back in the state house, it's so interesting to see this failure of the GOP in Tennessee that thought they were on to something.

And as a battle for Bakhmut rages on, even leaving the city doesn't guarantee safety.Ben Wedeman is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the safest way out of Bakhmut, but not really safe at all. Video obtained by CNN of the view from a Ukrainian armored vehicle shows the wasteland the city has become. And it was in a vehicle like this. Marina and Yevhenia escaped from Bakhmut. They're building was hitting him bombardment last Thursday, killing three. Among them, Yevhenia's 33-year-old grandson. I had to help him, she recalls. But I couldn't do anything. They waited in their ruined homes with the dead for three days before the army could rescue them. Marina's daughter was married to Yevhenia's grandson. What will I tell my daughter, cries Marina. She and my grandchildren are in Poland. This shelter in nearby Chasiv Yar provides them some comfort and warmth, but they're still not out of danger. This town is well within range of Russian guns, and since the battle for Bakhmut began seven months ago, it has regularly come under shelling. On this day, the Russians were firing incendiary munitions over the city designed to cause fires. One resident showed us has spent capsule from the rocket. Officials say there are perhaps 1,000 civilians left in Chasiv Yar. Evacuations are possible, but they don't seem to be many takers. Alexander drags firewood home. There's no electricity or running water here. He fled to Chasiv Yar from Siversk, an hour from here, where his home was destroyed. Is he leaving? No, he replies. My wife died here. My parents are buried here. Serhei Chaus heads the town's military administration. Since last April, we've been trying to convince people to leave, talking with them, reasoning with them, he tells me, but we can't make them. Yet again, the old and infirm refused to leave despite the danger. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And this is just one town among many perilously close to the front lines in eastern Ukraine that run for hundreds of miles. There are thousands of civilians like those we saw in Chasiv Yar that are living without the basics, things like electricity and running water and are under constant threat of shelling and missile attacks -- Bianna.",

The plaintiffs need to respond by tomorrow at midnight, and we'll see what happens there. But absolutely, if they don't get relief, the Department of Justice from the Fifth Circuit, they're going to have to take it to the Supreme Court.
