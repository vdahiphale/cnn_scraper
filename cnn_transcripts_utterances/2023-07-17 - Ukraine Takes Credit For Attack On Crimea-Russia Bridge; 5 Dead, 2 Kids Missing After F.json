This is the only direct link between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is a vital logistical crossing for the Russian military. It is also a critical artery for supplying Crimea with civilian goods.Russian officials say there is damage to the roadway, railroad tracks that run parallel to the road.

      "sentences": "It is John. And when we see brazen attacks like this from the Ukrainians, we rarely get confirmation or admission that they are behind it. Now we are not only having Ukraine claiming responsibility, but they're trolling the Russians at the same time. We heard earlier on telegram from Ukraine Security Services saying the bridge has gone to sleep. Again, that is a reference to another attack on the Kerch Bridge that happened nine months ago.At the time, Ukraine did not claim responsibility. They are doing that today, saying it was a joint effort between the SBU the security services and Ukraine's navy. They're not offering any details beyond that. But from the Russian side, we're told that this strike happened around 3 o'clock in the morning local time. That sea or surface drones were responsible for this. As you noted, you got two -- assent -- two lanes, both car and truck and then railway lines that are run parallel the 12 miles or 19 kilometers across the Kerch Strait. We understand that the railways were relatively untouched, trains kept running but on a delayed schedule. But on the car side, the roadway side significant destruction that will late likely take quite some time to fix. Now this was a personal project of Vladimir Putin, this bridge, that was put in place in 2018, four years after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula, it costs almost $4 billion to build. So not only, as you noted, a very, very important to get people and food and fuel as well as military equipment across that that Kerch Strait that connection between southern Russia and Crimea, but hugely symbolic because of course, Putin considers Crimea to be very much a part of Russia. How Russia responds now is the major question after that last attack in October of 2022. We saw one of the biggest if not the biggest Russian strike all over Ukraine since the war began last year, John?",

      "sentences": "So first case, this is not entirely unexpected. The Ukrainian diplomat said last month that she was 99.9 percent sure that the Russians were going to not renew this deal. And obviously, that has turned out to be true. The Russians essentially say that the U.N. was not living up to its end of the bargain. Because in exchange for allowing Ukrainian ships packed with grain and other food to leave port safely, the Russians were supposed to get help from the U.N. to actually more easily get their own food and their own fertilizer out to market.Now, there are no sanctions at all on Russian agricultural products or on fertilizer or anything like that. But as we know, there are plenty of sanctions on Russian banks. And that applies in many cases to the international payment mechanisms as well that make payment for this grain. This food, this fertilizer for Russia more complicated. And so one of the key demands that Russia has had is to be reconnected to some of these international payment mechanisms. The U.N. has offered to connect the agricultural bank in Russia to that -- those systems but that's obviously been rejected. The U.N. says that they will continue to work on this. But an official also said today that Russia's decision is pretty final. In fact, they say that they've already removed security guarantees for ships passing through the Black Sea. And as you said, this is an area that is mined with explosives, food prices, or grain prices that were already up, Futures up 3 percent on the news, the Russians do say that look, they could go back to this if their conditions are met. And on your question about whether or not this has anything to do with the Kerch Bridge explosion, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson was asked about that directly earlier today. And he said this, quote, these are absolutely unrelated events, even before this terrorist attack, the position was declared by President Putin. And I repeat again, as soon as the part of the Black Sea agreements concerning Russia are fulfilled, Russia will immediately return to the implementation of the deal. As you said, Turkey was one of the parties that helped broker this deal. President Erdogan today said that he may call President Putin in advance of their scheduled meeting in August. And I should also mention quickly, Kate, that Ukraine still can get grain out to market, it's just more complicated because it has to go by rail. And the difficulty is that the gauge on the Ukrainian railways is different than the gauge in Europe. And so it has to get transferred to another train at the border, Kate.",

WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: That's right. This is worldwide. It drives up prices. It restricts the volume of grain that's out on the market. It particularly attacks the U.N. World Food Program. And it puts some countries in the Global South in real jeopardy for real hunger crisis. They're all dependent on Russian and Ukrainian grain. Russian grain has been moving out.

And here's the thing, we would never have launched a counter offensive against this kind of a defense without air superiority. We've encouraged the Ukrainians to do so. And we've dragged our feet on providing them the F-16s. And the other air superiority qualities they need.We don't have enough air defense to protect the ground forces on Ukraine when they're attacking from attack helicopters and other things, which is not our way of war. Our way of war is we have air superiority first. Ukrainians don't have air superiority, they don't have the air defense with those ground columns that they need. So we've really handicap their offense offensive. And the sooner we can get those F-16s there, the better. And I would say this, Sara, in addition to the F-16s, the Ukrainians needs the long range ATACMS missile. Now the French are supplying the long range missiles, the Brits are supplying long range missiles. They're not the same missile as ATACMS. ATACMS is a ballistic missile, it's guided. It's very effective, and it should be provided now that the Brits and French have broken ground on this. It's clear the Russians can't expect to sanctuary deep.

We have not seen this many delays this summer, 40 percent of all flights delayed on average, an hour and 10 minutes were flights arriving to their destinations.So that is a lot of trouble for a lot of air travelers, especially on a Sunday when the numbers are typically pretty big. A lot of folks coming home at the end of the weekend, the worst airports, unsurprisingly and we've seen this over and over again this summer in New York, JFK, Newark LaGuardia. Those are the real trouble spots. And the FAA says it is short air traffic controllers there. But when this weather rolls through, that's when the deck of cards really begins coming tumbling down.
