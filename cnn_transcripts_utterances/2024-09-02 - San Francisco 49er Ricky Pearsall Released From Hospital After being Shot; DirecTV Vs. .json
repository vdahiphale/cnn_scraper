And it came as many of them we're trying to watch college football or the U.S. Open yesterday.And it's not just sports channels like ESPN. It is everything under the Disney umbrella, from \"National Geographic\" to the ABC affiliates where a lot of people get their local news. The channels are all blocked out because of a distribution dispute. CNN media correspondent, Hadas Gold, has all the details -- Hadas?",

      "sentences": "Pam, if you're a college football fan, if you we're hoping to watch the U.S. Open and you happen to have DirecTV, then you are out of luck on Sunday because it went on a blackout.And that's because of a distribution disagreement between DirecTV and Disney and all of the Disney-owned channels. That includes Disney, but it also includes ESPN, some of the local ABC channels, as well as channels like FX. This is all because of a disagreement over how much DirecTV has to pay Disney in their contract in order to be able to air Disney channels. Now DirecTV is saying, listen, the way we watch TV is changing. People are cord cutting. They're creating their own bundles. We want to offer more flexible, cheaper bundles for our customers, so they don't have to pay for channels they don't necessarily want. Disney is saying we are willing to work with you a little bit on that, but they're saying that, listen, it's expensive to have the sports rights, it's expensive for these production costs. So you need to pay the fair price. Now, DirecTV, in a statement, is saying, \"Disney's only magic is forcing prices to go up while simultaneously making its content disappear.\" Disney is saying, \"While we're open to offering DirecTV flexibility and terms which we've extended to other distributors, we will not enter into an agreement that undervalues our portfolio of television channels and programs.\" But the clock is ticking because there are major sports events coming up. Next Monday is the return of \"Monday Night Football\" on ESPN, which is a Disney-owned channel. And it's the return of Aaron Rodgers to football after being injured last season. So I'm sure there's a lot of DirecTV subscribers who want to be able to watch that game. Now, these contract disputes, they always tend to expire right around these sort of big sports moments. That's part of a way to sort of force the issue. Last year, there was a similar feud between Charter and Disney that got worked out literally at the last second. So there's a good chance that this will get worked out for those sports fans before next Sunday.",

If you're an ESPN fan, there is ESPN-Plus streaming. There's also other sort of streaming cable options, things like Sling and YouTube TV. But that's a problem for DirecTV, that they could be losing customers by the day as these customers say, well, I can't watch it on DirecTV, so I'm going to sign up for one of these other streaming platforms. And hey, you know, I I'm going -- I'm going to stay there instead. So there is a big incentive for DirecTV and for Disney to work this out. Because even though more and more people are cutting the cord, these distribution deals still make up the major bulk of revenue and profits for these companies -- Pam?",
