Kennedy Jr. will take a stage in Arizona and he's expected to formally announce that he's suspending his presidential race. His base of support is small, but it could be pivotal depending on where his voters go and whether RFK Jr. endorses Donald Trump, which appears likely, though nothing guaranteed. We have CNN National Correspondent, Kristen Holmes in Arizona for us. Let's begin, though, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez.

      "sentences": "Well, she's clear eyed that there is a long way to go. That is what sources are telling me and my colleagues. And campaign officials feel really good about what they saw last night. But they also know that they now have to focus on the battleground states, especially states like North Carolina, where they want to be particularly bullish and building out their infrastructure, trying to bring in those voters.But they also know they really have to focus on the debate on September 10th. That's going to be another opportunity where the Vice President will be able to appeal to voters when she's up against former President Donald Trump. But on today's headline with RFK Jr., they are looking at some of these voters as people who perhaps flocked to him because they couldn't stand or didn't want to go to Donald Trump. Now, they could have Vice President Kamala Harris as an option. And so that is something that they are also considering and how to bring in those voters as part of what they say is a bigger tent. And I think that's what we were really seeing from the Vice President last night. And she in her remarks, it wasn't just about the people that were in the room. She was speaking to all Americans and also trying to come off as moderate, to try to bring in those independent voters that they have been thinking about and trying to target. So the next couple of weeks for them are going to focus again on those battleground states, on reaching those voters who don't have RFK Jr. as an option if he is to suspend his campaign. And then also -- and focusing on the debate, knowing that there's another moment in this very truncated timeline for them. And I will say another thing that I keep hearing is how do they keep bringing in -- continuing to bring in those fundraising numbers? They've had such success. But they also need to focus on those grassroots donations, too, which can sometimes be a little less predictable, which means they have to seize moments, create moments to continue to bring in that funding, because they know that Trump still has a long ways to go with his fundraising and he can certainly do it. So they have to try to get ahead of it.",

So what we're expecting to see today, you heard Priscilla talking about trying to get those RFK voters. That is why Donald Trump is also trying to secure this endorsement from RFK.Just a little bit of background here. We're not going to go through every single state where RFK stands in relation to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. But one note, particularly here in Arizona, because it gives you a little bit of a glimpse into the landscape as a whole. Recent polling shows RFK at 6 percent here. Donald Trump is at 42 percent. Kamala Harris was at 45 percent. The reason that this matters overall is that every side believes that this is going to be an election that is decided by razor thin margins. So does Donald Trump team think that if RFK Jr. drops out and endorses him, that they're going to get all 6 percent in Arizona? No, they do not. But do they think that they could get enough of that to make a difference in a battleground state and potentially put Donald Trump over the edge in November? Yes, they do. So that's why they've been working so hard for several weeks to try and secure this endorsement as it became clear that RFK was likely to drop out. You're going to see him on the stage today. RFK is going to likely spend his campaign. That's what we've been told. And then Donald Trump has a rally just outside of Phoenix. RFK shows up. That is what we are waiting to see. The Trump campaign has been alluding to a special guest, but we'll wait and see.",

You're not looking at a very large, persuadable audience in there. So for her, those people are already generally pretty split. And you're looking at the margins of who you can message to.Donald Trump by going back on Fox is going back to his base. So if he can't -- there's not a persuadable audience that's really sitting out there on there. At least he's talking to his base. When it comes to what the message should be right now for her, she wants to try and nod to those -- maybe to those RFK voters who were people who haven't really made up their mind yet or to those Nikki Haley voters. But again, the Trump campaign is doing the same thing. You see J.D. Vance out in swing states. You see Republicans trying to message that way.

So I don't understand what -- how that is holding people accountable, because what we haven't heard is what did they specifically do wrong? Where were they responsible for some of this breakdown? Right?If they really was accountable, then you would put them on full administrative leave. You would take their badge and gun away from them. We didn't see that. We're basically giving them the option to work remotely, which is a little bit odd. And I think that the viewer is going to look at that going, that's not really accountability from what we heard and what we heard the deputy or the Acting Director say that he was going to hold people accountable. So there is that point. But let's get back to the radios, the communication breakdown. We've been talking about this, and it's getting worse and worse. Now hearing that there was a pathway -- and Brianna, you and I actually talked about this on air, saying, all you have to do to communicate with each other is just share each other's radios. Now, we know that that was talked about in advance, but wasn't acted upon on the day. The fact that Secret Service didn't pick up local radios or local PD didn't pick up secret Service radios really just speaks to the complete and utter breakdown of communication and roles and responsibilities 41 days ago. And what we're not hearing is, we're not hearing this come from the Secret Service or as an output of their mission assurance review. We're hearing it in the drip, drip, drip from the DA's office, from the ESU team members, from other law enforcement entities, not the Secret Service. So I question the Acting Director today as to where is the transparency, where's the reassurance that you're going to build confidence back in the Secret Service, and where's the accountability?",

So again, there are stopgap measures which, you know, it looks like they attempted to put into place to be able to communicate, because they know it's important, but it was never acted upon that day.
