Jordan`s King Abdullah warning on Sunday of catastrophic consequences of the continuing war in Gaza. From Jordan, Blinken went to Qatar, which has been instrumental in negotiating for the release of hostages held in Gaza. Qatar`s Prime Minister saying the recent killing of the Senior Hamas official by Israel could impact hostage negotiations. MOHAMMED BIN ABDULRAHMAN AL-THANI, QATAR`S PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Of course, having one of the senior leader of Hamas being killed is something that can affect such a complicated process. Yet we are not giving up. We are moving forward.",

The Americans also killing Iran-back maliciously in Iraq, after an attack on a U.S. air base and the Iranian-back Houthis continue to interrupt international shipping in the Red Sea last month. The U.S. announcing an international effort to deter Houthi attacks, but in this region where I am very few countries willing to join that coalition to counter those threats. From Qatar, Blinken came here to Abu Dhabi meeting with the UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed. The trip also includes Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, and the West Bank where officials say there will be tough conversations. But if Blinken`s past visits are any indication and with no sign of an end to Israel`s assault on Gaza, his presence may not be enough to calm the region. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is a look at the planet`s Uranus and Neptune looking strikingly different as captured in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. But a recent study by Oxford University found that those original images had actually been stretched and enhanced resulting in a, quote, \"two artificially blue Neptune.\" Now newly reprocessed, the images show the planet`s true colors, and that they actually look quite similar. Talk about a color correction. But that`s not all, the study also used images of Uranus gathered over the years to figure out why the planet appears to change colors with the seasons. The study says as the planet spins toward and away from the sun, a combo of varying gas and cloud coverage give way to a seemingly shifting hue. Now, you know. In other inner stellar news, we now have the most detailed look ever at Jupiter moon IO, courtesy of the closest ever fly by, by the spacecraft Juno. Scientists say IO is the most volcanic body in the solar system and the new high-risk images given unprecedented look at the moon dappled with craggy volcanic features. By the way, am I the only one that thinks IO looks like the lightsaber training or thingy from star wars? I am. Okey dokey. Well that`s 10 seconds. We`ll never get back. Finally, we leave you spaced out for the day of the life of Mars. O, technically it`s half a day, 12 hours on the red planet crammed into a trippy ten second time lapse. It comes courtesy of curiosity. The Rover that`s been there for more than 4,000 days that look just like this. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
