Tonight, we're going to take you to the front lines. Our reporter Fred Pleitgen was feet away from incoming fire. You'll want to see this report.And also breaking this hour, we're learning Trump's team is deciding whether to allow federal agents to return to Mar-a-Lago because they say that he still has stuff as a federal judge now says, Trump lied under oath about his claim of a stolen election. And Senator Marco Rubio pulls a total 180. He once told a Parkland victim's father that he supported raising the minimum age to buy a rifle. And now, he's taking it back. That victim's father is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news: martial law. Putin's martial law now at this hour is in effect in parts of Ukraine just after midnight local time. Russian President Vladimir Putin doing the move not seen from Russia since World War II. Here, his declaration, martial law. And this order does a few major things. First, a degree of martial law in four Ukrainian regions that Putin has illegally annexed and, frankly, are in large part in many places under Ukrainian control. So, that opens the door for Russian- backed leaders there to impose sweeping new restrictions, curfews, seizing property, detaining people, forcibly moving people to other regions. Now, the order like many Russian laws is open for a lot of interpretation. Putin could take these new powers even further. All we know is what he said today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We are working to solve very difficult, large-scale tasks to ensure Russia's security and safe future. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It could be a whole wide range of transformational things, tracking down on travel just one of them. These appear to be desperate measures from a desperate leader. Here's President Biden today.

Put them in tanks. Get them so they can press forward and move the Russians out.And it's urgent because, frankly, what Putin wants is all of these declarations that he's making about martial law and nuclear forces and all of this. It is all an effort to gain time. He wants to force the West to slow our systems so that he can draw this out. And frankly, for us, that's a losing proposition because as this gets drawn out, there is increased risk. Maybe through Belarus or elsewhere, that we get drawn into the war. He's using social media, this is the last point I want to make. He's using social media to try to influence U.S. policymakers.

That's pretty incredible to think about, after all of this? Still hiding them?And that's one thing. The other thing is a major ruling from a federal judge who says Trump knew claims of voter fraud were wrong but decided to include them in a sworn legal filing anyway. Now, the judge says there's evidence for this. That he's got receipts because there are emails written by former Trump attorney John Eastman that have never been seen publicly. The judge says, quote, the court finds that these emails are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Our CNN reporters are OUTFRONT on both of these important developments. Evan Perez is following that Eastman ruling. I want to start, though, with Kristen Holmes on the discussions underway for a second search of Mar-a-Lago. And, Kristen, this is pretty stunning.

The president's legal team were trying to argue that there were tens of thousands of fraudulent votes, and you can read from the John Eastman email where he said the former president had some doubts about this and then he signs the document.I'll read you just what the email says. It says, although the president signed the verification to the state court on December 1st, he has since been made aware that some of the allegations in evidence offered by the experts has been inaccurate. For him to sign a new verification with that knowledge and incorporation by reference would not be accurate. The former president, Erin, was doubtful. He was basically raising some concerns about signing this document because he knew these were false and the judge says that. But he did it anyway. And that's the reason why the judge says these documents should go to the January 6th committee as part of their investigation.

Gravity being President Biden's approval rating pulling them down.But take a look at the generic congressional ballot, right, and take a look at how the people who disapprove of Joe Biden's job, what is the margin that Republicans have among them? Back in June and July, Republicans were up by 51 points. Now it's 61 points. The people who are disapproving of Joe Biden's job are moving more and more into the Republican camp. And that's bad if Joe Biden's rating is as low as 40 percent. Here's the other thing that is so important. Look at the most important problem. Who do you think is the better party to handle that problem? The Republican Party with an 11-point advantage right now on that issue. It's the largest advantage in the midterm for Republicans since 1946. You have all this gravity, all this gravity pulling down at contract candidate. See if they can hold on. But right now, the momentum is on the Republican side because of that gravity.",
