And what I can tell you is that there have been rumors for some time that Alexei Navalny was part of a negotiation to swap prisoners in Russia, U.S. prisoners Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter, for a Russian national being held in a German jail. He's been sentenced to murder there. He said to be an FSB hitman, basically.And what spin, what's come out now from Navalny's team, this is the late Russian opposition leader, is that Alexei Navalny was now, they're publicly saying he was pulled part of that negotiation, that he was going to be swapped as well in exchange for those American citizens and that Russian national in that, in that German prison. It's the first time they've come out and publicly said that. They're also saying that this could be the reason why Alexei Navalny died. Of course, Navalny's team accused the Kremlin the ordering his death in that prison. Basically, they're saying that the night before he died, the negotiations to swap him were in the last stage. And then in the morning or the next day, he was pronounced dead, and they're saying, you know, he was basically killed to take him off the table as a negotiating chip. That's the implication and the allegation that Navalny's team are making. Now, we should say that the Kremlin have categorically denied anything to do with Navalny's death. They've also not confirmed to us that he was part of any negotiation for a prisoner swap. It hasn't been confirmed to us by the State Department, by U.S. officials, by the Germans either. But it is a really interesting twist in this absolutely awful episode, what's been taking place in Russia over the past week or so. BOLDUAN:  Absolutely.

Steve, I want to start with what Matthew Chance is just bringing to us, this really extraordinary reporting from a top aide to Alexei Navalny saying that Putin was offered a prisoner swap. There was an offer made and they were even final stages, is how its described, for a swap that would have included Navalny, two Americans in exchange for an FSB officer who is being held in Berlin.

For starters, the Russians have always been trying to get this guy, this FSB officer who is currently in a German prison for assassinating an enemy of the Russian, of the Russian regime, an enemy of Putin's, in Germany. The Germans, for whatever reason, had been very reticent to get -- to make him part of the deal. Perhaps German law or whatever the reasons are, but there's always been great interest in Moscow.So this is the first we're hearing, I think, of this connection between, all right, maybe, maybe Navalny can be part of the deal sweetened with a package of Americans in order to get this FSB officer out of Germany. That raises questions, though, if he was killed because of that, because of the impending deal, who was on whose side inside the Kremlin? Because it sounds like you've got two different views of what should happen. So complicated stuff. It'll be interesting to see it all shakes out.",

I mean, that -- put aside if that is true.

We've seen that time and time again with all the opposition people that he's killed in the past.But the interesting thing here is, in my mind, so who was on the side of saying yes, let's put Navalny on the table? And then who was against it? Because all of those issues would have been behind the Kremlin walls and would indicate perhaps some sort of schism -- again, if this reporting is true, some sort of schism between those who thought, yes, let's cut a deal with Navalny, and those who say absolutely not, he's too dangerous if he remains alive.

And the reason that they're going back and forth on this and the reason that sometimes it's a surprise to say, well, maybe the Russians it would allow for some sort of public thing, or maybe they wouldn't is what's behind all of this is Putin's fear of turning Navalny into a martyr, providing a moment where the Russian population can take to the streets in the tens of thousands and begin some sort of, some sort of significant protests and push against the Putin -- the Putin government. So it's not surprising that they're very, very focused on this, because they don't want to provide that opportunity.So it's a real tough line for them to walk.

He may have calculated, it doesn't matter much anyway, so he may as well get it out there, but there is no doubt that really the fate of Ukraine in a very important sense rests with the United States and with the rest of our NATO allies, so he is concerned about that as well they should be.  BOLDUAN:  Yes, I mean, as he said, if the United States does not continue its support, millions of people will end up dead. It's good to see you, Steve, thank you so much for coming in.
