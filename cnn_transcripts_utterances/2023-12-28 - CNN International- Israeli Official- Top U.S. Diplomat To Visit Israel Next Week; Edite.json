      "sentences": "Well, that certainly is a mounting concern, Bianca, particularly as we continue to see an escalation of hostilities on the border between Israel and Lebanon. As you mentioned, Secretary Blinken expected to make that trip into the Middle East to speak with officials in Israel as well. And of course, we have seen those intense discussions now between White House officials and their counterparts in Israel. The U.S. calling on the Israeli Military to move towards what's being described as a lower intensity phase of the war.But, that certainly has put the U.S. at odds with the messaging we are hearing from Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has warned that the war could go on for many more months. And that in fact the Israeli Military is intensifying and expanding its operation both in the air and on the ground. And of course, that has driven and sparked a fierce reaction more regionally. And there is concern around Iran-backed groups who have called, of course, for not only a ceasefire and end to the war, but have also taken up action, particularly Hezbollah in Lebanon. Now, of course, on Wednesday, we did see Hezbollah claiming to have shelled local regions in the Israeli border area in response, they say, to an Israeli air strike on the border region of Lebanon in the city of Bint Jbeil. We did hear from the Lebanese National News Agency saying that at least three people had been killed in that airstrike, which the Israeli Military says was targeting Hezbollah site on the border region. But, of course, we also heard from Hezbollah saying at least one of them was a Hezbollah member.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is suddenly a troubling and concerning video which has emerged on social media, as you mentioned. Throughout the video, you can see dozens of men including what appears to be two children but also possibly more teenagers in this video as well who have been stripped to their underwear, having their hands held above their head or tied behind their back. Many of them, of course, also blindfolded in that video. And there are also some women seen in this video placed on the ground beside a soccer goalpost with the Israeli flag hanging above them, also blindfolded, as we said in that video. And of course, we haven't been able to confirm when this video was filmed, but CNN has geo-located this to the Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza City, and this is an area where we have heard reports of mass detentions.The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor group says it has received reports of people being detained in this area, including children, the elderly, and women who have reported abuse and mistreatment. And of course, over the last few weeks, we have been hearing these reports from other aid agencies as well. Now, when it comes to the stripping of these individuals, the Israeli Military says it has done so in order to ensure that they are not carrying explosives, but the time period in which they have been stripped for an extended period of time and the stress positions that they have been placed in clearly in this video has raised concern. The UN's own Humanitarian Office or Human Rights Office, rather, issued a statement earlier in the month with regards to the mistreatment of those detained. Take a listen to this brief excerpt from their statement earlier this month, saying that the UN Human Rights Office has received numerous disturbing reports from the north of Gaza of mass detentions, ill treatment, and enforced disappearances, of possibly thousands of Palestinian men and boys and a number of women and girls at the hands of Israeli Defense Forces. Most were rounded up as they were attempting to move south or were taken during operations conducted on their homes, hospitals, schools, and other places of refuge. Of course, the statement then goes on to say that they have received also troubling reports of mistreatment, which in the words of the UN's Humanitarian Office could amount, if confirmed, to torture.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Bianca. This is a big victory for Apple and no response yet from Masimo as yet. But, what this means essentially is that it's only a brief disruption to Apple's sales of the top tier Apple watches that it sells. Apple will be returning the top tier watches to its store shelves as early as today in some stores, and online by about 3 p.m. Eastern Time this afternoon. And as you noted, there will be wider availability across Apple's retail stores by the weekend. And Apple has said that it wants to make sure that it offers the full lineup of its Apple watches in time for the New Year.Now, as you suggested, this is just a temporary measure. The court that's considering Apple's appeal in this patent dispute will be considering whether to issue a longer stay, sometime mid next month, as Apple continues its legal battle to defend its Apple watch. And it will also be submitting, it said, an update to U.S. officials for them to review, also mid next month, in hopes of resolving this patent dispute that focuses on the pulse oximeter technology that it has in some of its Apple watches that essentially use light pulses to measure blood oxygen levels. And we'll see whether or not government officials who are reviewing this update agree that it resolves the patent dispute. But, ultimately, what the decision was made yesterday is just a temporary move that nevertheless gives Apple much more freedom to continue selling some of its most popular devices as it tries to move more into the health space.

      "sentences": "Yeah. And we did know that officials went into these meetings, officials from the United States that is, with a specific set of asks for their Mexican counterparts as they try and confront this surge of migrants at the American southern border. That included moving some of these migrants further south in an effort to decongest what has become a very congested part of the American southern border.They were also wanting Mexico to better control some of their railways in that country. These are the lines that migrants take from South and Central America up through Mexico to the United States. They were also looking for Mexico to play some incentives, like visas, that would make it more appealing for migrants to actually stay in Mexico instead of trying to come across into the United States. And when you talk to officials after this meeting, they were relatively pleased by the outcomes. They do feel like they have a willing partner in President Lopez Obrador. And what they said was that Mexico did agree to start ramping up some of its enforcement mechanisms, and start cracking down on some of the smugglers that you see that are really fueling some of these scenes of crowding at the American southern border. And so, they did feel relatively good about how those talks went. And the U.S. does feel like it has some leverage here in the form of these ports of entry into the United States, these border crossings that are so essential for Mexican businesses, for trade, for the economy. You'll remember, the United States actually had to shut some of those border crossings down in order to redeploy some of the resources to other areas of the border to deal with the migrant surge. This is something that Mexico really wants the U.S. not to do for an extended period of time because of the effect that it would have on the economy. And that was also a major point of these discussions as well. But, on the flip side of that, I think Mexico feels like it has some leverage with the United States as well, because this is such a political issue in the United States and for President Biden, as he gears up for reelection next year. His aides do acknowledge that this will be one of the central issues in his battle, potential battle with the former President Donald Trump heading into next year's election.",

And I don't think that there is any question that Republicans will use immigration as an attack line on President Biden, no matter what happens. And when you talk to Biden and officials, they actually say the numbers that we've been seeing this month, the points were extremely high, as many as 10,000 arrests at the border, they do see those ticking down. But, they acknowledged that this is cyclical. It'll go up. It'll go down. And every time it goes up, I think you can be sure that Republicans will use that to accuse the President of being weak on immigration.I think what you'll hear from President Biden is that this needs to be something that Congress fixes, that this is a broken system. It's sort of an irreparable problem that every American President has had to deal with. And unless Congress makes some changes, nothing will improve at the border. There are talks underway right now between Republicans and Democrats on things like tightening the asylum rules, things like making it easier to move forward with deportations. And what President Biden wants to do is work with those Republicans to try and come up with some kind of agreement. But, those talks are still very much in their early stages, and it doesn't seem clear how they will be resolved in the New Year yet, Bianca.",

KENNEDY, 35TH U.S. PRESIDENT: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): More than 60 years after those famous words, it was full steam ahead for a new space race in 2023. Space agencies from around the world are once again competing to get to the moon. And this time, they're hoping to stay for good, leaving more than just flags and footprints. In 2023, India's space program took a giant leap forward, successfully landing its uncrewed robotic Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the lunar surface in August. It's only the fourth country to do it after the United States, the former Soviet Union, and China. But, so far, India is the only one to reach the South Pole of the moon, where water in the form of ice has been detected.",
