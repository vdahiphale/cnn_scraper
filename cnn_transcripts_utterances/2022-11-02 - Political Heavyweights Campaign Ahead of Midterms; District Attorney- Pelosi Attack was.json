The broad expectation is that the U.S. central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate another 3/4 of 1 percent. If so, that would be the fourth in a row. Something we haven't seen in modern history.To put this in perspective, before this summer the last time the Fed raised rates by that magnitude in a single meeting was 1994. But the Fed is also trying to tame consumer inflation that's currently hovering at 40-year highs. By raising rates, the Fed makes the borrowing cost more expensive which should slow demand and thus, cool prices. But the data hasn't shown a cooling of prices. Not yet at least and not in a significant way. Also complicating the Fed's inflation fight, red hot labor market. New employment data released Tuesday showed that job openings actually picked up in the month of September. Meaning for every one person looking for a job, there are almost two jobs available. Good news for American job seekers, not so much for the Fed. Chairman Jay Powell has said he would like to see better balance between job openings and job seekers because of concerns that this labor market could be driving up wages. Higher wages could then trickle into higher costs for goods and services. Will learn much more when we hear from Powell when he speaks Wednesday afternoon.

So, it does seem as though so far if these numbers hold that Benjamin Netanyahu will once again become Prime Minister starting his 16th year as a Prime Minister. Already the longest serving Prime Minister and he would continue to do so.But what's been the most notable change of this election compared to the last four elections is the rise of that far right party -- Religious Zionism/Jewish Party. These are two Jewish powers. These are two parties that came together and this is really the far right, what were once considered the extreme fringe of Israeli politics. These are the settlers. These are people -- one of their leaders is one convicted for inciting racism. People who just a year ago -- Benjamin Netanyahu himself said that they shouldn't be ministers and now just in the last few days he said, yes, of course they could have a ministerial position. So, if they numbers hold -- and keep in mind there still potentially hundreds of thousands of votes out there that still need to be counted. But if these numbers hold, then the question will be, what kind of government will Benjamin Netanyahu lead? Will they be far- right government? Will these far right figures have ministerial positions? Benjamin Netanyahu addressed his supporters last night. Still a little bit cautious but take a listen to what he has to say.

As many as 20 records are possible across the northern reaches of the United States. And we're talking about record warmth, you've got to look at these temps. Because how about the 80s, that's what was observed across Topeka, Kansas on Tuesday, tying the record that's been standing since about 1990. And in Bismarck, North Dakota, the record of 74 degrees, best of previous records for that date that has been standing since 1887.Now, again, look at these temperatures. In Minneapolis, the first average date for snowfall is this Friday. Temperatures on Wednesday, 76 degrees. In Las Vegas around 62. Much the same across much of the Southwest. Where parts of the northern U.S. is going to be warmer than parts of the southern U.S. Chicago will climb up into the 70s and stays there for a few days. And then the bottom does try to drop out a little bit here especially in the overnight hours will get much cooler. But you'll notice, afternoon temps still staying above average. Now parts of the West here, winter weather alerts have been prompted. A front that does eventually bring in the cool air is pumping in quite a bit of moisture here as the storm door remains wide open. And of course, gusty winds as we often expect with these fronts across the great basin as well. So, here comes the front, expect much cooler air as we go in from Wednesday to Thursday across these western plains. And then eventually across parts of the Midwest by Friday into Saturday. So, have a look at these temperatures. In Rapid City, 74 to 37 up to 49. Fargo, 71 to 50 down to 40 and Minneapolis come the 70s, eventually by Friday, only 45 degrees. But guys, here's what it looks like across the U.S. 76 in Omaha. 73 in Chicago and New York City, not a bad early November day, highs just shy of 70 degrees. Send it back to you.",
