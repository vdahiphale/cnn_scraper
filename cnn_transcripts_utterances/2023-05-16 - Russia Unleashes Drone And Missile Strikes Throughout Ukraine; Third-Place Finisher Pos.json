Hello everyone, I'm ZainAsher in New York and this is ONE WORLD. From the air, land and sea, from the north, south and east, Russia unleashed a series of drone and missile strikes throughout Ukraine early this morning as Moscow braces for Kyiv's long-awaited counteroffensive. Ukrainian officials described the attack on the capital as exceptional in its intensity, and the country's defense minister says all enemy targets were shot down, including six Russian hypersonic Kinzhai missiles which were part of new advanced weaponry touted by Vladimir Putin back in 2018. The Kremlin claims that its forces destroyed a U.S.-made patriot air defense system in Kyiv earlier today. Meantime, the Wagner chief says a U.S. citizen has died while fighting in the embattled city of Bakhmut. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us live now from Eastern Ukraine. So, Nic, let's just talk about this Kremlin claim that it has shot down or rather destroyed a patriot U.S.-made air defense system. What evidence is the Kremlin providing and what are the Ukrainians saying about that?",

There's nothing that Russia would like more than to destroy equipment that the United States has given to the Ukrainian military. The Patriot air defense system has been a critical component of the ever- growing and strengthening air defense around the capital, Kyiv. The fact that it apparently, as a part of an integrated air defense system was able to help take down and defend the capital from six of those high speed hypersonic, 10 times the speed of sound missiles fired from aircraft to the north of Kyiv is significant. It does appear that the Russians are doing what Ukrainian officials said that they were trying to do last week, which is try to find a way through those new and improved air defenses. So, not only these hypersonic missiles, but the other cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea, the Iskander S-400 large land launched missiles fired at Kyiv, as well, three of those from the east within Russian territory. All trying to find a way to penetrate that air defense system and apparently failing. Kyiv refusing to comment on Russia's claims that are not backed up by evidence. Zain.",

Opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu today tried to rally his supporters, tweeting out messages to young people who might be looking for change. No candidate got more than 50 percent of the vote in Sunday's election, so a runoff between Kilicdaroglu and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is set for May 28. Analysts say the opposition candidate certainly does face a very steep uphill battle, however, the third-place finisher with just over 5 percent of the vote could actually end up becoming the kingmaker, depending on who he backs.

Rather, shrapnel from a missile fired by Islamic Jihad from his native Gaza into Israel ripped through his chest and abdomen. Abdullah was one of around 18,000 Gazans to receive a permit to work in Israel. His father, Jibril, also working in Israel, rushed to the hospital. It was too late. Human kindness triumphed over the passions of war. I found it made no difference to the doctors if we were Arabs or Jews, recalls Jadid (ph). I asked them to help me with the procedures to take my son home and bury him, and they did. Abdullah leaves behind a wife, four daughters and two sons. His children, his family, a whole family of seven people is now destitute, a relative, Mohammed tells me. These Bedouins are pious people. They prefer not to place blame.

There's still so much that these communities are up against, because a lot of the oil companies will either blame their subsidiaries for the oil spills, they'll say that the oil spills are the result of oil theft, for example. The list goes on. The statute of limitations is also another issue, whereby plaintiffs only have a very narrow window in which to file their case. But of course, the effects of an oil spill can last decades, if not longer. So, just walk us through what these communities are really up against when competing or trying to go up against big oil.",

When you thinkabout oil spills, for example, in this country, obviously, in America, we all remember what happened here in 2010, in April 2010, when that massive sort of BP oil spill happened here and it was just a few months later. I think it was by August, there were images and videos of President Barack Obama, then President Barack Obama, actually swimming in the Gulf to sort of show everyone that the beaches were open for business, that the clean-up there was indeed successful. Litigation and lawsuits aside, what do you make of the clean-up efforts in the Niger Delta or lack thereof? Because it doesn't seem as though much of the clean-up that has been promised or much of the clean-up that has happened has actually ended up having a real impact.

And before we end the segment, I just want to read the statement that Shell gave CNN when asked to respond to last week's British Supreme Court ruling. And I quote here, the decision builds on the recent U.K. High Court judgment, which found the relevant limitation period is five years, and rejected the claimants' case that Bonga oil could become trapped and re- mobilized years later, migrating upstream and impacting the claimants' communities. While the 2011 Bonga spill was highly regrettable, it was swiftly contained and cleaned up offshore. That's Shell's statement to CNN. All right, still to come here -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
