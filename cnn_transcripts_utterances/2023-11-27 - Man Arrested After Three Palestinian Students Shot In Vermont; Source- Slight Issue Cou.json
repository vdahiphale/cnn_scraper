One of them in critical condition and two of them in stable condition at last check.Some of the organizers -- some of the organizations, I should say, that are close to the families have identified those three 20-year- olds as Tahseen Ali Ahmad, Kinnan Abdelhamid, and that is Hisham Awartani that you see on the right corner of that -- of that group photo. That photo actually taken just moments before Saturday's shooting and in it you can see that they are wearing that Keffiyeh -- that traditional scarf that is often worn as a sign of solidarity with Palestine. And that is why an attorney representing the families of these young men believes that this is a hate crime. The local authorities saying they're not quite ready to go there quite yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABED AYOUB, ATTORNEY FOR VICTIMS' FAMILIES:  The suspect walked up to them and shot them. They weren't robbed. They weren't mugged. It was a targeted -- a targeted shooting and a targeted crime. And they were wearing the Keffiyeh -- very symbolic of the Palestinian cause in culture and history. Their identity played a role in them being targeted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, everything we've seen, Trump's lead has expanded over the past 12 months as the felony charges have accumulated, right? I mean, there's 91 felony charges, the bulk of which are -- have to do with his behavior and his -- after the election and his time at the end of -- end of his term.
