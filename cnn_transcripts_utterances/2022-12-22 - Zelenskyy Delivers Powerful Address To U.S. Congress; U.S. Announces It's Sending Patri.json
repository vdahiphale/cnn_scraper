All through the lens of a conflict that shows no signs of ending anytime soon.And that was one of the primary takeaways from his sprint through Washington D.C. His first trip out of Ukraine since Russia invaded at the end of February. The reality that as long as Vladimir Putin, as long as Russia continues to mount the invasion that they've had ongoing now for nearly ten months, there are no compromises to make. In the words of Zelenskyy, there is no change, there is no shift. And this is not just a battle between two countries, an invader and the Ukrainian people. This is a battle really, to some degree, at least in the framing of Zelenskyy, for democracy, for many of the western values that President Biden has made clear are essential in this moment in time. And that is why this visit, when you talk to White House officials was so critically important. Given the scale of the U.S. assistance over the course of the last nine or ten months and given the fact that while Zelenskyy was here Biden announced another $1.8 billion in security assistance including the most substantial addition of weapons capability in the Patriot missile defense system that has ever been put on the table, something that Zelenskyy made clear he wants more of.

How they're going to do that though remain somewhat unclear. We talk to U.S. officials, they see this now more as a stalemate when it comes to the battle space than any type of progression forward on along one side or the other.

Thanks so much for being here with us.So first I want to start with the symbolic significance of this visit. I mean a few days ago, Zelenskyy was, you know, on the front lines in Bakhmut. Yesterday addressing Congress in English in his trademark battle green. What is that for you? MATTHEW SCHMIT, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN: This is a man in his moment if there ever was one. He is authentic, he is empathic, and you know, he is just an amazing communicator in how he's able to take the Ukrainian experience and flip it into American lives. And look at his audience and say I wish for your kids to be able to do the things that our kids will do in the future. To go to college. And he's really bringing the war home in a way that I think few leaders can. And as far as the trip out from Bakhmut I think that this is a thumb in the eye of Vladimir Putin directly. To say that he can go -- he can go to the front lines when Putin can't, and then he can leave from there and end up in the, you know, most powerful country in the world. It's saying a lot about who is on his team.",

I think the real answer is here is that Putin could find any reason to call this a proxy war between America and Russia. And so the fact is that there's a lot of reason that Putin doesn't want to do that because he doesn't want to draw NATO in.
