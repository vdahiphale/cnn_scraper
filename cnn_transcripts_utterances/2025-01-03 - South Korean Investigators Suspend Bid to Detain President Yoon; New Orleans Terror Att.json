It's Friday, January 3rd, 9 a.m. here in London, 6 p.m. in Seoul, Korea, where the country's impeached president has dodged a legal bullet as the threat of detention looms over him.Just hours ago, investigators tried to serve an arrest warrant to Yoon Suk Yeol at his official residence as hundreds of his supporters rallied outside. But the official came face-to-face with his security detail, and after a dramatic standoff, the operation was put on hold for safety reasons. The arrest warrant for Yoon is still active, and it can be extended. Yoon is facing charges of abuse of power and orchestrating a rebellion following a short-lived martial law he imposed last month. Mike Valerio is standing by near the presidential residence, where Yoon's supporters are taking a bit of a victory lap, so to speak -- Mike.",

      "sentences": "I would say that's absolutely right, Christina, and you know so many of them have been here since that arrest warrant was issued Tuesday night, and they've gone back and forth to their homes or camped out. So to show you the tableau, this is the goal all along from South Korea, suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol, and the whole myriad or multitude of people who are gathered here. They wanted to form a human wall in front of the president's official residence to make it harder for investigators to come in and arrest South Korea's president, which would be a first.We have never here in South Korea, a democratic bastion of East Asia, ever had an elected president arrested while the president was still in office. So what you see here is definitely a victory lap, and people on the stage way, way, way in the background are absolutely saying that we have to keep fighting. So really, the question, Christina, is what happens next? This was a move by investigators and prosecutors to have the suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol be accountable, be held accountable for declaring martial law one month ago tonight, the evening hours of December 3rd, around 10:30 at night, into the early morning hours of December 4th, martial law across South Korea for all of six hours. So now, I think that so many people we've talked to here, Christina, they aren't confident that this is over yet. They are pretty convinced that prosecutors and investigators are going to try to arrest the president again. So we're going to see a whole host of people stay here or make trips to and from their homes, because this has certainly engulfed South Korean society, and it's not over yet.",

A private security consulting firm warned back in 2019 that Bourbon Street was at risk, particularly for mass shootings and vehicle attacks. The tourist attraction reopened on Thursday with additional security. Authorities have revised the death toll from the New Year's Day attack down to 14. The FBI released new pictures of the suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, walking around the French Quarter in the hours before the attack. One shows a blue cooler, which investigators say contained one of the two improvised explosive devices he planted in the area. The law enforcement source tells CNN, FBI agents and local police found precursor chemicals typically used to make explosives at Jabbar's residence in Houston, Texas. The White House says it has seen no evidence of foreign direction or involvement in the New Orleans attacks, but the FBI is focusing on the suspect's apparent interest in ISIS.

North Carolina, we had an incident in Ohio in 2016, 2017. We had another one in New York City in 2018, Fort Meade, Maryland. So this is a known threat, both overseas, of course, in Europe, as well as in the U.S. There's also been for quite a while now some standards in place from the U.S. DOD, 0201, and one from the ASTM, which is basically an industry standard for safety on what kind of vehicle barriers can you put against what kind of vehicle threat. So it's already known what we can do about this, where you can place these, how they might be the most effective, what grade of vehicle will they stop. The big question has always been, can we make this an enforced standard? Can we make it an industry standard? So local, regional, state, national authorities need to use this, yes or no, at particular type of events, yes or no. And that's still not standardized, and that's part of the big debate now.",

So you're right in that this, again, it's a principal threat. What's sad is it appears that some of the lessons we should have learned from a few years ago have not, or at least we haven't been disciplined about applying the lessons. Europe, in some ways, may have learned them better. We see more standardization in more countries around some of these efforts than perhaps in the U.S. It's always sad that we have a phase after these attacks of basically the blame game, where the lawyers enter the equation. But I'm afraid we're going to see that here now, and hopefully a positive thing will come out of it, and that is, can we go to greater standardization in the design of security measures in public spaces?",

Benjamin Netanyahu's office says Israeli security and intelligence officials are expected to travel to Doha, Qatar for the talks.Meanwhile, Palestinian officials say an Israeli strike in southern Gaza killed 11 people, including the head of Gaza's police and top deputy. Gaza's interior ministry accused Israel of attempting to undermine law and order, while the Israeli military accused the police deputy of being a terrorist in coordination with Hamas. The location of the strike, al-Mawasi, was previously designated by Israel as a humanitarian area, but has repeatedly come under attack. Meanwhile, in Israel, sirens rang out across central Israel early Friday, as the country's military says it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. Shrapnel fell in between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, though there were no reports of injuries at this time. Well, the U.N.
