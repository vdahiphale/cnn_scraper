But this is all supposed to be rooted not in one's philosophical ideology, but instead, based on the Constitution and also the context surrounding it. Remember, the 14th Amendment is a post-Civil War amendment, intended to course correct those who have been disadvantaged, those who have been discriminated against. Black people in America that has also been, of course expanded to include other racial groups, as time has continued. But you saw in the dissent, as you saw in the concurring opinion of Justice Thomas, the conversation really about what the intention of that was supposed to be in the long term. Now, of course, Thomas spent about 10 plus pages going after not only the dissent, generally, but also Ketanji Brown Jackson, the youngest of the Supreme Court justices, of course, in her career. But he focused instead on the idea of a racialized ideology, driving her particular perspective, as opposed to looking at what the Constitution. (CROSSTALK)",

And if you look at the way things were, I mean, he's a realist, basically, when it comes to this. At Harvard, Harvard started in the 1600s. It's much older than the United States. For 300 plus years, they typically allowed into the college 12 or fewer black students prior to 1970, less than one percent. And all of that change when affirmative action was created. And the minute it happens, it gives rise to this extraordinary group of people who go on to run major corporations, you know? They're running Merrill-Lynch.

What I'd like to do is play two pieces of sound. The first is Sonia Sotomayor in 1994 talking about being in her words in affirmative action, baby.
