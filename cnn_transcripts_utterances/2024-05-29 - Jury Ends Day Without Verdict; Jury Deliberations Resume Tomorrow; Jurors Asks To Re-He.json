The jury in Donald Trump's trial asks to rehear key testimony, and we are four hours and 37 minutes into their deliberations. Seven months more. Israel's head of national security warning that destroying Hamas will prolong the war until year end. Korean poop-aganda. North Korea is accused of sending balloons full of filth and rubbish to the South. And Swiatek survives. The world number one tennis star overcomes a spirited challenge from Japan's Naomi Osaka at the French Open. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, the jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial ending the day without a verdict. The panel of 12 jurors, we're talking seven men and five women, will determine whether the former president is innocent or guilty of 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. The jurors are allowed to ask questions through handwritten notes during their deliberations. They can also use a laptop containing the evidence presented in the trial. They must be unanimous in their decision to convict Trump, and there's no time limit for them to reach a verdict. So far, the jury has sent two notes. One, requesting to rehear the jury instructions, and the other, asking to be read back testimony from two witnesses. We're talking former Trump fixer, Michael Cohen, and then the former head of National Enquirer, David Pecker, who killed negative stories about Trump. Just listen to what Trump himself had to say just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I mean, what is very unfair is that I'm not campaigning. I'm in this room all day long, from morning to night, in the Biden witch hunt. Take a look at where the people come from. It's a Biden witch hunt. It's weaponization. So, it seems that there are a lot of witnesses, a lot of people that they could have called that they didn't call. Now, they didn't call them obviously because they would have been very bad witnesses for them. But take a look at the list. Because of the gag order, I won't go down to individual names. But you have a lot of big players, very big players that would have solved their problem or actually would have given us the win. We already have to win. If we had a fair judge, this case would have been over a long time ago. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Can I ask you about the other thing they asked for, which is absolutely mind-boggling to me, which is, I believe, 50 pages of instructions from the judge about how to go about this and they weren't given it in physical form.

And if there are 12 jurors, they'll probably give them six copies. So that when they deliberate and they go through the counts and they're applying the law to the facts as they see them, they have the jury instructions in their hands and they could go through it. I don't like when a judge just reads 50 or more pages of instructions and says, hey, I hope you have a photographic memory. Good luck.

      "sentences": "Yes, there are so many considerations on various sides of this equation here. But ultimately, what this signals isthat the Israeli military is going to plan on continuing to carry out this war in Gaza for at least through the end of this year, but perhaps even longer. It also signals that this Rafah offensive that we are currently witnessing being carried out underway is also not going to be the end of the line for Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip. We have already seen in recent weeks and months, as Israeli troops have gone back into areas that they withdrew from. And so, I think that is something that we could continue to see over the course of the next seven months. And that, of course, points to the larger strategic implications of the length of the fighting that is expected to last in Gaza. And that is because the Israeli prime minister has come under significant criticism in Israel from the United States and also within the ranks of the military for lacking a kind of broader strategic vision, an idea of what to do in Gaza the day after the war, the power vacuum that has existed after the Israeli military has defeated Hamas in certain areas and withdrawn, which has allowed Hamas to return to those very areas. But as you said, this also, of course, about the humanitarian implications. We are already witnessing, just this military offensive in Rafah, which we should say is of a smaller, more targeted scale than what we have seen in Northern Gaza, in places like Khan Younis as well. But even that is resulting in the mass displacement of nearly a million people, disrupting humanitarian aid operations in Rafah itself. The World Central Kitchen today announcing that they were shutting down their main kitchen in Rafah. And we're also seeing, as the fighting in general near the Kerem Shalom Crossing, near the Erez Crossing in the northern part of the Gaza Strip is causing enormous disruption to the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. So, seven months more of fighting means seven months of disruption to those efforts, seven months of continued suffering, of course, in the Gaza Strip.",

Two sources familiar with the investigation telling CNN a federal grand jury could soon hear from Combs' accusers. Combs has been named in eight civil lawsuits since November. Seven of those accuse him of directly committing sexual assault. Additional sources say federal investigators have interviewed most of the plaintiffs. Josh Campbell joins us now from Los Angeles.

That is when one person accuses someone else of doing something wrong. But what we're now seeing are federal agents here in the United States actually latch on to those civil suits and indicate that they are now going to investigate this criminally, which, of course, carries significant potential charges. Now, this new exclusive reporting from our colleague, Elizabeth Wagmeister, really incredible reporting, talking about the escalation here. We're now hearing from sources that those accusers have been told that they will soon be brought before a federal grand jury. What that means here in the United States is, you know, federal agents, if there's an allegation of wrongdoing, they start their preliminary investigation, but if they decide that they want to criminally charge someone and prosecute someone, they then take witnesses and documents and evidence before a grand jury, which will ultimately decide on potential charges. So, a significant step here. Interestingly, you know, this all comes after that dramatic raid at homes owned by Sean Combs, both here in Los Angeles and as well as in Miami. We were told that law enforcement agents went in collecting all kinds of evidence, digital media, other evidence. A law enforcement source told me that that pertained to an ongoing sex trafficking investigation. And so, Julia, you can very much see these allegations aligning. You have all of these accusers accusing Diddy of sexual violations, and now federal agents coming in saying, we're going to start an investigation of their own.

Voters have been flocking to other parties as the ANC fails to get a grip on blackouts, unemployment, and crime. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito says he will not recuse himself from two politically charged cases, one involving Former President Trump, and another concerning the January 6th Capitol Hill riot. Alito's impartiality is being questioned over an upside-down American flag outside one of his homes. And an \"appeal to heaven\" flag outside another. Both those symbols have been embraced by the January 6th rioters. Alito says it was his wife who raised those flags and that he asked her to take one of them down. He says the upside-down flag was related to a neighborhood dispute.

Anyone born before the internet knows these shops once provided an essential service when it came to researching travel of any kind, really. The humble travel agent once served as one of the only points of sale for tickets. They were also a place, too, to go for advice. And my next guest is about to use artificial intelligence to try to do what they used to do. Booking's A.I. trip planner can build itineraries and offer help if something goes wrong. But one challenge not even A.I. can fix is over tourism, from fences going up in Japan, blocking the view of Mount Fuji, to this anti-tourism demonstration in Majorca earlier this month, some popular destinations are fighting back against the annual flow of visitors. And it's interesting to note, Majorca was one of the most searched destinations on booking.com. Glenn Fogel is the CEO and president of Bookings Holdings, whose family of brands include car rental and restaurant reservations, as well as travel. Glenn, fantastic to have you back on the show. Thank you for joining us. Just put that sharp rise in airline bookings into context for us, because I listened into your last earnings call and you were talking about normalization, at least in certain parts of the world, even if Asia continues to remain a huge growth hotspot since they came out the pandemic latest.",

Of course, part of that is due to the currency is relatively inexpensive for a U.S. outbound traveler goingto Japan, it looks relatively inexpensive. So, that's certainly -- one of the things I noticed, we're looking at what the highest increase in searches for Paris year over year are, and it looks like the Japanese traveler going from Japan to Paris is currently increased for us in terms of searches, which I wouldn't have thought of. Very big. Obviously, a lot of people want to see the Olympics. But what's interesting, of course, is that people who don't want to see the Olympics are probably going to go away from Paris because they won't want to deal with the crowds.",

Let's talk about the over populant -- over population of some tourist sites as well. I mean, Majorca is one that I mentioned. Japan, to our point, about the optimism there. Is that having any impact on what you're seeing in terms of at least searches or booking activity, or is it also perhaps a reason even to go?",

And there are certainly some areas of the world that are suffering from over tourism, and some ofthe places are beginning to try and come up with ways to lower the number of people coming. Venice now has a daily tax. And there are other places that are trying to deal with their over -- an overabundance of business, so to speak. It's something that's going to get probably -- more people want to travel, more and more people get to a level where they can travel, and everybody wants to see the most popular places. And now, what we're going to do about that, obviously, it's going to be interesting. One can do many different things. Taxes is one way, make it more expensive. Now that, of course, then hurts people who can't afford to go to places. Another way, lottery systems, for example, some of the places, for example, a rare, rare thing, people want to climb certain mountains. Well, you have to get a permit and you get a -- it's a lottery ticket to get the permit. There are lots of different ways to deal with it. But somebody in -- primarily governments, are going to have to deal with this because the people who live in these areas are the ones who are actually having to deal with it.",

Overall, for us, globally, not a big deal. But for the local area, there is a boost, particularly if it's a smaller location. I mean, Singapore, when she went to travel, certainly got an economic boost from the concert there. And I'll tell you, it's something that people ask about Paris and say, well, is it going to affect our business, Booking Holdings? And I'll say, well, not much because people are going to travel any which way and they go to the Olympics, they would have gone somewhere else.

She looked quite rusty there, but the 26-year-old, I mean, she really looks like she's now returned to form, because Swiatek, she did end up taking that opening set. It was a hard-fought set. It ended up in a tie break that Swiatek won. But Osaka, then just rolled through the second set winning 6-1, and she kept that going in the third. She went all the way up 5-2, but that's when Swiatek really showed. I mean, she's got the heart of a champion. The two- time defending French Open champ was down to match point. It was about to lose to Osaka, but she just kept fighting. Swiatek was able to come all the way back, win that third set.
