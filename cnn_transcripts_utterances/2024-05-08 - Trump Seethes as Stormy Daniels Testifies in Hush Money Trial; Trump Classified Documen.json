But it was not until afterwards it -- it now puts it back, front and center, in a presidential campaign.And one of the political questions is, is that going to matter? We know that there are somewhere around 10 percent of voters who say they're truly undecided, which seems kind of crazy, because like, all this time, with all these years with these two guys, you still don't know how you feel, but there are about 10 percent of voters who say they're undecided. There are about a quarter of voters who say maybe they are persuadable. So they're not that enthralled with either choice. They could change their mind. If even a fraction of those voters were -- if their decision were shaped, either by Stormy Daniels's testimony or by the outcome of this case and the race were very tight in a key state, that could make a difference. So politically, it's possible that this will make a difference, but I think there's so many things going on. There's the kind of sordid, lascivious drama and the sort of details that have been recounted. Then there are the technical parameters of the case. The prosecutors felt that they needed to put her out there in order to establish sort of the tenets for -- for what is a business crime case.",

I think there's a question as to who shows up? You know, some people say those values voters -- well, you know, I like what Trump has done for traditional American values. We hear that. This is not traditional American values, folks. Are they going to actually show up and vote for him at the end of the day? And then of course, this question is being asked on the left.

They couldn't. And look, I think you -- they will eventually consolidate, because I think, as we saw in 2016, they do want to win. And I think, to Margaret's point, I mean, this is essentially -- I'm not a lawyer, but it's a business records case. And so, to the extent that this becomes a titillating sort of thing, and it becomes very lurid, I think Democrats -- the prosecutors risk losing the plot of this whole thing.

There are women who are strongly pro-choice. And that is going to animate turnout, perhaps more than this. Because I think this element of Donald Trump is baked in with women.

A surveillance camera capturing an out-of-control car going airborne in Phoenix Monday night. Police say no injuries were reported, but the driver ran off. They are searching for him now. In the NBA playoffs, the Boston Celtics cruising to a game one v new again won victory over Cleveland, defeating the Cavs 120-95 last night. The Celtics, led by Jaylen Brown's 32 points, connected on 18 three- pointers. Arizona's Flying Bucket Wildfire doubling in size in 24 hours, burning 4,000 acres West of Maricopa. Officials believe it was started by people firing guns. Parts of Michigan under a state of emergency after a tornado swept through, injuring at least a dozen residents of a mobile home park and trapping another 50 people in a FedEx building nearby as it tore the roof off.

You can see those strong storms stretching from upstate New York all the way back to Arkansas. Lots of lightning with these, some of them still strong at this hour. That's why you've got this tornado watch in effect here. You can see a couple. It almost looks like it's split there. That will expire here in about the next 40 minutes or so, but it's very likely we'll get additional tornado watches as we go through the rest of the day. And that's because we have yet another threat for severe weather today. It's just going to shift a little bit further East and a little bit further South than what we saw yesterday. The main focus point is going to be right here across the mid- Mississippi valley. So Louisville, St. Louis, Nashville, back over into Little Rock. But really, any of these areas you see here have the potential for the damaging winds. A tornado. And yes, even some very large hail could also be an option for several of these areas. [06:25:15] And that's just going to add to the total number. Looking at just the last 48 hours, we had 47 tornado reports, almost 300 damaging wind reports and 138 hail reports, some of them quite large. Larger than golf balls. And again, even just specifically tornadoes, we have now had several days in a row -- 13 to be exact -- of tornado reports, for a total of 290 tornado reports just since April 25th.
