I'm Erin Burnett, along with Wolf Blitzer and his post over overlooking the convention floor.

Meanwhile, the South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, a very prominent voice in the MAGA movement, will be speaking as well.

But I should note that over the last 24 hours, what Trump was doing in these conversations was weighing the pros and cons of what they would bring in his ticket, what would mean for his chances in November. And I'm told that he became, Erin, so focused on this last 24 hours that he was kind of brushing off questions about his health and instead saying, what do you think of this person for VP. Should I pick them? What do you do? Like, what does that look like? He was getting calls from Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, essentially, everyone under the sun who had an opinion and about who they would like to see on that ticket with that. But, of course, we saw Senator Vance over here. I'm on the delegation floor. You can see Florida could see Florida is right behind me. We've got Pennsylvania and Wisconsin delegations right here to must-win states for Donald Trump come November, a lot of action is going to happen on this floor. We are told a lot of the speeches that you're going to hear had been rewritten since what happened on Saturday night, namely the ones on the main stage. So keep an eye out for that.

Quite frankly, which has been the argument that you've heard Donald Trump making on the campaign trail throughout the entirety of this campaign, that prices are too high. And again, prices have come down. I understand where the statistics are in that, but we also see in a lot of the research on in conversations with voters, you hear people still experiencing economic pain, just in the prices of what they're paying at the supermarket and the like, and I have no doubt we're going to hear a lot of that. The other thing that's infused in this program, Wolf, and I, what they call everyday Americans. And you're going to hear, in addition to politics, right now, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson behind his address to the convention, you're going to hear from everyday Americans who have very identifiable stories. This to me is part of the play of trying to broaden the appeal that the Republican Party is making here. They understand mostly partisans tune in and watch this, but it's a huge opportunity to try in these battleground states to try and reach some of these critical voters and I think having everyday Americans tell the economic pain story is going to be part of the table.",
