The IDF also continuing to carry out strikes in Gaza, targeting the Hamas commanders who planned and pull off that terror attack on Israel, and with it, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is only getting worse. A warning, some of the new images coming in, they are disturbing. This new video that we will show you is a fresh view of the crisis. You can see very clearly what it is. It is a massive burial of Gazans killed. Body backs placed in rose, as you can see, row after row after row. Also this morning, we are hearing a new urgent plea from the mother of one of the hostages that Hamas is holding. This mother -- and this is Mia Shem.

These rockets do have a paralyzing effect on the community, but there are very few casualties as a result of them, which is a very stark contrast to what we have been seeing in Gaza this morning, reports of at least six airstrikes in southern Gaza.You might remember, this is the area that Israel's defense forces have told people to evacuate from their homes in northern Gaza and move into. Gaza's health ministry saying at least 60 people killed in those six airstrikes. They took very close to the Rafah Border crossing in the south and along the border with Egypt. This is the border crossing that there have been furious negotiations and diplomatic efforts to try to open that up to provide some respite, some relief to people inside of Gaza and also to get some of the most severely injured out of Gaza as well as foreign nationals. Again, that border crossing has not opened today. The U.N. warning that the situation is dramatically deteriorating, spiraling, in fact quite out of control. Six hundred thousand people Sara have moved from their homes in northern Gaza to southern Gaza in the hopes of finding some respite in some refuge. They've done that with airstrikes, and they still do not have water, they do not have electricity, and they are running out of food.

And what is important to remember here, when we're talking about the basics running out, it is not just about this humanitarian crisis unfolding moment by moment. It is being added to, Sarah, because those bombs continue to rain it down on Gaza, meaning more deaths, meaning more injuries, meaning more people flooding into a overwhelmed hospital system, and there is no safe place to go. That's what rights groups are saying.
