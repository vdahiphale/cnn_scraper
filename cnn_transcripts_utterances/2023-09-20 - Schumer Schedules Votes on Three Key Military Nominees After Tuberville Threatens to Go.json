In just 10 days on September 30th, the funding runs out for many federal agencies. The impasse is so severe that lawmakers can't even agree on the band-aid, a stopgap resolution a CR, to kick the can down the road. What's more, the stalemate is essentially all inside the Republican Party because far-right hardliners will not budget on their spending cuts.Now one veteran Republican said his conference is, quote, being dragged down by 20 people, but 200 of us are in agreement. They want their way or the highway. CNN's Manu Raju joins us now live from Capitol Hill. So Manu, Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that there was progress today. Bring us up to speed with what's happening.",

Just about a one-month plan, just a band-aid of sources before they try to negotiate the larger spending package. But there are still sharp disagreements about how to move ahead.In just matter of minutes, they was -- how the full House Republican Conference will meet in the room behind me as they tried to hash out all these disagreements. It's not just between conservatives and moderates, but a sharp division among conservatives themselves about how far to go in terms of spending cuts. And the real challenge for Kevin McCarthy is that if he goes too far to the right and gives in to those demands, he will lose moderates. And also the real warning from a number of those same conservatives that he works with Democrats to keep the government open, it could cost Speaker McCarthy his job. That is a warning level today by Matt Gaetz, someone who's been threatening to force a vote seeking McCarthy's ouster, reiterating that threat just moments ago to me saying, if McCarthy does indeed try to cut a bipartisan deal, he will no longer be Speaker. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): With all due respect to my conservative colleagues, let them go explain why they don't support that. It's completely inexplicable. And I think it's indefensible. So you know, here we set. So now we got to go try to figure out how to move the ball forward. But we had agreement in good faith with people across the conference.",

TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): I would never like to see a shutdown, but if that's where it's going, that's where it's going. (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera): And that last comment, something that has been echoed up and down the line about the growing expectation that a shut down will happen here. How they get out of it remains to be seen because as I mentioned, Boris, they don't just have to get out of the House, they got to get an agreement between the Senate. And Republican and Democrats are on much different pages between the Senate and the House. There's an agreement in the Senate on how to move forward. A non-agreement with how the House Republicans are dealing with this and much alone, letting the president signed this into law as well. So just so many questions here on Capitol Hill as the Speaker's job also in a very tenuous position -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Brianna. Yes, I just want to stick with that clip for just a moment more, Brianna. Because the question that Chairman Powell was asked right before the clip we heard there, is, is a soft landing the baseline? A soft landing of course, being inflation coming in closer to target two percent without a recession. And Jay Powell said, oh no, no, no. I wouldn't say that. And then he said, what you heard him say. So really not trying to box himself in in terms of what the path looks for ahead.Now in terms of some of the things that are out of his control. Look, he was asked about the UAW strike. He was asked about the potential for a government shutdown. He was asked about student loan repayments and gas prices. And Brianna, on most of these topics, most of these areas, he didn't really go into detail because of the obvious political nature. But he did say it's the strikes, the government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments. There are a lot of things that you can look at. So what we try to do is assess all of them and handicap all of them. Ultimately, though, there is so much uncertainty around these things. He did, however, go into a bit more detail about the rise up, the rise in energy prices. What we've seen at the pump. But also what we've seen in crude prices. And he said that if prices remain high for a sustained period of time, that's when it becomes more concerning for the Fed in terms of its inflationary impact. But just to sort of take a broader view here in terms of this meeting, they paused again for the second time in about six policy meetings but left open the door that we will likely see another rate hike in the remaining two meetings this year. And looking ahead to 2024 and 2025, fewer rate cuts, so fewer rate cuts than we had been previously expecting. And what that essentially means is that they expect rates to remain higher for longer. Now also something to point out here is that when you look at other economic indicators, GDP, unemployment, they actually expect those areas to hold up stronger than they previously had. But pausing, but certainly not saying that he expects a soft landing. Not yet.",

That's just a year and a half from now, and basically what they want to do is get it down to 90 percent of animals that are coming in, get adopted. 10 percent usually are too sick to be adopted, that sort of thing. And so it's a remarkable goal. And you, you can understand why they're successful. You know, you go out to their facility in Utah, it's like a animal rescue National Park or the facility in Arkansas is like an Apple store.
