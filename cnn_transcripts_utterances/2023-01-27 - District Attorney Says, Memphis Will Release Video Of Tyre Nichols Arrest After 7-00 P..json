And we believe that both of the video and the evidence as a whole will show that the defendants had to have known at least that it was reasonably certain that what they were doing would cause death.And although the video indicates that each person acted in a somewhat different way they nonetheless were acting together, and I believe all of their actions contributed to the death of Tyre Nichols, which is why we are charging all of them with the same charges. I think aggravated assault is pretty obvious. The kidnapping charge is just the fact that I think, as Laura Coates was describing to you earlier, regardless of whatever position you take about, whether the initial stop was legal, there came a point at which this was an unlawful detention. That unlawful detention was false imprisonment. It was confinement without authorization of law, which restricted someone's liberty, and it became aggravated kidnapping once bodily injury occurred and also given the fact that they had deadly weapons on them.",

The fire department hasn't seen this video. So, now, 20 days later, they themselves are now launching an investigation to figure out what happened.

It is absolute vicious savagery.You are seeing things on this video that are not taught in any police academy in this country. And so it is. As a member of the law enforcement community, it is disgusting, it is embarrassing and it really drags the entire community down. But I think it also speaks loudly to this question of an undercurrent of toxic culture in our community and the law enforcement community that leads to situations like this. You can see from the absolute first minute of that video, the response at the traffic stop, where you have police officers bailing out of their cars at 100 percent intensity level, screaming profanities, guns drawn, racing up to the vehicle before they really have any legitimate way of understanding what they're facing. It's impossible to imagine that. Whatever led up to this traffic stop could provoke a response to that nature. And at that point, it's game on. There's absolute no restraint at any level. It's just -- it's horrific. So, I understand why you're getting those texts. I'm getting the same text messages.",

      "sentences": "So, I think it is troubling for a couple reasons, right? So, legally, the first question you are going to ask is why they stopped him in the first instance. Was this is pre- textual stop, pre-textual stop, meaning without basis, you're just looking to find something, or giving the police the benefit of the doubt. Was he engaged in this reckless driving that we're speaking of, right? That gives you the ability and basis legally for the stop, but then everything after that has to be legally justified in proper.And then the other question has to be, right, and more for law enforcement personnel, Chief Ramsey, perhaps, John, is tactically speaking, right? And I don't even think the experts need to answer that. Is it an appropriate way to engage with someone when you are throwing F bombs at them? How about, sir, we are stopping you because, may I see your license or registration? We have reason to believe A, B and C, get out of the car, get out of the car, get out of the car. And so that escalation of it, John, makes it turn right from the outset into an encounter, which is not only dangerous but, of course, ends up to be deadly. So, I think we are going to see an examination of all that, the predicate for the stop, whether was lawful and legitimate, what was the encounter like, could the encounter had been different, what the actions that were taken by the police with respect to getting him out of the car, was that necessary with regard to the force used to get them on the ground, with regard to the force used in the initial accounts, et cetera. So, we're going to see all of that play out. But I think this one thing which everyone is agreeing upon, is that this did not need to happen. Mr. Nichols should still be alive and that the tactics and approach of these police officers was patently deplorable.",

He's a Starbucks aficionado and he likes taking Instagram photographs of sunsets. I mean, this is not somebody who is in the life.You know, I've got kids that are like that. He is a good kid. And he got in a situation, he got scared. You know, he is trying to talk these folks down. He's saying yes sir. He's saying all right. He is trying to calm the cops down and they hit him in the face with pepper spray. And you and I know what that is. That is a bear repellent. You're supposed to squirt that stuff and a grizzly bear will run the other way. And he panicked. And there was no reason for them to have used that level of force against him when he was trying to comply. And then you are in this nightmare scenario. And you pray this doesn't happen to your own son. You pray this doesn't happen to your own children. And so, this is very personal for us. We see ourselves in his face and his voice. He was doing what we tell our kids to do. He was saying, okay. I'm trying to calm you down. Yes sir. And it didn't work. And it didn't work. And that's the nightmare I think for a lot of us.",

I think probably, unfortunately, one of the more famous echoes we hear from that is George Floyd, but let's be completely and 100 percent honest here. This is something that will not stop happening in this country until people actually come up with a plan.It's not just pouring more money into training. It's not just community policing as we say it all the time. It's not adding more police. There is something fundamentally wrong with the system of policing in this country. And it doesn't matter whether or not you are black or white. The commonality and I think Van will (inaudible) that goes from Emmett Till all the way to what we saw today back to George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, all of the names that we can imagine, is that the common theme is that these black folks did not get the benefit of their humanity. And until police officers, and the way that we police our communities. Until they start to see young men, young boys, regardless of whether or not they (inaudible) or regardless of whether or not they are free spirits or anyone in between as actual human beings, because the way they treated him today was -- or the video we saw, the way they treated him, was less than human. The way that the officers beat him, less than human. The way they didn't even care for him, less than human. And the crazy part about this, Van and Don, is I dare say, that if it was me or you, we would have gotten our ass beat the same way.
