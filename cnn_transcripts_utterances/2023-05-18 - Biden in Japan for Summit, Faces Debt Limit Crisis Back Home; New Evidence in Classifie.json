But the president is under growing pressure from allies, as well, to give Ukraine fighter jets that they believe would help turn the tide against Russia's brutal invasion.This trip was also supposed to showcase unity against China. But the White House is cutting the trip short by two stops so the president can race back to Washington for those talks on the debt ceiling. There's only two weeks left to reach a deal with House Republicans before the U.S. government would potentially default on its debts. As Poppy noted, CNN's chief White House correspondent, Phil Mattingly, is live in Hiroshima, traveling with President Biden. Obviously, Phil, we know the president has a busy schedule here, but this is, you know, such a rare moment where the president is on a world stage, but his domestic issues followed him abroad. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Kaitlan, what you saw there in terms of ignoring that question as the press was trying to get some kind of answer related to what's going on back home, is just kind of an acute window into a very delicate balancing act that will define the next several days. And that's not because the issues are not of import here in Hiroshima. When you talk to U.S. officials, they are very cognizant that on two fronts in particular -- the ongoing war in Ukraine from Russia's invasion, as well as the continual rise, tensions and major issues when it comes to China -- will be central. And, yet, particularly on that latter point, the president having to cut his trip short -- not going to Papua New Guinea, not going to Australia -- underscores just how difficult things are. Kaitlan, you would know this well. Bruce Reed, the president's deputy chief of staff, doesn't often go on foreign trips. He's on this trip, in large part because of his central role in those debt ceiling negotiations. At least in terms of the policy side of things. But the focus, very clearly, will be on those central issues with Ukraine, with China, and with G-7 leaders, which have remained remarkably united throughout the course of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in terms of economic sanctions and in terms of assistance to Ukraine, and most particularly, in terms of defensive assistance of Ukraine. There's still some very serious issues to deal with on that front, as well. But also, the president, since he's been in office, has been trying to pull particularly European leaders into an alliance in terms of the posture as it relates to China. And that will be a focal point, as well. So certainly issues back home. But the issues here are critical and certainly what the president wants to focus on.",

And this is my question to them, and it really has been, I think, for the last several years.The level of unsettled anxiety in the four years preceding this administration, particularly with European allies. One of the president's top priorities when he came to international issues, when he came in -- and Kaitlan knows this as well as anybody -- was trying to make clear that, in his words, America is back. America is back on the world stage. America is back in a leadership position. And my question repeatedly over the course of the last day or two has been, Do you think that's actually the case when two things are going on? One, we have this kind of domestic issue when it comes to the debt limit right now. A very real possibility that the U.S. defaults for the first time in its history. But also, given the fact that the former president, President Trump, is leading Republican polls to be the nominee by a significant margin. How does that make officials feel? One European diplomat told me, we're used to it when it came to the debt ceiling. They assume there will be a resolution here, and they understand what the president has to do. As of 2024, the official said, just don't want to talk about things that I don't want to think about right now. And I think that's a good kind of encapsulation. So it will all be happening behind scenes and definitely about conversations. Will they bring in that stuff publicly? Probably not.

Now, the next warning came in October of 2022, where he was in a briefing, essentially, and he was asking very deep questions, deep- dive questions into intelligence, really, that had nothing to do with his job. And the superiors there told him that he needs to really focus on his actual duties which, of course, were related to I.T. He was essentially an I.T. person for the Air National Guard there in Massachusetts. And so there was essentially a cease-and-desist order for him to stop doing these deep dives into this kind of intelligence. Then in January of 2023 of this year, he was again observed doing these kind of deep dives into intelligence. And he was warned again by his superiors not to do it. It does not seem like he was actually reprimanded at that point by his commanders. But it was noted in these Air National Guard memos that he was looking at things and looking at intelligence that he was not supposed to be doing. And we should note that the commanders there actually offered him a new position if he wanted to look into this intelligence more, if he wanted more kind of exposure to it in a way that actually comported with his duties. They offered to move him into a new job that would allow him to do it. So instead of really taking away his access to this classified information, after three strikes against him, essentially, they offered to simply move him into a new job. Now, we did reach out to the Air National Guard for comment. They said they cannot comment right now, because it is an ongoing investigation. But they did suspend two commanders in his unit, pending the outcome of this investigation. And the entire intelligence mission was actually taken away from this unit, pending the completion of the investigation. So we'll see how this shakes out on Friday when he has his hearing, where a judge is going to determine whether or not he's going to stay behind bars.

Democrats tried to stall that process. The filed more than a thousand amendments. The bill would ban most abortions after early cardiac activity is detected, a time before many women, we should note doctors say, even know they are pregnant. There are a few exceptions, including for fatal fetal abnormalities, the health and life of the mother, and exceptions up to 12 weeks for cases of rape, incest or underaged pregnancy. Let's go to our Amara Walker. She is live for us in Atlanta. Good morning. Are there other legislative options left for Democrats? Or is this it? AMARA WALKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: It looks like this is it, Poppy, unless the Republican-controlled Senate unexpectedly reverses course once it gets the House bill. But that seems highly unlikely. So the one option the Democrats did have, Poppy, in the South Carolina House was to delay passage of the six-week abortion ban. But given that the Republicans have a super majority, it was inevitable that this bill would pass, even after 20 hours of debate and two days. So look, this has been quite a contentious issue within the Republican Party in South Carolina. As you know, both -- the Republicans control both chambers. But for months, they were at an impasse, and they had disagreed over just how restrictive an abortion ban should be in the state. In fact, just a few weeks ago, the Senate actually blocked a near total abortion ban, where you saw several Republican women voting against it. But prior to that, in February, the Senate did pass a less restrictive abortion ban, which was this Senate bill 474, which was a six-week abortion ban. And so now the House has done the same. Where do things go from here? So this bill, which has a few changes to it now, now goes back to the South Carolina Senate. And then, once the bill passes the Senate, then it will go to the Republican governor, Henry McMaster, who has indicated he will sign this bill. And until then, it is legal to have an abortion in South Carolina up until 22 weeks of pregnancy, Poppy.",

The couple's spokesperson described the incident as, quote, \"a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi.\" That's a quote.But there are conflicting accounts about the extent of the danger and how long it lasted. Joining us now is Max Foster. Max, good morning to you. Obviously, we all think about Princess Diana and how she died, of course. And that has haunted Prince Harry. What do we know about the taxi driver who drove them at one point in all of this? MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: Well, they changed cars a couple of times, as I understand it, from someone that was in the entourage of Harry and Meghan. And the taxi was less than ten minutes of that journey. So they are basically suggesting we shouldn't over-emphasize what the taxi driver experienced. The longer, more than, like, hour, two-hour journey was a chase. We know that it was a chase. It wasn't a high- speed chase. We've learned that. And to be fair to the Sussexes, they never actually said it was. And as you say, all of this is much more traumatizing to Harry because of what he went through as a child. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Prince Harry, Meghan and her mother, Doria Ragland, attended the Women of Vision Awards at the Ziegfield Ballroom in New York City. Meghan was honored for her global advocacy to empower women and girls. But it wasn't until they left the event that things allegedly escalated. A local law enforcement source tells CNN a, quote, \"swarm of paparazzi\" followed them in cars, motorcycles and scooters. The convoy eventually went to the 19th Precinct, where the couple waited until they could safely leave. Chris Sanchez, a member of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's security detail, says they switched cars more than once during the chase. They were first seen in a black car and then a yellow cab. The driver of that cab says he noticed the paparazzi before as the couple's security guard started to tell him the address to drive to.",

The NYPD, who provided assistance to the Sussexes' security team, says the paparazzi made the transport of Harry and Meghan challenging. But there were no reports of collisions, injuries, or arrests. The couple's security team say the duke and duchess and their convoy were pursued by the paparazzi for more than two hours, allegedly resulting in \"multiple near collisions\" with other drivers, pedestrians, and two NYPD officers, adding the Sussexes, who were staying at a private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, did not want to compromise the security at their friend's home. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has questioned the validity of that two-hour time frame but says nothing like this should ever happen in a city as dense as the Big Apple, calling the incident \"reckless\" and \"irresponsible.\" MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: You shouldn't be speeding anywhere. But this is a densely-populated city. And I think all of us, I don't think there's many of us who don't recall how his mom died. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
