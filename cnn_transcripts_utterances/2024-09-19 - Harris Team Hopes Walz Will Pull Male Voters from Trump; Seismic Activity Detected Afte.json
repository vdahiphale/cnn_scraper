This was, you know, almost 500 kilometers from the border. We've seen them hit targets much further away. But range combined with precision, combined with clearly what was the, what was a very potent weapon for Ukraine. to be able to cause that level of destruction, that level of explosion at a military depot. Which when it was built in 2018, was touted as basically indestructible. Something that could have withstood a nuclear attack. Clearly, either the ammunition and missiles were not being kept in the tightest of security, or it wasn't, as it seems, indestructible. So there's that. President Zelensky is praising the inspiring precision of this. Clearly, look, this is a tactical thing for Ukraine. They have got to try to destroy these missiles before they reach their targets in Ukraine. That we're now going into the third winter of the war. The U.N. just put out a report that said that Russia has destroyed half of the generating capacity that Ukraine would need. Electricity generating capacity that Ukraine would need going into the winter. So there's that. But I think, look, there's also clearly some messaging here in this strategy of hitting these very high profile targets in Russia, which is to say to the West, look, we can do this as Zelenskyy continues his campaign for permission to use these Western provided long-range missiles on Russian soil. There's no decision on that yet, but he is set to travel to the U.S. next week for the U.N. General Assembly.",

It has been building them with greater sort of range. We've seen them hit targets, you know, 1,200, 1,300 kilometers from the border. So more than twice this distance. But also increasing their power as well.So this is something that they've been able to manufacture themselves, which, of course, gets around the issue of NATO provided weapons hitting Russian soil. But if you have a missile like the Storm Shadow or like the ATACMS, the payload is much greater. So they could, albeit within a smaller range, inflict much greater damage.",

I think there's an understanding in Ukraine that if the war is just in Donbas, if it's just, you know, war village after village, this relentless, grinding, almost World War I-style combat, Ukraine is going to lose over time because Russia is just bigger. It has more men, more equipment to throw at it.And Russia itself on the home front has not been suffering. And so Ukraine has already expanded its campaign inside Russia. We have seen almost everyday attacks by Ukrainian drones on Russian airfields, military airfields, and Russian ammunition facilities and Russian fuel reserves, which are really taking a toll on the Russian war effort already. But that's mostly using drones, which while effective, are slow. So for example, when Ukraine attacks a Russian military airfield, the Russian planes have the time to take off. And so Zelenskyy has been asking and will be asking Washington for more and more permission to use this long range missiles that will be much more effective.",

You know, survival was very difficult and required making a lot of compromises. And I think this novel examines this price of survival, whether it's worth it and what do you have to do to survive this big grinder of history.
