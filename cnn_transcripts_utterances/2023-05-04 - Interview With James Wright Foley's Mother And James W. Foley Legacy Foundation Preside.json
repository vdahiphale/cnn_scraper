Then, holding the high court to account. Maine Senator, Angus King, talk Supreme Court ethics with Walter Isaacson. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's been hostage week in Washington, D.C. with activities to call attention to Americans wrongfully detained in foreign prisons. Family members and supporters are holding a rally and a vigil, bringing attention to the detainee's plight. More than 50 Americans are trapped in countries ranging from Iran, Venezuela, to Russia. And the nature of the threat is changing and growing. The primary captors are now state actors, deliberately targeting journalists, aid workers and others, using them as pawns to advance whatever claims they have against the United States. A driving force behind that week's event is the James W. Foley Foundation, which fights to free the wrongfully detained and protect journalists around the world. The foundation was launched by Diane Foley, mother of James Foley, who was publicly and horrifically executed by ISIS almost 10 years ago. I spoke with Diane Foley about channeling her grief into action. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There is nothing -- it really requires the best of all of our countries, the International Community to address this issue. It really does. So, we have been pushing for a reevaluation of our current hostage enterprise to deal with the fact that now, 90 percent of U.S. nationals are, in fact, taken by state governments, which is totally different, as you said, Christian, than just 10 years ago when it was terrorist, criminals, pirates.

They're not really prisoners, they're hostages by these state governments who, you know, use their American passport, you know, as a pawn. The Namazi family, the Tahbaz family, the Emad Shargi family have all been on my program begging to have at least a meeting with the president, for the families to feel that it's a top priority and to be able to tell the president about their pain.

So, the administration is very aware. And those brave family members will continue to demand a meeting, and I pray that our president will at some point do that. However, the fact that he has not met does not mean that he is not looking at the issue. I just think Iran is a particularly difficult captor to deal with.

We're basically saying, adopt a code of ethics because that's what's needed to reassure the public after these recent revelations.

The Supreme Court justices do have financial reporting requirements and didn't report these, you know, luxury vacations and who bought the house and those kinds of things.

Now, they ought to do it themselves. They ought to take the hint. There's no question that they have the power to do it themselves, they shouldn't need an act of Congress to require them to do it. But so far, they haven't taken that step and they have resisted it. Justice Roberts sent a long letter to Dick Durbin and the Judiciary Committee and has said, we consult with people and we'll follow the substance of rules. That's not good enough.

How about following the rules? And what we're really talking about is, tell us what the rules are. It's hard to tell whether conduct is appropriate if you don't have any standard for defining what's appropriate. Justice Thomas, for example, justified his failure to report a $500,000 vacation by saying, well, I consulted people and they said it was OK. And it's OK to take hospitality. And it just isn't clear. For example, in the main judicial code of conduct there is an exception for hospitality. But you know it says? Ordinary hospitality. That is a dinner every now and then or maybe a round of golf. It's not a private jet and a yacht in the Philippines. Nobody would define that as ordinary hospitality. So, that's what I mean. Let's have a code of judicial conduct.

I can't believe that John Roberts wants his legacy on the Supreme Court to be a catastrophic decline in public confidence in his very important institution.",

This is Shakespeare, methinks he doth protests too much. If there are no problems, if you have consultation and are following some kind of vague standards that are undefined, then why are you resisting so stoutly, doing something that, again, applies to every other judge in America, including every federal judge in America? It just -- it doesn't make sense to me that they are resisting so strongly something that I think ordinary citizens would say, huh, why aren't they doing this?",

      "sentences": "Yes. But number one, we don't have lifetime appointments. We have to answer to the voters every two years in the house, every six years in theSenate. Clearly, and I'm not saying judges can't have a social life, but I am saying that the whole -- the heart of the judicial canon of ethics -- and I remember learning this in law school, is that judges must avoid impropriety and should avoid the appearance of impropriety. Avoid the appearance of impropriety, why? Because the -- again, to go back, the court's authority rests upon public trust. If people think the courts are rigged, they are not fair or are a subject to influenced by special interests, then they're going to say, why do we have to listen to these people? Why do we have to abide by their rulings? You know, President Jackson famously said, if the Supreme Court wants to enforce this order, it can have its own army, or something along those lines. You're a historian, you know better than me, the quote. But the point is, it's the moral authority of the court that is so important and we live in an age of declining confidence in public institutions. And here I am, a member of Congress, which, you know, has a pretty low approval rating itself, but at least we are answerable to the people. And that, to me, makes this what we are talking about here even more important. You've got nine people who have enormous power over Americans' lives, lifetime appointments. And now, I go back to Madison, or even go back further, go back to the Romans. You know the quote, quis custodes ipsos custodiet, who will guard the guardians? Madison put it another way and he used the term men, but we now know it would have been men and women. But he said, if men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to staff the government over man, no checks and balances would be necessary. However, in a government of men over men, there must be a way. First, we have to empower the government to control the governed and then oblige the government to control itself. And that's really what we're talking about here. Who will guard the guardians? And all we're talking about is just tell us what your rules are and be transparent about it, to restore confidence in this critically important institution.",

But as yousay, the -- Mitch McConnell went to the floor, I think the morning of our bill, and he wasn't talking about our bill. He was basically saying, we're not going to do anything with Supreme Court ethics. That's an attack on the court. And this week was the hearing the Judiciary Committee on this issue and the Republicans basically took the position, anything you talk about the Supreme Court is an attack on the court, an attack on Justice Thomas. That's not true. I mean, our bill is wholly forward-looking. It's not retroactive, it doesn't impose any penalties. It basically just says, a year from now, Supreme Court, tell us what your rules are going to be. Tell us the rules that you're going to follow, make them public and then, let's -- we'll move on as cases arise. But you're right, the Republicans have decided that, you know, this is just unacceptable. Interestingly, Dick Durbin, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to the chief justice on this issue in something like February of 2012 when Barack Obama was president. So, it's not as if this issue has just arisen because of the ideological nature of the court, it's arisen, I think we have to be honest with one another, because of these, I believe, outrageous revelations that have come out over the last couple of weeks, that's what sort of highlighted the issue. But this is an issue that's been around for a long time. And again, this whole thing would go away if the Supreme Court did it for itself what we are proposing. Our proposal is -- couldn't be more moderate, if you will, and that we are not saying what the rules should be, just tell us. You make your own rules, and tell us what they are.",

You'll see people milling around and chatting, almost always in a bipartisan way. You know, you will see John Cornyn it talking to Tim Kaine or Gary Peters over talking to Ron Johnson about homeland security. You see these little groups moving around. So, the idea that it's -- you hear the word toxic that we don't like each other, that just isn't true. That's number one. Number two, in the past two years, we've passed, I think, seven or eight major bills, five of which were entirely bipartisan. The Infrastructure Bill, the Veterans' PACT Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the budget in December. The media only likes to report the conflict. It's sort of like, you know, you never read a headline that says 5,000 planes landed safely yesterday. The story is about the plane that didn't land safely. So, I don't want to overstate it, it's not like we're all linking arms around here, but it is -- it's better than people think.
