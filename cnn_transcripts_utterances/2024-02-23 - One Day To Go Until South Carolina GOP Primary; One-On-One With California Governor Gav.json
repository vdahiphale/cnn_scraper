We're just one day out from the next crucial contest in the presidential race, the South Carolina Republican primary. Right now, polling shows Donald Trump outpacing Nikki Haley in her home state. Trump hovering around 60 percent of the vote compared to just 30 percent for Haley, a former governor of South Carolina. But if tomorrow's results come in anywhere near the police numbers, though tomorrow's loss could be devastating for her, she has said she's going to stay in the race. She has far outspent Trump in the Palmetto State, spending $16 million to Trump's $1 million. She's showing no signs of giving up. Haley spent her last full day on the campaign trail slamming her Republican opponent, accusing him of siding with Putin, who she says is both a dictator who kills his political opponents and a tyrant who arrests American journalists. Fact check, true. We start our coverage today with CNN's Kylie Atwood covering the Nikki Haley campaign from Moncks Conner, South Carolina, as well as CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's covering the Trump campaign from Rock Hill, South Carolina. Kristen, Mr. Trump is expected to speak tonight at the Black Conservative Federation Honors gala in Columbia, South Carolina. Today, the Biden campaign put out a blistering statement calling Trump the proud poster boy for modern racism. Is the Trump campaign responding?",

It's very loud here, so I hope you guys can hear me but one thing I want to point out overall is that when I talked to the Trump campaign, when I talked to senior advisers, they do believe it is going to be possible for Donald Trump to pick up African American voters. They think there are cracks in his Democratic support for Joe Biden, and it is a group that they are going to go after, and go after hard. When I speak -- spoke to a senior adviser earlier today, he said they want to leave absolutely no votes on the table, and that includes Black voters.",

Could tomorrow be the beginning of the end for Haley? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN CORRESPONDENTthink, you know, Nikki Haley's campaign has tried to get away from that potential narrative by her outright saying earlier this week that she's not going to drop out on Sunday, essentially, no matter what happens here in South Carolina. But when you look at the fact that she has already lost the three early states in the Republican primary and could potentially lose South Carolina, her home state tomorrow, voters across the country on Super Tuesday where the campaign is looking are clearly going to be watching for that. So this could be the end -- the beginning of the end for them or she could outperform those polls and things could look different.",

That includes supporting the availability of fertility treatments of IVF in every state in America. And again, I know we don't have this up there, but afterwards he said, like the overwhelming majority of Americans, including the vast majority of Republicans.So you can see that he had that data in front of him. He had an understanding of where people land on this. And this also comes after the NRSC urged its candidates not to support any kind of talk about the government prohibiting IVF in any way. And it comes out to the attorney general and Alabama released a statement saying they were not going to use the Supreme Court ruling to essentially persecute or prosecute excuse me any of the IVF users or providers. So there is a clear going in this certain direction here that Donald Trump got on board with condemning this. I will note, you see Democrats and Joe Biden take you there trying to link this to the overturning of Roe v. Wade directly, which, of course, Donald Trump was the architect of, with his appointment pointing of three Supreme Court justices. That issue was one that Donald Trump has waffled on trying to take credit while still not talking about abortion. But here, he took a clear stand saying he supported IVF.",

So we might see some Democrats show up for Nikki Haley tomorrow. The other thing she is reminding voters is to bring as many folks as they can out to the polls. Obviously, the margins for her are going to matter tomorrow as her campaign isn't really setting specific expectations. But after New Hampshire, she said that her goal here in South Carolina was to do better than she did New Hampshire, where she came in 11 points behind former President Trump. So she will be relying on potentially Democrats, moderate voters and a whole host of folks who have moved into the country -- moved into the state in the last few years to propel her forward in this primary -- Jake.",

Given the lapse in U.S. funding for Ukraine, given former President Trump's power over the Republican Party and his disdain for NATO, how do you assess Europe's security situation today? LAURENT BILI, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.:  Well, it's a tough moment for the -- first of all, for Ukraine because the clock is ticking and Ukraine needs -- needed our support. What I think it's -- what is important to understand is that we are not helping Ukraine for helping Ukraine. We are helping Ukraine for it being us and I think its exactly the same thing for the U.S. It will be a huge mistake to think that a victory of Russia over Ukraine could be a victory for United States.
