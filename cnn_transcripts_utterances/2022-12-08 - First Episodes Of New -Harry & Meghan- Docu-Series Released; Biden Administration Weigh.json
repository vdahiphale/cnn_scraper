The couple describes their contentious relationship with the media. Meghan calls their engagement an orchestrated reality show, and Harry says physical harassment from paparazzi has been made worse by social media. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "There wasn't the big bombshell that a lot of people were expecting. Perhaps that comes out in the second set of three episodes next week, which is where they talk much -- talk much more about the moment where they leave the royal family -- the decision behind that, or their royal roles, at least. And that is where, really, the height of their tensions.This is very much about how they met and how they were introduced to the family as a couple. Harry suggesting that people in the family didn't think this relationship with this American actress would last. And also, Meghan talking about how being an American actress was a bit of a challenge for them. They didn't know quite how to handle her, particularly when she was so smart, and amazing, and intelligent. So there's a lot of that. I think that the fundamental attack here is on the media and particularly, the idea that they weren't protected by the palace against these media attacks, particularly around the racial slurs, as they saw it, in the tabloid media. Why didn't the palace act on their behalf more vociferously? Why didn't they answer back more? There is this policy that you don't respond to all the media engagements you get every day as a member of the royal family. If you did, you'd be very busy with it and you'd be dragged down by it, feeling as you should rise up. You should represent continuity. Rise above the fray. But they felt that a lot of the accusations and the -- and the transgressions of the British media weren't addressed properly by the palace. And they're also suggesting that perhaps other members of the palace or the family benefited more from that. They -- Harry believing that it's the race element that made things different for Meghan and they should have acted on that and they didn't. And that's the big criticism in this first part of the docu- series that we've seen this morning.",

How damaging will that be for the palace?",

      "sentences": "I think -- you know, there is this mystique to the palace and the royal family which is very alluring, and that's been one of the great attractions. And I think they're making the point that there -- it is this -- it's really for people outside the U.K. I think to understand how transcendent, really, the British monarchy is in this country.But that's what Harry and Meghan are really breaking down by telling the true story of what happens behind palace walls and it's not perfect behind walls. And that's the big challenge for the palace because they don't talk about what goes on behind the scenes and this is incredibly awkward for them. But a lot of the allegations in here have been made already in that Oprah interview, but they're really fleshing it out. There's almost a historic document. Their main focus here is on the conspiracy between the palace and the media, and this is where Harry speaks to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I mean, anyone can be a royal expert. The whole point of it is to try and lend legitimacy to media articles and they get paid for it. And that sort of press pack of royal correspondents is essentially just an extended P.R. arm of the royal family. So there's been an agreement that's been there for over 30 years.(END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER:  I think what a lot of those royal correspondents would say is that they are constantly challenging the system and there's a lot of negative stories about the British royal family in the British media, and I think a lot of British people recognize that. So I think that will be one area where they could be challenged by the royal correspondents. He's also critical of the family, particularly the men in the family who don't necessarily -- here's the quote. \"I think there are many people in the family, especially amongst the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold as opposed to somebody who you perhaps are destined to be with.\" I think there is a very clear example there. Perhaps it's Charles and Diana. They were arguably put together and seen as a perfect couple and a perfect future king and queen, and that eventually broke down. But who else is Harry speaking about there? That's quite challenging for the family. But there's nothing here that I think the palace has to respond to immediately. They may be waiting to see the next three episodes to see if there's a bombshell in there.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 10 civilians were killed in a Russian strike in a town in Donetsk. In Kherson, in the south, he says four police officers were killed by Russian mines. Let's bring in CNN's Scott McLean to discuss. Scott, what is the military advantage of these cluster munitions? Why does Ukraine want them?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, first off, they want them because the U.S. has a lot of an older model that they no longer use on the battlefield that are essentially collecting dust. And so, the Ukrainians are saying we could use these.They're also extremely effective when it comes to killing your enemy, frankly. And one Ukrainian lawmaker said that this could really turn the tide in this war and help bring this war to an end much quicker. And I'll show you what I mean. So, when we're talking about more conventional weapons, typically they have an area that causes maximum destruction about 50 meters wide. When we're talking about these cluster bombs -- these cluster munitions, the main bomb actually breaks up into dozens of smaller bomblets, you might call them, and this causes destruction over a much wider area -- about 100 meters wide. So you can see why these are quite attractive. The difficulty, though, is that obviously, it is difficult to be precise -- frankly, impossible to be precise. The Ukrainians say look, we're going to use them on military targets, not on civilian areas. But obviously, war is complicated. It's difficult to find soldiers that are completely detached from the civilian population. That's pretty unusual. Plus, oftentimes some of the smaller bombs don't actually detonate and so they become sort of de facto land mines. And that is why the U.S. Congress has restricted the transfer of these weapons. Now, the Biden administration, according to sources, says that look, it hasn't ruled out explicitly the transfer of these weapons but it also hasn't seriously considered it either, Bianca.",

      "sentences": "Yes, with extremely deadly consequences. And perhaps one of the best examples of that came back in April. According to a U.N. report, the bomb that was used to hit a train station in Kramatorsk -- a city in eastern Ukraine -- that killed some 60 people and injured more than 100. That was a good example of a cluster bomb according to that report. And the aftermath of this scene was absolutely horrific.There have been other examples as well. And it's important to stress that both sides have used these. The Russians obviously more often -- more often against civilian targets. But the U.N. says that look, there have been civilian casualties from the Ukrainian side as well. They've even used them back to 2014, really, at the outset of this -- of this conflict. There was one particular attack that actually killed a Red Cross worker. So, Ukraine is sort of trying to claim the moral high ground in this war and obviously, they are the victims here. There's no doubt about that. But obviously, when we're talking about these weapons and how you go about war, certainly, it's going to be difficult to use these things without causing civilian casualties.",
