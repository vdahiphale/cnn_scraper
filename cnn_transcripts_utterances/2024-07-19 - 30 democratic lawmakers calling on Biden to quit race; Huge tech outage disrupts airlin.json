It is for these reasons that I urge you to step aside from our party's nomination to allow another democratic candidate to compete against and beat Donald Trump in the November election.\"As CNN has reported, senior ranking officials in both the White House and campaign privately believe that Biden must quit the race. There's a widespread feeling that the end is near. But in a statement released just a short time ago, the President says he's looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week after he recovers from COVID. CNN senior White House Correspondent MJ Lee joins us now. MJ, we're getting two vastly different messages from those close to the President. What do you make of it?",

There is a sense within the Democratic Party that feels like the end is near, people who are completely freaked out about the fact that the president needs to go in their minds. And as you said, this includes senior people who privately think this inside the White House in the campaign as well.And then there is the campaign's public position as of today, which is that the President is not stepping aside. And they've really been on full blast today. We saw the campaign chair going on television earlier saying the President is absolutely staying in the race. The President himself put out a statement saying he's going to hit the campaign trail later next week. And then this campaign memo that they put out which said, \"there is no plan for an alternative nominee. In a few short weeks, Joe Biden will be the official nominee. It is high past time we stop fighting one another. The only person who wins when we fight is Donald Trump.\" I was also told last night that the senior, most west-wing aides have had no discussion so far amongst themselves or with the President himself about preparations for the President dropping out. But the problem right now is that the panic inside the party is so deep and it is so growing, including the democratic lawmakers who are still publicly coming out, the donors who have stopped writing checks. And meanwhile, the President has been completely sidelined. So I think at this point, we just need to make the distinction between what is actually going on and a lot of wishful thinking.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, this is a really difficult inflection part -- point for the party, in part because they are weighing right now individual members in their offices as they are on recess this week, whether or not it makes sense to join the chorus of Democrats who are calling for the President to step aside or whether it might make more political sense to let their leadership and others take that task at the moment.Given the fact that you have to imagine a scenario where if Biden does not get out of this race, some of these Democrats running in difficult districts, running as frontliners, may be running in the same state and the same place that Biden also will be running aggressively in. And so I think there's just a lot of calculation happening behind the scenes. I will tell you that the dynamics could start to shift also when lawmakers get back to Washington next week. Let's say the weekend goes by, there isn't any substantial change in terms of Joe Biden making any announcements. That means the lawmakers are going to come back to Washington next week and they are going to be faced by even more questions about what they think the President's future should be. That puts on additional pressure on many of these members who maybe have doubts privately about Biden's ability to win, but have so far held back in expressing any of those concerns publicly. And so that dynamic is going to be really interesting to watch next week. And I think there's just an exhaustion that members are feeling right now. They do not like being in the spotlight at a moment when they would rather be talking about all the reasons that Donald Trump is a liability for the country. But they also understand that there's a reason that they are being asked these questions. There's a reason that Democrats are in the news cycle right now. And there's some frustration with the fact that perhaps the President does not recognize the hardship that this is putting on many members. So, you know, a lot of dynamics at play, and each of these members has to make this choice for themselves about what they think is most politically advantageous in their race right now.",

I would note as we look at the graphic of these lawmakers, and they're not the only democratic voices calling on Joe Biden to step aside, but we're to that point, when you start taking a tally of people saying something and the pictures of their faces start getting so small. You can't make them out because there's so many on the page. And that's really -- that says something about where we're at. We expect that there will be more faces added to that.And, Lauren, I do want to just talk a little bit about something that Seth Moulton, congressman from Massachusetts, he's written an oped in the Boston Globe. And he's talking about how much Joe Biden -- well, he's saying why Joe Biden should exit the race? But he's talking about how -- after he had won his general election as a congressman, that Joe Biden would invite him to breakfast at the Vice President's house, that he was really someone who's been a mentor to him. And he says, more recently, I saw him in a small group at Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. For the first time, he didn't seem to recognize me. He said, of course, that can happen as anyone age, but I watched the disastrous debate a few weeks ago. I have to admit that what I saw in Normandy was part of a deeper problem. It sounds, Lauren, that we're starting to hear the inside thoughts, becoming outside thoughts with so many lawmakers.",

Also back with us is CNN'S Senior White House Correspondent MJ Lee. Maria, I want to start with you to pick up on something that Laurenjust said. And that is that these lawmakers are becoming more vocal because they don't feel like they're being heard. I think part of that is also sort of a permission structure or an allowance, if you will, by the leadership in the democratic party, folks like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, even Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries saying that this is an ongoing conversation when the White House had shut the door on the conversation.

Where we are right now? The President has said, he is staying in. He is the nominee of the Democratic Party. What we're not seeing on TV and on your screens are the 1,400 black women who signed a letter saying they still strongly support the President. The members of the congressional Hispanic caucus who said they strongly support the President.The millions of grassroots voters who say he is our nominee, we voted for him, we have faith in him, he had our back, we have his. That's what the White House is hearing as well, because they have an incredible infrastructure in these states that is going door to door. And that's what they're hearing. So it's not like they're ignoring all of this. They are hearing from the voters who nominated him and who put him in office. And that I think, is an aspect that does not get reported very often. And we're hearing it from the communities that would be most in danger if Donald Trump gets into office again. And so at some point, and I'm not telling all these lawmakers who have legitimate concerns. To be quiet, we don't do that, right? That's the other party. We don't do that. But I will say to them, at what point -- if President Biden is going to continue to stay in the race, at what point do they say, okay, we have to embrace it because if they don't, let's say that's a scenario, we know what the other scenarios are, people have been talking about them nonstop what we don't know is how they would work and how chaotic it would be if it comes to that. But what if the scenario is that President Biden stays in? At what point do these lawmakers say, okay, he's our nominee, we have to embrace him, let's go win this thing because if they don't, then what are they saying? They're going to throw up their hands and that's it. We lost. Because if they're going to do that, we might as well inaugurate Donald Trump tomorrow.",

It didn't have a vision.

And he said he's hearing from his constituents that they feel like it's Biden being unfairly pushed out, that he's being ill-treated.All right.

And we don't know -- even Kamala, I think she would wipe the floor with Donald Trump. But there are people, as you know very well, that won't support a black, Southeast Asian daughter of immigrants woman as President, and probably even some in our own party.I'm talking about the unknown, right? Everyone can talk about their fantasy football ticket. This is not fantasy. This is real life. And last night's speech clarified it for so many people. I can't tell you how many texts I got from my immigrant friends who were saying, oh, my God, Donald Trump just put a target on my family's back. And as an immigrant Latina myself, I feel that way, too. I thank God I live 2in Washington, DC. But if I lived in Texas or in some other rural red area, and my kids were out speaking Spanish, I would be in fear of their life for the words that Donald Trump spoke last night. And that is what is at stake. Regardless of what happens here, I have been saying, you know, we absolutely can beat Donald Trump. The Democratic Party has got to get this telenovela off the air, and let's cancel it and focus on eyes on the prize. And that is Donald Trump Project 2025, the danger to our democracy and the danger to so many communities that today support President Biden as the nominee for the ticket.",

There's no place where you say, okay, if we make this choice, this choice will get us to the White House again, right? So whether we stick with President Biden or we pick somebody new. Now, I support President Biden as long as he's going to run.The question, though, becomes, is -- if not just about Joe Biden, is it about the entire party? Is it about us achieving the goals that it is we say we're going to get to? And something about the language, I think, and how the conversation is developing, it's becoming so much about Joe Biden the person. We all honor Joe Biden. I worked for him. I was honored to be there. But it's really about these families that Maria is talking about, about my family. And I think we've got to stay focused on the ultimate outcome and who's the best person to carry the democratic flag into the next election. Right now, that's Joe Biden. And if he's the nominee at the Democratic Party, at the convention, I think more Democrats will be able to go along with it. I think the time between here and there, you're going to have more robust conversation among Democrats who've been sitting on their opinions about this for a long time. And unlike Maria, I'm actually not that worried about telenovela. I think that Americans have been watching reality TV for a generation. And they are perfectly interested, maybe even happy to get a little bit of drama. And maybe Donald Trump is the one who's nervous that Democrats have so much drama that his entire convention was split screen instead of him dominating it. And if we come out with a unified party when this is over, we probably would have more people bought in to the end of our -- to the end of our campaign and us winning this campaign than we did before we started. We're finally having the conversation that is really the conversation about Joe Biden, that everybody in the party has been whispering about. We're having it out loud.

In the U.S. alone, more than 2,300 flights have been canceled today. Thousands more were delayed.Joining us now is CNN Aviation Analyst Miles O'Brien. I mean, Miles, my goodness, what we're seeing here, how concerned should we be that one apparent faulty software update has caused so much disruption to airports and airlines? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: It's kind of stunning to me, Brianna. When you think about aviation and why it is so safe to fly, it's all about redundancy and redundancies for the redundancy. So if you do get a failure, you're not going to have a really bad day. And yet the system all around aviation. This is not obviously mission- critical safety issue today, but the system around it where you check in, where you do your bookings, where you get on the flight, where they have the postings on the monitors. All those things can be brought to a complete crawl or a standstill by virtue of one misplaced keystroke on someone's software update. That is stunning to me. And it shows a little bit of a blind spot, actually, a big blind spot on the part of the airlines in the sense that they're not taking that ethos of redundancy outside what is strictly mission-critical for safety. Hopefully, there is a lesson learned here because we're all kind of realizing what a house of cards this is.",

You know, I don't want to date myself too much here, Boris, but when I used to first fly, they used to actually put stickers on a diagram. And that's how they assigned your seat. Maybe they should bring back the stickers as a fallback occasionally. I'm being somewhat facetious, but there have got to be ways to ensure that they have a go-to in these situations. The consequences of it are significant. And admittedly, there's not going to be an airplane that falls out of the sky because of this.
