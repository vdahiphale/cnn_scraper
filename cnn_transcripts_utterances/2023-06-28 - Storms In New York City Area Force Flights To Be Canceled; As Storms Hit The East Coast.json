And wanted to get his message out, and wanted to get his explanation out so much so that at one point he looked at us and he said, are you understanding this? And when he eventually cut the interview short because he didn't like a question and, I think just decided he was done answering the legal questions, he looked at his aides and he said, make sure they get this right. And so, I think that's notable because even while he is saying he did nothing wrong and this is all a witch hunt, he's also, in some sense, he really wants reporters to get his side of the story out. And he really wants to talk about whatever the latest explanation is.",

Also, among the fatalities, twin sisters, they were only 14 years old and had just graduated eighth grade. At this hour, at least 61 have been injured as search and rescue operations continue. And that missile attack comes as U.S. officials monitor the uncertainty in Russia after the Wagner group's insurrection this past weekend.And this is \"The New York Times\" reports, American intelligence officials indicate that a senior Russian general had advanced knowledge of the group's plans to rebel. The U.S. Officials are working to determine just how much help the Wagner group had from inside Russia's military ranks, including from Russia's top commander in Ukraine. Joining us now to unpack these developments, CNN Military Analyst and Retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel, I appreciate your time. Look, I want to start with the first thing that I thought when I saw this news alert last night, which is this would seem to be a great story for U.S. intelligence to try and get out there to cause some issues within the ranks at a very uncertain moment. I want to get into the details of what this might mean in a minute. But your read on that, whether or not this was an intentional effort to try and drive, I think, more uncertainty at a very uncertain moment in Moscow? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOIN STAFF AT PENTAGON, AND FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING, NSA: Yes. Good morning, Phil. I think that's a distinct possibility. You know, what you're looking at here is a very paranoid group of people in Russia and the Russian leadership right now, and this just feeds into that paranoia. And I think it's entirely possible that the leak was done in a way to fuel that paranoia in a, you know, in a very consistent fashion.",

As you mentioned, he was the one who withdrew Russian forces from the Kherson region before the Ukrainian forces moved into the City of Kherson. So, he was able to accomplish that in spite of shortages, in spite of the problems -- logistic problems especially that the Russian military had. So, General Surovikin is a pretty unique character, brutal but very competent, and certainly respected by his troops.",

So, when I saw that video, I -- it was very -- my reaction was similar to yours.I looked at it and thought, yes, there's something not quite right about this. You know, in Surovikin's favor is the fact that that video came out very early in this whole process, basically, Friday morning our time, when we saw it. And that was quite early before the columns of -- from the Wagner group moved up to near Moscow. So, it was pretty clear that Surovikin figured out that this rebellion, this mutiny, wasn't going to succeed. And he put his foot forward in that regard, and it was pretty clear that he wanted to play both sides in this particular issue, I think.",
