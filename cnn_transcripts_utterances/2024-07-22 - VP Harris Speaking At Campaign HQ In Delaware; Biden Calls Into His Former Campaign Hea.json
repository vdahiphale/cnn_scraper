You know, as many of you know, before I was elected as vice president, before I was elected as United States Senator, I was the elected attorney general, as I've mentioned, of California, and before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type. And in this campaign, I will proudly, I will proudly put my record against his. As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County district attorney's office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million dollars to the students it scammed. As district attorney to go after polluters, I created one of the first environmental justice units in our nation. Donald Trump stood in Mar-a-Lago and told big oil lobbyists he would do their bidding for a $1 billion campaign contribution. During the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big Wall Street banks in won $20 billion for California families, holding those banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of 34 counts of fraud.",

She thanked everyone for their effort and sacrifice. So, far, she spent time thanking President Joe Biden. Expressed her love, her devotion, her support that he has a big heart, his deep love for America. She also said there's 106 days until election day, and we are going to win. She also laid out what she underscored was the focus, the goal of her presidency, which was building up the middle class. Really, what you saw there was Kamala Harris spending her first full day as presidential candidate. Harris aiming to quickly consolidate support and earning an endorsement from Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the process. Sources also telling CNN that Democratic heavyweights, the likes of Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, are set to back her within hours. Harris making her first public appearance since President Biden's bombshell decision to step aside earlier today at a White House ceremony. You can see her there. Harris also, as we were just seeing there, visiting the campaign offices in Wilmington, Delaware, where she also -- we heard her speak, of course, a campaign official saying, too, well over 28,000 new volunteers have already signed up across the nation. Donors also showing the same level of enthusiasm too. The Harris team saying, it's raised $81 million online in the 24 hours since she announced her candidacy. Super PAC Future Forward saying it's received further $150 million in donor commitments too. Harris, however, well aware that time is short and we heard her say it there. She also said earlier on X, one day down, 105 to go. Together, we are going to win this. And that was a message that she underscored as we just heard from her there. Senior Democratic National Committee Adviser Brad Woodhouse joins me now. Brad, great to have you with us. What did you make of that speech? You can feel, I think, the enthusiasm in the room. Oh, I don't think we have him. We'll see if we can get him back. Brad, can you hear me? No, he was furiously scribbling there. So, he was definitely listening to that speech. We will try and reestablish connection with him as far as we can. For now, we'll move on and we'll come back to him as soon as we possibly can.

That is obviously not the case here. She admitted today she received numerous briefings from the FBI about what they're finding in their investigations. She could likely have, with a minimal amount of coordination, shared much of that information, but she chose not to. So, it's -- she really kind of backed herself into an untenable position.

However, I think it was a fair point that the Democratic representatives brought up in the hearing. And it's also another example of a place where I think that the Secret Service director could have been more informative. She was asked directly by several members, does the profusion of guns in this country, the fact that we are awash in guns, many of them very powerful weapons of war, like rifles, like the rifle that was used in this assassination attempt, does the sheer number of guns make the job harder for law enforcement? And no matter where you sit on the political spectrum, the answer to that is yes. As a law enforcement professional responsible for directing agents and, you know, verifying the security of the operations, it is infinitely harder to do law enforcement well and safely in this country, simply because we have so many guns.

Her spokesperson, Lauren Hitt, calls this a huge haul, showing grassroots enthusiasm for Harris. The campaign says it's the largest 24-hour raise in presidential history. Now, support for Harris also extends to many business leaders. That's according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He's known as the CEO whisperer and is the senior associate dean for Executive Programs at Yale University. And he joins us now. Jeff, fantastic to have you on the show. What are you hearing from the business community?",

As you can see right now, that historic record of fundraising that you mentioned, that was the greatest amount collected in a 24-hour period in the history of campaigns anywhere in the world, that it's now -- that was about $81 million, now it's approaching $100 is -- that's from small donors. We have large donors that are now just gearing up for a huge tidal wave of support. But CEOs in particular are so relieved. They personally liked Joe Biden a lot. But Joe Biden has got to be one of the most unlucky politicians in history. Just, you know, with the tragic losses he's had in his family and, of course, having career opportunities blunted before by other candidates and jumped in front of him. And now, up for re-election that he had to deal with this COVID illness, and whatever drug he was given for going into the debate was a debacle. So, they're happy to see the vitality that Kamala Harris brings. And she hits the ground running having been vice president. She knows the key players. She knows, of course, the instruments of government and they're excited. She taps into amazing constituencies of excitement. I mean, you're saying that CEOs are euphoric in some cases about the decision by Joe Biden to step back. And obviously, Kamala Harris now moving into poll position. Is it about policy or is it about personality? Is this again a decision that they don't want Trump personality versus policy? Because is there an assumption from the business community that there'll be policy continuity between Biden and Harris?",

So, the message is, I think, from the business community to the Trump campaign, tone down the tariffchat, perhaps, and calibrate that immigration response to legal versus illegal in this case. What's her potential Achilles heel? Jeff, if you had to point it out, whether it's the more we hear from her, perhaps? We certainly saw when she became a potential presidential candidate that the polls dropped almost immediately for her and that continued onto them becoming vice president, and that's perhaps been tied now to President Biden. How does she distinguish herself and what's the potential Achilles heel?",

But one of them is that in theprimary campaigns she could have -- she could come across as a little defensive and prickly, but Heaven's nose, being in that position, I would be a nightmare to deal with. And she's come a very long way. She's never campaigned on the national stage before. And with the global reach she's had, she's learned now how to be humorous, responsive, and informative without being as caustic as she used to be. So, that was one. I think she's transcended that. A second one, which is a challenge, is, it has to do with big tech, in particular, social media companies is that right now, Silicon Valley, no matter what you read or see, Silicon Valley is overwhelmingly Democratic. But still, some of the regulation coming towards them is problematic, but - - you know, for big tech, but they're still supporting her. Now, what is her saving grace on that is some of the most important legislation is either sponsored by Republicans or it's bipartisan. Marsha Blackburn, the great Republican Senator and Dick Blumenthal, Democrat Senator, are the ones who are sponsoring the Child Safety -- Kid Safety Act for social media, for example. But that kind of stuff, of course, gets big tech a little nervous and some of the cryptocurrency issues, but also that is bipartisan. And the third one, of course, if we didn't get to this before I -- you escaped hearing from me today, your viewers would get mad, and that is on the immigration front. She was assigned that duty, but not given a lot of discretion and that was a problem. It wasn't a winning hand. So, those are three areas where she has some vulnerability. But I think, you know, in the 11th hour, they came up with some very good programs on trying to stem immigration. And in fact, illegal border crossings, no matter what you see are actually down under Biden, but still, that's a vulnerability.",
