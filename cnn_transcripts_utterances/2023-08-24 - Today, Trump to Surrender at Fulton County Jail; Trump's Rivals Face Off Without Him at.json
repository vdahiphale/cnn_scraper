I spoke to of his two advisers early this morning about that debate he skipped last night. And there were some concerns that there could be a breakout moment for another candidate. They did not feel that after watching the debate.They all felt very confident, the former president feeling very confident after that debate in that decision not to participate. But when it comes to going to Georgia, they, of course, do not actually want to be doing this today. But they are going to take advantage of it when it comes to a media narrative. They know that this is going to suck all of the wind out of the sails of those people who did participate in the debate. And to give you a little bit of context here, here is what we know is going to happen later today. This afternoon, Donald Trump is going to leave his Bedminster golf club and go to the airport where he will fly to Atlanta and go directly to the jail this evening to be processed. We still do not have the details of what that's going to look like in terms of fingerprints, in terms of a mug shot, but we are expecting to possibly get those details before he arrives. Then he will head back to New Jersey. We're told that they are making arrangements for him to speak to reporters who hare traveling with him before he takes off to come back to his club. And I don't want to note that 7:30 time, because there had been a lot of conversations about the fact that it was in the evening whether or not this was Trump's decision because he wanted to be there during prime time. And I'm told that isn't the case, that this was because of negotiations between Trump's team and law enforcement in Atlanta, among others, as they tried to sort how to get the former president in and out of the city as quick as possible. As we know, that is a city that can shut down because of traffic. So, this was a later time that they believed would help them navigate getting the former president in and out. And this is the charges that former President Trump has lashed out again, both privately and publicly. But his team, they say that they are going to play this the exact same way that they have for the other three that he has been to, he there going to use this politically. They are going to fundraise off this. And he's going to say that this is election interference all because he is running for president in 2024.",

The question is, is that still the Republican Party?So, she scores this point against Vivek Ramaswamy, but is Ramaswamy actually more aligned with the current GOP primary electorate here? So, will it actually help Nikki Haley advance, or is it going to help her sort of just stay alive in this race by bringing some money into her coffers, some more support from that establishment wing? I think when we look at these debate moments, we have to assess it in the context of what the Republican primary electorate is looking for right now, which is why I think Ramaswamy was sort of this placeholder for Trump all night long without the former president on the stage.",

But I don't think he justified that position. I don't think that anybody came away from the debate and said, yes, I see why it's DeSantis as the alternative to Trump. It's not that he had a bad night. He didn't have a bad night. Several people had a good night. But where today, many are waking up who were on that stage thinking, hey, not so bad. I did well.

That for 50 years we've argued Roe versus Wade in the federal scheme was not the right way to go. That this belonged in the states. And that the states should be able, through their citizens, to make the decision that they want regarding how abortion should be regulated in each and every one of the particular states.And if, in fact, at one point, after all 50 states have weighed in, there's an obvious national consensus, I would support an obvious national consensus. But we are far, far from that. And I don't think we should court -- short circuit the process of letting all the citizens of all the states weigh in.

And I'm really happy about the fact that I'm at a clear second place now, 5 points ahead of Ron DeSantis and 3 points ahead of Vivek Ramaswamy in New Hampshire. And that's where this is going to matter in the early states. That's going to set it up. So, the national polls are silliness unless we decide to have a national primary, which is not what we're doing in this race. So, you know, I am no more concerned about Vivek Ramaswamy than I am about anybody else in the race.

But last night, I think those of us who expected to see The Chris Christie Show couldn't find it last night on the air. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  You know what I thought was so interesting? When the moderator asked the eight panelists, the eight candidates, if Donald Trump is convicted, will you still support him? And that's a question I've been asking our political folks. Because up until he's convicted, you can fairly say, well, he's charged, but he's presumed innocent, so let's see how it plays out. But if there comes a point of conviction, is that going to shake anyone loose? And, sure enough, what was the vote count, two, Christie and Asa Hutchinson saying, of course, not.
