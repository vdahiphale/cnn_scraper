      "sentences": "I think it's really fascinating, Jessica. I was speaking with one of the attendees last night and one of the presenters during last night's session at The Four Seasons was the one who said that the trial was bleeding money, really just privately noting that this is costing the Trump campaign a ton of money.We've heard the former president himself publicly say that he wishes that money would be going toward his campaign. Instead the Trump campaign, as well as the groups, the different packs that they have to raise money for him have been siphoning a lot of that money away and putting it toward his legal bills. And that's something of course that is also an issue when the Trump campaign is trying to catch up to the Biden campaign and their ever- growing war chest. Weve seen the Biden campaign consistently outrace the former president's campaign over the last several months. And so that's definitely weighing on people's minds this weekend. Now, I also just want to bring you some other reporting we got from some of the presentations happening this weekend. Susie Wiles and Chris Lacivita, both Donald Trump's campaign managers, as well as Tony Fabrizio, one of his pollsters, laid out that they raise $76.2 million in April. Of course, we can't independently verify those numbers because we will not have the FEC fundraising reports until later this month. But that is according to people on the campaign and who were in the room during those speeches. We also learned that they set out new a path for Donald Trump to compete in states like Minnesota and Virginia, both that leans democrat in most recent elections. And so that was a notable admission as well. And they also gave us another preview of how Donald Trump is going to continue to spend some of his days outside of the courtroom on upcoming Wednesdays this month. He's planning to host fundraisers in places like Ohio and Texas and Kentucky, using that one Wednesday when he's not required to be in New York for his trial, to be out there continuing to try and raise money for his campaign. And Alayna, it's -- there's obviously big donors at this event. They're raising money of course. But we also hear that Trump is meeting with potential VP picks. That's really a lot of that talk has picked up a lot of steam.",

Good to have both of you here. Charlie, let's start first with you. You just heard Alayna's reporting. Weve got a bunch of donors with the RNC. Weve got some potential VPs all down there at this event raising money for the former president and his reelection bid. You have a former president who is in a courtroom multiple days a week, not able to be on the campaign trail, who just in this \"Time Magazine\" article laid out exactly what he wants a second term to look like. And it involved, you know, giving pardons to January 6 rioters, things like that. And yet it's a very tight race. It's a very tight race if you look at the polling.

Trump has a very high floor, a low ceiling and he's obviously very distracted from his campaign activities.He's spending time in the courtroom and can't paying. Their fundraising has been fairly anemic up to this point. And what's happening out across the swing states anyway, there's just not enough of a campaign infrastructure from the GOP. So they have a lot of catching up to do. So Trump is going to use what time he has, little time he has to campaign to raise money. But I still think he's dealing with some real serious issues. In fact, I know he's trying to find a vice- presidential candidate also a sideshow because at the end of the day this selection is going to be about Donald Trump, not his VP selection. But if you ask me, I think to Trump campaign is really struggling right now. That said he's in a tight race and he still might get a shot at winning. And Karen, Trump's going to be courting these wealthy donors trying to catch up to Biden's campaign. It's really -- it's a growing war chest that they have.

But more importantly, again it means all of the things one does in a campaign to communicate with voters, to get your message out, to register voters to remind them to get to the polls. And the advantage that Democrats and President Biden has had is quite substantial because remember, we have learned in ongoing finance reports that the former president is having to use resources for his legal bills, not necessarily for, again for the RNC to open field offices and those sorts of things. So I think, you know, he's going to have a lot of work to do to continue to try to keep up as best he can, while also paying those legal costs, while also trying to build infrastructure in the states.",

It's -- we are seeing the softening in the polling in some of these other groups that Charlie was just talking about that I asked him about.Black voters, Hispanic voters, voters that helped make up young voters. The coalition that elected him in 2020. How do Democrats get them back into the fold if they're waffling. FINNEY: Yes. It's such an important point because one thing I want our viewers to understand is that when we talk about these numbers, for the former president, he just needs about 2 percent more of the African-American vote than what he got previously. And maybe 2 to 3 or 4 percent more with the Latino vote. Whereas President Biden has to recreate the coalition from 2020 and get more. And that's part of why our challenge is much steeper. Look, I think what we're doing and what they're doing is the right thing which is getting out on the road and talking to people. And the other thing that I think the president started to do that people appreciate is showing up in unexpected places. A bike shop, a coffee shop, and just talking to folks who happened to be there not just in big events where he's talking about both his record and the future. Those things are critically important. And obviously, the vice president is really the secret weapon of this campaign because she has been on the road very consistently. Yes, talking about reproductive freedom, but also speaking to the pain that people are feeling about issues like gun safety and school shootings and some of the other issues that are affecting communities. So talking about the future not just the past, that's going to be a really important contrast because you've got Trump continuously talking about the 2020 election and grievance versus the future.",

I was the last member of the House Republican Conference who supported abortion rights. And I got to tell you, there are consequences to the actions that they have taken. The GOP on the one hand, is trying to say this is a state issue now that Roe v. Wade was overturned. On the other hand, there are some offering federal bans. Now you have these states going on with passing these very draconian measures. And Republican candidates in those states are being -- for federal office, are being asked their position on those bills. Donald Trump's going to be asked about Florida and the six-week ban, which he needs to respond to. So bottom line is, Republicans don't know how to message this. They -- it's really not a very coherent message. Is it a state issue or is it a federal issue? And the answer is very muddled from the GOP and they know they are bleeding support on this issue and they better come up with an answer.

They haven't seen that yet from Israel. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been insistent that he will go into Rafah with or without a deal. So that is sort of hanging over all of this.

      "sentences": "Prosecutors tried to show the catastrophic impact the \"Access Hollywood\" tape had on Trump's campaign, demonstrating the urgency to kill another bombshell story from being released just weeks before the election.Hicks testified she was sitting on the plane when she learned that the \"Wall Street Journal\" planned to publish a piece about the \"National Enquirer's\" catch-and-kill deal involving Trump's alleged affair with an ex-Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and adult star, Stormy Daniels. Trump denies the affairs. Hicks said she spoke with Trump, who was concerned about the story, and he instructed her to deny it. She is quoted in \"The Journal\" saying, \"Daniel's affair allegation is absolutely unequivocally untrue.\" Hicks said Trump was concerned with how the article would be viewed by his wife, saying, \"He wanted me to make sure that the newspapers weren't delivered to his residence that morning.\" Prosecutors asked Hicks about Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels to buy and kill her story of an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen told the \"New York Times\" in 2018 that he made the payment from his own pocket. Hicks said she was skeptical about Cohen's motives, saying, \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person.\" Hicks described Trump's assessment of the story, saying, \"It was Mr. Trump's opinion that it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\" As Trump's attorney, Emil Bove, went to take over questioning, Hicks began to cry. After a break, Bove focused on Cohen, trying to show he had no role in the campaign and would act on his own. Hicks testified Cohen was not supposed to be on the campaign in an official capacity but would try to insert himself at certain moments. She said Cohen often did things that were unauthorized by the campaign and that he sometimes went rogue. (on camera): A court official tells me that Donald Trump paid the $9,000 fine for violating the gag order. Hope Hick's testimony completes the second week of witness testimony in this trial. The jury has heard a lot about the catch-and-kill deals at the center of this case. The next phase is the alleged cover up. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
