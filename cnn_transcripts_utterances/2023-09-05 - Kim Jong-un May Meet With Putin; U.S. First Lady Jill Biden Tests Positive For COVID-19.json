Now the White House says she is currently experiencing only mild symptoms and will remain at the Biden's home in Delaware. However, President Joe Biden has tested negative for the virus. Both were in Delaware for the Labor Day weekend. An official tells CNN there are no changes to the President's schedule at this time.The President is scheduled to depart for the G20 Summit in India later this week. Meantime, as COVID cases increase right across the United States, lab tests indicate that the new Coronavirus variant may be less contagious than previously thought. And vaccinated Americans should have some protection against it. Scientists say the new B.A. 2.6 -- 86, pardon me, variant is highly mutated and has been detected in 11 countries so far. That includes the United States. Two groups of scientists, one in China, another in Sweden, have also reported the results of their analysis of that new variant. Joining me now live from Kailua, Hawaii, is Dr. Scott Miscovich, who is President and CEO of Premier Medical Group. So good to see you again. Here we are, again, talking about COVID. I'm going to steal that headline from the New York Times. They said, it seems everybody has COVID. They asked why. I'm sure Jill Biden wants to know, Dr. Biden wants to know why she has as well. Just to state the facts here. She's doing fine. She's 72 years old in very good health. What can you tell us about any risks that, you know, those people that age might encounter from getting COVID and if she should start maybe Paxlovid? DR. SCOTT MISCOVICH, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PREMIER MEDICAL GROUP: Absolutely, what a way to start. That's exactly what I was going to say. I really hope that she is on Paxlovid because, you know, Paxlovid has worked so well. It does reduce up to 90 percent risk of hospitalization, and even higher with death. Now, with First Lady Biden, the good news is from what we know publicly, she's in pretty good health for what? 72. And so, that also goes in her favor, but I really hope that she is on Paxlovid right now. And back to your other point at the beginning. Masks in public, you know, we don't see any masks anywhere especially -- well, anywhere, let alone our politicians and other people in other areas. But, you know, people over 65 probably should be wearing a mask when they're in public.",

It does show the early studies that this new vaccination is going to be effective. So right now, we're back at square one. Anybody over the age of 65 should be getting it.All the nursing home residents should be getting it. Anybody who's immunosuppressed should be getting it. But some of the early looks we're getting are that the lines aren't going to be that long when it comes out in a couple of weeks. And at the same time, please, everybody gets your flu shot. And adults now over six get the new RSV vaccination. So, it's an important time to prevent an infection will be happening for sure.

A U.S. official says North Korea's Kim Jong-un is expected to travel to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin who is believed to be seeking more firepower for his war effort. Now, it's not clear when the visit might happen. But the New York Times says it could be as early as this month.These images are from Kim's welcome home ceremony after his last visit to Russia in 2019. We want to go straight to CNN's Kristie Lu Stout from Hong Kong. I mean, what more are we learning from this potential meeting? And what exactly would that Vladimir Putin be getting in exchange for this meeting, given the needs that he has for the war in Ukraine right now?",

They are expected to discuss potential arms deals for Russia for Russia to get more North Korean weapons. You know, like artillery weapons, like rockets to use against Ukraine. Now the timing of this meeting is unclear.It was the New York Times that first reported about this potential meeting saying that Kim would travel from Pyongyang to Vladivostok where he would be meeting with Putin at a forum set to kick off this weekend. It will run from September the 10th. Now Vladivostok is a port city, not far from North Korea. It's also the city where Kim and Putin met for the first time and toasted their champagne flutes as you see on your screen back in 2019. And Kim when he made that journey, he did it on that famous armored green train. Now as for this new potential meeting, the time supports that in exchange for weapons, what North Korea is seeking is advanced technology. Technology for satellites, for nuclear power submarines. They're also seeking desperately needed food aid. Now this potential meeting follows a recent visit by the Russian defense minister to North Korea that took place in July. It also comes after U.S. officials have said that the two countries are actively advancing their talks over another potential arms deal for Russia and Ukraine. You know, last year, the U.S. and North Korea delivered rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner forces something that North Korea has denied. But Russia and North Korea have been edging ever closer together. The Russian defense minister now saying that joint military drills in North Korea are currently being discussed. We know that Kim and Putin have exchanged letters to each other pledging to increase their cooperation. Back to you.",

And then, a lot of people have already had discussions, should cattle be used with this kind of water table? Are we growing too many water-intensive newts (ph) -- fruits and vegetables? Where does the aquifer fit into all of this?",

So, I think there -- that we need to look at both what we are growing, as well as where we are growing it.So, some of the most stressed aquifers globally can be found in the Arabian Peninsula, in the border of India and Pakistan, and then the famous Ogallala Aquifer that covers eight states in the United States, as well as the California Central Valley Aquifer. So those are all under enormous stress. So, for us to resolve this crisis we need to look at two main areas. The first is agriculture but the second is industry. Industry also uses quite a bit of water. So in terms of agriculture, I think the key question is, are we growing water thirsty crops in highly arid regions, such as the Great Plains? The Great Plains in the United States are extremely arid. The Central Valley of California is very arid. We can't stop growing plants in those areas, we rely on them heavily, but we can do a better job -- (CROSSTALK)",

Some agencies of the U.S. government are helping them, like the Natural Resources Conservation Service.It's an interesting point that you raise about the large amount of rainfall in California. Obviously, everybody is very excited about that because that can help reduce drought and it can fill reservoirs, but aquifers or groundwater recharges incredibly slowly. So, many aquifers may take millions of years to fill, but only like 100 years to deplete. So, although everyone is excited about all of the rain and snowmelt we've been getting, it's not going to be sufficient to recharge these heavily stressed aquifers, whether in the U.S. or globally. And I do think that the farmers are concerned, and they are making changes. And the Natural Resources Conservation Service, among others, is working closely with farmers to make careful choices about what they're growing, to make sure they keep their profit margin.",
