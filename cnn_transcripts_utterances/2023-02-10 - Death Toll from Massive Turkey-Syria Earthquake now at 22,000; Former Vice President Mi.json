The Justice Department wants Pence's testimony about his interactions with the former president leading up to the 2020 election and on January 6th itself. CNN's Evan Perez has details. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  A historic milestone in the Justice Department's investigation of Donald Trump and his allies for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Special Counsel Jack Smith has issued a subpoena to former Vice President Mike Pence seeking documents and testimony in the January 6 investigation. Prosecutors want the former vice president to testify about his interactions with Trump leading up to and after the 2020 election, and the crucial days before rioters who believed Trump's claims of vote fraud attacked the U.S. capitol. This all follows months of negotiations between the Justice Department and lawyers for the former vice president. Among the issues that we expect to come up, Donald Trump's claim of executive privilege for conversations with his vice president. Pence, who is considering a run for president, published a memoir in November in which he described some of his interactions with Trump, as the former president sought to overturn the results of his election loss to President Joe Biden. Pence's team knew that the book's publication raised the prospect that the Justice Department would likely to seek information about those same interactions as part of his criminal investigation. It was also notable that two of Pence's former aides have already testified to the grand jury going in twice after a judge compelled additional testimony overriding Trump's claim of executive privilege.

Sam Kiley reports on how Ukrainians are making do with military equipment from another era. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Carrying weapons designed 75 years ago, these Ukrainians are grateful that they're training with an American vehicle, even if it's from another age. They are a mixture of combat veterans and relatively new recruits, but all have been fighting in Ukraine's eastern front with Russia in the cauldrons of Bakhmut and Soledar. Their commander-in-chief, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has begged the west for modern NATO standard equipment. And he's been given some modern weapons. But not the strategic weapons like long-range missiles and jets that he says he needs. Meanwhile, Ukraine's war is expected to intensify and Ukrainians make do with old Soviet weapons. And workhorse hand me downs like these M113s, aluminum troop carriers, which the U.S. Army started using in 1960. About 400 have been given to Ukraine by the U.S. and others. This has been patched up since it took a direct hit in Bakhmut, that the top gunner was killed. To say that it's old, well, it looks old, but it just looks battered. But it does the job 100 percent, he tells me. Ukraine has been given better air defenses, better artillery, better missile systems than it had before. But Zelensky said that's not enough. And anyway, it's not the best equipment. Often not even second-best. (On camera):  The Ukrainian military keen to stress that they are really, really grateful for all any help that they have given. These are the personnel carriers from America are better than some of what they started the war with, and they're an important part of the battlefield replacement. They've been here since the summer. This one already needs a new engine. (On camera):  Ukraine captures a lot of what it needs from Russia. It's desperately cannibalizing ancient equipment for parts. Like a 20th century nation under siege, not a nation that's backed by America and by NATO allies. Making do is what Ukraine has done. Privately, though, commanders here made it clear that it's going to take more than iron will and hand-me- down weapons for them to win this war. Sam Kiley, CNN, in southern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
