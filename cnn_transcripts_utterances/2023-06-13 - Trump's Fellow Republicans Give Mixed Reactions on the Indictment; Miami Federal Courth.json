Donald Trump has achieved many firsts in his career,and in a few hours, he'll have one more, the first former president to face federal charges. He'll step into a Miami courthouse where he'll be placed under arrest and lightly fingerprinted. Mr. Trump will then hear the 37 charges against him. He's expected to plead not guilty. The charges stem from his handling of classified documents after he left office. Outside the courthouse, security will of course be tight. Miami police, the FBI and the Homeland Security will be keeping an eye on things in addition to Mr. Trump's CIFRA service detail. We probably won't see the former president until Tuesday evening when he makes a public statement from his New Jersey golf club. Members of Donald Trump's own party seem split on his indictment. While several Republican politicians like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have slammed the proceedings, not everyone is in Mr. Trump's corner. Here's what two Republican senators told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITT ROMNEY, U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN: I'm angry. The country's gonna go through tumult as a result of one thing, President Trump didn't turn over military documents when he was asked to do so. All he had to do was hand them in. JOHN THUNE, U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN: They're very serious acts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He posted a message on Truth Social basically saying, see you guys in Miami on Tuesday. Just walk us through what is happening behind you right now. RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): I can tell you right now, maybe more protesters will arrive at some point. But what I can show you right now is that there are small groups of protesters. In fact, the media outnumbers protesters at this point. So, we've seen maybe about a hundred to 200 protesters. They're swelling through the area. They're making sure they go over to each media tent to get their voices heard. But when you talk about the federal courthouse, you can see all the Homeland Security vehicles that have been placed in front. They created a barrier with these cars to make sure people can't get through and this whole plaza has been dedicated to making sure no one can come out in and out easily. I'm talking about the media. Take a look this way. You can see tents are basically streaming down the sidewalk here and coming all the way through this corridor. This is a small group of Trump supporters that have shown up. Several of them give their speeches to say what they feel about what's going on. Some of them are saying this amounts to communism. There are people who are happy that Trump's also being indicted, and so far, they're allowed to intermingle. So, we've seen some confrontations with people who are making their voices heard but so far, no sort of physical confrontation. Now, come back out to the street. There's been a lot of conversation just about what should happen, whether or not there should be some barricades up. It seems what the police department has been able to do is they've been able to make sure they've been limiting people coming in and out of this area in small groups. In fact, they're making it hard basically go down several different streets throughout Miami. Now, massive road closures will probably start within the next hour and a half or so. And I've been talking to people within the police department who said they feel like the layers of security added, something that you don't see have been going very well so far. We actually saw some of the security personnel doing an outer perimeter walk, talking to people, trying to figure out exactly what's going on. So far, in terms of the security apparatus and things that are seen, it's been running pretty smoothly. Zain.",

According to state media, the president of Belarus says Russia will send tactical nuclear weapons to his country in quote, a few days. Aleksandr Lukashenko was quoted as saying he would not hesitate to use them if required. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg meets the U.S. President at the White House in the coming hour. The meeting was delayed by a day as Joe Biden dealt with a dental issue, an unplanned root canal in fact. They'll talk about the upcoming NATO summit in Lithuania and the war in Ukraine, as well as a personal issue. Who will replace the NATO Chief when he steps down after his term ends in October? Earlier, Stoltenberg met U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken in Washington. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us live now from the White House with the very latest. Arlette. ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, Zain, President Biden, in just about an hour will host NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg here at the White House where Ukraine is expected to be at the top of the two men's agenda. Now, Stoltenberg was over at the State Department a short while ago meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken where he said that --where Stoltenberg said that the Ukrainian offensive is being conducted at this time and said that he believes that Ukraine has been making grounds in their fighting against Russia. One thing that Stoltenberg was stressing and something that you will continue to hear President Biden likely stressed today in their meeting in the Oval Office is that the aid that both the United States and NATO allies have provided to Ukraine have been pivotal in their fight against Russia. Now, heading into that NATO summit in July, it is expected that the countries will come together to provide additional assistance to Ukraine as they continue to wage this war. But something else that President Biden will be discussing likely in this meeting with Stoltenberg is the fact that they need to find a replacement, a success for him as Stoltenberg's term is expected to come to an end this fall. There is a chance that it could be extended once again. It's been extended several times in the past but the President has been getting some lobbying about who should replace Stoltenberg as the chief NATO leader. Last week, the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was here at the White House, really pitched the President on Defense Minister of the U.K. Ben Wallace, also here at the White House last week was the Danish Prime Minister who is considered to be a contender for that position. But for the next NATO chief, they will need to have a consensus candidate, as all NATO countries will need to have some buy-in. But the U.S. does have considerable weight in the selection of this NATO chief. So, those are just some of the items that are expected to come up in this meeting with President Biden. I will note that the White House at this moment is really trying to engage in this business-as-usual strategy as the former president is facing indictment down in Miami a bit later today. The White House is trying to just proceed with their regularly scheduled programming and trying to go about their normal business as they're trying to present this contrast with the former president. And up first this afternoon will be that meeting with the NATO secretary general.",

Just explain to us in terms of what the two men are gonna be talking about today. Obviously, they will be talking about Ukraine, of course, but the summit, the NATO summit that's gonna be happening in Lithuania in the next month or so is obviously top of the agenda and also the potential for Sweden to become a member of NATO, as well.",

As he mentioned, these were three separate incidences which Nottinghamshire police have said they believe were linked. There was the first initial incident just after 4AM this morning. Police being called to reports of two individuals found dead on a street in central Nottingham. But they were shortly called afterwards to another incident of that van attempting to ram into pedestrians, injuring three individuals. Now, at this stage, police have said that two of those individuals involved in that car attack had sustained minor injuries after being treated in hospital, but one of those involved in that incident is in a critical condition receiving care at a hospital in Nottingham. And then, of course, there was a third incident, another man found dead in the street in Nottingham, excuse me. This is three killed at this stage. We are still waiting for more details around the victims. But there has been a statement from the University of Nottingham confirming that two of their students were involved and confirmed dead following this major incident. Now, at this stage, police have reprimanded a 31-year-old man who was in custody, arrested on suspicion of murder. This investigation is still very much ongoing. We don't have any details just yet around a potential motive behind this attack. Police say they are keeping an open mind as they continue their investigation. But they are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incidents, anyone who may footage to come forward. And we've recently seen a statement from the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, who has said that he has been kept updated on the developments as police continue to investigate this incident and that he's expressing his condolences to all those who lost their lives and to their loved ones, as well, but has asked for the police to be given the time to undertake their work.

So, this is going to produce a very heavy rain. The potential for catastrophic flooding across portions of Pakistan, as well as India. So, you can see, Thursday, by 9PM, this storm is making landfall and you can see very heavy rain, especially across that southern southeastern side. So, Wednesday going forward in time, and then we get into Thursday. You can just see the progression of this storm pulling on shore. So, not only are we going to have the very heavy rain, the flooding aspect with this storm, we're also going to have the gusty winds, very, very strong winds, as well as storm surge. So, it's going to be a rough go for this part of the world for the next 36 to 48 hours and beyond as the storm continues to make landfall and have impacts that are far reaching once it does so.

We could have winds topping 130, maybe 140 kilometers per hour as it's making landfall, Zain.

U.S. lawmakers are asking the White House to punish SouthAfrica, saying intelligence suggests it may have provided weapons to Russia, a charge that South Africa denies. In a letter obtained by \"The New York Times\", a bipartisan group in Congress is asking the Biden administration to respond by moving a major trade conference out of South Africa in an act of economic retaliation. A judge in Central England has sentenced a British woman to 28 months in prison for using medication to induce an abortion after the country's legally allowed limit. The medication is allowed at home for a pregnancy up to 10 weeks, but the woman was at least 32 weeks along. The case has sparked a growing debate over reproductive rights in the U.K. during calls for reform. And what should have been a celebratory night in Denver, Colorado after the Nuggets won their first NBA championship on Monday night instead became yet another reminder of America's rash of gun violence. A mass shooting near the stadium left at least nine people wounded and three in critical condition. As we await Donald Trump's arrest and arraignment in just a few hours there are things about it that may seem familiar and others that of course won't be. While it is expected, the former president will be fingerprinted, it is unlikely that he will be handcuffed or placed in a cell. It is likely that today's arraignment will mostly be filled with predictable things, for example, a reading of the charges followed by Mr. Trump saying the words, not guilty. One of the big questions at this point will be what is Trump's defense? His lawyers are already raising questions about the prosecutor in this case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BYRON DONALDS, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: An indictment is a one-handed account from the prosecutor. If you look at the history of Jack Smith, he did a railroad job on Bob McDonald, the former governor of Virginia that was overturned by the Supreme Court.

I mean, yes, there are some superficial resemblances, but Hillary Clinton, simply, I shouldn't say simply, but she basically discussed classified information over a private email and server.

Don't worry about the evidence, it's just not fair. It could potentially have the effect of swaying, you know, maybe one or two jurors and that's all you really need from a criminal defense standpoint. As a legal matter, it's very unlikely to succeed, because not only do you have the fact that there's a judge, for example, who okayed the search warrant. Now, there's also a grand jury. Citizens actually review the evidence to bring the charges. It's not as though the prosecutor just gets to, at his whim, decide to bring the charges.
