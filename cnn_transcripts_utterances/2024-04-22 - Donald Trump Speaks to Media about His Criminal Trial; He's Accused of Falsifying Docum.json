Donald Trump is accused of falsifying New York business records in an effort to conceal hush money payments to an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election.

And she was also, interestingly enough, I think we're seeing from supporters and even surrogate defenders, trying to shift the conversation a little bit saying, hey, you know, when I'm out there talking to people in South Dakota.

Well, so less said about Stormy Daniels herself, the better for those who oppose Trump. Because people think they already know the story. Actually, they really don't know a big piece of the story. They don't know the legal criminal side of the story. So if there's too much about Stormy Daniels, that it may not be having much effect. But if it's really on the central points of this trial, then people will learn things that they had never known before. Not many people, I think outside the media, never heard of catch and kill.

It's important to point out there's no evidence of that here. This is a case that was brought by the district attorney here in Manhattan, Alvin Bragg. So as we continue to watch what's happening in the courtroom behind me? You also heard Donald Trump talking about that civil judgment and about a bond that was put up, that is a separate matter, but also one that is being discussed at this hour.

If you look at a jigsaw puzzle, and you see the outside of the box, that's the theory. And the pieces are what the evidence is going to show. So we will hear that we'll hear likely the types of evidence. You know, we'll hear about corporate documents, we're probably going to hear who's going to testify, we're going to hear a timeline of what the prosecutors think occurred. In addition to seeing corporate documents, we may hear about other documents. I know that Michael Cohen's attorneys have come out and said, listen there are text messages that show these things.

And he let the defense you know back up their concerns on the prosecution to with social media posts. There was even a prosecutor that came forward and said you know one of our seated jurors seems to have a criminal history that may not have been disclosed. I can't see anything from reading the press coverage that suggests that this was rushed or unfair. Again, you're not after a jury that knows nothing about the case or about the defendant. You're just after a fair and impartial jury. And I'll remind your viewers too. The Boston Marathon bomber was tried in Boston, which undoubtedly carried off a lot of significance for the city.

And what is happening there is Trump wants to appeal that judgment and to be able to do that with why holding off the attorney general's office from collecting his assets, seizing his properties like Trump power penthouses. Other things he might have bank accounts, he needs to be able to tell the court he has the money. The way to do that is to get a bond underwriter. And so after quite a bit of difficulty, Trump's team was able to come through with an underwriter that is not allowed to do business in New York, rather, they're not authorized to do business in New York, but they've said that they'll secure this bond of $175 million, which is the amount that the Court said that they should secure. So Trump's team now is arguing that should be enough. The DA's office or I'm sorry, the Attorney General's office in New York, they're saying that this money isn't actually under the control of this bond underwriter and this the way this is set up by this insurance company. It's not enough and it's not correct. And whatever Trump's trying to do to continue appeal that should be denied and he should have seven days more to try and figure this out.

There's never been before a bond that this company secured for anyone in New York. And crucially, they don't have enough cash that If Trump were to somehow default or not be able to pay if he lost, they couldn't put up the money themselves and then collect from Trump, which is how it would work. And so we'll see what the judge does there. It's, it is really crucial. And clearly, he's unhappy about it, because he says two things. I put up the money.",

Here's something that we can expect to seefrom the prosecutors opening, not only are they going to talk about the falsification of the business records, the second central piece to this case is that those records were falsified for the purpose of an attempt at another crime. That other crime his failure to do the proper protocols with respect to campaign finance law so it's attempted campaign finance violations by calling these payments to Stormy Daniels legal fees, where the prosecution says it was to stifle the stories because it was going to be harmful to him in the election. Now, why does that matter? Well, the whole context of the affair? What's going on at the time? Donald Trump as someone who is running for president, all of that is going to come out? So in these opening statements, we could hear some pretty salacious details about those underlying stories. And the reason that it matters, it all speaks to that intent factor. Why were these business records falsified? And that's a critical part of the prosecution's case. So it's going to be a very broad look at that time, that's a snapshot in time, all for the purposes of proving intent. So that's going to be a really important piece.",

So that's not going to be an issue, according to the judge after that sidebar.

Oh my gosh, the media attention, the fact that there was some identifying information that was out there -- out there in the world, we know that that impacted one of the jurors who was selected and ultimately left to the jury during jury selection. But this is the process. So if a juror raises a concern of that nature, the media attention, their ability to serve, they have a one on one conversation with the judge, but the judge probes and they ask questions to make a determination about whether or not that juror can continue to serve. Here it sounds like everything is OK. And that jury is going to move forward. But I wouldn't be surprised if we see these types of things throughout the course of the trial, because there is so much attention on the trial. It is a historic trial. And look, the pressure is high on everyone involved in jurors may not have expected it to be what it is.

There's also been a lot made about how it's a fairly diverse group of folks on this panel, there been some thinking that in Manhattan, it's sort of -- you know one flavor, if you will.

The way that he cut down on this prejudice, however, was to allow evidence of this conversation to come in through the prosecutors.

Whether they call Donald Trump to testify inhis own defense or not in this criminal case? The way that this is working is they're setting parameters for what can be asked of Donald Trump, if prosecutors get him in the witness box as a witness. And what his team wants to avoid is all of the things that they perceive could make Trump look bad before the jury in his civil cases. So not this case, this is a criminal case. But they don't want him to be asked about the Eugene Carol defamation cases which he lost. They don't want him to be asked about violating a gag order in a civil case where he was fined $10,000, because he was commenting about court staff. They don't want him to be asked about that other hearing today or that other proceeding in the civil fraud case from New York state and the judgment where he has lost there because of the lawsuit that the state brought saying he did commit civil fraud. So this is going to be one of those things that we're going to wait and see exactly what the judge does here. He's reading his decision, according to our reporters in the courtroom. And once we see that the defense is going to very likely watch how every single day goes factor into what the judge says here, and then make a decision once the prosecution is done presenting their case, if Trump takes the stand? And we'll be interesting too, because Donald Trump has said, look, I want to testify, I plan to testify. We've heard this from him a number of times before.",

This could also potentially though this ruling could actually be helpful for him.

And the reason is that it opens up the floodgates to a whole slew of other information the jury would not usually hear. And so I'm sure the attorneys' advice is going to be --. That being said, there was always an analysis. A defense attorney is going to listen to the case they're not going to commit him to testify. And your balance test isn't worth it for him to testify with all of the other risks. And so it's usually a game time decision, but just based on what can come into the courtroom.
