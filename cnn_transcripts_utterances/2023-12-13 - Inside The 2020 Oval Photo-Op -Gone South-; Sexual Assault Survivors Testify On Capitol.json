A meeting where Chesebro says Trump was told he lost the election.CNN's Marshall Cohen, CNN's Katelyn Polantz, they have all of this reporting for us. Marshall, let me start with you. Donald Trump -- what was Donald Trump told in this meeting that we're just -- that we're talking about here, specifically about Wisconsin? Why does it matter?",

Trump had just lost his election challenge in Wisconsin, the lawyers from that state who worked on that case were in D.C., and they got a meet and greet with the President in the Oval Office.They were supposed to just, you know, take pictures, and do some handshakes. But it turned into a pretty elaborate discussion about the election. They were told before they went in, Kate, do not get Trump's hopes up about overturning the results. And his lead attorney from Wisconsin toed the line and he delivered the bad news. That man is Jim Troupis. Here is Ken Chesebro describing what the president was told about Wisconsin.

There's no chance you can win. We all know what happened though, Kate. Trump continued to contest the results in Wisconsin and the other states. This is big and important to evidence possibly for Special Counsel Jack Smith. That federal indictment against Trump is loaded with examples of Trump being told by his lawyers, by his advisors that he lost. And it doesn't mention this Oval Office meeting.

But what does this all mean then for federal prosecutors and their case against Donald Trump?KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN JUSTICE &amp; CRIME REPORTER: Well, it means that there is another example out there of how Donald Trump was being told he lost. In each of these investigations, there's the Michigan investigation, there's several other states, there's the Georgia case, there's the federal case, all of these turn on who was being duped and who knew that the election lies were false, who made the conscious choice to continue pushing disinformation about the election. In the federal case, the prosecutors are saying it was Trump and he had co- conspirators and some of those co-conspirators were people like Ken Chesebro, who knew that there was no chance for Donald Trump to win the election after the votes came in, but yet, they continued to push this idea that there could be a way for him to eke out a win. And so, hearing something like this, that this is what Ken Chesebro recalls from that period of time, it is another example. Now, whether that means that the special counsel's office is going to want to call Ken Chesebro or even talk to him at this point, we just don't know. We have no evidence of that right now. He's also a co-conspirator in their case, and they're ready to go to trial against Donald Trump. So, we might not hear from him in that venue. But it just underlines that this is something that Ken Chesebro has to say as just as many people in the political world around Donald Trump have also said he lost he knew it.",

(END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:41:56] SIDNER: A deeply emotional hearing on Capitol Hill where several women who were victims of sexual harassment and assault at the Coast Guard testified yesterday before a Senate subcommittee. Lawmakers upon hearing it, blasted the Coast Guard for mishandling and covering up sexual abuse for years. But we may not have heard about all of this until CNN started reporting on it. And now, our chief investigative correspondent Pamela Brown and her team have been working on this and telling these stories.

But in terms of the hearing, Sara, you know, it is so rare to get bipartisan agreement in Washington these days. But both Senator Richard Blumenthal and Republican Senator Ron Johnson said this was the most powerful testimony they have heard. And that's because four brave women agreed to tell their stories of sexual assault, including a current cadet at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.CNN as you noted, Sara, uncovered a long history of rapes and other sexual assaults within the Coast Guard that were often mishandled or hidden. And when the Coast Guard did a years-long investigation to figure out the depth of that problem, they kept the results a secret. So, that meant the Coast Guard didn't fix its issues. Though the Coast Guard Commandant, the current one, has ordered sweeping changes since our first report five months ago. Now, the women who testified represent decades of service in the Coast Guard, all from different eras. And most of them faulted Coast Guard leadership, which in the past made it difficult to report sexual assaults. They spoke of having to work alongside their attackers of not being protected. Many times, the victims were punished. For example, if alcohol was involved, well, their assailants would freed. Sometimes they were promoted. Current Cadet Kyra Grace Holmstrup was raped by a fellow Cadet on campus. And she says, while the reporting process has improved and she was given a victim's advocate and counselor, she still had difficulty with leadership. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CADET KYRA GRACE HOLMSTRUP, U.S. COAST GUARD: We are always told that you just have to say no. But no to him was an invitation to try again. I was 19. What I didn't know then was that after making an unrestricted report out of fear for my safety, I would be thrown into the darkest year of my life. My classmates stopped talking to me as I spiraled into a deep depression. We always talk about how trauma stems from the assault. But the reporting system continues to re-victimize and causes trauma of its own. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so there is -- you know, looking ahead, there's a lot of these survivors are wondering, are they going to be held accountable? What's going to happen to them? Now, the Coast Guard said in a statement to CNN after this testimony. We recognize and applaud the tremendous courage of the witnesses who came forward.
