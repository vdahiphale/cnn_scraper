Tens of thousands are leaving.But it really raises this massive, massive unanswered question and I think this gets to the root of part of the frustration between the White House and Prime Minister Netanyahu, all of these people, these civilians are heading to the south, but the IDF is still having strikes in the south. You now have a double density population in the south of the Gaza strip. There is a small humanitarian area set aside. International NGOs, the U.N. is saying, look, there simply isn't a structure there. The infrastructure to support the people, not their shelters, not the food, not the water, no the sanitation. And the reality is the IDF and Prime Minister Netanyahu both say that they need to go through the whole Gaza Strip. So you move the civilian population into the south to make them safe for the intensity of the fight in the north, you have a double density of civilians potentially in the way when that fight rolls into the south.
