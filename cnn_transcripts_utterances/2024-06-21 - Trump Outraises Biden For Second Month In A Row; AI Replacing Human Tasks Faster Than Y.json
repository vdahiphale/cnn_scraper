      "sentences": "Coin toss and got to pick the right-side podium. Donald Trump's campaign chose to get the final word of the debate.It comes as we get some new numbers on how much both sides raised last month. Trump took in a staggering $141 million. Biden and the Democratic Party fell well short of that even though they raised more than $85 million last month. Joining me now, former Trump administration official, Matt Mowers. And former White House deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton, Matt Bennett. We've got double Matts today so I will try to keep you fellows straight. First, you know, the latest polling here -- we talk about these hauls that both of the candidates have brought in, but the latest polling is the economy is the top spot for concerns for Americans. Matt Bennett, to you. When people hear that each candidate is bringing in this huge amount of money, some of it or a good deal of it from billionaires while the American public is struggling with finances due to high prices, can this help a campaign? Obviously, the money will, but could it hurt them in the public eye? MATT BENNETT, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS, THIRD WAY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY ASSISTANT, CLINTON ADMINISTRATION:  It's possible that it could. I mean, look, the Trump campaign just brought in $50 million from Tim Mellon, a guy that, by the way, has also given $25 million to RFK Jr. in a very cynical attempt to use RFK to help Trump. And it is kind of gross when those kinds of numbers are tossed around. But look, both sides do it and Americans know that. I think the important thing to keep in mind about these numbers though is that in modern presidential elections nobody loses because they didn't have as much money as the other guy. The people living in swing states will be ponded into submission by ads from both campaigns. There is a point of diminishing return. So I never thought that this race would be decided by the money. It was always clear that it was going to be basically tied in the money race and that's what we're seeing.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, it shows that the conviction served to energize his base and you certainly saw that not just from the folks who have been giving him $10.00, $20.00, $25.00 every month for years now, but even from a lot of folks who were really on the cusp of whether they were going to support Donald Trump or not earlier this year.I mean, just anecdotally, I've heard from folks who are reluctant to support Donald Trump again who are kicking in donations in those 24-48 hours after the conviction because they felt that Alvin Bragg was in the search of the person, not in the search of a crime. They thought it was unfair and unjust in our system. So that did serve to energize many folks in the Republican Party. And you're seeing that Donald Trump's -- they would capitalize off of that. You know, to your earlier point, I agree that it can be a challenge if you have the support of too many of the millionaire and billionaire class. And that's why I find it really confusing why President Biden continues to have these kind of glitzy fundraising appearances, whether it's with President Obama or the one they did with President Clinton and President Obama where they have media. Where they have a room full of celebrities. It just shows how out of touch they can be with where folks feel like they are right now. If you ask folks about their perceptions of the economy, despite what the economic statistics say -- and I know I'm sure Matt and others will try to say well, you know, the number -- unemployment remains low and the rest of it -- it's all about inflation. And that directly corresponds to how people feel about the economy. And right now, if you look at every poll, more Americans feel like they're falling behind in the economy than they're getting ahead. As long as that remains the case it's going to be a challenge for Joe Biden. And if he's out there doing continued glitzy fundraisers, I think it's going to continue to show him to be out of touch.",

We're often asked is Trump all rhetoric and not enough policy? He's actually continued to lean in to putting in new policies. As long as he focuses on that next week -- as long as he keeps the focus about the record under Joe Biden versus the record under Donald Trump -- how Americans are feeling about the economy and safety and security -- he has a great chance next week.

I think Matt is dreaming if he thinks that Donald Trump is going to keep this on the issues and not make this about personal grievance.

This survey was from Duke University and Atlanta Fed and Richmond Fed, and they found that companies say they are adopting AI to increase the product quality, improve their output, reduce labor costs. And yes, sometimes to substitute workers. Now, researchers say AI is being used to substitute workers for a variety of tasks -- everything from financial reporting and doing invoices to other tasks, like paying suppliers. And that's on top of some creative tasks where AI is being used to write press releases or even craft job postings.
