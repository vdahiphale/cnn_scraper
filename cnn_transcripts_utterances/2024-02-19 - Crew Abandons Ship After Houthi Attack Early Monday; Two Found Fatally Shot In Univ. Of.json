      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. So, we're learning that the vessel that was attacked today in the Gulf of Aden, the crew actually had to abandon that ship because of an attack by the Houthis, which the Houthis said was carried out because this ship was linked to the UK. Now, in fact, it is a vessel that was registered to the UK. But this really goes to show that the Houthis had been targeting really any and all vessels in that commercial waterway that they believe have any links whatsoever to the U.S., to Israel, to the West because they say that they're launching these attacks in retaliation for Israel's war inside Gaza.And now we know this also comes just a few days after the U.S. hit a number of Houthi anti crew -- anti-ship ballistic missiles that were preparing to launch, according to U.S. Central Command. As well as a new capability that Houthi have not employed before, which is essentially an underwater drone. A sea drone, that of course, is very dangerous and capable of inflicting a lot of damage on the ships transiting this waterway. Now, I can tell you that last week when I was on board these ships that are responding to these Houthi attacks, the personnel onboard there, they were very concerned about these ongoing attacks. And it is all the more concerning because the U.S. does not have a great understanding of just how much of the Houthi's capabilities actually remain. They have been carrying out these strikes on Houthi targets inside Yemen repeatedly over the last few months. But the Houthi still have quite a bit stockpiled including a lot of weaponry that is underground at this point. So, it's a very dangerous environment for the U.S. military that they're operating in there. And they don't have a good sense of just how much longer they're going to have to keep up this fight, Kate.",

      "sentences": "All right. Joining us now. Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and founder of Renew America together, General Wesley Clark. General, thank you so much for being here.I wanted to start with a Washington Post headline, which talks about what is happening with Iran. And Iran, according to their reporting, is telling its proxies to -- basically to knock it off to try to lessen these attacks, worried that this will start an actual fight between the U.S. and Iran. What are your thoughts on hearing that? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, I think it's a tactical pause by the Iranian government if it's -- if it's -- if it's correct, in the sense that they've got assets, they don't want to lose inside Iran. They're getting very close to a nuclear capability. And they don't want to give the United States or Israel any pretext for going after that capability. So, maybe, you know, we're going to pause in the action. But that remains to be seen. Israel remains convinced that it has an existential threat to the north and to the south. And so, this is a long way from being played out, no matter what Iran says.",

We have been gotten word today that the Russian authorities will not be releasing Alexey Navalny, the opposition -- the lead opposition -- most famous opposition to Putin, his body, he died in prison, for the next couple of weeks. There has been some response in Russia. Do you think this will be enough of a distraction to have some impact on Russia's war in Ukraine or do you think this is something that they can completely keep separate, basically?",

Because it's very clear that the Navalny was poisoned or some other -- some other means was used to kill him. And this is why the bodies being held. They want to prevent the autopsy and more adverse publicity.So, this is a kind of event that stirs up especially our European allies -- (INAUDIBLE) can confront the reality of who Vladimir Putin is, what his regime is, and the serious nature of the threat. And so, in that respect, it will have an impact. Will it change the voting? Will people come out in tens of thousands and demonstrate? No. But I do have to commend the courage of his widow who's speaking out now and says she's going to pick up the mantle. And I hope that it will continue to mobilize opinion in the West because we're the ones who have to help the people in Russia. They can't help themselves.",

The official cause of death is still under investigation, but police discovered each victim with at least one gunshot wound. CNN's Lucy Kafanov is in Denver for us. So, Lucy, what can you tell us about the investigation? LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENTNow, ask for these victims. There was 26-year-old Celie Rain Montgomery of Pueblo, Colorado. She was not a student at this university, but she was found dead in that dorm room. The young man who was killed, 24-year-old Sam Knopp of Parker, Colorado. Now, he was a registered student at UCCS. The school describing Sam as a senior who was studying music. I believe we actually have footage from the UCCS music program showing Sam performing at one of the concerts there. He played guitar. The school also saying that he was a beloved member of the visual and performing arts department, an accomplished guitar player, and an extremely talented musician. Friends who were obviously shocked by this, describe him as an outgoing, bubbly person who can talk to anyone and everyone for hours. They are grieving the sudden unexplained loss. And, yes, that's basically what we have so far. Classes remain closed. But the University is open for people to process their grief. There are counselors on site. There's going to be a march today, as well as therapy dogs, Fred.",
