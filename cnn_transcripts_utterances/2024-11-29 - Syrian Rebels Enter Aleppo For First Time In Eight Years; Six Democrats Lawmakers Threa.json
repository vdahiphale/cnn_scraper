This surprise offensive catching Bashar al-Assad's government forces totally off guard. A drastic escalation in the country's civil war.And we're tracking new threats of political violence, this time against Democrats. Six lawmakers targeted with bomb hoaxes just days after several of Donald Trump's cabinet picks faced similar threats. And also tonight, investigators in New York are trying to figure out how a woman was able to bypass multiple security checkpoints at JFK International Airport and then board a Delta flight to Paris, apparently stowing away in the plane's bathroom. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt. And you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin our coverage tonight with a major flare up in Syria. Rebel forces there making a surprise move into Aleppo, the first time they've set foot in the country's second largest city since government forces recaptured it back in 2016. Let's get all the latest details from CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman. So, Ben, this is quite remarkable. Walk us through how all this unfolded and what's happening right now. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Alex, this has been a lightning offensive by this coalition of rebel forces. It began only this Wednesday. And what we've seen is that since then, they've been able to take control of about 70 villages to the west of Aleppo. And beginning this morning, were getting reports that these rebel forces had entered western edges of Aleppo proper, Syria's second largest city. And by this evening, we are seeing reports that they are basically in the center of the city. We've seen video of rebels next to Aleppo's historic citadel. We've seen other videos of what appears to be these rebels liberating prisoners from regime jails. And all of this, as I said, has happened just since Wednesday. It appears that the Syrian government has been completely taken by surprise. Earlier today, they put out -- the military put out a statement saying that they are active on all major battle fronts facing a major offensive. But for instance, in Aleppo, which has been under regime control since the final months of 2016, there were no battle fronts there until, it appears, just a few hours ago. And in that time, the rebels have gained a massive foothold within the city itself. Now, there have been video posted online of regime tanks leaving Aleppo, but by and large, the Syrian government has been silent about the situation in Aleppo. It has been sort of showcasing Aleppo as a major victory over the rebels. And they have -- the regime has invested a certain amount of money in trying to reconstruct the parts of Aleppo that were severely damaged during the civil war. Now why this is happening now, it's widely believed it's partly because Hezbollah, which entered the Syrian civil war to bolster the regime and provided the regime with some fairly well seasoned, trained and disciplined forces to fight the opponents of the regime, they've largely pulled out of Syria, gone back to Lebanon. So, what is defending the regime are Russian air assets, but they have been used over the last three days to bomb Idlib Province where the rebels are headquartered. But by and large, they've done very little to stop this rebel offensive that does appear to be making steady progress in Aleppo itself, Alex.",

Anything that affects the Syrian regime and the stability of the Syrian regime means it also affects Russia's presence in Syria, for which, for example, there is a deconfliction line with the U.S. to make sure the militaries don't clash there. And then it also affects the presence of Iranian backed militias in Syria. And all of that is key to the U.S. The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria as part of the ongoing campaign to defeat ISIS. So, that's the mission of those forces.And yet they have with some frequency in recent weeks and months come under attack from the Iranian backed militias. They have carried out counterstrikes, including just as recently as this Wednesday. So, the U.S. very much aware that the war torn country is still not a stable place and this only adds to that instability. In addition, the U.S. works with Kurdish forces in a separate part of the country to maintain, for example, prisons that hold ISIS detainees. So that's also part of the U.S. force there. And the U.S. is well aware of the instability throughout the country, how much the U.S. presence in Iraq is critical to the presence in Syria. So the U.S. will be watching this very closely. We haven't gotten any indications from the conversations I've had today that there is any U.S. involvement in any way in this, but it is certainly a situation the U.S. will keep an eye on as it moves, just as Ben told us very quickly, Alex.",

Beth and Andrew, thank you so much for being with us as we watch this incredible story unfold. Andrew, I want to go to you first. As you know, it's been years since the last major fighting. Now rebel forces entering Aleppo, first time in eight years, they were pushed out in 2016. How did this stunning offensive happen so quickly? ANDREW TABLER, SENIOR FELLOW, WASHINGTON INST. FOR NEAR EAST POLICY: A number of factors. First, as you're we've been discussing Hezbollah and Iranian forces have been pulled out of the area and back to Lebanon into that weakened front. Also Russian forces, air assets had been pulled back to Ukraine as part of that effort as well. So there was a real skeleton crew of allies. But the real question marks and the ones that were the major shock the last few days is the degree to which the Assad regime's forces are just a paper tiger. And literally, the HTS opposition, as well as the Syrian national army, have been advancing very quickly through these ranks. There's a counteroffensive on the way, the regime says, with Russian air assets. So --",

And that's their way of trying to get HTS to stop by making it hurt at home. But many of the people that live in northwest Syria, in Idlib, are actually displaced from Aleppo.So they support the Aleppo offensive because they've been sitting there for eight years waiting to go home, and they've been unable to do so.

So there's a lot more knowledge about swatting than even than there was two years ago.

She is, according to authorities, in her mid to late 50s. She did not have a boarding pass for that flight. She held a Russian passport and a U.S. Green card. We also know that she had previously applied for and failed to secure asylum in France several years ago, so that may potentially speak to the possible motive here. Again, no boarding pass for that JFK originating flight. However, she did was -- was able to complete one security checkpoint. However, authorities said that she eventually bypassed two subsequent ID verification stations here. A little bit of what Delta Airlines has -- has shared as they continue to look into how this was possible. Here, a spokesperson saying nothing is of greater importance than matters of safety and security. That's why Delta is conducting an exhaustive investigation of what may have occurred and will work collaboratively with other aviation stakeholders and law enforcement to that end. Rob Jackson, which is the passenger that actually shot that video that you just saw a short while ago after that flight arrived in -- in Paris, said that he overheard the crew discussing how this woman was able to do it. And you touched on it briefly at the top here, Alex. She reportedly was able to move from one lavatory to another before eventually getting caught by the crew. That passenger telling CNN that the flight was completely booked so that there were no empty seats aboard that flight.",

The Kremlin saying that big attack was a direct response to the Biden administration allowing the Ukrainians to use those U.S.-supplied ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia.Of course, both the Russians and the Ukrainians have confirmed that targets were struck in the western regions of Russia using ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles. At the same time, the Russians definitely ramping up their aerial campaign against targets within Ukraine. The Ukrainians saying that in the early morning hours of Friday the Russians launched about 130 strike drones towards Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainians are saying they managed to take a lot of those drones down. At the same time, they do acknowledge that there was damage caused, especially in the town of Odesa, but also in Kyiv as well. However, the big thing that the Russians are talking about, that Russian state media is talking about, that the Kremlin is talking about, is Russia's new gigantic intermediate range multiple warhead ballistic missile called Oreshnik. In fact, Vladimir Putin came out and said that missile could have a devastating effect on any sort of positions that the Ukrainians would have on the ground. And he said several of those weapons paired could actually cause an explosion that is almost the size of a nuclear weapon. So the Russians definitely very much threatening the Ukrainians, of course, trying to dissuade them from continuing to use those U.S. and U.K.-supplied weapons to strike deep into Russia.
