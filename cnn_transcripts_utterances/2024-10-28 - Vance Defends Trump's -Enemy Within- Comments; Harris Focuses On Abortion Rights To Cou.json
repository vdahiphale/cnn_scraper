Tell us what you saw when you were there in person and, you know, especially along kind of these lines. There clearly was -- the dark MAGA energy is how I saw one person describe what we saw yesterday. What was your take? SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, SEMAFOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, good morning. This was certainly an event. My big takeaway I think was that this was an event designed for Donald Trump's base. And that's really notable, of course, because we are essentially one week out from the presidential election where a lot of times candidates will sort of shift to the center and drive home messages for a broader base. It seems clear that Donald Trump is focused on less so getting out some of those undecided voters and more so turning out that base, and that's what this message was about. This was a very similar stump speech that we have seen Donald Trump do before at his rallies. He talked a lot about immigration. He talked a lot about the economy. He had a number of speakers before him, some of whom made some of those crude remarks. The comedian making remarks at the beginning of his rally. This base -- this was intended to turn out Donald Trump's base.",

And it is listen to Donald Trump's own words, listen to some of his former advisers, listen to other Republicans, and they are issuing a warning against another Donald Trump presidency.

He did not stray away from that despite what Kamala Harris' campaign is pushing which is, of course, these comments from Kelly and others.

And I think this is another example of Donald Trump saying things that complicate his campaign for him a week out of the presidential race. They don't want to be talking about this. They don't want to be having to defend some of Donald Trump's comments. They want to be focused on the economy. They want to be focused on immigration.

I've been canvasing all over the state, particularly in the metro Detroit area and some of our most marginal statehouse districts. So I've been downriver south of Detroit over in McComb County. And we hear this time and time again from women who say it's not even a question who they're voting for. They may not have a sign out because they don't want to be bullied by their neighbors, but our doors have been going incredibly well and this is an issue that's definitely at the top of people's minds.",

Whitmer was at risk, that Sec. Benson was a risk, and that Attorney General Nessel was at risk. And what we saw was largely led by women and on the issue of reproductive rights Democrats took a historic trifecta in the state House, the state Senate, the governorship -- all the statewides. It was a blue wave and a strong one. And I think what polling misses is that for so many women and, frankly, families who this is an issue for, when you talk about the economy this is baked into that. Because the decision on whether or not to start a family and when is the most important economic decision any family is ever going to make. And it's a fundamental right that kind of goes beyond an issue that may be most important to you at the moment that I think pollsters are missing in the same way they missed it two years ago.",

There's an acknowledgment from uncommitted that third party is not an option. And they really laid out the case that Donald Trump would be so much worse than Kamala Harris, pointing to the fact that his son- in-law once called Gaza great beachfront property and looks forward to the day that they take it over to be developed. That is not where anybody wants to go. So I think that is a message that a lot of voters are hearing, and I would encourage people to hear. And I would point as well to the primary vote in Dearborn during the primary election where Congresswoman Slotkin had a challenger from the left and she defeated him handily with something like 70 percent of the vote. So I think a lot of voters are really plugged in even though they are going through a lot right now and it's painful to continue to see this war carry on.",

His first pass, a 16-yard completion on the opening drive that ended with a one-yard touchdown run. So looking good early on. And then early in the second half he was scrambling for 13 yards to pick up a first down, too. And what's key here is that he slipped to avoid taking a hit.
