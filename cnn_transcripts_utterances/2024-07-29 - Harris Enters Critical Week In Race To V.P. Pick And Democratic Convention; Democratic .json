As the upended race takes shape, both Harris and Donald Trump are now sharpening their lines of attack. She's calling him plain weird and he is labeling her as a crazy liberal.Also tonight, top contenders to be Harris's ready mate are hitting the campaign trail and the airwaves. We are tracking Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and others as the audition process intensifies. And breaking news, President Biden just laid out his proposal for sweeping Supreme Court reform with Harris' support. We are breaking down what's in the plan and why the House speaker says it is dead on arrival. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off. I'm Pamela Brown and you're in The Situation Room In the presidential race tonight, the newly launched Harris campaign is feeling a growing sense of urgency with the Democratic Convention just around the corner and with fewer than 100 days left to win over voters. As CNN's Kayla Tausche reports, the strategies on both sides are evolving and the attacks are flying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): With 99 days until Election Day, both parties racing to sharpen their attacks. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Probably the most far left person in American history. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, RESPUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The American people are never going to elect a wacky, out of touch San Francisco liberal like Kamala Harris.",

And then stemming from that, I would always get comments from people it was weird, but the underlying part of the weird, which I think this kind of gets to without saying it, is that it's creepy and actually kind of scary, too, just how off-putting it is and how much it really does not resonate with people who want normalcy, who want calm, who don't want chaos.So, I do think it's working because it does overlay with everything that we got from four years of the Trump administration, which was people would wake up, and they would wake up with heart palpitations, wondering if the republic was still standing. And so I think this kind of feeds into that, and it does work with the additional expanded message about how much of a threat he is to everything we hold dear as values, as a democracy, as a diverse society, as a society that's trying to bring people together and expand opportunity, as opposed to take rights and freedoms away, which is what he and J.D.

But it actually goes to the heart of what so many women find offensive about Donald Trump, MAGA, taking away abortion rights, thinking that women are second class citizens, not thinking that we're good enough to make decisions about our own bodies. That's exactly what J.D. Vance's words go to. And he's not trying to explain them away or apologize.

Obviously, political considerations go into this as well. I think you see that, as you noted, she's looking at a bunch of white guys, right?

It was a big motivating factor for Republicans. Since Dobbs, the court has become a big animating factor for the left, the right also, but still he's feeding into that. I would just note, it's fascinating, you know, Harris, as Paula noted, you know, joining this, that this was a shared proposal. But Harris, when she was running for the presidency back in 2019, she actually was open to the notion of expanding the court, something Joe Biden was not open to. So I think we'll have to learn and ask, you know, yes, you stand by this proposal, but what is your court reform, Vice President Harris? What are you pledging to do?

A plethora of Americans, even a sizable percent of Republicans, don't actually agree with that. It's a small cohort of the Republican base that supports former president that have that position. And so, from my perspective, strategically thinking, I'm looking at numbers. I'm a numbers guy. And the numbers showcase that this is a message that does not resonate with enough voters to get him to that 270, that magic number that he would need to return to the White House. So, I would say, take a step back. Don't focus on this. Focus on the things where he has some advantages, such as the economic front, immigration, et cetera. But the more he talks about this, I think it turns off a lot of that 4 or 5 percent of persuadable voters in the middle. He's not just talking about the past here. He's saying, if he doesn't win Minnesota this time around, it's because of cheating. And we know that that's just an absurd statement. He didn't win Minnesota against Hillary Clinton. He didn't win Minnesota. No Republican has won the state of Minnesota going back to 1972. So, that is not true, that if he doesn't win Minnesota, it's going to be because of cheating.
