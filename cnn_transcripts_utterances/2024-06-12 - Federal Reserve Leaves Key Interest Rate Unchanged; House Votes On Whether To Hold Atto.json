And CNN getting rare and exclusive access to a site in Syria that a U.S. official once called a breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS. We'll show you what we found there. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We begin with breaking news at any second now, we're expecting the Fed's latest decision on interest rates. We're going to go directly to our team at the moment that we have reporting from the Federal Reserve after a new report that shows inflation cooling in May, expectations are high that we might get projections for a rate cut later this year. Prices for everyday items flatlined compared to a month earlier, marking the first time inflation has been at zero in two years. Over the past year or so, consumer prices rose by 3.3 percent, according to statistics from the Labor Department. Let's start with CNN's Matt Egan. So, Matt, what is the decision?",

But it's not really the bleak picture that some had been predicting we'd see the economy in for years now.",

      "sentences": "Oh, absolutely. If you had talked to Wall Street analysts a year and a half ago, most of them or at least a healthy share of them were expecting a recession.And part of the reason why the Fed has not cut rates despite expectations that they would, their own forecasts that they would is that the economy has been so strong that we have dodged a recession. That month after month after month, the jobs numbers come in better than expected. Inflation is the other side of this coin. Inflation earlier this year had been coming in a little bit hotter than expected. But as you and Matt, were just talking about, the numbers that came out today earlier this morning, suggested that maybe inflationary trends or disinflationary trends are back on track. And once again, we're seeing the Fed try to respond to that and figure out where the economy is headed and how much stimulus or lack thereof it needs.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, it's always -- forecasts are hard to make, especially about the future as the expression goes. So, it's always hard to get it exactly right.I think what's interesting here is that most of the time, for the past year or so, when the numbers have come in differently than economist suspect -- have expected, they've come in a little bit hotter, they have shown the economy to be stronger. And with the exception of today, they have generally shown inflation numbers to be a little bit higher than had been expected. And if you look at the Fed's projections that came out today, not only for when they expect interest rate cuts to happen, but also for other metrics about the economy, they actually now show that they think inflation is going to be a little bit higher this year and a little bit higher next year than they had once thought. So, this is all kind of pointing more or less in the same direction, that the economy has been stronger, has been hotter. And that comes with good things and bad things. The good things being that there a lot of jobs being added. The bad things being that if there's a really strong consumer demand as there has been, then that can manifest in higher prices if supply can't adequately adjust.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's been very interesting, again, to see the Fed's own forecasts change. They keep on shrinking the number of interest rate cuts that they are expecting in the near future, or at least putting off when they would begin.And so, we saw today, of course, that they've now said, OK, maybe they'll only be one cut by the end of the year rather than two. If you had looked at their projections from a year ago, I think that they had anticipated more rate cuts than that. And every time that they push back those rate cuts, or they say maybe we'll need fewer of them, maybe we'll need them later. That's again a reflection of the economy doing relatively well. Of course, if you are someone who is sensitive to interest rates, you're trying to buy a house, for example, you're trying to buy a car and you need to borrow or you have -- you're carrying a balance from month-to-month on your credit card statements. That's quite painful for you. So, you're being told the economy is great, doesn't need to see lower interest rates. But when it comes to your own pocketbook, of course, that can be painful, because you're hoping that the Fed is going to cut rates and you can refinance or you can get a -- you know, your mortgage for your first -- your new home that you're trying to buy at a lower rate and that hasn't been happening. So, there are winners and losers when the economy is as strong as it has been.",

Do you think there's any chance that those Republicans could buck their party and actually take final passage? REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): It's my hope that they find their courage and they do what's right, because what we've seen this entire 118 Congress is just a degradation of our institution. From the inside, we are minimizing very serious things, such as the idea of holding the attorney general in contempt, considering the fact that he would technically be held in contempt by people that still have subpoenas outstanding that are years old at this point, and they could care less about honoring those subpoenas to show up and testify in front of the January 6th committee. We are talking about an attorney general that turned over tons of information. And honestly, this is nothing more than a continuation of them trying to save face, because they failed to impeach the president of the United States, after the party of fiscal responsibility has spent over $20 million and reviewed over 3.8 million pages of documents and done over a hundred hours of testimony from witnesses. It is time for them to get down to business because the American people are honestly sick and tired of being sick and tired.

And then the prosecution can always write to actually get more. So, I can't say what will happen.
