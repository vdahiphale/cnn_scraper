Now they're trying to figure out if the other way is going to work.Maura, last night I went back and re-read this great piece Peter Baker wrote a month ago in \"The Times,\" and it was about why there's this disconnect between how the economy is doing and how people feel. And I thought this was so interesting. He wrote, \"what may prove more vexing to Mr. Biden and his strategists is the possibility that his political prospects may be decoupled from such issues. In past generations, Americans were more reactive to events in evaluating their presidents, while in recent years they've been more locked in their partisan corner.\" Meaning, it's different now than it was. The way voters in both parties reacted to numbers on the economy was different now than it -- is different now than it was before. Do you agree with that assessment? MAURA GILLESPIE, DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, FORMER REP. ADAM KINZINGER: I do. I think people are so stuck in their political believes that they're not look objectively at anything. So, whatever Biden's touting about infrastructure, you're already seeing Republicans who are touting it, too, saying that, you know, it's good for our district, it's good for us. Like, here I am as a leader. They're not being objective in the fact that some of these people didn't vote for it. And people at home, they're looking at the Biden administration talking about inflation going down, yet prices for groceries, for gas, for housing all have gone up, 20, 30 percent and higher. So, there is a disconnect there. But, again, it's easier to keep your political helmets on and just stay in your kind of corners than really look at things, you know, objectively. And it's going to impact voters at the poll, you know, as they go to 2024 and beyond.",

Initially, law enforcement officials were saying that the search was really focused to a two mile radius just south of the Chester County Prison, where we are right here. But now, last night, law enforcement officials say that this man, Danelo Cavalcante, was actually spotted on trail cameras in Longwood Gardens around 9And, Phil, I just want to describe Longwood Gardens just for viewers in case they're unfamiliar with this particular area. It's a very popular tourist spot. Also locals in the greater Philly region, they enjoy going there. It's a 200-acre sprawling space with a lot of gardens, a lot of lush, open meadows as well, and also winding paths. And this Longwood Gardens had been closed because of the investigation during part of the weekend, but then it seemed like the search was being focused a little bit north of there. Now, in this press conference, we just learned the Pennsylvania State Police said that they've cleared some of the more northern parts of their search and now they're looking at Longwood Gardens. But, again, like I said, 200 acres. It's a huge space there. And we've been seeing a lot of Pennsylvania State Police troopers and other police presence all surrounding that area there.",

So, you don't want to expose them to anything at all.He's already apparently made entry into something. It could be a vehicle. It could be a shed. It could be a home. And that's why you see the change of clothes, you see the backpacks. He needs money. He needs food. He needs transportation. And so he's still desperate. And he's going to continue to do whatever he can do to get out of that area because right now he's pinned in. And it's difficult terrain. It taking time to be able to thoroughly search it. But eventually they'll get him. But in the meantime you just hope that no one else is put in any kind of danger because he is desperate and he will break into a house. He will carjack a vehicle, if he can. Those kinds of things you have to be very, very concerned about. And he may have access to a weapon now if he broke into a home. He could have a knife.

You have to remember, he had the foresight to escape on Labor Day weekend. So, a lot of people had been away and may not even know that their homes or garages have been broken into. As they get that data, yes, I believe this is - this is him who broke into my house, they will be able to get a clearer path and map it out where they think he is going. And that's why they keep expanding the perimeter. I think it would be really helpful if they mapped it for us.
