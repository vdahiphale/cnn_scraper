If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.The Manhattan district attorney who filed criminal charges against Donald Trump is suing Republican Congressman Jim Jordan for trying to interfere with the case. Bragg says Jordan's attempts to undermine the investigation are unconstitutional and should be blocked. And newly released bodycam footage from Louisville, Kentucky, and the bank shooting there shows the quick response by police to take down the suspect. Officials also say the 25 year old gunman had purchased his weapon an AR-15 style rifle just six days before the shooting. The U.S. president is on a historic visit to Northern Ireland 25 years after the Good Friday Agreement ended decades of sectarian bloodshed. He'll soon hold talks with the British Prime Minister who greeted him on the tarmac and will also meet with the five parties that make up Northern Ireland's power sharing agreement. CNN's Nic Robertson is live from Belfast to discuss the significance of the visit. Nic, it's interesting, I've detected some frustration in Britain about this visit. Being referred to by some political commentators as a blink and you'll miss it trip from the president. And the fact that the political meetings have been less choreographed than the personal events that he's undertaking. What if anything, do you think can be achieved here?",

And we'll have much more on Biden's visit on \"EARLY START\" in about 30 minutes time.After a week of escalating tensions that have erupted into violence, Israel is moving to bring calm to one of the world's holiest sites. Benjamin Netanyahu's government is banning all non-Muslims from the sacred area that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslim call, Haram al- Sharif until the end of Ramadan. The area includes the al-Aqsa Mosque, which Israeli police raided twice last week. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz takes us inside that compound. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A delicate balance that governs and binds this holy site is under strain. My producer and I, both Muslim-born, were granted access to film at the al-Aqsa Compound by the custodians of the site. Only Muslims are allowed to pray here under a long- running but unwritten status quo agreement that worshippers tell us is slowly being eroded. Non-Muslims can visit the complex only during certain hours. I feel pain, true pain inside, this woman tells me. This is a place of worship, not a place for occupation or for provocation. This is what she means. While we speak, a group of largely Jewish visitors passes by the mosque under police escort. The women demonstrate by reciting the Koran louder and louder. This mountaintop is revered by Jews too. They call it Temple Mount. A growing movement of Jewish extremists is demanding to perform prayers here. That could upend the status quo. We witnessed at least two men praying as police stand by.",
