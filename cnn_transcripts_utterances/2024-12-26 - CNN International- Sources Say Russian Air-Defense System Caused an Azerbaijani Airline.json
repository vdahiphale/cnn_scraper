The U.S. is now weighing in as questions swirl over the deadly Christmas crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane in Kazakhstan. A U.S. official tells CNN, early indications suggest the plane may have been downed by a Russian anti- aircraft system.At least, 38 people on board were killed in the disaster, and remarkably, there are 29 survivors. CNN's Nada Bashir is tracking the aftermath as both investigators and families search for answers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  This is the moment an Azerbaijani plane attempted an emergency landing, bursting into flames upon impact. Rescuers rushed to the scene, extinguishing the fire that engulfed the front of the plane and pulling out dazed survivors from the wreckage. Out of 67 people on board, including crew, at least 38 died. Remarkably, 29 people, including two children, survived and were taken to hospitals. Questions swirled on why the plane, which took off from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, en route to Grozny in Russia, diverted to Kazakhstan. Flight radar 24 shows the plane flying across the Caspian Sea and circling in the Kazakh City of Aktau. Before the crash, in a pattern, an aviation expert says indicates loss of flight control systems. The crash came shortly after drone strikes hit southern Russia. And while investigators say they are exploring all scenarios, multiple Azerbaijani sources have told \"Reuters\" that the plane was hit by Russian air defenses. Video verified by \"Reuters\" reveals a rare glimpse into the last moments on board the flight. Oxygen masks down as the camera tilts to the window, showing damage to the wing. Then, in another geolocated social media video, the plane appears to nosedive. In the resulting explosion, the plane fuselage is broken into parts with its rear-half miraculously landing almost intact, but upturned. Parts of the plane scattered across a wide radius. Bodies seen covered in blue blankets. Russia and Azerbaijan evacuated their injured citizens as families in Baku waited to see if their loved ones had survived. For Azerbaijan, it is a time of mourning. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

David, it's good to see you again. So, I should note that speculation about the cause of this crash yesterday was swirling around just this, that it could have actually been a Russian military air defense system that brought down the plane.You and I didn't speak about this yesterday because there wasn't much sourcing signaling that. But now, 24 hours later, it does appear that at least, this is a credible hypothesis behind what brought this plane down. Talk about the significance of that and how investigators can perhaps confirm that, that was the cause, given some of the images that we've seen online to damage to the plane.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Bianna, yesterday, we did talk about the fact that they were saying it was a bird strike at first, and we just didn't see that this flight profile matched that at all. And now, it makes more sense to me in investigating this. And now, we also have this video.So, if we look at -- I've been reviewing the video and the photographs that we had from the MH17 accident, which was years ago, but in that case, there were larger holes that went through the aircraft. So, in trying to determine what caused this or what it was, I looked into why these holes would be different now than they were with the MH370 -- excuse me, with the MH17. And it makes sense now because they've been upgraded, these missiles now, the Pantsir S is a missile that has smaller projectiles that come out with it. They're more designed for drones and that sort of thing. So, it's more likely in my mind now after analyzing these photographs and some of the information about how the aircraft flew and how it hit the ground, it makes a lot more sense to me now that it was indeed some type of missile or attack from the side of the aircraft, not from the front.",

      "sentences": "And the flight path of the plane in the minutes prior to crashing has also raised some speculation as to the cause as well, and perhaps some of that can be answered once investigators really dig into the black box itself of the plane. But just the flight path and perhaps why it didn't land immediately in Grozny, but then was somehow diverted to Kazakhstan. What do you make of that?",

      "sentences": "Well, the diversion, I think, had to do with the fact that the closest airport that was there for them to land at was closed yesterday, and so, they had to make an alternate -- take the alternate airport. And this must have been their alternate airport as to why they went to the other location.As far as the flight path goes, typically if it was a bird strike or a power issue only, the aircraft would still fly straight. It would just have a lot of ups and downs, a lot of altitude drops and a lot of rises. And that we see in this aircraft -- but we also see this left and right motion, the uncontrollability of the aircraft. And you would tie that to more of a flight control failure of some kind, which these missiles are designed to do that with the small projectiles, the shrapnel goes in and damages hydraulic systems, hydraulic pumps, various things that control that aircraft. So, it would be more in line in my mind that this type of flight pattern, the erratic left and right and lack of control. And you could see it's not very well lined up on the runway at all as he was coming in as well. So, that would indicate to me that there was a loss, at least minimal loss of flight control systems and perhaps a total loss of flight control at the end.",

      "sentences": "Bianna, this isn't the first time Israel has responded. And as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined just a short-while ago, this won't be the last. I mean, over the last 4 out of 7 to 10 nights, the Houthis have lobbed ballistic missiles towards Tel Aviv in the middle of the night, sending millions of people scurrying towards bomb  shelters, including, I should say, myself and my 11-year old daughter when I was in Tel Aviv on Saturday night.That particular one got through Israel, Israel's multi-layered missile defense systems and landed in a sandpit in a park in the southern part of Tel Aviv. But while most of those drones or missiles have been intercepted, just like Saturday night's one, some have got through. A drone, a few months ago wasn't even detected, didn't even set off sirens and killed one person in Tel Aviv when that one got through. And really, as far as Israel is concerned, you know, it's been battering Hamas for the best part of the year. It has managed to win a ceasefire by battering Hezbollah in Lebanon. And as far as Israel is concerned, the Houthis in Yemen seem to be the kind of the last leg standing from Iran's -- what Netanyahu describes as Iran's axis of evil. But of course, it is quite far away. It's about a thousand miles away. And so, although Israel has the ability to carry out attacks as it did today on the international airport in Sanaa, and also on a couple of power stations as well, it's not as simple as carrying out attacks against Hezbollah just over the border in Lebanon or indeed in Gaza, of course, which is an enclave effectively surrounded on three sides by Israel and one side by Egypt. So, Netanyahu says this will continue. The Houthis, for their part, say that in their words -- and this was tweeted out by one of the Houthi accounts. If the Zionist enemy thinks that its crimes will stop Yemen supporting Gaza, then it is delusional because let's not forget, the Houthis began firing on Israel and also on international shipping. One of the most important shipping lanes in the world in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th, saying that we're doing so in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.

Thank you.Well, as 2024 comes to an end, we're taking a look at the most captivating pictures of the year. Images such as this by photographer Doug Mills when then U.S. candidate for President Donald Trump was shot at during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania back in July. The \"New York Times\" put together a series called \"2024: the Year in Pictures\", featuring photos  that just took our breath away. These powerful moments and stories were captured by photographers covering global events. And joining us now is \"New York Times\" photo editor Jeffrey Scales, who worked on the special edition. Jeffrey, good to see you. We always look forward to these specials where we really get a look back every year at the pictures that stood out to us, that made news around the world. It's one thing to have brilliant journalists putting into words what they're seeing. But seeing the images themselves are quite stunning. And let's start with a few that you'd like to talk about. Let's go in sequential order. Let's start with the most recent. So, the destroyed neighborhood of Jobar in Syria on Thursday, December 12th that we're showing right now. This was just days after the fall of Bashar al-Assad. Really stunning. The world -- talk about this image and what we're seeing here.",
