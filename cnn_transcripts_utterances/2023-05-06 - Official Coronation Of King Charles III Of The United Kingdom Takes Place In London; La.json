Today the king has been not only confirmed in his role as head of state constitutionally, but also his role as head of the nation, and also as an important sort of influence in terms of attitudes and inclusion and the sort of society that he'd like to see develop.

You can't have too many people on the balcony.And in any case, I think the king himself wants to see a smaller working monarchy. I think that's the wish of people in this country, that they don't want to see too much expense, too much extravagance in the monarchy. What they want is a good, effective working monarchy, but something that's a bit smaller. If you look at the monarchies in the rest of Europe, the Dutch, the Danes, the Swedes and others, they all have much smaller monarchies. They're much smaller countries, of course. But I think the way forward is a smaller working monarchy, but it means an awful lot of work. The king for prince of Wales, William and Catherine, and of course not having Prince Harry as a working member of the royal family, it means that the workload is greater.
