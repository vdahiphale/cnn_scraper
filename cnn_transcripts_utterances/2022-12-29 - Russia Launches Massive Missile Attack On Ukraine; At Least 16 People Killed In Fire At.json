The man -- apparently, they emerged largely unscathed just with slight scratches. They managed to escape.The man we spoke to, however, ran out. He was barefoot. Neighbors gave him some boots. He said that the wind -- they heard a huge explosion. The windows shattered. The walls crumbled. And shortly afterwards, to the left of this house, you can see their car exploded as a result of this falling debris. Now, according to the mayor of Kyiv, three people have been injured at another location about four miles from here -- one of them a 14-year- old girl who is currently in hospital. Now, the mayor of Kyiv said that 16 missiles were fired at Kyiv. They were all intercepted by air defenses. But as a result of this, 40 percent of the capital is now without electricity. Now, normally, they'd turn off the electricity in these situations in order to avoid any damage in the event of a direct stroke, but it appears Kyiv, with the exception of this location and that other location where three people were injured -- the air defenses worked. But in other parts of the country -- for instance, in Kharkiv, four missiles hit what are called as critical infrastructure sites. We don't know exactly what that is. But in other areas -- for instance, in the city of Lviv in the west of the country, 90 percent of the electricity there is no longer working. So this is by far the largest strike as far as we can tell. One hundred twenty missiles and drones hitting the entirety of Ukraine -- Whitney.",

But we know from rescue teams that it's probably come from a restaurant on the lower levels of the hotel and then it has engulfed the building from there.I have seen some of the eyewitness videos that were sent to us in our newsfeeds and you can see that there are Christmas decorations on one side of what looks like a restaurant. There are lots of, sort of, communal tables and on the other side, slot machines. I mean, let's just put it in context. This is in the town of Poipet, which is on the border of Thailand and Cambodia. It sits in Cambodia but it's really popular with a lot of Thai gamblers. And you imagine going for a weekend in Atlantic City or something like that, or in Vegas, you would never imagine that this kind of thing would happen to you or your friends. And there are a lot of big groups of gamblers that go from Thailand to these sorts of resorts. We do know, in fact, that around 700 Thais have been rescued and taken to hospitals. So that gives you a sense of how full this building must have been at the time. And what is -- what is worse about fires like this is we know that the smoke that rises from these sorts of really harrowing amber, orange, and fierce fires -- that is very deadly. We know from authorities there are about 58 people still unaccounted for. But these rescue teams have this really harrowing task of going and knocking down doors of rooms where people would have been trapped. And they expect to find people who would have died as a result of smoke inhalation. So this is very much a situation which is still moving, but it certainly gives us a great deal of reverence for what those rescue teams are going to have to go through and what they'll encounter, Whitney.",

Israel's longest-serving prime minister returns to power after being ousted last year. He has vowed to govern for all Israelis, even as this will likely be the most right-wing government in Israeli history. Reporter Elliott Gotkine live in Jerusalem outside the Knesset for us. But, Elliott, there's a little bit of a political nuance here. So Netanyahu, though, largely expected to be among the most liberal of this highly conservative new government. Can you explain the political nuance there and what impact that may have on the policies moving forward?",

And he is right-wing, but he's also secular right-wing and a lot of his partners not only are more to the right of him on the political spectrum but most of them are to the right of him in terms of their level of observance in terms of religion. So this isn't a position that he's used to being in.Indeed, in the run-up to the swearing in, which still hasn't happened -- he's still prime minister-designate for now. He's due to be sworn in shortly. Because of all of the controversy surrounding his coalition partners, he's been forced to come out and he's launched a bit a charm offensive. He was giving interviews to U.S. networks and the like. And he's been adamant to say that look, no one, whether they are from the LGBTQ community, whether they are from the Arab community, or whether they are secular is going to find themselves discriminated by this government. Because many of his new allies who are going to be in this government still espouse or have espoused in the past views which have been racist. Itamar Ben-Gvir, his new interior minister, has a conviction for incitement to racial hatred against Arabs and also for supporting terrorist groups. One of his new allies from the Shas party -- they had to put a new law through Parliament here in order to allow him to serve as a minister because he was convicted for tax fraud earlier this year. So a lot of controversy around his partners. But when Netanyahu got up earlier today in a speech punctuated by applause from his supporters and heckles from his opponents, at least five of them were physically ejected from the chamber. He laid out some of his priorities, including ensuring Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, strengthening Israel's defense, boosting public transport, lowering house prices, and more peace agreements. And one final note, Whitney, is that the outgoing prime minister said that Israel is further along in the way to forming some kind of peace agreement with Saudi Arabia, so that will be one to watch.",
