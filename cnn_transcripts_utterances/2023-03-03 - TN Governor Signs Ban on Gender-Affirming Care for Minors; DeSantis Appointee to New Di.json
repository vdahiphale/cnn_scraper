Today in Tennessee, the Republican governor, Bill Lee, signed two controversial new laws. One bans gender-affirming care for minors, and the other restricts drag shows in the state.Let's bring in former Democratic Congressman Mondaire Jones, Patrick McEnroe is here, Molly Jong-Fast is here, and Doug Heye. So, guys, let's start with the decision to ban any sort of doctor's medical care for anyone under 18, who is looking for -- who believes that they're trans and who is looking for any sort of medical treatment, be it, you know, pharmaceutical or surgical or consultation or anything like that. Doug, you are, I believe, comfortable with this law, new law in Tennessee.",

We don't want that.But there are differences between people who are adults and people who are children. And the decisions that are being made when you're talking about children, some of these are not just life-changing but body-changing things that you can't then say four years or 10 years down the line that you want to redo.
