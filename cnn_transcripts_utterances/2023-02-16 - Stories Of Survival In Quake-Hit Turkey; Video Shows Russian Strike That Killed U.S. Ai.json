He was trapped under piles of debris and rubble in Antakya in Turkey.And not long after that, a woman and two children also have saved in Antakya, according to Turkish state media.

Many of these recent survival stories are raising questions about how long people have managed to live so long under the rubble. One man trapped for more than 180 hours, wrapped himself in a rug to keep warm while waiting in the dark and he explained the drastic action he was forced to take to stay alive.

And the -- and the public office is not exactly the most undesirable of activities. So when it comes to the bill that you just mentioned, which I think intersects with the bigger debate around culture wars, I think this was a clear example as to when the consultation and the advice that she was getting was to stay away from this particular bill that essentially has -- was attempting to transform the law, so that the process of self-identification around gender lines would move away from a medical diagnosis towards a self-choice. And the way in which this unfolded is that a -- an individual was on trial for committing rape, and went through the process of then declaring themselves to be transgender, and were temporarily held then in a women's prison. And this, of course, triggered a furor around this question and things that she was warned about. So on top of the other controversial issues in which she was embroiled, this for many was simply one step too far, and an indication of her own inability to take advice from those around her and the warnings, and therefore, contributed in some ways to the change of her ability to gather leadership from within the SNP and, therefore, of course, greater concern as they move towards an election, John.",

Now, I speak to local journalists here in India who have been under pressure for their reporting on facts, figures, and things related to the government.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUD (voice over): India's government does not like what some journalists are saying about it. [1:25:04] Last month, a BBC documentary critical of Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, was banned across the country. On Tuesday, agents from the Indian Tax Department enter the BBC's offices in New Delhi and Mumbai. Employees weren't allowed to leave or to enter by agents who said they were carrying out a survey. Outside the BBC office in New Delhi, the local press back watches on as the ruling political party issues a new challenge to the media outlet. It considers hostile. Journalist, Siddique Kappan, doesn't have the might of an international news organization behind him. Instead, he says his reporting of a politically charged rape case under more than two years in prison without a trial. Kappan was charged under an anti-terror law, he says, is being wielded by the government to silence dissent. As long as you support the government, published their press release in newspapers, you're a good journalist. If you raise your voice against the government, if you highlight the failures, draconian laws will be slapped against you, Kappan tells me. He says supporters of the Modi government have threatened him online. Kappan is out on bail, but he says he still doesn't feel free.

He said Ukrainian troops are holding on, standing firm to defend the country but it's not easy, as heavy fighting continues to rage. Elsewhere in the Donetsk Region, Ukrainian authorities say at least three people were killed, 11 wounded in a Russian attack in the town of Pokrovsk. One official says four multi story buildings and a school were damaged. The war in Ukraine is grinding on as NATO defense ministers meet this week in Brussels, where they've agreed to increase ammunition production. Right now, Ukraine's military is firing artillery rounds faster the NATO allies can make them. There's also agreement on speeding up training on advanced weapons for Ukrainian soldiers. Meantime concerns are growing that Belarus, Russia's only major European ally and Ukraine's northern neighbor may join in Russia's counteroffensive. Belarus was used as one of the launch pads for the Russian invasion in the early days of the war. Two countries have been stepping up joint military drills in recent months.

In some cases, training them for military service.The report was produced by the Conflict Observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, with support from the State Department. It found more than 6,000 children from infants to teenagers had been in Russian custody at some point during the nearly year-long war. 43 facilities were identified within the network stretching across Russia and even into Russian occupied Crimea. At least 32 of those facilities have apparently engaged in what the report calls systemic reeducation efforts that exposed children to Russia-centric academic and cultural education, and in two cases, military education.
