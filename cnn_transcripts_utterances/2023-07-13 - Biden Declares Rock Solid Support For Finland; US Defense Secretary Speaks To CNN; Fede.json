Live from Atlanta, it is Thursday, July 13th. I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, US president, Joe Biden has wrapped up a critical five-day trip to Europe declaring Russia's Vladimir Putin has already lost his war in Ukraine and that NATO has never been stronger. Meeting Nordic leaders in Helsinki, Mr. Biden pledged rock solid support for NATO's newest member, Finland, and he addressed why Ukraine has not yet been invited to join the Alliance.

I mean, just consider what the picture looks like as President Biden was heading over to Europe for this multi-day trip that spanned three countries. You know, it started with President Biden having just greenlit the sending of cluster munitions to Ukraine, a decision that was controversial, and that really signaled some divisions within the Alliance over that. There were questions about whether Ukraine was going to be satisfied with the level of security guarantees provided by the NATO Alliance and the promise of a future in that Alliance. And there were questions also about whether or not Sweden was going to be able to get into NATO, whether Turkey would lift its objections. And so during this trip, what you have seen, you saw the president reaffirming the strength of the Alliance by offering these long-term security guarantees to Ukraine alongside the other allies. They offered a commitment that Ukraine will join the NATO Alliance after the war is over. You saw President Biden and President Zelenskyy putting to rest any of those tensions that seemed to be simmering at the surface in their meeting together and President Zelenskyy affirming his gratitude. And of course, you saw Turkey clear the way for Sweden to be able to join this Alliance. So by all of those measures, it does appear that the president was able to emerge here with really what has been his focus, which is showing that the NATO Alliance is united and also demonstrating that the US and that NATO Alliance is committed to Ukraine's long-term struggle in this war against Russia, and it seems like he was able to accomplish those various points along this trip.",

He acknowledges how dangerous they are and how they need to be kept far away from civilians. He says their use will only come within a very strict framework. In fact, a deal that was struck between the United States and Ukraine that governs their use, he says Ukrainian forces will not use them in densely populated areas, they'll only be used against Russian forces, and their use will be carefully tracked for future de-mining efforts.

Now, in response to the US announcement that Ukraine would be getting American cluster munitions, which are known as DPICMs, Russia said that they would reciprocate if they are used, and we also heard from the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, who said that it is now time for Russia to use up its arsenal of what it calls these inhumane weapons. We have to note that of course, Russia has been using their own cluster munitions against Ukrainian troops and Ukrainian civilians since the very beginning of this war, and that was a big part of why the US -- the Biden administration said that they were giving Ukraine these weapons which have been extremely controversial.

As far as technology, we're looking at artificial intelligence really taking a larger role in productions. And, you know, they're still fighting for better wages for those middle class workers, the middle class actors and writers, who are struggling to afford to live in major film hubs, like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta.
