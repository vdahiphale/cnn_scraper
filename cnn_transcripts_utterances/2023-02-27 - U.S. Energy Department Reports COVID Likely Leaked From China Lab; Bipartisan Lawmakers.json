MEGAN RANNEY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICARE: It matters because it can inform our steps for the prevention of the next pandemic. But we're not going to know likely, perhaps ever, but certainly not in time for things like H5N1, which we're already facing down. I think we can take the lessons from a public health perspective whether this was an unintentional lab leak, which points to the fact that we need better biosecurity protocols for labs across the world and we need better monitoring of labs across the world. Or whether this was animal to human transmission like what we're seeing with H5N1. There again, we need better monitoring, surveillance, and a better ability to respond quickly. Regardless of what the answer is, we know the next step. And I'll tell you, John, while we're focusing on where COVID-19 started, we're not spending time thinking about how to keep America from ever having to go through the last three years again.",

They're already thinking about the midterms. This might be something they could easily message on and say, well, if Republicans aren't signing on, this is actually something that a Democratic leadership would want to bring forth. The Republican leadership is a completely different question, because this is not necessarily in their wheelhouse (ph) as much as it is.And if they can get there, it would be monumental for them to strike any kind of policy agreement. But it's unclear right now, just given how those margins exist among Republicans, there could be some who say, oh, my gosh, this could, I don't know, contribute to inflation. This could just not help the economy in one way or the other, which are a lot of the arguments that you're hearing nowadays from Republicans. So it could be tricky.

Those five lawmakers are Nick LaLota, Anthony D'Esposito, Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro and Brandon Williams. All of them are freshmen and all of them are thought to be top targets for Democrats in the next election cycle. Now, we should point out that Molinaro and D'Esposito both did return the campaign donations once some of these financial issues for Santos came to light. But those billboards are still calling them out anyway for taking the donations in the first place. And they're just trying to really link George Santos to these Republicans as tightly as possible. Now, it's worth noting that these five House Republicans have been some of the most vocal critics in their party, either calling to condemn Santos or calling on him to resign. In fact, Nick LaLota, a congressman, he took it even further today in a tweet calling for Santos to be expelled and saying this is one of the most provable cases of election fraud that he had ever seen.
