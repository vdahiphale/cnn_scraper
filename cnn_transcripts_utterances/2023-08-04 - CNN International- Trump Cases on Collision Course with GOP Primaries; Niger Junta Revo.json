      "sentences": "All these criminal cases involving former President Trump can be dizzying, so we want to update you on the cases and what lies ahead. There are a total of four criminal cases that the former president has been investigated in, three of them where he's been formally charged and pleaded not guilty.The January 6th case that he was just arraigned in on Thursday, where he's charged with four counts including obstructing federal proceedings and conspiracy to defraud the government. Then there's the Mar-a-Lago documents case, where he faces 40 counts related to the allegedly illegal retention of documents at his Florida estate. There is the New York hush money case brought by the Manhattan D.A. where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and to Karen McDougal. Those are the cases where Donald Trump has already been indicted. Then there's the Georgia case where an indictment could come soon. That case focuses on Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state of Georgia. Now let's look at what happens next on the calendar. In just about a week, August 10th, he'll be arraigned on three additional charges brought in the Mar-a-Lago case, although he's not expected to attend that hearing. Also likely in August, could be a decision on an indictment in the Georgia case. Now, as far as when the actual trials in these cases will begin and how they square with the election calendar for next year, well, two of the cases he's been indicted in are scheduled to start in the middle of the primary season. Super Tuesday is on March 5, 2024, and there are several other primaries during that month of March. And the first case to begin -- the first criminal case to begin, the Manhattan D.A.'s hush money trial is scheduled to start about three weeks after Super Tuesday on March 25th. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case, a pre-trial hearing is scheduled for May 14th. The trial itself could begin as early as May 20th. On the election calendar, there are several primaries in the month of May and the Republican Party's nomination deadline is 11 days after the Mar-a- Lago trial is slated to begin, that deadline for the nomination is on May 31st. But that Mar-a-Lago trial, we need to point out, could easily slide until later in the year. As for the case he has just been indicted in, the January 6th case, the start date could be set during the next hearing in that case, which is on August 28th. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

The Department of State has not requested DoD personnel or equipment as part of the ordered departure. We continue to monitor this fluid and evolving situation and reiterate our focus on a diplomatic solution. The U.S. State Department on Wednesday ordered the evacuation of non- emergency personnel and their family members in the wake of the military takeover. France, Germany and Spain have also been evacuating their citizens. U.S. President Biden called for the immediate release of Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum on Thursday. Marking the first time he's commented on the coup since the country's military seized power last week. President Biden says, quote: The Nigerian people have the right to choose their leaders. They have expressed their will to free and fair elections -- and that must be respected. CNN's Stephanie Busari following all these developments for us in Lagos, in Nigeria. This is a big question, isn't it, because if you look at the images, there is so much support within the country for the coup leaders, but yes, the election put someone else in power. So how do we read this?",

      "sentences": "Max, there is a very strong anti-Western, anti-French sentiment that is running through this whole situation. As one of the people there said, they feel that France -- which is a former colonial power -- Niger became independent from France like other former French colonies in the 60s. But there's a sentiment that France never really left. That the French maintains control of the currency in 14 of these countries -- the CFA. And it's him pegged to the French central bank, to pegged to the euro, and they have to maintain reserves in the French central bank. So there is a sense that France has never really left.And analysts are telling me that sometimes there's a thinking that things don't really happen without in franc-controlled Africa without the tacet approval of France. So this is the backdrop against what some of -- what is happening is going on. It a bolding, Max. But when facing the real possibility of military intervention and diplomacy talks have failed, you'll remember that ECOWAS, the regional body of West African countries have given the military junta until (INAUDIBLE) Bazoum. And they have just left a delegate -- a delegate has just left the country without meeting the leader himself. So we're facing a real possibility of some military intervention. And President Bazoum himself has been writing in the \"Washington Post\" talking about the consequences of this coup in the region. Let me read you some of what he had to say. He said: I write this as a hostage. I'm just one of hundreds of citizens who have been arbitrarily and illegally imprisoned. This coup has no justification whatsoever. If it succeeds, it will have devastating consequences for our country, our region and the entire world. Now Bazoum was seen as a key ally and strong partner with the West. The U.S. of course has military bases there and France also has military bases there against the fight against insurgency. Boko Haram, ISIS and Al Qaeda all operate in that region. So is looking like a very fragile situation indeed -- Max.",

A day of mourning has been declared for the more than 200 victims who died and the thousands more who were hurt. The blast originated in a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate that had been improperly stored for many years. It's not known what set off the explosion but a shockwave was one of the biggest nonnuclear explosions ever recorded to date. No official investigation into the cause has not been completed. CNN's Tamara Qiblawi joins us with more on this tragic anniversary.

What she has is a right to justice. A right to get answers. And so far, we have none. We are none the wiser today than we were three years ago.",

His message to the young faithful, don't be afraid to stir things up. Take care of the planet and beware of the pitfalls of online addiction.Catholic youth have traveled here from all over the world for this event. Which is held every three years in a different location and is dubbed as a Catholic Woodstock. And it really does feel like a festival with live music and lots of singing and dancing around us, not only here in the park but in the whole city. The Pope started his day by meeting and praying privately with 15 Ukrainians who traveled to Portugal here for this event. He then met with students and staff with Lisbon's catholic university and during that speech he urged young people to keep seeking and be ready to take risks in a world which faces enormous challenges. The five-day trip is taking place in the shadow of clerical abuse scandal here. Earlier this year a report published by an independent commission found that some of the Catholic clergy in Portugal have abused thousands of children over a 70-year period. On Wednesday evening the Pope did meet privately with 13 victims of clerical abuse. The Vatican described it as a time of intense listening. And during an address he said that the Catholic church needs to do better when dealing with victims of clerical abuse. Saying that the church is in need of humble and ongoing purification and must listen to the anguished cry of the victims. Despite his recent surgery and struggles with mobility, the Pope has an intense schedule with some 11 speeches during his trip and more events than in the past trips this year. Including a trip to the country's popular Shrine of Fatima. The 86-year-old pontiff was in very good form on the papal flight from Rome's Fiumicino airport. And he joked with journalists saying he would come back from this trip rejuvenated. Antonia Mortensen, CNN, Lisbon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
