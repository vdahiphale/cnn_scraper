I'm Sara Sidner in Los Angeles, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. President Biden is busy at work today, welcoming Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, to the White House. Meanwhile, a political scandal is brewing over the discovery of classified documents at Mr. Biden's Delaware home and former office from his time as vice president. A special counsel has been appointed to investigate. And as expected, Republicans are using it to slam Democrats as hypocrites. The president was highly critical of Donald Trump when classified documents were found at his home in Mar-a-Lago last year. There are some key differences though in the secret documents' debacle. Donald Trump had refused to return the files, even after being subpoenaed. Joe Biden's lawyers turn the materials over voluntarily, and the White House has promised to fully cooperate. But it's still a political headache for the president. Let's get some important context now with our Elie Honig. he is a former federal and state prosecutor and he joins me now from New York. Elie, thank you so much for joining me. This is a scandal that certainly the administration does not want because it has been so much in the news when it comes to what Donald Trump did with these documents. Can you help us understand a bit of context here though. What exactly did President Biden do when he was vice president? And what's the potential legal exposure for him as there is now an investigation? ELIE HONIG, FORMER U.S. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Sure, Sara. So, here's what we know, Joe Biden, when he was vice president, he left the vice presidency in January of 2017, then he took an honorary job with this think tank associated with the University of Pennsylvania where he had a private office in Washington D.C. that he used from about 2017 to 2019. Well, two months ago, in November, his attorneys were going through and packing up that private office, and they found a small number, about 10 classified documents. They immediately notified the National Archives, and in turn, DOJ got involved. And then, in December, last month, Biden's team found more classified documents, we don't know the exact number at his private home in Wilmington, Delaware. And so, that's what leads us here today. Now, if the question is, what types of federal laws may be implicated either as to Joe Biden or as to Donald Trump on the Mar-a-Lago case? There is, sort of, a lattice work of different statutes here. Federal laws that essentially all boiled down to making it a crime if a person knowingly and intentionally mishandles, destroyed, steals classified or other sensitive information. And really, the crux of that is did the person, whether its Donald Trump or Joe Biden, know that they had these documents, and did they have criminal intent?",

But they also said something to the effect of, you know, he was calling it, particularly sensitive matters. And so, by making this appointment of someone that is not the attorney general at the time, who was, of course, put in place by Joe Biden, the Justice Department saying, look it shows that we're acting independently. Can you translate all of this into plain English when it comes to what exactly does sensitive matters mean? Is that just about the documents?",

The reason you wouldappoint special counsel is if you have an extraordinarily sensitive situation like this or if you have a potential conflict of interest. And I think, really, what's driving both of these special counsels, Sara, is the at least appearance of a conflict of interest. Taking the Donald Trump scenario, of course. We had Jack Smith appointed as special counsel a couple of months ago. And Merrick Garland is thinking it appears was well a reasonable normal person could look at this and say, look it's a potential conflict of interest to have Joe Biden's Justice Department, criminally investigating Donald Trump, who is now likely running against Joe Biden for the presidency in 2024. By that same logic, Sara, I think Merrick Garland left himself with no choice, and I think the right choice, in appointing a special counselor because if it's a conflict of interest for Biden's DOJ to investigate Donald Trump, it sure is heck is a potential conflict of interest for Joe Biden's DOJ to investigate Joe Biden.",

We're only, at thispoint, talking about a handful of classified documents located in two different places. The fact that Biden's team is cooperating should shorten the timeframe here, as opposed to somebody who's obstructing. And there is a way -- if I'm prosecuting this case, the first thing I'm looking at, Sara, is knowledge. Because Joe Biden has denied knowledge. Now, we don't know if that's true or not. We've not seen any counter evidence. But as a prosecutor, you have to test that. You have to talk to all the other witnesses. And if you can confirm, solidly, beyond just Joe Biden's denial, but if you can confirm that he had no knowledge, then it's over, legally, not politically, but legally because there is no crime if the person simply didn't know.",

But a specialprosecutor, a special counsel has the ability to run grandeur investigations, to subpoena witnesses, to force them to testify, to obtain documents, to do wiretaps, and most importantly to indict and then to carry cases through trial and sentencing. They can do all the things that a federal prosecutor can do. What makes a special counsel special, is that they have more distance, more independents, more insulation from the normal apparatus of the Justice Department from the A.G. The regulations say that special counsel is not subject to the day-to-day supervision of the A.G. However, the special counsel will make a recommendation, both special counsels to the attorney general. And the regulations say that when that happens, the A.G. has to make his own call, but he also has to give, \"Great weight to whatever the two special counsels recommend.\" And there are other safeguards as well, for example, if the attorney general overrules of the special counsel, that has to be reported to Congress. There has to be a written report. So, it's essentially a federal prosecutor with a lot more independents.",

It is long-standing DOJ policy, dating back to the early 1970s, the Watergateera, that DOJ will not indict the sitting president. So, even if worst comes to worse for Joe Biden. Even if it turns out if he has criminal exposure, the most special counsel could do would be to write a report saying, here's my findings and I recommend charges. And then when the day comes when Joe Biden is no longer president, whether that's in 2025 or 2029, then he would be subject to indictment. Donald Trump, sure. If the facts prove out that there's been a crime, either on Mar-a-Lago or January 6th, both of which are being investigated by a special counsel. January 6th, then absolutely he can be indicted. And look, it's not going to be easy if he's indicted to turn that into a conviction. This will be an enormously polarizing prosecution if it ever happens. But there's no legal or constitutional protection for either a former president or a current candidate for office.",

Nevertheless, the magnitude of what we are up against in the coming days is very severe and we are asking people in their homes to get ready. To get ready to evacuate if they have to. To watch for rising water. To look at their local news. To have batteries for flashlights. And to get ready because of these swings between drought and then the kind of atmospheric rivers that we're saying, they are here to stay. And again, we are wide-eyed.

While at the same time, preventing loss of life and being able to respond to emergencies. So, all of this is happening at the same time and we've been working on it for decades. So, that's all great. But what we are also doing, and I think this is really important, it's something California is known for, that because we know that climate change is real, we are investing in a carbon free energy future. So, we have about $48 billion over the last two years in the kind of tax credits that will allow the private sector to come up with a kind of innovations that we hope will change the ability of us on a global level to be able to combat climate change and deal with or try to avoid further climate change in the future. Of course, that's a much bigger goal. But we are responding to this from everything from responding to extreme weather, to trying to prevent more climate change in the future by transitioning to a carbon free energy future.

In fact, if you -- looking back at the 1918 flu pandemic, which we make a lot of references to in talking about COVID, we saw a post-flu syndrome during that pandemic as well. But for some reason, long COVID caught us off guard. And, I think part of the reason that we don't understand it is that is very heterogeneous, meaning long COVID means a lot of different things to different people. When we look at the symptoms of long COVID, we're talking about anything ranging from loss of taste and smell, all the way to pretty debilitating fatigue and shortness of breath. And then the other thing playing into it is that we don't -- we still don't understand what's driving it. What's causing it. The underlined biology or sometimes it's called pathophysiology.

I mean, we've had -- you know, we have a tendency to focus on the people who have died, and rightfully so, but the people who are still alive with this is a huge problem. DR.

And that I think that's the wrong headline. Long COVID is not deadly. Actually, if you look at the numbers, the -- probably people that are dying directly as a result of long COVID are very, very few and far between. But I think what we should be worried about is how long COVID might exacerbate or hasten other chronic health conditions. Either because you have a long COVID, so you're now not managing your other health conditions in the way that you should, maybe going to the doctor or taking medications or treatment like you should because you're so exhausted or you're having trouble breathing or you have cognitive impairment, or it may be that long COVID itself and the biology that's driving long COVID are interacting with other chronic health conditions like diabetes and dementia.

And right now, it's almost like whack-a-mole with the different symptoms that people have. And a lot of this is falling to the primary care providers. We did have a lot of optimism, I think, in the beginning that long COVID specialty clinics would provide, you know, an umbrella, you know, a place of multi-disciplinary care where people with long COVID could have all of their needs met. I think that long COVID clinics have not delivered quite on those promises and probably the experience of patients varies depending on their geography and what academic medical center they might happen to be near, locally. Our long COVID clinic that was affiliated with our largest academic medical center just closed. And so, that's something that we're hearing from patients as well.",

What do you think that they need to be asking if they're not already asking? DR. BEAUDOIN: So, RECOVER was a massive investment. Taxpayer dollars, $1.2 billion. Probably one of the single largest research investments on behalf of the government for a specific problem at one point in time. And some people have likened RECOVER to a glacier, and that it really was this slow- moving mass. And in the beginning, I don't think there was a lot of productivity coming from RECOVER, and it was quite opaque. There has been some increased transparency and momentum around patient recruitment. And so, about two years in, and there has not -- I can't point to a single, like, landmark study that has come from a RECOVER, but there is a lot of work ongoing. In addition, a massive amount of infrastructure being built up in terms of data and just ability to recruit a lot of patients. So, I'm hopeful that in the next year, we will start to see some products coming from RECOVER that tell us really, like, what causes long COVID. You know, the basic biology and pathophysiology, and also treatment, an evidence-based treatment for long COVID. And then thirdly, hoping to better classify long COVID. Right now, we call long COVID this whole bucket of things. But it may be that it really is discreet, kind of, syndromes that were all -- that are all called long COVID now but may actually be different things.

You know, we all in the U.S., in some fashion pay for our health insurance. And so, we need to understand what the downstream implications of that.

So, the economic piece starts at the individual. And that, you know, we have talked to patients who are no longer working and bringing in a paycheck into their house because they can't work because of long COVID, and now that person is no longer in the workforce. There's obviously been a tremendous amount of tension -- attention on the labor shortage in the U.S. and some have even populated that long COVID is a contributor to that.

Part of it was that we started -- you know, the signal that long COVID was a thing really started happening -- I don't know, several months, maybe a year into the pandemic. And I think, next time, if we have learned our lesson, we will be looking for that early signal, you know, as soon as we know that a new disease or virus has emerged.
