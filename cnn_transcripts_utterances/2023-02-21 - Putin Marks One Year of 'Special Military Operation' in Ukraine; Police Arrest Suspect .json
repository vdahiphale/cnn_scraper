All of this is coming at a critical and symbolic moment. The Ukrainians are begging for more and more weapons as the bloody conflict is dragging on, with no end in sight. The big question right now that everyone here has, from Poland to Washington, is how long until the American public and European allies grow weary about sending billions of dollars' worth of aid to Ukraine. CNN's Clarissa Ward is standing by live in Kyiv. But first this morning, we want to get to Fred Pleitgen, who is in Moscow, where President Putin has just finished that address.

He doesn't believe that they should be inspected by the U.S. or by any other sort of other outside entity, because he obviously believes that that is something that could be detrimental to Russia in their campaign in Ukraine. He was specifically speaking about those places getting attacked. He then went on to say, Look, it's one thing about having something with the United States, having an agreement with the United States, but what about France and the United Kingdom? They have nuclear weapons, as well. And obviously, he sees himself in a major conflict with the collective West, as he -- as he kept putting it. So he's saying, and he made clear, to say this twice, that they are suspending their participation, but they are not going out of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty altogether at this point in time. He did, however, say that, if the United States decides to develop or further develop any nuclear weapons, that Russia would then obviously do the same, as well. So there is a clear warning in all of this. It is a pretty big decision on the part of Vladimir Putin to make, but certainly not one that he couldn't walk back from.",

He accused the Ukrainian government of being responsible for destroying the economy, destroying the lives of its citizens. He accused them of being responsible for starting the war. He accused them of paying more attention to the interests of the West than to the interests of their own Ukrainian people. Really reflecting a sort of startling take on the actual events that we have seen transpire on the ground in the last year. He said, quote -- talking about the Ukrainian government again -- \"They unleashed the war, and we continue to use force to stop it.\" This kind of thinking, this sort of alternative reality, I think, really underscores why it is that the Ukrainian government has shown such reluctance to really sit down at the negotiating table with Vladimir Putin or with his emissaries and try to hash out some kind of a political situation. Because at this stage, it's clear that there is such a discrepancy in understanding and perspective on the war, and there's such a complete lack of respect for truth and for facts, that the Ukrainians just don't believe there's any prospect of being able to take Russia at its word, even if it were to offer a more conciliatory approach. So while you won't see most people here on the ground focusing too much on Putin's speech today, I do think it's fair to say that the leadership will be offering this as classic evidence for why a political solution is just not feasible at the moment.",

And under that treaty, both sides are supposed to be able to inspect the other to make sure that they are complying with the number of warheads that they could have, the deployment of strategic missiles, and so forth. Those inspections haven't happened in the past few years. First because of COVID, and then because the Russians would not allow the inspectors back in. What he has done now is said, I'm done with participating in this inspection thing. What he didn't say was that he's going to build more weapons beyond the 1,550 that are allowed.
