That's how many sheets of plywood will be used to construct the platform on which the nation's 47th president will be sworn in in January. Does that sound like a long way off? Well, consider this, it's already under construction at the Capitol, a tangible sign of the presidential election entering the final phase. Think about it.Both conventions are passed. Labor Day is next weekend. The following week, we're going to see the only scheduled presidential debate, and by then, some voting will already be underway. North Carolina will be the first state to cast their mail-in ballots on September 6. Thereafter, early voting will kick off on September 20 in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Virginia. November 5, not so much Election Day as it is the last day on which you can cast a ballot. Meanwhile, the election continues to be a roller coaster. A month ago, coming out of the RNC, former President Trump looked invincible, but vice president Kamala Harris has now recaptured what President Biden lost as a result of his debate performance. The race is margin of error close, whether viewed nationally or in the seven battleground states, and every day brings a new twist. By any objective measure, the Democratic Convention was a success, well produced, thematic, entertaining speeches. The only hiccup, in my opinion, the disrespect shown to President Biden by having the 81-year-old speak after midnight on Monday, the Vice President accepted her party's nomination with a poised and at times forceful speech. Democrats left town with a sense of confidence not seen since, well, since Republicans left Milwaukee. For Harris, the task is to maintain her momentum when finally taking questions from the media and voters. She's not been on the record in a free flowing manner since entering the race. For Trump, the challenge is to maintain self-control amidst a sea change in the race. His frustration with her ascendancy is palpable. D has always been for Donald, not for discipline. And as Doug Sosnick recently reminded in his latest missive, Trump has never enjoyed majority support as either a candidate or as an incumbent, is a high floor but a low ceiling. When he won in 2016 it was with the benefit of some robust third-party candidates allowing him victory with just 45.9% of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton's 48%. According to 538 most recent polling averages, Trump is currently at 43.6% to Harris's 47.3. And as of yesterday, RFK Jr was drawing 4.6% of the vote. But now he's dropped out and given Trump his blessing in the competitive states. Last night, he and Trump appeared on the same stage for the first time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The whole basis of American democracy is the free flow of information, and we know that a government that can silence its opponents has license for any kind of atrocity. And can you think of any time that you can look back in history and say that the people who were censoring were the good guys. They're always the bad guys because it's always the first step down that slippery slope to totalitarianism. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The DNC Allied mainstream media networks maintain a near perfect embargo on interviews with me during his 10 month presidential campaign in 1992, Ross Perot gave 34 interviews on mainstream networks. In contrast during the 16 months since I declared ABC and. NBC, CBS, MSNBC and CNN combined gave only two live interviews from me. Those networks instead ran a continuous deluge of hit pieces with inaccurate, often vile pejoratives and defamatory smears. Some of those same networks included with the DNC to keep me off the debate stage. (END VIDEOTAPE) [09:05:28] SMERCONISH:  I don't doubt that he's been shunned for the record. He was my guest here three times. I have all the angry emails to prove it, one live, two pre-taped interviews to accommodate his schedule. He was also invited to join us live this morning, and I hosted his wife, actress Cheryl Hines. So Mike Kennedy thwart Harris's convention momentum in an election of inches. The answer is, maybe take a look. This is Nate Silver's silver bullet, an average of 2024, general election polls to appreciate the potential significance, just take a look at Nevada right at the bottom of your screen. Harris and Trump separated by just 0.1% with Kennedy polling 4.5% of the vote in every one of the seven swing states. Kennedy's vote share exceeds the margin separating Harris and Trump. Where will those voters go? Or will they just stay home? It brings me to today's poll question. It's smerconish.com. Does RFK Jr's withdrawal and endorsement of Donald Trump change the race? Joining me now is Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, cofounder of purple strategies and CNN, senior political analyst Ron Brownstein, who's also senior editor at The Atlantic, his latest piece titled, Why The Blue Wall Looms So Large.

RFK, and that makes, I think, makes Kamala Harris a little bit more of the old insider, which is what she's trying to get away from, what she's trying to reinvent herself not to be.But there's something even better for Trump here, and that's the K in RFK, the Kennedy brand, the Kennedy mystique. It still represents a bit of Camelot and the promise of what could be a promise that was interrupted, and I think many Americans hope will be again. Trump's run out of script a little bit. It's the same old show that it used to be. How does he freshen it? How does he appeal to new voters? Well, he's done a little bit of Elon. He's reaching out to young black men. But this gives him, I think, a new way to expand his story. So I think Trump is not a math campaign guy, right? He's not disciplined, as you just said, Michael, he's all about driving entertainment to drive a narrative, to create a story. And this, I think, gives him something new to say.",

I guess he has nothing to contribute at all, which is why the Democrats and Biden and Harris have been working so hard to shut this guy down, to censor him, to get him out of the process. I think a lot of what you're saying, some of the extremism is built into his stock price, but what he does is he changes the narrative for Trump. There's a youthful, optimistic factor to that brand, and I wouldn't discount that Ron. I think you're off base on that.How would I use him? I'd put him on the plane, but not all the time. I think once a week, do an event with him, do something big and powerful. Americans are hungry for politicians who believe in something other than themselves, and that's certainly not Kamala Harris. She just had a convention where she not only just did plastic surgery on herself, she like, ripped out her DNA and inserted some new stuff and then did nothing to explain to the American people why that occurred. It's like somebody who just shows up on your doorstep and you never and just says, oh, I've always loved you when they hated you yesterday and gave you no rationale. It's a very cynical campaign, and I think the more exposure it gets, the more selfish it's going to become. And I think if on the other side, Trump can take advantage of the Kennedy opportunity to expand his vision of the future, which frankly, is hard for Trump. All he's got about to say about the future is, let's make America great again. But if now he's got somebody can talk about children, children's health, clean water.

She had a whole list of economic policies last week. She gave it a DC and C speech, it certainly gave some policy on Israel and Gaza. So I don't think that's quite right what he said. So I think the question to me is, like running for president is not, should not be, in my view, it should not be. Might be just giving stump speeches and then walking off stage. She's not and Gilead specifically. So she did not really run in the primary. She basically was anointed as the candidate picked by the DNC delegates and it is not taking questions from not only many journalists but not many human beings, regular voters either. She's not had the kind of town halls you would have and Q and A's you would have with voters if you ran during the primary. So there's a real sort of democratic small D function, I think in taking questions, accepting the potential of like really being challenged by journalists, being challenged by regular citizens. So I do think it's time to not only have press conferences that are formal, which have more than two or three questions, but also to have interviews that could be -- in my piece, I mentioned, for example, her talking to Christiane Amanpour or Fareed Zakaria, people who are experts in foreign policy, or reporters specialized in economic issues. Because I think part of what I want to see is more debate, more back and forth in terms of, what are her policy ideas as she thought them through? How well can they undergo with rigorous questioning?

How about at the Washington Post, your newspaper? How about at the New York Times? But also some of the other major newspapers in the in the country, could be the Wall Street Journal.Is it incumbent upon her to provide that kind of questioning opportunity, because it's exactly, I think, the type that you're describing. BACON, JR.:  Yes, I think editorial boards are important, and I think those in because you have a wide group of journalists who are in the room who often have different expertises. I'm not trying to say she has to interview with CNN or the New York Times. I work at the post. I'm sure I'd love to interview her, obviously, but my piece is not trying to make the case she should talk to the post or talk to Perry Bacon. Philadelphia inquirers a great newspaper in a swing state where she's visiting all the time. Anyway, there are papers in Wisconsin and Arizona. I just think the point is not necessarily that she should sit down with me. The point is that I want to hear people in those communities get a chance to talk to the candidate. And I want to emphasize again, I also think it's not just a special privilege for reporters. I don't think there should be a point in this campaign where she talks, takes questions from regular voters, which is also not happening, which is also an important part of the presidential process.",
