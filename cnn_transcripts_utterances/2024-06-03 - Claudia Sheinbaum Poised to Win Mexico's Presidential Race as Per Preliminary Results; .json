So shepledges to be a president for all Mexicans. You know, when we talk to voters during this weekend, they recognize that the chances of having a female president was high. So that was not the main factor for them to vote. What they told us they want to see is what kind of president is she going to be? They say they want to see her walk from under the shadow of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and become her own person. She has said during her campaign that she would continue with the policies of Lopez Obrador. But the Mexicans obviously agree with some of that, but they would like her to be not to be a puppet. They want her to be able to show who she is and lead the Mexicans in the next six years. Public safety is going to be a priority. That's what everybody told us. They want to see change because the past few years have been very violent. Mexico is one of the most violent ones in the world. So they want to see what she's going to do to change that, to get some control over the organized crime that Mexico has in many parts of the country. This was a very violent campaign. Over 30 candidates were assassinated. So there's optimism from the voters. Obviously, they like what they saw on her. She's getting at least 58 percent of the vote, according to the National Electoral Institute, means that she will get a mandate. And she's also going to have likely a majority of the state governors behind her and most of the members of Congress. So she should have an easy time governing without much opposition.

And I think that's the other great mystery about the Sheinbaum administration is how much will she continue building on Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's political platform, which essentially brought her not only to the candidacy, but to power and in which areas she might break away from her predecessor.In looking at her political platform, there are three areas specifically that she outlines where we could see potential change. The first one is in the energy sector, where, you know, her scientific background and environmental engineering degree has pushed her to state that she looks to foreign direct investment in clean and renewable energies in Mexico, something that's very different from sort of the fossil fuels and dirty energy that AMLO has, you know, pushed forward during his administration. On the security front, there seems to be a potential change in terms of AMLO's hugs-not-bullets strategy and what Claudia wants to do in terms of strengthening intelligence and information gathering to combat transnational criminal organizations that have taken control of a vast area of Mexican territory. And then on the last point, there is a potential shift in foreign policy in regards to the relationship specifically with the United States, given that the issues of migration, security and commercial ties between both nations will be determined not only by Claudia Sheinbaum's success today, but also who will win the White House in November.

And they seem much less likely to support him or, if they back him, to do so enthusiastically. Many want him to drop out of the race. Now, it won't surprise anybody that Democrats feel that way. But independents, a clear majority of them, pretty much chime in with the Democratic point of view. Republicans were unchanged for the most part, though about 15 percent of Republicans, which is very near the percentage that Nikki Haley has been getting, even though she's dropped out of the race.

Although this was an Israeli proposal back on Thursday of last week, we understand this was handed indirectly to Hamas.We have also been hearing from Israeli officials over the weekend. The prime minister's office, for example, said that this deal would go ahead as long as there were certain conditions that were met. They are the conditions that Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently been saying to make sure that Hamas is not able to be a threat to Israel in the future, that there's no threat coming out of Gaza and that the hostages would be released. Now, we did hear from the U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday when he publicly endorsed this plan and pushed this proposal forward, saying that he believes that Hamas has been, it is in a position now that it wouldn't be able to stage an attack the likes of October the 7th. So its capabilities have been downgraded. So really addressing one of the key concerns from Israel there, the prime minister had been saying he wanted Hamas completely destroyed, something which many questioned from day one, really, a very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. When it comes to what we've heard from Hamas, they initially were positive. We did hear in a statement that they positively viewed this proposal and that they would be responding constructively. We are waiting to hear what that exact constructive response will be at this point. But we know that there have been a flurry of phone calls over the weekend, the secretary of state, for example, calling his counterparts in Qatar, one of the key mediators in Egypt, again, a key mediator that is able to try and put pressure onto Hamas to go forward and to accept this proposal. But when it comes to Israel, there is resistance within Benjamin Netanyahu's own coalition. There are far-right ministers within his coalition who have said that if he does agree to a ceasefire before their conditions are met, and they see that as destroying Hamas completely, then they would leave the government. They would step down, which, of course, would cause significant political problems internally for Israel. So there are many different elements to convince at this point. It does appear, though, as though the U.S. is viewing this favorably, saying that they believe this plan, this proposal is very close, in fact, almost identical to a plan that Hamas had been suggesting as well. So they're hoping there's very little distance between the two sides now. Rosemary.",

One of the key factors here is former President Jacob Zuma and his upstart party that really had made huge inroads in particularly one province, KwaZulu-Natal. Now there will be a significant meeting of the ANC on Tuesday. We might get some sense of how they are thinking this should move along, but really they are not entirely in the driver's seat, Rosemary, because of the fact they have lost so many votes. They won't be able to dictate the terms of any coalition or informal agreement. I think investors, South Africans, politicians from both bigger and smaller parties are going to watch extremely closely how this plays out and many are hoping for a level of political maturity that at least some politicians in the past haven't shown in the South African context.

But still, he told reporters that right now the U.S. policy has not changed, that they do not want to see Ukraine firing long-range American weapons, including those ATACMs systems, deep into Russia. They don't want to see the conflict escalate to that degree, don't want to see, of course, Ukraine striking deep into Russia itself. And so for now, that policy remains extremely limited, really, to allow Ukraine to defend itself in that small area. But President Zelenskyy, of course, he has said that, you know, in order to defeat Russia, in order to defeat Vladimir Putin, the international community needs to not be afraid of him and needs to not show weakness, but rather strength. But still, Secretary Austin earlier today, he did say that this is going to make a huge difference for the Ukrainians in order to defend themselves against these strikes. And he said, importantly, that the Russian advances in Kharkiv, they have slowed because they have run into Russian defenses. Now, Secretary Austin also met, importantly, with the Chinese defense minister here in Singapore just a few days ago, and he raised the fact that the U.S. believes that China is actively supporting Russia in its war in Ukraine. And he underscored that the Chinese could face consequences from the U.S. and the international community if they continue to do that. But Zelenskyy, for his part, he was unable to secure meetings here in Singapore with Chinese officials. He has been trying to get them to come to a peace summit that Ukraine is hoping to hold in the next two weeks in Switzerland. It does not seem like that's going to happen.
