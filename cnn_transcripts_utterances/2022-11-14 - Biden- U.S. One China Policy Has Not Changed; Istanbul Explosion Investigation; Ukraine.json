U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are coming off their face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali. This was their first in-person meetings since Mr. Biden took office and lasted more than three hours. And the stakes could not have been higher. North Korea's missile tests trade climate change and human rights are all part of Monday's talks along with tensions over Taiwan. President Xi stated that the self-governing Island is at the core of China's interests and is a red line that cannot be crossed. Well, President Biden said he doesn't see China invading Taiwan anytime soon. CNN's Ivan Watson is covering the G20 for us in Bali. And our Selina Wang joins us from Beijing. Good to have you both with us. I'll start with you first, Ivan. So, this three-hour meeting went much longer than expected. And the two leaders certainly had a lot to discuss.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Lynda exactly. I mean, walking into this meeting, tensions couldn't have been higher at the lowestpoint in decades. But there are some key areas where they do have agreement. Critically, the idea that they both realize that U.S.-China relations are not living up to global expectations and that both countries have a responsibility as global powers to improve the relation to stabilize it, to prevent it from veering into conflict, because that's not an either country's best interest. So we did get that concrete statement that they would restart those talks at various levels of the government not just at the high level, but also at the working level. We also heard some statements about Ukraine. Now the Chinese readout said that China does want to promote peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. However, what it differed with the White House readout is that the Chinese readout did not include the statement that China also opposes the use of nuclear force. Now, however, despite all the smiles and handshakes to your point, there are so many fundamental disagreements between these two countries. That one meeting cannot even begin to scratch the surface. There are fundamental challenges and fundamental opposition, a lot of mutual distrust and hostility. From Beijing's perspective, they increasingly see America as trying to suppress its rise trying to keep China down. They point to recent sanctions from the United States, these sweeping export restrictions that choke off China's access to critical advanced semiconductor chips. That not only hits China's military development goals, but also its economic and technological development. On the other hand, you've got the United States. You do hear Biden saying that he doesn't want a new cold war after this meeting. However, he has been increasing this framing of autocracies versus democracies. He's also labeled China as America's most consequential geopolitical challenge. There has been increasing rhetoric from Washington that Beijing is trying to supplant America's role as a world's dominant power. So deep divisions here, but the fact that they're agreeing to talk is better than a lot of expectations going into this meeting.",

And to know that nothing could be done there. Let me say that my aunt, she lost one of her pupils, former students because she is the teacher of Ukrainian language and Ukrainian literature, because there was a missile and the shrapnel just fell into the window of that student. She was killed immediately. There was a guy who was helping to maintain electricity. And he was beaten hugely by Russian soldiers and he needed to leave. Very few people left there and they were living in such a fear. So, when I saw this video, and it went viral everywhere, not only in my account, but on different other social media. And she's like very popular person right now. And she even doesn't know this because she doesn't have her connection. This is such an important, such an emotional period of our life, such a relief, but at the same time we are crying so hugely. This is such a sadness and a joy. Last week when we were talking to my aunt, and she was saying that she was waiting to hug me and to see me so much when Russians leave.

Now when we see that because of Ukrainian army, because of the fact that the world is united and helps us. We could made Russians retreat from Kyiv, Kharkiv, from Kherson. So we can have our lands, our people back and we can maintain democracy here serving as an example to many countries in post-Soviet region. So, what I would ask you to say that Ukraine -- there is no any country in the world and there is no any people in the world that would love to help these more than Ukraine.

One of those NGOs has been monitoring the number of those killed since the protests began. It's been warning that beyond the revised toilet gave on Saturday of 326 people killed since these protests began. There are those of course who've been charged, held, arrested, some charge, now convicted of crimes that could lead to executions. And, of course, that is one of the great tragedies of what's going on in Iran right now is that the death toll continues to rise from the active protests themselves. But also, Lynda, because of the nature of the judicial system and the way it functions as well. And there is, of course, a coordinated response going on from outside the country, even as we hear news of this, the first conviction since those protests began and that is an extra round of sanctions being placed on Tehran, not just by the European Union, but the United Kingdom in coordination with each other to try and continue to put pressure on those that they believe are responsible. Not just for the initial arrest that led to all these protests and murder, but also all of the repression has gone on since, Lynda.",

More than three-hour meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jing ping that the U.S. president says was open and candid. It was their first face-to- face meetings since Mr. Biden became president. The talks come at a time of strange relations, especially when it comes to trade and Taiwan. Mr. Biden says he does not think China has any imminent plans to invade Taiwan and said the issue of Taiwan's future can be resolved peacefully. Russia is denying speculation about the health of its foreign minister who was in Bali to attend the G20 Summit. The spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in Indonesia says reported Sergey Lavrov was taken to a hospital in Bali and not true. The foreign ministry spokesperson released a video of Lavrov sitting outside in shorts and a T-shirt. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived at the G20 Summit just hours after Istanbul was rocked by an explosion. It happens on a busy street in the heart of Turkey's largest city. Police say a Syrian national trained by Kurdish separatists is behind the blast to kill at least six people and injured dozens others. The armed wing of the Kurdish Workers Party is denying involvement. The suspect is in custody. Police say she planted a bomb at the scene and then left in a taxi. Authorities are calling it a terrorist attack. Our Scott McLean is following the story from London and joins us now live. So this explosion, Scott, happened in the heart of Istanbul in what is it a bustling pedestrian area. What more can you tell us about this suspect?",

Those conflicts have cost tens of thousands of lives over the last 40 years. So, obviously, Turkey, the United States see things very, very differently.
