      "sentences": "That`s right, Coy. It has been a brutally hot week and it`s all thanks to a heat dome. Now, essentially whatwe`ve had set up this week is a high-pressure system essentially parked over the central U.S. Now, normally we all know heat rises, but under high pressure, that`s actually pushing that air back down towards the surface, essentially acting like a giant lid, trapping that heat, keeping all of it back closer to the surface. And what that does is it allows a lot of this same area under that high pressure to just be dealing with incredibly hot temperatures. And in some cases prolonged periods of time because that high pressure system simply doesn`t move. Now over this week, we`ve had over 400 locations break, record temperatures. Again, all the way from Texas up into Minnesota and back over towards the Atlantic side of states like Georgia and Florida. Now, we are still going to continue to see those heat records continue. A lot of excessive heat warnings and heat advisories still in effect for the day Friday. But I have some good news and that is cooler temperatures are on the way, especially across the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast once we get into the latter half of the weekend and into next week.",

Rossum`s Universal Robots was a check play about machines taking over. The next time you have to do chores like taking out the trash or doing the dishes. What if you could have a robot do it for you? It sounds like science fiction. It sounds like the future, but the future is apparently near. The team at Austin-based robotics startup, Apptronik believes their human like droid helpers will soon become the norm. We caught up with them to find out what all they are capable of and the potential downsides. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHLEY STRICKLAND, CNN SPACE &amp; SCIENCE REPORTER:  What is Apollo, exactly? JEFF CARDENAS, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, APPTRONIK:  Apollo is our latest humanoid robot. Sometimes you`ll hear us called a general-purpose robot. This is something that is going to be your friend.

We have a big labor shortage here in the U.S. So where Apollo`s going to start is in warehouses. Like you kind of see here, it can lift about 55 pounds. It operates on about a four-hour battery and you can change the battery out so you can keep it running 22 hours a day is what we`re targeting.",
