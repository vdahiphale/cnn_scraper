I was in there. And he just had this permanent scowl on his face the whole time in a way that we haven't seen him with other situations. Donald Trump is so much more sensitive about Michael Cohen that I do think it will be remarkable to see how he handles just being in the same room as him, being in his presence. I was banned from a White House event when I was covering Donald Trump because I asked about Michael Cohen in the Oval Office and it infuriated Donald Trump so much that he instructed his aides to not allow me into another event. That is the level of sensitivity he has about someone even bring up Michael Cohen's name, much less being in the same room as him.",

Michael Cohen has been called to the stand and we will be bringing you all of that - all of the details as they come in. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger is going to conduct the direct examination of Michael Cohen. We also have some new photographs of Donald Trump from inside the courtroom. There he is. Looks like he's in a mood. So, let me bring in Lanny Davis right now, who used to represent Michael Cohen. And, Lanny, thanks for being here. Michael Cohen's entered the courtroom. You said you spoke to him last night. Tell me about his mindset testifying. This is one of the most important days of his life. LANNY DAVIS, MICHAEL COHEN'S FORMER ATTORNEY: Well, much better than the night before he faced Jim Jordan and Mmark Meadows and the Republicans because he has a judge who's presiding. In that particular venue there were no rules and it was all attack. You walked into a room and on the wall was behind Jim Jordan, liar, liar, pants on fire. And the night before we did try to provoke him over and over again to being called a liar. So, he's going to do very well today. Last night he and I joked about whether this will be worse than what he faced with Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows.
