The highest court in the land will do unanimous that Donald Trump cannot be remove from any states ballot because of his actions on January 6. The former president is calling the decision of quote, big win for America. He's expected to speak any moment now from Mar-a-Lago.In the meantime, let's go straight to the Supreme Court outside that building is where our Paula Reid is. So, Paula, give our viewers a sense of what this decision does and what it does not do? And we're talking about just hours before voters in key states go to the polls.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. Here this is the biggest election related decision from the court and nearly a quarter century. And it comes just hours before Super Tuesday. And here a unanimous court ruling that the state of Colorado cannot remove former President Trump from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the so-called insurrectionist ban.The court writing quote, because the constitution makes Congress rather than the states responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal office holders and candidates we reverse. We conclude that states may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But states have no power under the constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency. And Dana, they talked about their concern that if individual states were each able to make different decisions, that it would create what they described as a patchwork across the country that they equate with Congress. And they said, look, that's not what the constitution intended here. Now, even though this was a unanimous decision. Four justices also wrote concurrences, saying that they disagreed with the idea that the only way to enforce this part of the constitution was through a statute enacted by Congress. The three liberal justices are writing that there are other ways that you have foreclosed on by writing this decision. And notably, Justice Barrett wrote her own concurrence. She said, look, I don't want to sign on to the exact language that these liberal justices are using. She also said, quote, in my judgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency. The court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings in the court should turn the national temperature down, not up. Now, of course, she's speaking to the fact that this is a case about Trump. Political tensions running high right now. It comes to the court at a moment, Dana, when they are under a lot of scrutiny for ethics, questions about partisanship and it is notable that here this is a unanimous decision. It is also of course, a win for the former president, but this quote -- this idea that they should turn the temperature down and not up. They always deal of course, with politically charged issues. This is a quote that could come back to haunt her. And in just a month and a half, they will all be back together to heal all arguments on another Trump related case on immunity. So, this is the first of at least two major Trump related cases that the court will hear this year.",

He actually just moments ago went on a radio show. When he said that he was honoured by the nine to nothing vote. And that the next thing of equal importance was that immunity ruling. It would be done hearing the arguments there.But the important thing to really note here is that Donald Trump's team feels very good about this, not just because of the fact that they won in this argument that he will remain on the ballot. This was something that they had long expected. Donald Trump himself watched those oral arguments commented to a number of people that he thought that his lawyers did a very good job. And they believed that of all the legal challenges that Trump is facing, that this is really the one that they were the strongest -- had the strongest legal argument for. So, they were anticipating a win here. But overall, they are feeling very good about his legal standing, particularly given that the Supreme Court also decided that they were going to hear those immunity claims something that would likely delay those trials, possibly past the election.",

It's not going to be a matter for judicial resolution under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, but it's up to Congress to enforce it.You know, I disagree with that interpretation, just because the other parts of the 14th Amendment are self-executing. People can go to court and say that something violates equal protection, even if there's not a federal statute that allows them to do that. But in any event, the Supreme Court punted and said, it's up to Congress to act. And so, I am working with a number of my colleagues, including Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Eric Swalwell to revive legislation that we had to set up a process by which we could determine that someone who committed Insurrection is disqualified by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. And the House of Representatives already impeached Donald Trump for participating in insurrection by inciting it. So, the House has already pronounced upon that. And there was also a 57 to 43 vote in the Senate. The question is whether Speaker Mike Johnson would allow us to bring this to the floor of the House.",

I'm going to get to what Congress can -- maybe from your perspective, there's a shoot and then there's a can, which I'm going to get to in one second, but just looking again at this decision today, on page 12 of the decision. The justices said that the patchwork that would likely result from state enforcement would sever the direct link that the framers found so critical between the national government and the people of the United States as a whole.

In some states, it's very difficult for an Independent or a Green Party or Libertarian to get on the ballot and other states, it's much easier to get on. So that patchwork already exists. That's just a reflection of existing electoral federalism.But obviously, the Supreme Court did not want to step up to the plate and deal with the clear textualist meaning of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, much less did they want to deal with the original purposes of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was to keep off of -- keep out of federal office, people who've already proven themselves, disloyal and untrustworthy.",

You mentioned Congress -- the Supreme Court, of course, mentioned Congress. And you're right that they said, this is not up to us. We've seen the Supreme Court do that. And on other really big fundamental issues in recent years, even with a slightly different makeup of the court voting rights, for example, even Obamacare way back when.And what we've seen, particularly on voting rights, and now, I would guess, with this issue is, it's really hard for this Congress to do anything. That's relatively easy. When you look at the support for any given issue. Never mind something that's really hard. And I would call -- I would put this question in the really hard category.

A couple of them are still around.But it seems like Mike Johnson and the leadership of the GOP are very clearly under the spell of Donald Trump and would probably do everything they could to keep this from going to the floor, even though it's just the mere enforcement of a clear constitutional command as the Supreme Court itself pointed out.

On the other hand, a lot of people have suggested that because this was a unanimous decision that the court wanted to do but enter into some kind of grand constitutional bargain that would restore some of the lost legitimacy of the court.And they would say, therefore, nine to zero, this can't be up to the states, they can control only access to the state ballot, not the federal ballot. It's up to Congress. And then in the presidential immunity case, stick with the unanimous bipartisan ruling from the D.C. Circuit, saying, of course, we don't have any kings here. We don't have dictators. No, a president cannot assassinate his political opponents and escape any kind of criminal consequences unless he's impeached in the House and convicted in the Senate, which was the argument that Trump's lawyers actually made before the D.C. Circuit. So, I would hope that would happen. Unfortunately, there are at least three justices who were appointed or nominated to the court by Donald Trump who appeared not to be veering very far from what the MAGA element wants them to do. But let's hope that this is the case where they can vindicate themselves and also rehabilitate the very tarnished image of the Supreme Court at this point.",

We have Laura Coates at the Supreme Court, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams is here as is CNN's Joan Biskupic.Laura, I'm going to go to you out there at the court. What is your sort of main takeaway? Now that you've had some time to read and digest. What's your main takeaway from how this all was written? How it all went down, particularly the prokarium at the beginning, and then the concurring opinions by the three liberals? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Well, Dana, we kind of had an inkling of what was going to come because we had that over to our oral argument. They were very skeptical about the idea of one state being able to make a determination that would impact the entire nation. And lo and behold, that was the very conclusion. If you had to sum up all in one way, it'd be two things. Patchwork and stay in your lane. They did not want to have a patchwork of states deciding different ways to remove them from a ballot. In one state it might be secretary of state's office, and another might be a criminal prosecution. He didn't want to have an inconsistent result but also staying in your lane, you know, that the states are in charge of elections. But here they said, yes, that's true for really a state office, but not for a federal one. And these justices said, look, you cannot have individual state, making these determinations for us the rest of the nation here. It was a really, really setting opinion, though, in its unanimity. But as you mentioned, there are three at least who have said, well, we agree with the patchwork analysis. After that you go too far.

In terms of will there ever be any way that Donald Trump could be kept off any ballot in the future. [12:20:00] The majority says, no way because it can only be enforced through an act of Congress in a particular way. And three of the liberals -- the three liberals who protested that really came on strong saying there should be other opportunities. They quote the dissent from Bush v. Gore to say that, you know, to suggest this was another majority going too far as Bush v. Gore did in many people's minds. And that's when, you know, Amy Coney Barrett made her statement even though she joined the liberals on substance there. She said this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency.

The court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a presidential election, particularly in the circumstance writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.And meanwhile, again, as Joan discussed, you talked about the fact that the three more liberal justices evoked Bush V. Gore. In the very beginning of what they wrote, they evoked Dobbs, and they were kind of throwing the majority's dobs decision in their face. If it is not necessary. This is on page 15. If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case than it is necessary to not to decide more Dobbs V. Jackson, Women's Health Organization, that fundamental principle of judicial restraint is practically as old as our republic.
