Trump aides telling CNN they believe formats and calendars can't change issues like immigration and the economy that they think are dominating the race and certainly can't change how Biden comes off on camera. Joining us now CNN's Isaac Dovere. And Isaac, you have new reporting about both campaigns getting ready for this debate on June 27th. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yes, look, it's a month away. But for them, the preparations are already underway, especially for the Biden campaign, which feels like they have a plan to organize toward June 27th. With a lot of things they're going to be doing, including marking the anniversaries of the Pulse shooting in Orlando, talking about guns, marking the anniversary of the Dobbs decision, talking about abortion. But all of it aimed at really just what they think is a very transparent, straightforward approach to going at Donald Trump on stage, which is to say, how do you defend these things? Just say what you say about this, they feel like that contrast is really going to be to their benefit. There's a lot of preparation that's going into that, on the Biden side. On the Trump side, they have so far advisors tell us looked at this and said, they're not doing a lot of formal prep, they're not expecting --",

Chris Christie is clearly not going to be part of the process of helping Trump this time around. And Rudy Giuliani doesn't seem like he's going to be either. And so, that's a real shift. And you see that on the Biden side, it is by and large, the same group of people around him that are preparing and they know the way that he goes at this. Biden, one of the words that tends to be used when talking about the Biden preparations is sprawling by people who've been part of it, exhausting. That Biden can sometimes get too focused on -- or not focused enough really and just go off on tangents.

And I've said, hey, Senator Schumer, if you want to actually pass something, let's sit down and actually work this out. But this is not a bipartisan attempt to be able to solve something. This is a partisan attempt for fundraising. SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-AZ): All talk and no action goes both ways.

And you played a clip of Jon Tester. He's one person I think we should pay attention to, because what's going on with Jon Tester? Well, he's running for reelection in Montana. It's a red state. He's a Democratic Senator, that there's going to be a closer race as we are probably going to have in any Senate race there. And what hangs in the balance, the power balance of the Senate itself.

That's exactly what they were doing yesterday. This is a meticulously planned event that took place in a transparent pavilion on the South Lawn. We learned from the first lady's office that it was adorned with more than a thousand candles. Now, the guests enjoyed a three course meal that we know include a chilled heirloom tomato soup, as well as lobster and beef short ribs and as you saw there, entertainment headlined by Brad Paisley and the Howard Gospel Choir. Now, of course, this was book ending a critical visit by the Kenyan leader, it was the first day visit by an African -- an African leader since 2008. And we heard from both President Biden and the Kenyan president over the course of the day yesterday where the two were underscoring their decades long relationship and also how they plan to further cooperate on the economy and economic cooperation as well as on other issues like for example, managing the spiraling situation in Haiti.
