      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\"! Fantastic to have you with us for another superlative show filled with truly superhumanfeats. We'll reach for the stars with a huge state of the art rocket and introduce you to heroes performing medical miracles closer to home in Ukraine. First though, to South Texas where the countdown is officially on for the first ever launch of the SpaceX starship, propelled by the most powerful rocket ever built. This is taking two of course because the mission was called off at the last moment on Monday, but all systems are going at this moment. This is a first move for a spacecraft that could eventually take us to the moon, then Mars and beyond. We're going to be live in Houston with the latest and even more technological trends ahead we'll rock it over to the superhuman Center. This is a state of the art rehabilitation facility in Lviv, Ukraine. It's offering care to both civilians and soldiers who've suffered life changing injuries in the war, a phenomenal array actually of scientific excellence and innovation combined with philanthropy to provide hope, I think to people. For now they're the action on global markets, slightly less hopeful take a look at that and it's actually a sea of red. U.S. Futures in certain need of rocket fuel with low energy. Tesla earnings, pressuring the NASDAQ Europe can't make it off the launch pad either as you can see, lowers there. XETRA DAX in Germany, the underperformer calm though markets overall, compared to last month's March Madness. The VIX volatility index, the fear index as it's known, currently sitting at 52 week lows, but tensions not far from the surface real concerns that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates not only in May, but perhaps even in June as well, if inflation doesn't show noticeable improvement. Weak bank lending and the still unresolved debt ceiling debate here in the United States could change the dynamic for the Federal Reserve very quickly. The latest Fed's Beige Book out yesterday showed tighter credit conditions so tighter lending conditions across many parts of the United States, and also alarm growing in Washington with tax revenues coming in weaker than expected so far. This means that the U.S. could run out of emergency spending options before mid-June and still no political resolution to raise the debt ceiling incite a critical countdown that no one is looking forward to and speaking of countdowns, we're now around 25 minutes away from the launch of the SpaceX starship. This monster rocket is nearly 400 feet tall and has 33 engines. Today's launch attempt comes after years of testing and it's the first step in Elon Musk's vision of sending humans to the Moon and Mars. And joining us now is Former NASA Astronaut Leroy Chiao. He's also a Former Commander of the International Space Station and sits on the SpaceX Safety Advisory Panel. Leroy, fantastic to have you on the show! I'm afraid to get too excited after how close we got on Monday's attempt. How confident are you that this one actually makes it?",

And so they went all the way to declare it at about this point in the countdown, they were going to do a wet rehearsal. And so they did go to countdown to near T zero before backing out.

And so what you'll see is that as we approach the separation point, the thrust will tail off. You'll see the engines kind of throttle down as they get ready to shut down and then they'll shut down and then the separation will occur. And the six engines will ignite on the upper stage or rather the starship in this case, and you'll see it continue to burn and fly away and then the booster will just simply fall away. It will do a couple of burns of some thrusters to get it into the right attitude, but then it's going to splashdown. In the future you'll see the booster flip around and come back and land or land on a drone ship. Just like Falcon IX -- notice SpaceX's Falcon IX and so that eventually this will be a fully reusable system both the Falcon super heavy booster as well as the starship vehicle.",

Well yes, rebuilding infrastructure, roads and bridges is important. But without people it's not going to mean anything. So we need to start rebuilding Ukrainians. And Ukrainians build rebuild their country. So this is what Superhumans are doing. Basically, we unfortunately, we estimate more than 10,000 people right now who are in need of prosthetics in the Ukraine. Official numbers are of course classified, but this is our estimate. And we are working towards getting them the most. The most newest the top notch prosthetics, bionic arms and bionic legs there are on the market.

We're talking about, again, as I said, 10,000, more with prosthetics tens of thousands of people who need help with reconstruction. Unfortunately, the state is too busy with the war. So they don't pay attention to aesthetics and to these kinds of things. Their goal is to stabilize and to keep the patient alive. And our goal is to take this people, the bravest people on earth and reintegrate them back into their society, to make sure they're back at work doing whatever they were doing before. If, for example, it was an ice skating instructor we make to make sure that the prosthetic he gets he or she gets is going to be an ice skating prosthetic so we can go back to training kids and same thing with their faces, their limbs and their bodies.

There have been well over 2.5 million tributes to him on this hash-tag. Many talking about their grief and their shock and to add to that as well, just 11 days before this happened, Moon Bin had actually said on a live stream that he had been struggling we have a quote, he said, \"It's been quite hard. I tried not to show it and it is the job I chose. So I need to bear with it\". So very upsetting words, there seeing that he was struggling in the days before this has happened the police and the agency asking for privacy for the family at this point, so they can deal with their grief but it is yet another member of the Korean entertainment industry that has it is believed by police taken their own lives.
