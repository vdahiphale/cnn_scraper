And this time in Kurdish areas, we're going to take you to the Middle East for the latest developments on that. It is 09:00 a.m. in Washington D.C., 05:00 p.m. in Damascus. I'm Jessica Dean, and this is \"Connecting the World\". Also coming up today, in the hour ahead, Saudi Arabia will be named as host nation of the 2034 World Cup. We have a full report on this historic moment for the region and the tough questions being asked about the Saudi bid. Plus, urgent action to help the environment. CNN goes around the world to meet people making a difference on this call to Earth Day. And the stock market in New York will open in about a half hour. The indices are on the green premarket, as you see just a few minutes after the Bureau of Labor released the consumer price index. Prices were up 2.7 percent in November, showing U.S. inflation is heating up slightly, but analysts say not so high, to keep the Federal Reserve from cutting rates next week. After rebels ousted the Bashar Al Assad regime, the turmoil in Syria is now reaching areas controlled by Kurdish forces. The rebel coalition says it's taking control of the Eastern City of Deir Ezzor, and you can see many camouflages outside the administration building there. Deir Ezzor had been controlled by the U.S. backed and Kurdish led Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF. It comes just a day after the SDF agreed to withdraw from Manbij, which is near the Turkish border, following attacks from a group allied with Turkey. And for more on all of this, I want to go to CNN's Paula Hancocks, who is in Abu Dhabi. Paula, two Kurdish control cities have now fallen, one of the rebels, as we noted, one to the attacks by a Turkish backed group. What does it tell us about the many players who were involved in Syria? It's not just a single rebel coalition.",

They were all considered anti-Assad groups. And so, they were united in their quest to topple the dictator that has happened. And now, of course, they have to find a new reason to unite, and we are seeing that is simply not happening. In some cases, we're seeing Turkish backed factions fighting against Kurdish fighters in Northern Syria in a number of different locations of over the past week. We also heard from Turkish state media, they say that a Turkish drone took out a convoy, as they believed that Kurdish fighters had taken control of some weapons. They say there were about 12 trucks filled with ammunition, which they took out and provided images of that as well. So, you have these different groups, for example, the Turkish backed groups. It isn't just one group. There are dozens of groups within that umbrella itself with many different ideologies, and they are fighting against the U.S. backed group, SDF. We heard from the U.S. Defense Secretary, in fact, Lloyd Austin, talking about this, saying that they are conferring with the SDF. They have been working with them in the past, as they say that they have been helping in the fight against ISIS, and they mediated a cease fire in another area, a City of Manbij, that the SDF evacuated and withdrew from so it is highly complex. There are many different factions in Syria at this point. Before they were in different geographical areas. They certainly have different interests. But the fact that they were united against the common enemy, that common enemy has now gone. So, it is being -- it's very interesting to see just how the main rebel group, HTS is going to be able to try and create some kind of unity amongst them, if it will even try, Jessica.",

And when something because they say there's going to be instability in Syria for years, and who knows who's going to be on the other side of the border, we need to secure our border.

And in Southern Syria, there's also very close relationship, because there is a big Druze community in Israel. Israel even told the Druze community in Israel that if the Druze community in Syria will be under threat, Israel will intervene. But when it comes to HTS, I think that's the most interesting thing. And the Israelis have sent messages to HTS through third parties that they -- and they warn them not to get anywhere close to the border with Israel, and that if they get close to the border with Israel, the IDF will take action.

And as he has been doing with President Trump of around 2026 that he promised to be the face of the new FIFA when he came to become president in 2016 but from what we've been seeing, perhaps not immune to make the same mistakes of the past once again. The FIFA extraordinary congress is taking place as we speak, is item eight on the agenda, which is going to be the official awarding of these two tournaments to Morocco, Portugal and Spain, and then Saudi Arabia. But it says so much of where we are, the state of play, the engineering of this process. There's not going to be questions asked by the media, there's not going to be a press conference.
