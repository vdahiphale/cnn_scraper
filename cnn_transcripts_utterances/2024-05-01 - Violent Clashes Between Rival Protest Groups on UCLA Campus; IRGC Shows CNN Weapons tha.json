What is he said the right to peaceful protests. Let's bring in CNN's Gabe Cohen, who's been at the scene at Columbia University since early this morning.

And today, you can see clearly this big NYPD presents a few officers here. As we come around. There's a lot more security a lot more officers in this restricted main entrance to the campus here. But look, the tone had really changed where you heard the mayor yesterday, Eric Adams talking about those professional outside agitators, as he put it. The insinuation or the claim at least that more than half of the people involved in the protests, Becky, were not affiliated with Columbia. And they felt that the violence associated with breaking and entering Hamilton Hall here warranted additional action and the school obviously agree because the school not only requested that the NYPD come in and clear out the protesters that were on the lawn as well as in the building. But they also have requested that the NYPD stay here until May 17, two days after graduation. And so we expect we're going to continue to see this, officers out front trying to make sure that more protests don't pop back up. But look, the reality is, Becky, that this campus is divided on this issue. We have a lot of Jewish students and faculty and members of the community here who have raised concerns about safety for Jewish students and Jewish individuals who fear that the protest has created an environment that is unsafe for them. But I've also spoken with students who said last night I spoke with a freshman who was inside his dorm he talked about last night. A lot of other students around him there being disagreement, some feeling like police didn't belong on the campus that student safety was at risk is that police action, dozens of officers came in and arrested a couple 100 of these protesters. Some felt like that shouldn't happen here at Columbia, there are others who felt like it was necessary given the escalation of the protests. But again, it is a quiet morning, today. We'll see what happens in the hours ahead, especially as we learn more about those protesters who have been arrested, as we learn how many of them are Columbia students, or if the mayor is right that so many of them are outside agitators.",

And we saw an operation where dozens of police officers from the NYPD climbed in through a second floor window. And it was really, it was dramatic. It was Becky. One of the issues that we're facing is that media is not allowed on this campus. It's closed and even last night's Student Press has been allowed on. But even they were pushed aside by police as they came on. So we're relying on images that have come from NYPD and protesters and obviously both of them have their own interests.",

Or are they going to view it through the lens that I think probably makes more sense in this case, which is the lens of politics in Israel, because hours after the Israeli Prime Minister made those comments, we then heard from Bezalel Smotrich, the Finance Minister, a key member of Netanyahu's governing coalition, who's really propping up this government right now alongside Itamar Ben-Gvir. And he basically threatened to walk to make this government collapse if the current deal that is on the table comes to fruition because he is saying that he believes this deal will effectively lead to the end of the war before Israeli troops go into Rafah, before they complete the objectives of defeating Hamas in Gaza. So Netanyahu is really doing a lot of political messaging at the moment as well. And we will see whether or not that meets the diplomatic reality on the ground.",

Ifyou look behind me here, this is an area that has been held down by Israeli supporters. Then beyond that, there's a barricade. And on the other side of the Barricade, there's a walkway that the university built in there. And as we see some hired security, and then another barricade, and then the encampment of the pro Palestine supporters on that side. What we saw overnight, was skirmishes breaking out. And in some of the videos, you could also see that there were some people who were pulling away the barricades from the pro Palestine encampment and throwing things at them. Some of those security people in the middle we're trying to put the barricades back. All of this going on while obviously there's plenty of helicopters who are shooting this video and reporters out there. So you could see this, but what was missing was a police presence. And then after 1 am local that is when the Mayor of Los Angeles said that what she was saying was an -- And she called in for LAPD, the Los Angeles Police Department to make their way to campus. But they did not get here until things had been devolving here on campus for a while. By the time we got to like 3 am that is about when the police were in position, maybe before that in the 2 o'clock hour, were in position and we're pushing people out. And they pushed people out, made a line of people across here where I'm standing now and then slowly started to erect this barricade that's right here. But there were some protesters and they just used a wall of humanity, these law enforcement officers from different local agencies and push people out on that side there. There was still some agitation out here we saw some people yelling, but what I can tell you is it was enough inside there that some of the student reporters for the school newspaper, The Daily Bruin said that some of the people had irritants sprayed at them, that they were injured, that they were assaulted in there and that it was dangerous for them. They now just put out a an Op-Ed on their website right now saying that UCLA is complicit in the violence that occurred last night because it took so long for law enforcement officers to get here on campus. So there are questions of accountability. Yesterday, we saw the chance to say that this, you know, encampment now. What they were seeing was now unlawful, and that they were increasing the security that was on campus. But for these reporters, they're saying, where was the security overnight? Why did it take so long for them to get here? But obviously, as you can tell, even when you take a look, and you look at the law enforcement officers, you can see, Becky, that there's a very different energy now things are a lot calmer. They're quiet. We did hear chanting from the Palestinian camp. But all of that now completely died down as the sun is just now starting to come up here in Los Angeles, Becky.",

And you'd see they probably fix their barricades to put them back in place there. But overnight, we saw fireworks being thrown into the camp there, you could see that they were pulling at the plywood and the barricades that were there, saw people throwing rocks in there, and then people spraying something out from the camp towards the people. So that's how everything was devolving. But you can see it's still very much there at this point today. We're going to be out here watching to see what happens with this and if there are more pressures to remove this situation from campus. But as you can see, right now, the police presence is there.
