This is reporting that CNN has, that Western and U.S. officials are saying that, frankly, they are getting a bit of a dose ofreality, that two months or so into this counteroffensive, we're really not seeing much movement. The fact that Russia had the time to build up its defenses, especially, we see, in the south, has meant that Ukraine has faced mounting casualties, now in some areas, having to pull back units in order to minimize those casualties. Look, in many, ways this wasn't unexpected. President Zelenskyy has been saying look, we were waiting. We wanted to start the counteroffensive in the spring. We had to wait for more weapons, for more ammunition, until around early June, when we felt comfortable enough to start it. But there are questions around that as well, whether enough training was given to the brigades who were operating some of the Western weapons systems, that balancing act we've been talking about, whether to go quicker or to wait for more training. Some of that is coming into play now. But I suppose one small silver lining for the Ukrainians is that at least this manages the expectations and they are still getting, as we saw with the Abrams tanks, they are still getting these Western weapons through.",

On a global diplomatic push currently underway in Niger, a senior U.S. official met with members of the military junta on Monday to push for an end to what is this country's coup. Well, the acting deputy secretary of state, Victoria Nuland, says they had a frank conversation but made no progress in restoring constitutional order, adding, quote, \"It was not easy to get traction there.\" Well, instead, the junta has been trying to strengthen its own authority. It has hosted allies from Mali, Burkina Faso and appointed a new prime minister. Earlier today, President Bazoum's prime minister claimed in an interview with a French broadcaster that the military junta had asked a delegation of ECOWAS to return to Niger for another round of talks at the highest level, likely on Tuesday. Let's get you more on this. We're covering this on all fronts. I'm joined by CNN's Larry Madowo, who is in Nairobi; Kylie Atwood at the U.S. State Department. Larry, what do we understand to be the situation on the ground? We know this deadline for the reinstatement of the president passed Sunday. ECOWAS suggesting that they want to hear more and that military intervention is clearly still on the table. What do we understand to be the conversation or the narrative between ECOWAS and the military junta in Niger at this point? What happens next?",

I mean, she gave a pretty sober assessment of her meetings on the ground in Nigerwith the military junta, saying that they had frank discussions but also calling it a difficult mission. And as you've said, saying it was really challenging to gain any traction, when it comes to a negotiated settlement here, because, fundamentally, what the military junta wants doesn't see eye to eye with the constitution of Niger. And the U.S. has long been pressing over the last few weeks for the return of the democratically elected president, President Bazoum, who Victoria Nuland, the deputy secretary of state, acting deputy secretary of state, wasn't even allowed to see while she was in Niger. She says U.S. officials have had discussions with him, so they have been in contact. But it was pretty clear that the contours of her visit were controlled by the military, which is now in power. She said that she made very clear to them what the United States is going to have to do if they do declare this a coup, which they have resisted thus far, which will mean, of course, pulling all kinds of U.S. support to the country, including the U.S. military presence to the country. But she also said she hopes that there is still the possibility for a diplomatic solution here. But she, in no way, shape or form said that there is any active diplomacy underway right now. And that is significant. Now the fact that she went to the country demonstrates that the United States is watching this and feels that the future of Niger is incredibly important, not just for the country but for the entire region of Africa. So U.S. officials continue to watch this and, as she said, hope for some kind of diplomatic solution. But there doesn't appear to be one in the offing at this moment.",

Today, the grand jury is once again convening in the federal courthouse. It's the first time that they are back meeting after the indictment against Trump was handed out last week in the 2020 election case. Our team exclusively reported yesterday that members of the special counsel's team even met yesterday with former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik. It was a five-hour meeting. It related to Kerik's knowledge of what Rudy Giuliani's efforts were to find fraud in the 2020 election. That's really crucial. Rudy Giuliani is listed in the indictment as a Coconspirator No. 1. He was left unnamed. But this clearly shows that the investigation continues and more people could get charged. A lot is happening this week. We were not expecting a hearing in the 2020 case until the end of the month, August 28th. But like I said, the judge here, Tanya Chutkan, has been criticized by Trump's team because, in previous cases involving January 6th defendants, she railed against the former president in upending the 2020 election. Trump's team has said they are going to try to get her to recuse. That probably will not have much success. But things are moving rapidly in this particular case, in large part because of the judge.
