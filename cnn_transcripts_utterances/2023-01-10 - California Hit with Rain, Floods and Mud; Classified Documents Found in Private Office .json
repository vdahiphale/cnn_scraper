      "sentences": "Attorneys for President Joe Biden say they discovered a number of classified documents and other government records from his time as vice president at a private office that he set up after leaving government in 2017. The legal team turned over the documents including what they say were fewer than a dozen marked as classified to the National Archives which in turn referred the matter to the Justice Department.Now the matter is now being reviewed by the Chicago U.S. Attorney John Lausch, originally an appointee of former President Trump and the FBI which handles these types of investigations. Now we don't know exactly what is contained in the documents. But a source tell CNN that they included some mark at the TSSCI level which stands for top secret sensitive compartmented information, a designation used to protect the U.S. government's most closely guarded intelligence secrets. Richard Sauber a special counsel to President Biden, said in a statement: The White House is cooperating with the National Archives and the Department of Justice regarding the discovery of what appeared to be Obama-Biden administration records, including a small number of documents with classified markings. The documents were discovered when the president's personal attorneys were packing files housed in a locked closet to prepare to vacate office space at the Penn Biden Center in Washington D.C. Former President Trump and Republican allies have drawn immediate comparisons to the Justice Department's handling of the classified documents recovered from Trump's Florida home. But there are important distinctions from what we know so far. Biden's lawyers say that they found fewer than a dozen documents with classified markings. Now court documents show that the FBI recovered more than 300 documents that were marked classified from Trump's home. Biden's lawyers say that they turned over the documents immediately after finding them. And the Archives and the Justice Department spent months trying to get Trump to return government documents even after Trump's lawyers said that he had turned over all documents that were marked as classified. The FBI said it obtained evidence showing that boxes of documents were being moved from a storage room where they were supposed to be kept. And that prompted the Justice Department to open an obstruction investigation and conduct the extraordinary search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort where the FBI says they found even more classified documents.

And over the last year I've spoken to a lot of former high level officials who, frankly, admitted to me that they had accidentally had a file that they found later. There is a certain amount normally, in normal times before Mar-a-Lago, a certain amount of discretion. Does the National Archives think this was a honest mistake? In the past they might not have referred it. But I'm told specifically because of what's going on with Donald Trump that the Archives knew that they had to, you know, out of an abundance of fairness, caution, but really because of Donald Trump there was no question they had to refer it.

The judge signed an order dissolving the special grand jury that had convened for over a year. Now course, what set all of this off is Trump's phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking Raffensperger to just find the votes needed for Trump to win the state of Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. That sent District Attorney Fani Willis down the path of investigating Trump and his allies.But in the time since this special grand jury has been working, has been calling witnesses, subpoenaing witnesses, trying to get more information, this investigation has expanded. It includes threats to election officials. It includes the fake electors scheme. It includes false statements that were made before Georgia state lawmakers. So now that the special grand jury has finished their work, they have written all of this in a report. They don't issue indictments. But the report goes to prosecutors and it's expected to include recommendations about who if anyone should face charges and what crimes. And then it is up to district attorney Fani Willis to decide if she's going to go to a regular grand jury and seek indictments. One key question is when the public is going to see this special grand jury's report. There is a hearing set on that matter on January 24. Notably in this order dissolving the grand jury the judge points out that the special grand jury wants the report to be made public. Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
