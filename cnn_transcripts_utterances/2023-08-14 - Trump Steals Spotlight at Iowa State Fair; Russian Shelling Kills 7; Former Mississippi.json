And staying true to form, he skipped the traditional meet and greet fair events that Republican candidates always take part in. Instead, he clearly wanted to send at least one message to at least one of his competitors by showing up with a slew of Florida Republicans supporting him, not supporting the Florida governor.CNN's Jeff Zeleny following this for us. He's joining us now. Jeff, Donald Trump flipping the script on the traditional Iowa State Fair visit once again.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kate.Being in Iowa over the weekend, as I was watching all of this unfold, it was clear that the main mission for former President Donald Trump was trolling Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, coming with all of those Florida members of Congress. I'm not sure many Iowa voters, at least the ones I was standing around, had any idea who these Florida members of Congress were, but certainly they were eager to see the former president. But really what we saw unfolding was the split screen that we are going to see likely for the next several months or longer. The fact that the legal challenges that were following the former president there are now central to what he is talking about. He's trying to use them to rally support. But voters are not necessarily as focused on these indictments. And voters also that I talked to have an open mind about this race ahead of them. Take a listen to some of our conversations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZELENY: Is there anything that could happen between now and January that might change your mind? I mean are you open to seeing how the events unfold?",

He said, you know, all these charges going on. He wasn't sure that he'll actually be able to run. So, the reality here is that's what other candidates are trying to seize upon and essentially be waiting in the wings or on the debate stage to be there if something falters with the Trump campaign. So, there's no question, he is the front runner at this point. But, Kate, I was talking to the Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, the Republican, who's at the center of all of this, she said, surprises often happens. Most voters are not where the polls are necessarily. She thinks its far too early. So, we have to wait and see how this campaign plays out. Five months from tomorrow, the Iowa caucuses. Kate.",

He has a passionate following in the Republican Party, including a share that, you know, views really any challenge to him as fundamentally illegitimate. Not only, you know, believing that Joe Biden was illegitimately elected, but, you know, even someone challenging him for the Republican nomination is illegitimate. And we saw the kind of heckling and harassment that DeSantis faced. But, you know, the words that Jeff used, and Kate used before, blew in, blew out, quick, I mean, that is the challenge for Trump in Iowa. You know, whether that historic Iowa model that you have to burrow in on the ground, do the full Grassley, they call it, visiting all 99 counties, whether that still applies, because certainly Ron DeSantis, probably Tim Scott, maybe Nikki Haley, they're all going to do a lot more of that than Donald Trump. And we'll see whether his more nationally focused campaign ultimately can hold them off in Iowa, which does have a tradition in its recent elections of going against the frontrunner but then picking a candidate who ultimately can't win the nomination.",

Bush and Bob Dole won to find an Iowa winner who actually won the nomination. And a big part of that is because you can win Iowa in a way that sets you on a path that makes it hard to win the nomination. It is possible to win Iowa by consolidating and dominating among one group, evangelical Christians, home schoolers, culturally conservative Christian voters are the dominant block in an Iowa Republican caucus. But if that's all that you can pull together, it becomes very hard to win the nomination. And, again, Iowa also, you know, historically at least, has rewarded that kind of shoe leather, sweat equity, you know, putting in the time in every state -- in every county. We'll see. I mean Trump might have won Iowa even in 2016 if he had not, in a fit of pique, skipped the Iowa Fox debate at the very end there, which is, you know, why I personally think that even though he may skip some of the early national debates, he's likely this time to participate in the debates in the early stage themselves because judge -- you know, skipping those can be seen as a slight not only on the sponsors but on the voters. This will be a test as -- not only of the Republican Party and kind of its ideological leanings and how damaged they think Trump is, but whether that historic model of how you win this caucus state still applies. As someone said to me over the weekend, you know, this is not Jimmy Carter's Iowa anymore, referring back all the way to 1976, but they -- obviously the other candidates still believe that model applies, at least somewhat.",

They're clearly investigating to find out what led to this.The moment of the blast, it was caught on a doorbell camera of a neighboring house. It's remarkable. Authorities are working to determine what led to this. In Los Angeles, it was a wild, coordinated act of looting at a Nordstrom's store. Police say the flash mob of about 30 people were all dressed in black when they ran into a mall on Saturday, overwhelming the staff there. They grabbed an estimated $100,000 worth of merchandise. All of it caught on camera, as you can see, and the chaos that ensued. A similar crime happened earlier in the week in near Glendale. There's also more incredible video that we want to show you. The moment two people, you can see, were ejected from a vintage fighter jet. It happened during the thunder over a Michigan air show on Sunday. The jet later crashed into a parking lot of a nearby apartment complex. Officials say the two people who ejected, they did not suffer any serious injuries. They actually landed in a lake.
