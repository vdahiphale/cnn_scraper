How the Biden administration is planning to respond. And China simulating strikes against Taiwan after the nation's president visited the U.S., we're live in Beijing as tensions escalate. All right, welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans, this is EARLY START. This morning, Justice Department officials are racing to find out how top secret U.S. military documents were leaked online. The information is intended only for those with the highest levels of U.S. security clearance. Documents cover a wide range of topics from assessments of Ukraine's military strength and casualty figures, to intelligence on American allies like Israel and South Korea. The documents were reportedly first posted on obscure internet gaming sites. But have now turned up on Twitter and YouTube in recent weeks. Democratic congressman Ruben Gallego, raising concerns that this leak could jeopardize sources and relationships the U.S. has with its allies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ):  We actually have to figure out the extent of how much is actual verifiable information that we've collected and how much is it? Something has been repurposed by our foreign enemies, specifically Russia, for their end goal. And let's be clear. The reason this is coming out right now is because its goal is to, you know, weaken our resolve, weaken our alliance, and help their end goal, which is to take all of Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you so much for joining us bright and early this morning. So the DOJ and others are obviously investigating. This is damaging. Some of these documents show the extent the U.S. spies on its allies, and there's human intelligence here, sources and methods. How much damage in your view has been done here? JAMIL JAFFER, FOUNDER &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTE, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL:  Well, you know, Christine, it's hard to know the exact amount of damage, but what we can tell certainly is their adversaries are learning a lot about what we know about them and what they're doing about what we think of the war in Ukraine, about our supplies of weapons to the war in Ukraine, to the Ukrainian military, and to know what we -- or we're assessing in terms of other nations' relationships. So they're learning a lot about our capabilities, and about what we know in our analysis of that information.",

But Ukrainian officials are said to have become frustrated by the revelations revealed in these leaked documents, particularly when it comes to the U.S. government's assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine and as well as the Ukrainian armed forces progress and its counteroffensive against Russia.One document from late February describing the battle for the eastern Donbas region as likely heading towards a stalemate throughout 2023. So it's not the kind of assessment that Ukraine or its allies would like to see in the public domain. And of course, we have learned from these Ukrainian sources that Ukraine is already altering some of its military plans and activities on the ground in response to these leaked documents. However, it has to be said that one senior adviser to the presidential office in Ukraine has described these -- he says he believes that they are inauthentic, and that's -- they do have no relation to the situation on the ground or Ukraine's plans. And of course, when it comes to Moscow, we are learning more details around the United States, its penetration of the Russian Ministry of Defense, as well as the notorious private mercenary group, the Wagner Organization. We are learning that United States has been able to with quite a degree of accuracy, pinpoint Russian targeting locations. Of course, that is a huge amount of information there to hold. And of course, the Russian armed forces may now be looking to change and alter their communications in order to better conceal their plans from the likes of the U.S.",

In terms of scale and intensity of China's latest war games around Taiwan, now reaching the level of what we saw last year after the then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. Remember after that trip, the Chinese launched their biggest military drills in decades, firing missiles directly across Taiwan, we have not seen that yet this time. But with the Chinese continuing to normalize these war games, refining them and improving their tactical complexity, according to military experts we talked to. They were really injecting a new element of instability or even potential danger, especially with the Chinese assets continuing to cross the so-called media line in the Taiwan Strait, that's something both sides had observed for decades until recently. That's where potential misjudgment, miscalculation could come in and leading to conflict between the U.S. and China. remember, it's not just the Taiwanese, but also Americans and allies -- and their allies, sending warships and warplanes to the region to assert their navigational and over-flight rights and freedoms.

This was a public event in northern India, that's where the Dalai Lama, the 14th Dalai Lama has been in permanent exile since 1959.So there's this boy who went up to him and asked him for a hug, the Dalai Lama called him on stage and said, along with that hug, give me a kiss on the cheek. So he obliged, that young boy. Straight after that, the Dalai Lama then asked for a kiss on the mouth, he pulled the boy's chin in and gave him a kiss on the mouth. Now, moments later, then the Dalai Lama said, and I'm going to quote him here, \"and suck my tongue\". Now, this clip has gone viral across social media, sections of people on social media have called this outrageous. they've condemned the actions and the exchange between the Dalai Lama and this young boy. What's interesting is, it's taken weeks since the incident for the Dalai Lama's office to come out with the statement with the Dalai Lama, has regretted the incident and apologizing. I'm very quickly going to take our viewers through what Dalai Lama said through that statement. The statement reads, \"a video clip has been circulating that shows a recent meeting when a young boy asked his holiness, the Dalai Lama if he could give him a hug. His holiness wishes to apologize to the boy and his family as well as his many friends across the world for the hurt his words may have caused.\" What's interesting here is, Christine, they're not talking about his actions, but the words, then goes on to say, \"his holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras, he regrets the incident\", unquote.
