There have been waves upon waves of strikes -- Russian missiles hitting at critical infrastructure targets around the Kyiv region to the -- to the south, to the east, and the west as well.And so, we're seeing dozens of missiles striking these critical infrastructure targets -- power stations, power lines, distribution points, and things like that -- that are really making it difficult for the authorities to provide sufficient power to the population of the country. And Zelensky was saying -- the president of this country was saying in that -- in that sound bite we just heard that 10 million people now without power at various times of the day across the country. And, of course, there are emergency teams working day and night to try and get the power reconnected. But the Ukrainian authorities are concerned not just about the shortage of manpower and being overwhelmed by the extent of the Russia -- Russian strikes, but also they're saying they are running out of spare parts to fix the power lines and the power infrastructure installations that are being struck repeatedly by these Russian forces. Why are they doing it? Well, of course, you mentioned it. There's that strategic ambition, it seems, on the part of Moscow to try and make the situation as uncomfortable, as unpleasant, and as unbearable as possible for the civilians of this country as winter hits. We're seeing the first snow now in the Ukrainian capital of this winter. Temperatures are set to plunge even further. The Russians have even acknowledged that, saying that this lack of power is a consequence of Kyiv not coming to the negotiating table -- Christine.",

That is major news for world football's governing body, FIFA. Budweiser, one of the headline official alcohol sponsors -- it leaves their contracts -- their multimillion-dollar deal with some serious question marks hanging over it. We got some sense that something was going on a couple of days ago when the kiosks where Budweiser was selling their beers have been asked to be moved to less visible positions on the concourses. Then these reports started emerging and we now know that on a request of the Qatari officials, they have asked that this step be taken. So, no beer sales. You will be able to get alcohol in hospitality areas and the fan zones.
