But they are asking the Qatari prime minister to push Hamas to make sure that this could be something that is acceptable to them. We've heard from senior leaders within Hamas that they don't believe Israel is addressing the concerns of the Palestinian people, still pushing for people to be able to go back to their homes in northern Gaza and pushing for a withdrawal to certain areas of the Israeli military.

The Arizona Supreme Court is reviving a 160 year old abortion ban with no exception for the woman's health, rape or incest.And let me put this in the right perspective for everybody. This ban originated back before Arizona was even a state. Back when Abraham Lincoln was still president. Back when the American Civil War was putting brother-against-brother. That's how ancient and backward the Arizona abortion ban is. But it doesn't end there. When overturning Roe, Justice Alito cited a 17th century judge, Matthew Hale, who executed two women for alleged witchcraft. He also cited a 13th century jurist who denigrated women as inferior. Our current speaker Mike Johnson says that we should adhere to 18th century values. Trump thinks that he can gaslight us when he is the reason to answer a question. Why is this happening? He is the reason why the Supreme Court annihilated our rights. He is the reason why Brett Kavanaugh, an alleged sexual predator who triggered 4,500 tips to the FBI, has jurisdiction over our bodies. Why Amy Coney Barrett, a former member of the religious cult People of Praise, has a say over our bodies. He bears responsibility for their endless suffering that American women endure today. And Trump, who was found sexual liable for sexual abuse himself and was accused more than 25 times of sexual assault, appointed a third of the Supreme Court.

Republicans don't realize, but the calculus has completely changed. It changed that day in 2020 when their right-wing justices decided to eviscerate our most intimate and fundamental rights. The calculus of the past no longer holds. And Vice President Harris was quick to condemn Trump for bragging about destroying Roe. She was also the first president or vice president to visit an abortion clinic. And her visit to a Planned Parenthood clinic was a monumental move because it signals to American women that our voices are being heard. Our voices matter. Our bodies matter. Our lives matter. And Arizona Republicans think we're nothing but chattel and broodmares. Florida Republicans are trying to police our bodies.

Since then, CNN has been investigating the incident. And a warning, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing.The Israeli military claims its tanks fired warning shots into the air to disperse a crowd after seeing people were being trampled. Gaza's health ministry says more than 100 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more injured. However, a CNN analysis of videos, interviews and eyewitness testimonies cast doubt on Israel's version of events. CNN's Katie Polglase has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): It's early morning on February 29th on Al Rashid Road in northern Gaza. Thousands of starving people have gathered here to receive food. But as the aid trucks arrive, this happens. The night would become known as the flour massacre. By morning, over 100 would be dead in one of the single biggest mass casualty events of this conflict. CNN investigated this incident, obtaining never seen before videos of that night, collecting evidence from 22 eyewitnesses and tracing the aid itself all the way to a Muslim charity in the U.K. It was the IDF that was then responsible for safely delivering these vital supplies. But we found they opened fire on unarmed starving Palestinians at close range as the aid arrived. Their explanation for the tragedy using this drone video was a stampede that caused soldiers to fire warning shots in the air. They later admitted to firing some shots directly at so-called suspects who approached them. But the IDF footage is incomplete. It cuts between crowds surrounding the trucks and bodies lying on the ground. Even this reveals they were firing in a densely packed area, likely to cause severe bloodshed. CNN requested the full footage from the IDF, but it was denied. Jihad Abu Watfa was amongst the starving Palestinians and started filming as the trucks crossed into northern Gaza. JIHAD ABU WATFA, EYEWITNESS (translated): We decided to face the danger, to risk our lives to obtain any piece of bread for our families. POLGLASE (voice-over): Videos from Jihad and another key eyewitness, Belal, indicate the gunfire started earlier than the IDF claimed. The IDF published this timeline saying the trucks arrived at the checkpoint at 4am. They then crossed at 4:29 and only after that did the IDF fire shots at the crowd. But in Belal's video filmed seven minutes earlier at 4:22am, gunshots ring out. He warns there is a tank. The IDF claim the convoy was still stationary at the checkpoint at this time. Next, Jihad begins filming. It's now 4:28am and there's a barrage of gunfire and the shots are close. Analysis by weapons experts of the bursts indicate it is heavy automatic gunfire at 600 rounds per minute. Jihad keeps filming. A tank is beside me. We're now under siege, he says. Moments later, you see a truck driving along the road. We spotted traces from the gunfire here. One can be seen ricocheting up here, according to weapons experts. WATFA (translated): The feeling was totally indescribable, fear, confusion. You fear, God forbid, going back to your family as a martyr. POLGLASE (voice-over): As day broke, the number of dead and injured that emerged was staggering. Interviews with survivors at hospitals afterwards found some people had been shot in the upper body. UNKNOWN (translated): Where were you injured? UNKNOWN (translated): In my chest, and it went out through my back.
