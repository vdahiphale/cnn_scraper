Well, American and British forces have carried out large scale multiple strikes on Houthi targets across Yemen on Monday. A nighttime operation which could signal the beginning of an open ended military operation by the US. The leader of Iran backed militants warns that military action by the West will only strengthen their results to continue to target commercial shipping in the region.

Eisenhower an aircraft carrier that's been in the region, but also surface vessels and a submarine to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles. U.K. meanwhile, says they use Typhoon fighter jets as part of the strike. The U.S. carried out strikes on eight separate sites using some 25 to 30 precision guided munitions, according to a senior military official who briefed reporters following the strike. The strikes were, quote, successful and achieve their desired effect, according to that official as well as a senior defense official who was part of that briefing. Now they pointed out that the U.S. was specifically going after the sorts of weapons and capabilities that the Houthis an Iranian back proxy in Yemen have used to attack international shipping, meaning they're not trying to expand the target set over the types of weapons they've tried to destroy over the course of the past two weeks. Now, of course, surely they say they were successful in targeting these weapons that includes drones and missiles as well as an underground storage site for these capabilities for the first time. But it has degraded the Houthis abilities the U.S. believes to go after and threatened commercial shipping. The threat remains on the table at this point. If the Houthi attacks continue against international shipping, so will the U.S. operations here and we've again now seeing the U.K. join in this as well. They issue that same warning that unless the attacks on international shipping lanes stop then the U.S. and U.K. lead strikes on who feet assets won't stop. The question, where does this go from here? The officials who briefed reporters wouldn't sort of predict in which direction this goes only to say that the U.S. will continue to operate as it sees the need to.

What they need right now is EW capability, electronic warfare capability to attack the GPS systems, for instance, and the communication systems of Russian drones. They're getting that.

The U.N. says only a quarter of aid agencies based in Gaza were granted access by Israeli authorities so far this month. And the U.N.

But right now, let me just tell you where we're standing. We're standing about 500 meters away from the temple that was consecrated yesterday. Massive crowds can be seen here. Thousands of pilgrims, devotees, locals, as well as visitors have thronged to the gates of the temple. We believe that since three this morning, have been lining up to go inside and there's a huge crowd inside because of which the entry to the others has been stopped right now. Even the media cannot go in at this point. But yes, this has been controversial. Yesterday, you saw Narendra Modi, inside the inner sanctorum of the temple along with priests presiding over the Hindu ceremony. Now, this is a moment of celebration for Hindus across India and overseas. Remember, 80 percent of India's population are Hindus and about 14 percent of the population Muslims. For them, it's been a bit too painful as well because it brings back memories of 1992 like you said. That was when the communal rights took place and the mosque was demolished and ever since, there's been a legal battle in 2019. Remember the supreme court said that the Hindus can go ahead and build a temple at that spot. They've also given the Muslims property for building a mosque, which is yet to come up. But for now this actually encapsulates what this means for Modi in an election year, he's seeking a historic third.
