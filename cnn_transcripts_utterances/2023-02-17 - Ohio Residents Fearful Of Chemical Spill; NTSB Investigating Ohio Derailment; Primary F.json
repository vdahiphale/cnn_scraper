Ohio's governor saying that both the city water, the -- in addition to that the village water, again, safe to drink.He says he's going to be bringing in the best experts going forward to make sure that the air and water is safe and he is also saying that what they're going to be doing is setting up some sort of a clinic in the middle of town so if people are feeling like they're having symptoms, they can walk in and get evaluated. He said he's doing that out of an abundance of caution. But what you're having here on the ground here, you've got this divide, right, because you have state and local officials saying the air is save, the water is safe, but then on the other hand you've got people who live here in East Palestine, some of them are saying that they feel symptomatic, that they've got sore throats. Some of them saying that they've got rashes and whatnot. And so you've got this divide. You've got a lot of distrust here between what officials are saying and what's happening (INAUDIBLE) community. Yesterday (INAUDIBLE) I had a quick opportunity to speak to the head of the EPA about all this to get some of his insight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Mary, we always appreciate having you on because you can put this in layman's terms for us. So I think, first, let's just tackle things in order here if we can. There's been a lot of talk about the braking system and that there was a braking rule that was put into place under President Obama's administration and then it went away under the Trump administration. As I understand it, that rule would not have made a difference here. Why?",

      "sentences": "So what happened -- when we see that video with the fire under the train, the train tracks, for most major rail lines, are smart tracks. And on the track are defect detectors and they have infrared sensors and they detect if a wheel or axel is overheating, that's called a hot (INAUDIBLE). It sends an automated message, voice message, to the train engineer. And you have to stop if you have a hot box. So, if they - if those sensors were working, as they should have been, and the engineer got that warning, then the engineer should have been able to stop.Now, this braking system, this electronic controlled pneumatic braking system, short nickname ECP, would have been required for all trains carrying, you know, high hazmat, highly flammable materials. However, it was limited to trains over 70 cars, going over 30 miles an hour, and carrying oil. So here, most likely, it would not have been required. But yes, it could have helped the train to stop and it probably would have stopped it much sooner.",

That's going to be one of the things that the NTSB wants to know right up front because those sensors are, you know, really lifesaving because they would have sensed the hot wheels. They would have sensed what's called a hot box and told the train engineer. Did that system work and did the engineer get that warning? That remains to be seen.And then, if that -- those two things occurred, did the engineer have time to stop the train and would the system (INAUDIBLE) on this train have helped it stop. So, there are a lot of - of, if this then that. But the NTSB will figure this out and the sensors are -- that's not new technology, that's been around for some time. And that's one of the reasons we don't have cabooses anymore because the smart tracks took the role of the caboose.",
