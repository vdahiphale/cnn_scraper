This happened at the Covenant School, a parochial school in Nashville. We're learning also that there are multiple patients and the scene is still an active one.CNN's Amara Walker is getting updates on this breaking news story. Amara, what do we know this hour?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby, that's the key here, right? This is still a developing story. It's an active scene. There was a tweet from the Nashville Fire Department that said that they have multiple patients. We don't know what that means. We don't know the number of patients. We don't know the age range of these patients.Although judging from the type of school, this being a preschool through 6th grade, you know, I guess the patients could be as young as three to four years old, as old as 11 to 12 years old. We don't know the extent of the injuries of these, quote unquote, patients. We don't know if staff or any of the teachers may be patients at this point. But look, this is obviously a huge nightmare and a terrifying scene for parents, including you and me, Abby. You and I are both parents. This is something that goes through our minds, you know, every day. The safety of our children when they're dropped off at school. And now we're talking about another school shooting, this one in Nashville, Tennessee. This is a private Christian school called the Covenant School. You asked me last -- a few minutes ago the timing of the shooting. It looks like this happened later in the morning. Judging from the tweets from Nashville Fire Department, they tweeted this about an hour ago. And keep in mind, Nashville is on Central Time, so it happened at least around 10:00 or so. But again, what we know is that there was an active shooter event. That is how the Nashville Fire Department, excuse me, the Nashville Police Department is characterizing this. Police saying that the shooter is dead after the shooter engaged with police. We have no more information on the shooter, if this was a student or had any ties to the school. But again, you are looking at live pictures there on the scene in Nashville, Tennessee. And we're talking about an elementary school where little children, preschool aged children attend this school. Three, maybe four years old, Abby. But this is what we know. Multiple patients being treated, according to Nashville Fire. And look, once we get more information, we'll get it to you. But right now, as you see, it is an active scene, Abby.",

Amara Walker, thank you for that.Let's bring in now CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Chief Charles Ramsey, who's on the phone for us. Chief Ramsey, in this moment, they are describing this as an active scene, although the shooter is known to be, confirmed to be dead. What does that mean about what is happening at that school right now?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And let's bring in now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who is with us. Andrew, this is, as we've been saying, quite a nightmare, but something that has become very familiar. Schools as targets. Elementary schools with the most defenseless of potential victims, children as young as three years old. What goes through your mind to hear that we are dealing with yet another active shooter situation at an elementary school in this country? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYSTThis can happen really anywhere around the country. We've seen it all over the place in all kinds of different circumstances and schools and places of worship and hospitals, anything you can imagine. And this is just another chapter in that unfolding drama of gun violence in America. I think right now my heart goes out to the folks who are responding to that scene. I understand how devastating that can be. But they are laser focused on trying to take care of the folks who have been -- certainly the folks who have been wounded, might be hurt, need medical attention, all those children that are going to need care and support, first and foremost, from their families, but from professionals as well today and in the days that follow. And it is still very much an active crime scene. So they're trying to understand the full scope of the victims they have, ensure there are no more threats on the premises. Sounds like that's been resolved. But as the chief said, you have to do a really thorough search to be absolutely sure that there's nothing there that could cause anyone any harm. So it's a lot that they're dealing with right now.",

We also have Chief Charles Ramsey and former FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe, all standing by. Let's start with you, Amara.

It's a very small school, only about 200 students, young kids, elementary school aged.And when we've talked over the years about how schools and communities protect themselves against this unfortunate occurrence happening to them, how does that impact a school like this elementary school, Covenant School, that is not a public school? What protocols -- do they -- are they subject to the same kinds of protocols as say, a public school might be?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, every school is different, but certainly, I mean, it's just an unfortunate reality now where you have to have some level of security in place at all these schools, including apparently pre-K. I mean, this is just unbelievable what we're talking about here, and we're talking about it on a regular basis.I mean, you know, I do some work with the United States Conference of Mayors, and there's a lot of discussion around what to do with active shooters, whether it's a school or wherever it might be. There's actually a playbook, for lack of a better word, that is used by mayors, by police chiefs and others on what to do when you're confronted with something like this. I mean, think about that. That is absolutely insane that we have to even have this discussion and that people have to be prepared at the level, that they have to be prepared to deal with it, because it just continues to happen, and it will happen again. The only question is when and where. It's particularly tragic, obviously, if you're talking about very young children, I mean, pre-K up to 6th grade. But even a small school, 200 students would need to have, you know, some kind of security. I mean, but even then, you know, is that enough to really stop what's going on right now. It's just not an easy fix to -- for what we're seeing happen in our country, and it just doesn't seem to be the kind of action that needs to take place in order to at least take steps to try to minimize the opportunity for people to do this sort of thing.",

      "sentences": "Yes. In recent years, this school has had between 195 and about 210 students. And what you're talking about there, the fact that this has become, it seems, more frequent in recent years, Andy McCabe, I wonder about the contagion effect here, if there is any in your mind. When we see a Sandy Hook happen, we see a Uvalde happen, and you have a shooter, whoever this person is picking a target, is there -- are we seeing a contagion effect where the targets that they are choosing are schools with the youngest kids?",

The shooter in this situation is now dead after a confrontation with police, but they are describing this as an active scene.And as you can see, a lot of activity on the ground there as parents are in this moment seeking to be reunified with their kids. There is an active investigation underway. And we are also learning just moments ago, the Nashville police have just tweeted that they will be providing an update in this case in about 15 to 20 minutes from now. We will bring that to you when it happens and as we learn more information about this. I want to go back, though, to Charles Ramsey on what Andy McCabe was just talking about. It's impossible to not put this situation in the context of all the other cases that we've had of violence inside of schools. And I wonder, as you look at what has happened since the Uvalde tragedy, that massacre involving so many students, and the conversations that came after that, do you see anything that schools need to be doing in this moment? Maybe not to make themselves hard targets, but to protect their students when there's perhaps nothing else that they can do?",
