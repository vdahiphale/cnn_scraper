So, this should be interesting, particularly given, as you said, Donald Trump himself has been doing the same.Now, this comes as a time where the campaign says that it is trying to go outside of the box. Their excuse for not holding as many campaign rallies has been that they believe there is a small group of voters who they want to reach, and they believe that this election is going to be decided by a small group of voters, who don't get their news in the traditional sense, who are not going to be necessarily engaged in politics, and they might be engaged with Elon Musk. That might be a demographic that he could reach. So, that's why you've seen Donald Trump, instead of stumping in all of these swing states, or at least this is what the campaign says. That's why you've seen him doing streaming interviews with Adin Ross, sitting for podcasts, doing stuff with MMA, and now doing this with Elon Musk. They believe that this is an opportunity for him to reach a different demographic. And obviously, as we've talked about, this is a very high risk, but possibly high reward type of campaigning, but that's what they are looking at.

We've obviously reached out the campaign to see if they're in touch with law enforcement. They have been very vague about that.

So, in Nevada, on Saturday, before culinary union workers, vital group that endorsed her, she did announce eliminating taxes on tips for hospitality workers. That, of course, got a lot of attention because the former president also endorsed that policy and has been talking about it for weeks. But other things we can suspect to hear from her, based on what she is been saying on the campaign trail, is tackling high prices, take on price gouging, and banning hidden fees and surprise late charges, as well as pledging to take on corporate landlords, and capping unfair rent increases. When you speak to voters in Nevada, you know, they would often say, you know, having one job should be enough. They lamented that in that part of the country, it used to be affordable. Used to be able to afford things, but now, the prices are comparable to, you know, major cities and living on the coast. So, those are all things that she has to speak to.",

They know how to needle Donald Trump, and it's on crowd sizes. And this is clearly something that bothers him. It's clearly something Democrats know bothers him, and they have sought to continue to throw it in his face. Look, the reality is, Donald Trump has gotten crowds for the past nine years that any politician would dream of. That is very true. His frustration has long appeared to be that he doesn't a, get credit for them, and when anybody else gets big crowds, as the vice president is unequivocally getting, at this point in time, to a point Democrats say we've haven't seen this since 2008 with the Barack Obama. It is frustrating to him. If you needed any evidence, you could just watch the press conference Mar-a-Lago that Kristen attended, where he spent a good portion of that hour-long journey that we all went on with him, talking about crowd sizes, talking about Martin Luther King and how his January 6th crowd, compared to it. I think the question right now that you hear from Republicans constantly is, what is this going to help us? One Republican texted me yesterday evening saying, this is how we lose. Kevin McCarthy, former Speaker of the House has been allied with Donald Trump for a long time said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): You've got to make this race not on personalities. Stop questioning the size of her crowds, and start questioning her position when it comes to what did she do as attorney general on crime. Question, what did she do when she's supposed to take care of the border as a czar. Question that they brought inflation.

Let's talk about the polls, and we'll talk about them in those great lake battleground states, right? Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Look at this, enthusiastic about voting for Harris. Look at this, 86 percent of her voters say yes. They are enthusiastic about voting for her. That is way up from where Joe Biden wasn't an average in these states last year, when it was just 72 percent. And take a look at Trump. This, I think, is the key nugget, because now what we see is we see that only 80 percent of Trump voters say they are enthusiastic about voting for him in these three states. So, Harris is leading on that metric. You go back to last year, it was, in fact, Trump that was leading on the enthusiasm metric. So, yes, we're talking about crowd sizes, and those don't necessarily mean anything, but in this particular case, what we're seeing is it's backed up by the polling data, which shows that democratic enthusiasm is way up, while Trump level enthusiasm is just kind of steady. It's pretty good, but it's steady, and Harris is passing him by on the train tracks. And is there any indication that Trump's kind of obsession over crowd size could actually hurt him?",
