Then, who should represent the Palestinians? I ask Nasser Al-Kidwa, a former foreign minister for the Palestinian Authority. Plus, the United States of Autocracy, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, talks to Walter Isaacson about the dangers of Trump 2.0. And finally, a collaboration for the ages. Hollywood's most celebrated composer, John Williams, and virtuoso violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, tell me why they're joining musical forces. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. There is nowhere to turn in Gaza, Palestinians say, as Israeli's stranglehold on the besieged land gets tighter, and airstrikes continue to pound the enclave. But despite international pressure, Israel remains intent on eradicating Hamas, whatever it takes. Israel's national security adviser says that could be measured in weeks, even months. But the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority says it's not even possible to wipe out the group, calling Hamas, \"an integral part of the Palestinian political mosaic.\" Tonight, we attempt to look beyond the war from the perspective of future Israeli and Palestinian leadership. For that, let's remember some crucial prescience from the past. During the Oslo negotiations in the '90s, the chief Palestinian delegate told the chief Israeli delegate the following, I believe we've arrived at the root of the problem. We have learned that our rejection of you will not bring us freedom. You can see that your control of us will not bring you security. We must live side by side in peace, equality and co-operation. So, let's start with Israel's Labor Party, once the dominant political force, all the way back to the founder, David Ben-Gurion. But the peace camp has lost so much credibility over the years that it's barely clinging on in Parliament. And now, leader Merav Michaeli says that she's stepping down. She joins me now from Tel Aviv. Welcome to the program. Can I start by asking you --",

We don't just look away from the sites in Gaza, but this is Hamas' doing. Instead of taking all the resources that were invested there over the years, it invested it in terror, unfortunately. What will -- what we will have to recognize after this war is that the only way to live here in security for both peoples is a political solution for the two-state solution. This is what I've been fighting for, following what Yitzhak Rabin has started in 1993. This is what needs to take place. But it has to be with mutual recognition.

But I wonder whether you have any thoughts about the latest investigative report and revelations by \"The New York Times,\" Ronen Bergman, who has dug deeper into stories that your own press has been talking about, you know, for a long time. He's speaking with Israeli officials on how Netanyahu \"propped up\" Hamas with Qatari funds to try to separate the Gaza Strip from the West Bank and essentially to avoid having to discuss or contemplate or negotiate a Palestinian State. Even apparently, when he found out the money was going to the military wing. So, a former ally and now a fierce opponent who was a minister, Avigdor Lieberman, member of Knesset, has told Bergman, \"For Netanyahu, there is only one thing that is really important, to be in power at any cost. To stay in power, he preferred to pay for tranquility.\" What is your response to this big story in your country now?",

So, certainly, I think this war goes to show that what Netanyahu has tried to do has failed completely and utterly. And we need to recognize it, Israelis need to recognize it. But again, Christiane, you can't let the Palestinians off the hook. The fact that Israel, under Netanyahu, was going the wrong way does not mean that Palestinians do not have to be accountable to what they're doing and their choices. They too have to demand from their leadership to stop educating for hate and incitement and to stop robbing them from their rights in order to inflict terror on Israel and the Jews.",

And not just no plan, a plan that seems to be moving towards, at least from Netanyahu's mouth, you know, who knows how long occupation of Gaza, despite what his American allies and others say.

But it should be that way because the thought should be about everyone's security in the region. More weapon never brings more security, rather the opposite. So, yes, as difficult as it is in these very, very hard times. And in Israel, the trauma is so, so, so present. It is very hard to explain and to convey to people from the outside how present the trauma is. Still, leadership must come up with a plan that sees a horizon and a horizon for coexistence that sees everyone's bigger good, larger good. It is possible. I know it is possible. I know there are partners. We just need to be determined to get rid of the blame game, that so long ongoing blame game, and to start thinking of what is the bigger picture that we can really not only thrive to but really get there.",

As you heard, and I quoted Prime Minister Shtayyeh said over the weekend that Hamas is part of the political mosaic. Do you believe that that's the case? AL-KIDWA:  Well, first of all, I am not representing the official Palestinian position as you referred correctly. Now, with regard to the situation that I wrote publicly in the early days of the war, that there will be three changes. One, we are going to have a new Israeli government. Two, we are going to have a new Palestinian leadership. Three, where we are going to have a new Hamas. This is, I think, the best way to put it. So, in one hand, we are trying to accommodate the fact that there is an ideology, there is an idea, but at the same time, we know that there is a new situation, a new results of the current war and the positions taken by many important parties, including the United States and the West in general.",

Who maintained or encouraged the split between Gaza and the West Bank and encouraged the presence of an authority under the control of Hamas in Gaza and an authority under the control of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as a way to avoid any serious political solutions?

So, how is it that the PLO/PA has become so discredited and that Hamas has gained so much strength? And tell me what it's like on the West Bank. We kind of know what happened in Gaza, but what is it like on the occupied West Bank? Is Hamas a big political force there too and a military force? AL-KIDWA:  It is a force in the West Bank, thanks to the ineptness of the group that is governing now, the Palestinian Authority. Thanks again to Mr. Netanyahu and to probably the support from some -- of some western powers. There is absolute failure on the part of the group and control of the Palestinian Authority. The last time they went to election was 17, 18 years ago. They destroyed the institutions completely. They violated the principle of the rule of law. They violated all kinds of basic rights of the Palestinian people, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is the situation that has to end. And it has to end because the Palestinian people, the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian people want it to end. Not because Mr. Netanyahu wants that, and not because Mr. Biden wants that, it's because the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian people want that, and it is going to happen.

What is the mechanism, even within your own -- you know, within the Palestinians to even have an accounting, a political accounting, elections, I mean, something? Is there any mechanism or does it have to await the end of this war? AL-KIDWA:  Absolutely. You are absolutely right. The final -- the right solution is the general election. There is no doubt about that. But frankly, you and me know that this is almost impossible now in the circumstances when we have more than a million and a half Palestinian, displaced Palestinians, we can't ask them to come and vote. So, we need to create some kind of resemblance of normal life for these people and then go for election. Until then, we need a transition. And the transition, I think, the peaceful one, might be one that means, a -- the existence of fully mandated Palestinian government with Mr. Abbas and his group's side stepping aside and not having any impact or any influence over the affairs of this government, whether with regard to the Gaza Strip or with regard to the West Bank, because it's very important to affirm the unity of the Palestinian land as well as the unity of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian administration as well.",

It's -- you know, it's actually more than 20 different writers taking on their subject area expertise. So, we have pieces on immigration and national security, the staffing of the military, the civil service, Supreme Court issues.

I don't make the assumption that people in media, in politics here in Washington, where I am, you know, we sometimes assume that everybody is following events the way that we do.

And after my article came out about Mark Milley and about his relationship with Donald Trump, Trump said that -- he said this plainly on social media, he said that Mark Milley should be tried for treason for the things that he said and done. So, like, I believe in taking people at their word. Donald Trump will come into -- if he comes into office, he will authorize his Justice Department to investigate Mark Milley. Remember, Donald Trump is a person who threatened -- in his first term, he threatened to call back to active-duty Generals Stanley McChrystal and William McRaven, two retired four-star generals, you know, incredible American patriots and soldiers. He threatened to call them back to active-duty, which you can do as president in order to court martial them. Why? Because they were critical of his leadership. There's nothing secret here. There's no -- I don't think there's anything overblown. He will blow open the norm that has existed for a very long time that -- especially since the Watergate era, that the attorney general operates autonomously from the political operation of the White House, right? That attorney general always annoyed presidents, right? Because they are in the cabinet, but they're running their own show. And the reason they're running their own show is because they have to have prosecutorial independence, right? Donald Trump's going to get rid of that. He's promised to get rid of that.

And I became a deep John Williams fan, and I was also following his classical scores, of course. But, you know, from the Black Forest to Hollywood, it's not just around the corner. So, I knew that Andre and John were very good friends. And so, I was the one who always asked Andre, couldn't you ask John to write something for me?
