At the UN Security Council, the US vetoes another Gaza ceasefire resolution arguing that calls for a ceasefire won't result in a ceasefire. And in Gaza, the World Food Programme suspends the distribution of food as starving Palestinians in Gaza and ignores the risk of Israeli fire and attack an aid convoy.Right now, one of the most punitive sanctions regime ever imposed by the United States is currently in effect on Russia. More than 300 in all over the war with Ukraine. And with the second anniversary of the Russian invasion just days away, so too are more sanctions. Which a senior US official says, at the direction of the US president, will now include a response to the sudden death of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny in a Siberian gulag. An announcement from the White House expected Friday. Here's US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan with more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER (voice-over): This is another turn of the crank, another turn of the wheel. And it is a range of targets, a significant range of targets that we have worked persistently and diligently to identify to continue to impose costs for what Russia has done, for what it's done to Navalny, for what it's done to Ukraine, and for the threat that it represents to international peace and security.

People hear like, oh, now the big sanctions are coming. But the problem is, is that they take a lot of time to take effect. And then it's really difficult to measure how well they're doing. In my mind, the best measure is what does Vladimir Putin and others in the Kremlin say about them? If they weren't such a big deal you wouldn't hear so much about them.I mean, you might hear a little bit of, you know, discussions about how it's, you know, against international law and other sorts of nonsense that the Kremlin puts out. But the fact of the matter is, is that Vladimir Putin says both publicly and privately, you know, he wants them to stop, as does the rest of the leadership in the Kremlin. So, for me, that's the best measure of efficacy, even though we can't always see it ourselves because it goes away and we kind of forget about it.",

I mean, certainly sending people to prison camps in the Gulag, that's not unprecedented. The Russians have a long history of that going back to Soviet days and even before and having people go to the prisons and essentially it's a death sentence. People are going to die there. They know that that stuff is all old and historical and very much part of the Russian tradition.But this whole idea of, say, you know, other people are responsible and it's irresponsible for the international community to accuse the Kremlin and Putin himself of being behind this killing, despite the fact that they've already tried to kill him once with Novichok and he had to be flown to Germany, not to mention all the other assassinations that have happened inside and outside of Russia as recently as yesterday. So, you know, it's it just doesn't stand up to reason. But what it does, I think, show us, John, is that I think Putin is really feeling it. He's feeling that now is his opportunity to move forward. And it's because he thinks his policies and his planning have worked. And he has been let's wait until the West loses focus. Let's wait until the United States loses track and becomes interested in other things. And it seems to be working for him, at least right now. And I think he's feeling it and moving forward briskly because he sees this as a window of opportunity.",

It makes more sense if Putin is preparing to take a new, more politically fraught course. In that case, he would want to leave nothing to chance. Whatever he has planned with Navalny dead, even the slim possibility of political resistance within Russia is likely now extinguished.So, if that's true, how much of a role is U.S. domestic politics playing in all of this? How much of a role is there played to Putin's calculations? You have a Republican front runner for president who won't say a bad word about him, and then a congressional Republicans who are blocking military aid for Ukraine and are very pro Putin, pro Russia at the moment.",

It's amazing to me that despite there being a great deal of popularity in the United States with the idea of hurting Russia in the worst way possible, which is helping Ukraine, that's the real weakness.[00:10:29] That's the chink in Putin's armor. It is incredible that our political system here in the United States can't figure out a way to somehow get money to the Ukrainians, if for no other reason than to push back.

This group of 100 believed to be the first post-pandemic tourists visiting Kim Jong-un's hermetically sealed nation, amid its deepening ties with Russia. They flew from Vladivostok to Pyongyang on a vintage Russian plane operated by Air Koryo, North Korea's only airline. I've flown it more than a dozen times when Westerners were still allowed in. Diplomacy with the U.S. collapsed in Hanoi in 2019, when observers say Kim made a strategic pivot, bolstering his nuclear arsenal, prioritizing ties with Moscow and Beijing, both protecting Kim from fallout at the United Nations for his unprecedented missile-testing binge. Russia is reportedly releasing millions of dollars in frozen North Korean assets, facilitating access to international banking networks, \"The New York Times\" reports, setting the stage for a new chapter of Kim's nuclear ambitions, possibly with the help of Russian rocket scientists.

This is a country which has a strategic pork reserve, much like the strategic oil reserve in the United States, but for pigs. So pigs in the bank.So now to the braised pork latte flavor. Starbucks is hoping coffee drinkers in China will like this interesting flavor. It's marking the lunar new year, because they say eating meat means prosperity in the year ahead. CNN's Marc Stewart is out on the streets of Beijing, doing a little taste test. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So much anticipation. We're here to try this new pork-inspired latte, unique to Starbucks Reserve here in China. Let's go. OK, all right, let's give this to try. All right, so let's take a closer look. You've got coffee. You've got milk, and you've got got some barbecue style sauce on top. We don't have the garnish of the piece of pork, which you see in the promotional materials. But all right, let's give this a try. One more. One more sip. All right. So it pretty much tastes like a latte with a little bit of like a sweet, savory topping. I can see why people may like, and it's kind of that sweet, savory -- savory mix. This costs about $9.50 U.S. I think for me personally, I'm going to stick to an almond latte.
