And you can see a large plume of smoke visible in the sky in this drone video. There's no word on what might have caused the explosions.Meanwhile, rebel groups in Syria are preparing to take control of the country's government. The leader of the main rebel group, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, met former President Bashar al-Assad's outgoing prime minister on Monday to discuss the transfer of power. But a source tells CNN that a decision has not been made yet on who will be the transitional prime minister. The rebels say they will release a list of senior Assad officials wanted for torture. There are long documented reports of the Assad regime committing atrocities against Syrians. Rebels and civilians are tearing down symbols of the Assad regime. And the rebel coalition says members of Assad's military forces must register with them. [03:10:09] They have issued a general amnesty for soldiers conscripted into the military, but that does not apply to those who volunteered. The civilians' life in Syria is starting to return somewhat to normal. In Aleppo, people are back on the streets, some shops are open, and Syria's central bank employees are returning to work today for the first time since the Assad regime's fall.

We have heard from al-Jolani, that outgoing prime minister, that he is keen to see a smooth transition. He has said, really, as Damascus was falling, that he would do what is necessary to create that space for the smooth transition. And just the fact that he is still in Damascus, he is not one of those who has fled the country. Now also at that meeting was the man who is leader of the Salvation Government, prime minister, I should say, of the Salvation Government, which is HTS-affiliated. It was ruling in the area where the rebels really had control, Mohammed al-Bashir. Now he appears to be a key figure in all this, the very fact that he was at this meeting. But we are hearing an actual prime minister, a transitional prime minister has not been named at this point. But what we're hearing from many sides is that there is hope that this appears to be moving peacefully. The fact that you have remnants of the outgoing regime that are physically present, that are willing to work towards this transitional time, along with the rebels, is giving some countries, including the United States, some hope.

The charges that he faces are bribery, fraud and breach of trust, alleging that he did favors for businessmen in exchange for gifts and favorable media coverage. If indeed he is convicted, the process that could take several more years before a verdict is actually reached, he could indeed face prison time. But this is also very much a test of whether or not a sitting Israeli Prime Minister can continue on with his duties and testify in a trial at the same time. And for months now, the Israeli Prime Minister and his legal team, his political allies have been seeking to play this moment, arguing that amid the security situation right now in particular, that a sitting Prime Minister should not have to stand and testify in his trial at this moment. And it will be quite time consuming. For several weeks going forward, three times a week for as many as much as six hours per day, the Israeli Prime Minister will indeed be on the stand facing questions initially from his own defense attorneys and then ultimately facing questions from the prosecution.
