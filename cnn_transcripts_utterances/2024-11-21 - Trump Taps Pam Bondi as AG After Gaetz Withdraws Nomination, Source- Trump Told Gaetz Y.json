      "sentences": "All right, tonight on 360, two big pieces of breaking news on the first big setback for President-elect Trump and just how it came to be. Matt Gaetz's pick for attorney general, saying no thanks to the job before senators have a chance to say no thanks to him.And, the president-elect's choice, just a short time ago of Trump loyalists and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to take the place of Gaetz. Also tonight, what now becomes the Fox host, Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice to run the Pentagon. As a police report complete with lurid details of the sexual assault allegation against him, come to light. Plus, a report from Southern Arizona, where expectations for the new administration's border policies are running high, but so is the apprehension. All right, good evening John Berman here in for Anderson. Donald Trump just lost his first battle as president-elect and immediately joined a new one. That first battle to push through a pick for attorney general who has been accused of sexual misconduct, including sex with a minor. Trump could not get that man or that baggage through though it is notable he tried. So, now just a short time ago, the president-elect chose former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be his second attorney general designee. She also worked for years as a prosecutor, served as one of then President Trump's attorneys for his first impeachment trial, and was a 2020 election denier. She also defended Trump after a subsequent felony indictments, including the Florida documents case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, (R) FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL NOW NOMINEE: we don't talk about all the time weaponization of our courts, weaponization of our law enforcement. And you know, today, truly or if he really is indicted, I believe he will be in Florida. It truly is weaponization. The ultimate sense, guys, the ultimate sense, because there are so many violent crimes out there that they should be investigating and my guess is those real FBI agents out there don't want to be doing this. They want to be investigating the real crime. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As in Anthony Scaramucci, who does join us shortly for Gaetz to fall to earth.Gaetz withdrew his nomination today. And tonight, we also know a lot more about how it played out and why. Gaetz took himself out of the running with a social media post. \"There is no time to waste.\" It reads in part, \"On a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle. Thus, I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as attorney general.\" The post went up at 12:24 PM, about 45 minutes after CNN reached out about our new reporting that the House Ethics Committee was told of a second alleged sexual encounter between Gaetz and a 17-year-old at the center of the accusations, 17 years old. Tonight, we also know it came after a phone call from the president- elect, who told him he did not have the senate votes to continue something one Republican finally managed to say out loud after the fact today.

Now, Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department investigated these allegations and did not charge him. The adult woman who has referenced by this witness has also denied having sex with a minor.

They said it was a consensual encounter. We know there is a paid settlement between the two of them. Hegseth, directed towards this woman. And so, really with Matt Gaetz withdrawing a lot of the attention on Capitol Hill, that was mainly directed at him, I think will now go and focus on Pete Hegseth's nomination. [20:10:13] We've heard some Republican senators already raising questions about this given just the immense role that he would have if he is confirmed. Now, some of them have been enthusiastic and said they are supporting him, but I think there are a few senators to watch for on this matter, especially people like Senator Joni Ernst, and how they are viewing this nomination. That's still an open question, but right now the Trump team has felt good about it so far.

She's not a person who purposely wants to come across as being you know, the kind of person that a Matt Gaetz wants to come across as being. She has been an early loyalist of Donald Trump back in the 2016 primaries. She was a loyalist of him, even though Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio were running. I think with Pam Bondi, he gets loyalty, which matters a lot to him and she hasn't committed statutory rape or been accused of it. She hasn't been accused of sexual assault.

Someone who understands 'A' how to build prosecutions and 'B' has actually managed anything in their life. And that's sadly, John, the point we are at in our politics today.Now, how will the confirmation go? I think that the biggest challenge for Pam Bondi is having, you know, I think you used the term election denialism in the beginning of the segment. You know, she has embraced baseless legal claims on behalf of the former president. And I want to be clear, she is entitled to be a supporter. She's entitled to be MAGA. She's entitled to push the president's agenda whatever that may mean. But we don't want our attorney general pushing baseless legal claims, and she ought to be pressed on that in any -- certainly meetings with senators that she will have in the coming weeks.

Do you agree?ERIN PERRINE, FORMER DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN. I think Republicans feel much better about Pam Bondi's confirmation chances than they do about Matt Gaetz. And I think Speaker Johnson is probably excited that he doesn't have another House member getting scooped up with such a thin majority going into the next Congress. Pam has the experience and should be able to handle a confirmation process well. This is almost a double-edged sword, though, with which you get for the Trump team. She has a lot of footage out there. She's taken a lot of political positions, and she's been very relevant in the news. So, that makes her a good messenger. She knows how to handle a battle, not only as a prosecutor, but being able to litigate in the court of public opinion as well. But that's going to be tough because all of that sound now comes back and she will be pushed on having taken political positions previously going into the Department of Justice through the nomination process.",

So he's still at a loss as to how that's going to go forward. I also asked a lot of the folks down there about President Trump's intentions to potentially deploy the military to the border. You've got a lot of different opinions about this, John. You've got the rancher, Mr. Chilton, who you saw there. He's all for it. Despite being a Democrat for many years, he fully supports Trump, including when it comes to putting the military there. Law enforcement, a bit uneasy about this. They hope cooperation and coordination can be in place if that's to happen. The vigilante who you saw there, Tim Foley, very skeptical about the military. While he supports President Trump, he says the military has been deployed in places before, he's referring to the National Guard, says it's been ineffective. So as he sees it, it would not work.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): On Yuzhmash, the ballistic missile strike, which the Westerners started talking about, we are not commenting at all. ZAKHAROVA (through translation): Yes, OK. Thank you. PATON WALSH (voice-over): Perhaps a trailer for Russian President Vladimir Putin's big reveal. He said the missile was a new hypersonic non-nuclear device called the Hazelnut. There are no means to counter such weapons today, he said. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): The missiles strike targets at speeds of 10 mark. That's 2.5 to 3 kilometers per second. The modern air defense system available worldwide and the U.S. developed missile defense systems in Europe cannot intercept such missiles. This is impossible. [20:50:00] He framed the strike as a response to American and British supplied missiles, ATACMS and storm shadows slamming into Russia proper over the last 72 hours. PUTIN (through translation): We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military objects of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our objects. And in the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond just as decisively and in kind. PATON WALSH (voice-over): Yet Kyiv was yet more on edge when the sirens sounded Thursday afternoon. A U.S. official insisted Russia had few of these new experimental missiles and it had warned allies about the strike. It's unclear if that led to its embassy shutting suddenly a day earlier, citing fears of an aerial assault. Russia, sending a clear signal, but now not with a test like this. In 48 hours, it's made a nuanced change to its nuclear doctrine, and launched a new missile. Total silence so far from Western leaders, but the blast was heard across Ukraine. (END VIDEO TAPE) PATON WALSH (on-camera): John, whatever it turns out, the weapon used over Dnipro indeed was, and there is still some uncertainty, frankly. The Russians are trying to project some element of technological prowess to say that they're still a military superpower that hasn't yet exhausted its arsenal, and there may be new horrific surprises ahead for Ukraine. Even 1,002 days into this war. At the same time, Western officials perhaps know something that they want to say, some things that they don't want to say, and also maybe some things that they don't know about this new device. But the scenes we saw in the skyline over the Dnipro, they're new, they look different. And they're making many Ukrainians feel concerned that when Vladimir Putin says these new missiles can get through any kind of air defences, particularly the ones that protect Kyiv every night, he may not be bluffing.
