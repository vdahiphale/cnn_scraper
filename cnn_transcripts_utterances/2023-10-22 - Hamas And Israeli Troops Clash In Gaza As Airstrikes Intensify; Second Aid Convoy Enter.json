A senior Israeli official tells CNN there will be no ceasefire in Gaza, even while efforts by the United States and Qatar continue to free more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas on October the seventh.On Sunday, Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters inside Gaza. And this appears to be one of the first skirmishes between the two sides on the ground inside the strip since war broke out just over two weeks ago. And it comes as Israel ramps up its bombardment of the Palestinian territory. And Netanyahu government says it's preparing for what it calls the next stage of its war with Hamas. We're also hearing from Egypt's Red Crescent confirming that more trucks with life-saving food and water are now getting into the besieged enclave. But the U.N. says that the convoy has not brought in any desperately needed fuel. Right now for more on our top story, I want to bring in my colleague Sara Sidner, who's in Jerusalem for you.",

But there is definitely a sense of nervousness and fear as this war continues, and the fear of the ground defensive and what that might mean and the reaction to that also very much present.But let's go now to Northern Israel near Lebanon, there have been issues there that have been expanding, including evacuations. CNN's Matthew Chance was at a village that basically the entire village had to be evacuated. He has more on that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It's very quiet here in Kiryat Shmona at the moment in northern Israel. But that's mainly because the vast majority of the population of this city of more than 20,000 people town have gone. They've been evacuated. And that's true of towns and villages all across this area, close to the Lebanese border. There's been an order from the Israeli government for civilians to leave because of the growing threat of rocket attacks and other kinds of attacks from southern Lebanon, where Hamas controls the territory. Palestinian military groups also operate in southern Lebanon as well. And indeed, the Israeli military say that those attacks have been increasing over the course of the past week or so. With, as you say, drone attacks taking place. It will drone flights at these taking place across northern Israel from Lebanese territory, and anti-tank missiles being fired at Israeli installations along the border. There have been infiltrations of gunmen from the Lebanese side into Israel. The Israelis have of course, responded in kind, they've been pounding areas with artillery strikes and airstrikes inside southern Lebanon and in Syria as well. We're very close to the border with Syria, also. And they are now warning Lebanon yet again and warning Hezbollah that if this continues, or if it escalates, there will be a very strong response indeed, from the Israeli military. They say they don't want a second front to open up. But you know, as they're focusing on the south, and as they prepare for that operation, that land operation in Gaza, but they have moved tens of thousands of troops, at least into this region, in preparation for what they say will be a very determined and strong and destructive response against Hezbollah and against Lebanon, if the attacks from that southern part of the country persist or escalate. And so a lot of tension up here in northern Israel, and if there is going to be a second front that opens up it's here, Sara, where it's likely to start. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There is the violence unleashed against an entire population trapped into a besieged enclave in Gaza, and 4,500 Palestinians have already killed. I think over 1,700 are children, but of course there is the ongoing violence in the West Bank, and east Jerusalem at the hands of soldiers and settlements. So in a way, yes, the situation has changed, but in the sense that it has worsened, and it makes all the more imperative for the international community to intervene. What is the urgent is a ceasefire in Gaza, a ceasefire that protects further -- civilians from further deaths, both the Palestinians and the hostages who are trapped there. But then there is the necessity to hold to end the Israeli occupation, because this is the root cause of the violence that has been ongoing in the occupied Palestinian territory for decades now.",

The Al Aqsa martyrs Hospital in central Gaza is close to areas of intense bombardment and a doctor there is calling Sunday quote, a bloody day, saying the situation is nothing short of catastrophic. Scott McLean has details and a warning to you that his report contains graphic images.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Those who arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza alive are the lucky ones. There were five airstrikes this morning near the hospital. This video shows the smoke from one rising nearby. Some 110 bodies were brought here overnight and this morning. One medical source tells CNN the morgue is now full. The rest of the bodies wrapped in white sheets now lay outside in the heat of the day. Relatives try to identify their loved ones, finding them confirms their worst fears. Inside the hospital children, including a toddler are among the dead. Several of these victims were found with their names written in Arabic on their legs, an increasingly common marking as parents try to make identification easier if they were their kids are killed. This hospital is located outside of the area of northern Gaza that Israel has been trying to get civilians to evacuate. On Saturday, the IDF dropped leaflets telling people that everyone who chose to not evacuate from the north of the strip to the south of Wadi Gaza might be considered as a partner for the terrorist organization. In a statement the IDF confirmed it dropped the leaflets but said it has no intention to consider those who have not evacuated from the affected area of fighting as a member of the terrorist group. Even those who have managed to avoid the bombs are not out of danger. A trickle of aid 20 trucks were allowed to cross the Rafah Border Crossing from Egypt on Saturday.

The situation before this war was already dire for them that it was a healthcare system on its knees living in that's continued since 2007. In the last few days with the escalating bombardment, they are having to make extremely difficult decisions that includes triaging patients out the door to decide who to leave behind, and who to try and salvage. And that's because of this huge number of mass casualties that are walking through the door. On top of that, they're having to do operations without electricity. And that often means using mobile phones as their source of light. That means using to reduce the use of supplies, they will use anesthetic -- reduced amounts of anesthetic to do operations as well. Many of the medics I've spoken to have told me that they have been operating and working for seven days straight with little to no rest. One of the surgeons I spoke to mention that he was sleeping on his own operating theater table in between operations. And not only that, but you have to remember these medics, nurses, paramedics are human beings, they have families, many of them have had families that have been killed or bombed. And at times, they've come in on a shift and found their own family members coming in that through the door. So it's a human catastrophe, to be honest, it's a humanitarian crisis.

I mean, that truly unthinkable. ABDEL-MANNAN: Absolutely, I mean, I am often horrified by these stories. And I think I don't know how they managed to function. They often will just zone in on trying to salvage the patients trying to work as hard as they can. But as you said, the situation is dire for them. They are running out of supplies. There is a lack of basic supplies like antibiotics, fluids, blood products. And again, speaking to sources on the ground, and people waiting at the border, they've told me that all the private stocks of medicines and supplies within Gaza from have been exhausted. So the aid that comes in is really crucial. It's always welcome to see a coming in. But to be honest, 20 trucks is a drop in the ocean to what they actually need. This area was used to having 200, between 200 and 500 trucks of aids going on a daily basis. Now 20 trucks of aids, I think is not sufficient to keep these people alive. And as you pointed out, this is not only from a medical perspective. These patients are now suffering from malnutrition. There is a lack of basic water sanitation, and that will lead to infectious diseases spread color are things that we see in humanitarian catastrophes such as Haiti after the earthquake, the recent Libyan dam explosion, you know, these are -- this is unprecedented for the peace of people of Gaza, and they are living in pretty horrific.",

President Biden is spending the weekend in his Delaware home. That is where a CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now.

He has had multiple calls today with world leaders, including European and Canadian leaders, and notably another call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This marks the eighth call that the two leaders have had since those terror attacks on October 7th. And according to a report from the White House, the two leaders discuss developments in the ongoing situation in Israel and Gaza. The President affirmed the flow of critical assistance to Gaza and they discuss efforts to release hostages.Now, of course, all of these calls come both on the heels of President Biden's trip to Israel, but also as an invasion looms into Gaza. And as U.S. officials are working around the clock to try to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. Friday was a positive signal for officials after they saw the release of two American hostages. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken on networks today, saying that he is still hopeful that they can secure the release of more hostages though, of course, there still remain questions over how many of those are U.S. citizens. U.S. officials have characterized it as only a handful and also in what condition they're in and where they may be whether they're together or held in separate areas across Gaza. So all of this is what the administration is working very closely on in something that the President has talked about with the Prime Minister of Israel, as well as with other leaders. Now, President Biden has also been briefed over the course of the day by his national security team that includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. So this, of course, is all developing very quickly, and the White House is keeping eyes on all of it. Sara?

There are a lot of troops in place that we've seen today along the border with Gaza, not far from here. But some of the heaviest strikes we've been hearing have been coming in the northern area of Gaza. And we're beginning to get some reports in from the Jabalya camp and other parts of northern Gaza, about impacts there.

In fact, I was talking to one former IDF soldier who told me, look, I fought in the 1967 war. He said, we were kept out in the field, he was an officer, then he said, we were kept out in the field, waiting for a month before the incursion.We were frustrated. We were told we were going to go. We were not going to go before the offensive, rather not the incursion back then. And he said, actually, we spent a lot of time training. And he said, I believe that we had greater success there in 1967, because we waited so long to go in. The other narrative that comes from former generals is that while the troops are waiting there in the field, and these airstrikes continue, that is allowing Israel to pick off more of the Hamas military commander targets that they want to go after, we're very aware. And they are very aware as well, when you ask them about the civilian casualties that are happening, while Hamas is being targeted. But they're saying it is having a military effect. So the waiting again, is still productive for the military in terms of trying to go after the Hamas leadership. But on top of that, they're also aware that the window is closing. The window of international will of opinion that says Israel can still have an incursion, that window that says that it's closing because the international community wants Israel to stop the civilian casualties inside of Gaza, to have a humanitarian pause to allow a free flow of aid trucks into Gaza, things that aren't happening at the moment, because Israel is afraid that that aid will end up in the hands of Hamas, and strength -- and therefore strengthen Hamas. So I think all of this seems to be in the balance. And add into that balance, the fact that, you know, Prime Minister Netanyahu can't say no, when President Biden puts pressure on them because the United States supplies munitions to Israel. But then Prime Minister Netanyahu is in a difficult political position already. There are a lot of hawks in his government. There's a lot of strength of feeling in the population in the country that Hamas needs to have and be shown a very tough military response for their barbaric attacks of two weeks ago. So all of this is in play at the moment but it doesn't seem at the moment, despite this to be adding up to a decision not to have an incursion. It still feels it hasn't happened.

And when something is done to Israel, anti-Semitism increases.So you see a massacre of proportions that we've not seen for 75 years, and then you have people coming out and attacking Jews. So I do expect there to be continued attacks in anti-Semitism against the Jewish community. But I don't know that Israel's response is necessarily to blame for that.",

I think initially, just looking at the headline, a Detroit synagogue leader found stabbed to death, of course, really brings people to potentially jump to conclusions and it's exactly what police are cautioning against at this point.We actually just got the statement from the Detroit Police Chief not too long ago, and he said that this time, despite the investigation remaining ongoing, they stress that that no evidence so far has surfaced suggesting that this crime was motivated by anti-Semitism. But also as part of, they did not include as part of that statement, I should say that they ruled out this involves anti-Semitism. So it's why they are urging caution that this is the initial stages of an investigation. Now what we do know police say that just behind me here in just near downtown Detroit. On this block was where the body of 40-year-old Samantha Woll was found. Police say there was a trail of blood leading from the body to her home. And that's where they believe the killing actually took place. Now Woll was 40 years old and of course a member of this community but known throughout the state, from community members up to elected leaders in this state, very politically active. The Attorney General in this state talked about how Woll helped her with her reelection campaigns, always by her side, always showing up with a smile on her face. She's been -- they've been having a memorial service over the course of today. Woll has as many people have reflected on her life. A state senator who knew Woll very well talked about how she was just at a wedding with Woll, the night before her body was found Friday night, and how the one constellation she has is some of the last memories she has of her were of her smiling and laughing. This happened, we are trying to figure out how this happened and community members are trying to figure out how to process it. And now police and investigators are trying to figure out why.",
