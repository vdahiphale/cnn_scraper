Look, Democrats controlling the Senate, Republicans likely taking the house. We could be looking at a divided Congress. What does it all mean for President Biden and his agenda? How challenging, Jeff, could this be for? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly is challenging, we're not nearly as challenging as the president in the White House was bracing for. And the reason is this, Democrats keeping control of the U.S. Senate, it's really monumental because it allows the rest of the Biden agenda from the second half of his presidency to go forward through a judicial appointments. One of the biggest powers that the presidency of course is appointing judges, so this is something that you'll be able to do without any disruption, as well as appointing other cabinet members, ambassadors, people to serve in his administration. So, holding the Senate for Democrats, that was absolutely huge. Now, Republicans are likely to have a narrow majority in the House, it's still being worked out, they have a mess on their own hands, they're deciding if their leadership election, but even a small majority certainly a headache for the White House in terms of investigations, in terms of oversight, we'll certainly see a lot about the White House being called into question, what they're doing, Hunter Biden, of course, he's at the center of a lot of investigations and interest from Republicans. But the majority is likely to end only on somewhere in the single digits, five seats, eight seats at the most. So, certainly, not nearly as big of a Republican, a majority, as White House though.

But here by accounts that are beginning to come through, they're pushing the Russian troops further back off that eastern bank of the river. And that is -- the way that it appears.
