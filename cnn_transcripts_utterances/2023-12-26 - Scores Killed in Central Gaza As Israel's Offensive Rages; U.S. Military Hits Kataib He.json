It is Tuesday, December 26.And we have got a lot to get to here. We're going to start with Israel's offensive raging on in Gaza this morning while the death toll soars. And a warning, some of the images that you're going to see are disturbing. In Central Gaza, family members mourn their dead out beside the Al- Aqsa Hospital according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. At least 250 people were killed and 500 injured in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was interrupted by angry shouts from family members of hostages still held in Gaza. It happened during a special session of parliament Monday, after he made a second wartime visit to the Palestinian territory, telling stories of a long fight to come, putting him at odds with the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Whoever talks about stopping, there's no such thing. We are not stopping. The war will continue until the end.

      "sentences": "Look, Omar, we know that the U.S., the Biden administration, and the Israeli government have been keeping close contact over the course of the war. And this, of course, comes just days after President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the week. The focus has really been that call from the U.S., from the WhiteHouse to move towards what's being described as a lower intensity phase of the war. And as you mentioned, this has really put the U.S. at odds with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has said he believes this war will be a long fight ahead. He says that the war is not near being over at this stage. In fact, what we are seeing on the ground in the Gaza Strip is an expansion of Israel's military operation, both in its air campaign and ground operations in Gaza. We have seen those renewed evacuation warnings telling civilians in Central Gaza and southern Gaza to move. The question of where civilians can actually move under a blockade remains to be answered. But, of course, there is mounting pressure. Of course, the U.S. is also feeling that pressure. The civilian death toll continues to soar, now topping 20,000 according to health officials on the ground in Gaza. And, of course, while the U.S. has been calling on the Israeli government to move towards that lower intensity phase, we haven't had that vocal agreement from the Israeli government. Last week we did hear from the White House telling reporters that they had been assured, by the Israeli government, that they would begin to transition their operations towards that lower intensity phase. There are no clear timeline giving as to when we might expect to see that transition. And, of course, this latest message from Benjamin Netanyahu that the war is, indeed, intensifying by the looks of things really stands against what the U.S. has been saying. So, clearly that is expected to be a primary focus of today's talks between Ron Dermer. This is, of course, somebody who has had a lot of experience in dealing and working with the U.S. government, who did as the Israeli ambassador to the United States under Benjamin Netanyahu, as you mentioned, a very close confidant of Benjamin Netanyahu. He is the minister for strategic affairs. It'll be interesting to see what comes out of those meetings, but those operation developments will be a primary focus.",

We know, of course, that aid has been getting into Gaza via the Rafah Border crossing, which separates Gaza from Egypt. But, as we begin to hear those warnings of an expanded ground operation by the Israeli military, particularly with the focus on the south, we know of course there are hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians who are now taking shelter in these temporary tent cities. There is mounting concern that we will not see that U.N. resolutions, that call for the unhindered access of aid actually being adopted in practical terms, at least not in the immediate few days and weeks. That is the primary concern here. As you mentioned, we are now beginning to hear diplomats and aid agencies talking about an impending famine in the Gaza Strip, an acute hunger crisis that is being faced by some 2.2 million people inside Gaza. And, as the fighting intensifies, as we continue to see airstrikes, not just across southern Gaza but also airstrikes focused on Rafah, the city of Rafah where of course that is the vital gateway of aid from international partners across the board to get in violence convoys, crossing the Rafah border crossing, there is a huge amount of concern that the safety guarantees that these aid agencies need, that these agencies need, simply are not in place and will not be upheld in order to allow for long term aid to get in. Now, of course, there continues to be cold for a humanitarian port, for a longer term balls, even calls for a cease-fire. That has, of course, been flat out rejected by the Israeli government but there continues to be pressure there. We are hearing from two Israeli sources that a proposal has been put forward by the Egyptian government over the weekend, but no confirmation at the stage with regards to the detail of that plan from the Egyptian government itself -- Omar.",

We're going to be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [05:12:01] JIMENEZ:  From the start, the Israel-Hamas war has had significant political consequences for President Biden at home, revealing deep divisions between his party's base and its progressive wing. Those deep divisions are now altering the dynamics of 2024 House Democratic primaries with some of the most high-profile progressive incumbents facing moderate challengers who are hoping to oust them over their vocal criticisms of Israel. So, let's bring in Samantha-Jo Roth. She's a congressional reporter for \"The Washington Examiner\", she has been covering this. Great to see you. Thanks for being up with us. Look, I want to take a look at some of your most recent reporting. I mean, it shed light on the impact the war is having on these house races, which candidates are likely to be impacted most. Or which candidates do you expect, should I say, do you expect to be affected most? SAMANTHA-JO ROTH, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Yeah, absolutely, Omar. We're expecting Cori Bush, Jamaal Bowman, Rashida Tlaib who is not actually had a challenger at this time. A lot of these members like Ilhan Omar mar of the so-called \"Squad\", the Israel lobby is working really hard to recruit candidates to take them on. It is important to remember that this is a theme throughout a lot of Democratic primaries in the past, but with this war it is going to take center stage. The Israel lobby spent about $30 million in 2022 and they are expected to spend about three times that in these upcoming elections. So, it's going to be really fierce, it's going to be a fierce fight. You know, obviously progressive leaders are not happy about this infighting within the party and a lot of them are trying to remind folks that, you know, these single-focused interest groups are not always great. If you look at, and the 2022 cycle, AIPAC actually endorsed over 100 members of Congress, Republican members who voted to overturn the election results. So that's something that they're trying to make very clear that, you know, in this upcoming fight.",

So it's going to reduce the visibility and, yes, we are meeting the criteria for blizzard conditions. I'll show you just that in one moment.But look how expansive the storm system, is stretching from the southeast all the way to the Canadian border, even towards the Colorado Rockies. Zooming in a little closer, we have a full on ice storm taking place across northern Minnesota and into North Dakota, parts of South Dakota. This is really just snow, but, again, being blinded and driven by this very strong powerful wind out of the north. We have roughly a half million people under with blizzard warnings right now. Ice storm warnings across the Dakotas. So it's really focused in on the planes at the moment. When we talk about reduced visibility because of the blowing snow, look at Cheyenne, Wyoming, about three quarter visibility. That is a combination of heavy snow and also the winds gusting over 35 to 45 miles per hour, reducing that visibility for a sustained amount of time. That needs to blizzard criteria. Winds will not relax for that part of the eastern plains until Wednesday evening when the system finally says goodbye to the central parts of the country. But we're still feeling its impacts as we head into the east coast for the next couple of days. In fact, we have rainfall that is causing flash flood concerns over the Appalachian mountains. We have flash flood watches in place across western North Carolina. So, take care, a couple of extra inches on top of what is already fallen. And then look as we head into the late Wednesday and Thursday. We're going to focus our attention across the I-95 corridor, New York City, Boston, all the way to the nation's capital. That is where we have a marginal risk of flash flooding and you can see just how that will evolve over the next couple of hours as the system combined with low pressure just off the coastline. So, heading back to your holiday plans or perhaps getting ready for the New Year's weekend we will certainly be impacted by rain along the east coast.
