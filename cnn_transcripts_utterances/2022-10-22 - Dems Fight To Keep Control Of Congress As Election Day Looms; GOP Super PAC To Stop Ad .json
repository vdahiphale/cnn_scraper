We are outside of Philadelphia in what are called the collar counties of Pennsylvania.This is an area that will be key to Democrats in 2022. Dr. Oz, during the Republican primary argued, this is the kind of area he could help Republicans win. Because frankly, Donald Trump suffered in areas like this. Joe Biden won this county 58 percent of the vote. In 2012, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, actually won this county, beating the man you just heard from, President Barack Obama. Obama won this county in 2008. So, you can see it's a swing county. It's also not happenstance, who is here. Klobuchar being here highlights the importance of women voters in this county. The Fetterman campaign thinks they have to turn out women voters who helped Democrats in 2018 and 2020. That's their path to victory not only here in Chester County, but across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Fred.",

And women really are, as David was saying, you know, women, particularly, college educated women, women in the suburbs, they are the swing vote in this election, it is often the case. But I think it's particularly true this year, where we have really seen the polls go back and forth, in large part because those independent voting women are torn between the focus on the economy, which, of course, the Republicans have been emphasizing and hammering on. Everything, you know, from inflation to the price of gas, and housing, and so on. And the Democrats are making the counter argument about abortion, which I think is just as powerful an argument for a lot of these independent women. So, I think you may see a lot of these voters waiting to make a decision until the final days and keeping this race really up in the air.",

But there are a couple of issues right now that are making it tough for Democrats.They got a boost -- a few weeks ago, when gas prices really seemed to fall, then they ticked back up. At the end of the summer, they had a bunch of legislative wins, but that has sort of faded from memory. You had -- you had the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which as Molly says, really is a motivating issue for Democratic base voters. But that happened in the early part of the year. So now, Democrats are having to go into their closing argument, reminding voters of what they have done, because it's not top of mind because it's not front page news anymore. If they can effectively message that, including the president on gas, then, it will help them, but I still think they're going to have a tough time holding on to the House. They're not going to have a shellacking like the Obama-led Democrats had in 2010 when they lost more than 60 seats. But I do think the House is tough sledding.",

In Georgia, particularly, I do see Governor Kemp getting space from Stacey Abrams. But in the Senate race, I really think it's going to come down to which party can turn out their voters in these next couple of weeks in early voting, and on Election Day. Again, Democrats have a better chance to hold on to the Senate, to hold at least a 50-50 tie with Vice President Harris as the tiebreaker vote. But all these contested races, except for a few exceptions, Colorado Senate or Georgia Governor, I think all the candidates are going to have to run all the way through the finish line because you just don't know what's going to happen in the coming weeks.",

More than 7,000 cases were detected last week alone, the highest of any week in the past two years. WHITFIELD (on camera): Several hospitals tell CNN that they have been overwhelmed with patients at a time of year when a surge is actually unusual. CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula has more. DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): We are seeing an uptick in RSV nationwide. And in particular, when it comes to kids having to go to the hospital. We're seeing hospitals in many parts of the country really being overwhelmed with the number of kids being admitted and diagnosed with RSV. NARULA (voice-over): We know that RSV is a very common lower tract respiratory illness in kids usually under the age of 1.And on average, causes about 58,000 hospitalizations a year in kids under 5. Typically, we treated symptomatically and most kids do well, even when they are hospitalized with supportive care. We think we're seeing this uptick in part because of COVID mitigation strategies, which really prevented kids in many parts of the country from being exposed at a time when they normally would. NARULA (on camera): We know that most individuals have RSV before they even reached the age of 2. But here we have a population of children who never really have the ability to develop immunity because of those mitigation strategies. Also, moms who may not have passed along immunity to their babies, because of decreased exposure to moms over the past two years. In terms of what parents need to know, we want to make sure that they pay attention to things like runny nose, sneeze, cough, fever, wheezing, or in young infants, decreased activity or irritability or difficulty breathing. NARULA (voice-over): Certainly if any of those things get worse or child is unable to stay hydrated, looks like they're having respiratory difficulty then it is important to get to the emergency room. NARULA (on camera): Pediatricians do have tests to help differentiate this from COVID and the flu, so that's another important thing to note. And finally, keeping kids safe, this is transmitted basically in similar ways with cough, and sneezing, and viral particles that can land on hard surfaces and actually live there for several hours. So, it would be important to cover coughs, to wash hands, to disinfect, and clean surfaces, and really avoid contact with people who may be sick, particularly, paying attention to your younger children and keeping them away from anyone who may be exhibiting signs that could be RSV.",

So, Joe, I mean, nearly 20 million people had already applied to have their student loans forgiven. What's the White House saying? JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, they're essentially saying, Fred, full speed ahead, and that people should continue to put in applications if they think they're eligible for this program. And say the administration is going to continue reviewing those applications, because the point they're making is that all this court decision really says is hold on, don't start canceling debt under this program, until they can take a closer look at it. The issue really is whether the president can just throw out these loans, essentially with a wave of the wand without getting Congress involved.

We need for them to stop associating our missing black and brown men and women as, you know, criminals because there's no sense of urgency and finding them, it's really desensitizing and dehumanizing the fact that these are valuable members of our community, their mothers, their fathers, their sons, their daughters, brothers and sisters, and they deserve the same amount of resources.

A new today one of the first state troopers on the scene of the Uvalde, Texas school shooting has been terminated, Captain Juan Maldonado was fired Friday but the Texas Department of Public Safety declined to explain why. The shooting at Robb Elementary School left 19 children and two teachers dead. And in a new CNN exclusive audio tapes released from that day reveal more about how another Texas State Police Captain may have contributed to the failed response that day. CNN Shimon Prokupecz has details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER (voice-over): Amid the chaos at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas where nearly 400 law enforcement responded to a deadly school shooting last May, CNN has learned commands by a high-ranking state police officer may have contributed to the broader failed response that day. While a gunman sat in a room full of dead, dying and traumatized children, new police radio transmissions obtained by CNN show Texas Department of Public Safety Captain Joe Betancourt given an order to stop police from entering the classroom. And one internal memo describes him before he arrives telling officers to stay away from the school and remain on the perimeter during the initial response to the shooting. Captain Betancourt was one of 91 DPS officers on scene in Uvalde. We are now learning he is one of the seven referred for further investigation over his actions. After lionizing the police response in the initial days, the Texas governor and state officials have pushed the blame for what has since been acknowledged as a failure on the local and school police. But CNN has now reviewed memos written just two days after the shooting. The detail actions by the DPS that allegedly went against protocol for mass shootings. One lieutenant wrote, I heard someone shout out, Captain Betancourt said all DPS personnel need to be on perimeter. Do not enter the building. And a sergeant reported he knew this was clearly against established training. And so he entered the school anyway. By the time Betancourt says he arrived outside Robb Elementary, students and teachers had already been trapped for more than an hour.",

In an interview with investigators that has been detailed to CNN, Betancourt said he did not know there were any children in the building until after the breach. That's despite 911 calls from children inside the room. Betancourt says he was relying on information from Uvalde Sheriff Ruben Nolasco that the gunman was a barricaded subject and no longer an active shooter. And that a better SWAT team was on its way. He admits he never spoke to former school Police Chief Pete Arredondo who has been labeled the on-scene commander until after the shooter was killed. The memo referencing Betancourt's actions and another corroborating it are some of the clearest evidence that questions are being raised internally at the Department of Public Safety about the actions of its officers. His orders over the radio contradict the official narrative that the state police were never in command of the scene and never issued substantive orders. When questioned by CNN in September, DPS Director Colonel Steve McCraw confirmed the investigation into Betancourt and promised to resign if his agency was shown to have culpability for the botched response.
