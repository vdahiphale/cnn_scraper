NASA scrubbing its second attempt, or third, to launch Boeing's Starliner flight test after an automatic hold was triggered with less than four minutes until launch. The computer that launches the rocket stopped the countdown clock, and now officials are racing to learn why. Both astronauts are now back at crew quarters after leaving the capsule a short time ago. Joining us now from the Kennedy Space Center is CNN space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher. So, Kristin, obviously this is not the news that NASA or Boeing wanted today. What happened?",

      "sentences": "We just don't know yet. And we're going to find out hopefully quite a bit more during a press conference that NASA, Boeing, and the United Launch Alliance have called, which is set to start in exactly one hour now. All we know right now is that there was an issue with the ground launch sequencer, and that is the computer that's responsible for launching this rocket. It's essentially an automated process once you get down that close to liftoff, and there was some kind of problem with it.We just got a new line here that I'm kind of reading through and dissecting for further meaning. NASA says the system was unsuccessful in verifying the sequencers necessary redundancy. So hopefully we'll learn a bit more about what that means at this 3:00 p.m. presser. But it sounds like this was not a NASA issue. It sounds like it was not a Boeing issue. It sounds like it wasn't even an issue with the weather. Most likely it was United Launch Alliance issue. And that's an important distinction given all the scrutiny that's been facing Boeing leading up to this launch. For those that don't know, this is the vehicle that was supposed to be launching today. This tiny capsule on top, that's all Boeing is responsible for, the United -- the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. This is the Atlas rocket which propels the Starliner spacecraft into space. It's operated by the United Launch Alliance, which is all to why they're responsible for this ground launch sequencer, which is where problem was today. But yes, Alisyn, definitely a bit of a bummer for Boeing, NASA, the astronauts that were inside, everybody involved. But really important to remember that scrubs are so common in spaceflight. I can't tell you how many launches I've been to that are scrubs, especially for a first crewed test flight. The mantra at NASA is we don't launch until we're ready. And so this is fairly routine, I'm sad to say. But what -- that does not underscore, or undermine all the many issues and challenges that Boeing has faced leading up to this moment. It had so many technical issues and so many engineering problems with this spacecraft, so much so that its competitors, SpaceX, has been able to launch 13 crewed missions to outer space in that four-year span that Boeing hasn't been able to fly. So the pressure really on Boeing to prove that it's spacecraft can finally fly in space and carry astronauts on board for the very first time. But Alisyn, today just was not their day. And so when will the next attempt be? It could be as soon as tomorrow at noon. We should find that out at this press conference in one hour. If not then, then they have the next back backup launch attempts are next week, June 5th and June 6th. So hopefully we'll learn more in one hour, Alisyn.",

[14:05:11] To that end, the secretary did in fact meet face-to-face just the other day with his Chinese counterpart for the first time since 2022. And importantly, Secretary Austin reiterated to the Chinese that there are going to be consequences not only for their actions potentially in the South China Sea and in the region around Taiwan, but also for their support and their ongoing support for Russia's defense sector and how that is fueling the war in Ukraine. Secretary Austin said that if China continues provide that kind of support for the Russians, then the U.S. and its allies will be forced to take further measures. Now, that is undoubtedly going to be on the agenda for Secretary Austin's meeting with a surprise guest here at the Shangri-La forum, which is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. He showed up earlier on Saturday night, and he's expected to meet on Sunday with Secretary Austin alongside his defense minister Umerov. And they are expected to talk about the battlefield situation in Ukraine, as well as what Ukraine needs to defend itself against the Russians right now. And so expect that meeting to be very significant, of course, for Austin and for the Ukrainian leader here at a moment when the Chinese, of course, are here as well, and they have continued to provide very significant support for Russia's defense sector.

Colonel, thanks so much for being here. So what's the most urgent thing that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Defense Secretary Austin need to discuss tomorrow?LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET), FORMER EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  I think the fact is that the west and the U.S. haven't necessarily played the same role in terms of fulsome support to Ukraine that you now see you kind of China orienting, trying to really fundamentally floating the Russian war economy. We're more iterative. We had a long suspension in terms of our military support. That was a six-month gap in which the Ukrainians had to do more on their own. The Europeans stepped up in a big way. I think the biggest thing is, do we make that final commitment for Ukraine to win? That's still yet unclear. I do appreciate Secretary Austin using the word \"convergence\" of our allies in the Pacific. That is a very powerful notion. It's a debate amongst policymakers and strategist whether we recognize that the authoritarian world, whether the Chinas and Russias and Irans of the world and North Koreas of the world, that they're converging. Does as the democratic world converge in the same way to secure our own interests? Ukraine being one of the most important and the currently the principal battlefield.",

The fact is that for a long time, I would argue for probably the past 30 years, we've been highly deferential to Russia, seeking in all cases to avoid any real significant risks on the fear of escalation, devolution in the relationship. This is a meaningful change in that we're not allowing that kind of same mentality to creep in in the same way. It's still quite limited. It's oriented around a specific region, around Kharkiv, around Russia's ability to use offensive forces, artillery strikes from across the border. It is not the typical standard fare of we provide military resources to an ally, and then they're entirely unencumbered in defending themselves. We don't restrict in the same way. If this was another country, we would not see any of these types of restrictions on striking cross into the aggressor state's territory.But this is meaningful. This is a shift in the right direction. It is likely to be a test. If the administration and the west don't see a significant blowback, which I wouldn't expect any significant blowback from the Russians, I think that would enable a broader approach to reducing these constraints on how the Ukrainians defend themselves. So it's an important step, but it's still a toe in the water.",

      "sentences": "So it's quite different even now than it was in April in certain regards, because I was there just at the tail end right before we pass the Ukraine aid bill. And I'd say morale was really quite low. The Ukrainians were seeing pressure from Russia in a bunch of different places, especially in the Donbas. They're worn out in a lot of ways because they don't have enough combat troops. The Ukrainians hadn't mobilized, or still haven't mobilized sufficient force is to start rotating folks off of the front lines, giving them a break. But now what's significantly changes that we passed a $61 billionUkraine assistance package. The Europeans continue to step up. That weaponry has reached the front lines. You could see that in the way the Ukrainians are more effectively repelling Russian forces around Kharkiv. And I think that I am pretty optimistic that the Russians will likely make some additional gains really, meters, kilometers, but they're not going to do anything substantial. They're not going to change the orientation of this war over the next several months. And the senior policymakers I talked to in Ukraine when I was there were concerned about June and July Russian offensive, and whether they're forces could weather them. I think that that's going to be -- that's going to turn out OK. There will be small setbacks. And in the meantime, the Ukrainians are going to build resources for a counterpunch, probably not this year, but next year. They'll weather the Russian attacks and then start building towards next year and an offensive.",

And if people are using public information to identify these people, I don't know that there's going to be a recourse.If they cross the line into doing things like Swatting these jurors or potentially actionable death threats, then they'd have the same recourse everyone else does, which is to go to the police.

Now, it says it's done so because it cannot guarantee the safety of the drivers of the humanitarian aid trucks, because now that Israel is in control, that would make it a target for Hamas militants. And case in point being, that there have been rocket attacks on the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip, which has also caused that crossing to be closed at times over the past few weeks. So it's incredibly important that the Rafah crossing be reopened. And this is what these talks in Cairo do to resolve, because the Egyptians have been blaming Israel. They said they cannot let these trucks go through until Israel withdraws its forces from these border crossings. Israel has said no, Egypt just simply needs to open the border. So they're going to try to resolve this issue right now. One imagines trying to clear the air as well, and try to find some kind of mechanism to ensure that the flow of humanitarian aid resumes. But let's not forget that even the aid that was getting through the Rafah crossing before it was closed was not enough. Now that that aid has been stopped, they are even further short of the amount of humanitarian aid, food, medicine, fuel, and the likes, going into Rafah in the southern part of the Gaza Strip than is necessary. So these talks designed to resolve that, to try to get aid flowing once again to the people, the Palestinians in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Alisyn?",

      "sentences": "It's going to be a busy season. We are absolutely confident it will be an above average season. NOAA's official forecast calls for up to 25 named storms. Average would be 14. Of those 25 named storms, 13 of them could be hurricanes. Average is seven. So again, incredibly active, much above average, and that's the forecast from multiple outlets.I find this stat remarkable. We have 85 percent confidence that this will be in above-normal season. The chance that it's below average will only be about five percent. So virtually impossible that this will go the other way and be a lackluster season. Part of the reason is we have a La Nina. La Nina, is that cooler ocean circulation in the Pacific, and sometimes it could do a dance with our jet stream, or the path of storminess. What it can do is the La Nina can send that jet stream, or the path of storminess, to the north. That opens up this area to less wind energy, or windshear. Hurricanes hate wind energy. They don't like when the winds change speed and direction with height. So if we get more of this out of the way, keep that clear of the wind energy, this will open up a path for more storms to develop. On top of this, another big factor is we have really warm ocean temperatures. Ocean temperatures so far this season have already been about three to five degrees above average. They've already been closer to August normals than typical for May or early June. So we're already off to the races with a very warm start for the ocean temperatures. And this is the climate change factor. This is climate change. Our oceans track 90 percent of our heat from our greenhouse gas emissions. Warmer water is more fuel for stronger storms. Hurricanes love warm ocean temperatures. The warm ocean temperatures can also fuel more moisture into this storm, that's heavier rain. You have higher storm surge as well with sea level rise. So we're talking about more intense storms with climate change, and that could be the factor this season. When the storms are wetter, more intense, they can get farther inland with the damage. We're talking about more costs, more billion-dollar storms. And that increases your insurance costs to, Alisyn.",

We have excessive heat watches for parts of California and Nevada, including Las Vegas. This goes into effect by Tuesday where we're looking at triple digit temperatures already for Phoenix, Vegas. And Vegas, yes, it gets hot there, but your average is 95 degrees this time of year. We're talking about temperatures already getting to 105 as we go into the workweek.So again, Tuesday, looking at temperatures at 105 degrees in Sacramento, nearing 107, that's 20 degrees above average by Wednesday. So again, yes, it gets hot in these places, but not this hot this early. Even temperatures in the 90s already in Denver by the middle of the week, this means, again, heat sickness early in the season. So check kids, elderly pets.
