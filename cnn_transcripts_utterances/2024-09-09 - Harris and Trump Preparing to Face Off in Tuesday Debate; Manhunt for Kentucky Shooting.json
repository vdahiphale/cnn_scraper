It's Monday, September 9th here, 9 a.m. in London, 4 a.m. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are just one day away from meeting face-to-face for the first time on a debate stage. That high-stakes showdown in the first presidential debate with 57 days to go until the November election. It will come just before early voting begins in several key states.And as new polling shows, the race for the White House remains very, very tight. A New York Times Siena College poll shows no clear leader. But a similar theme found in the latest CNN Poll of Polls, which shows Harris at 49 percent and Trump at 47 percent. Former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney, who announced she'll be voting for Harris, had this message for her fellow Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Given the closeness of this election, particularly if you're going to find yourself voting in a swing state, you've got to take the extra step. If you really do recognize the threat that Donald Trump poses, then it's not enough to simply say I'm not going to vote for him. I would also remind them, you know what, it's a secret ballot. So I would prefer to have as many people as possible out publicly making the case. But at the end of the day, you just have to wrestle with your own conscience when you're there in the voting booth.

She has likely been poring over briefing books, anticipating what the moderators might ask her, anticipating what former President Donald Trump might say. We know one thing is for sure, though, her campaign not so worried about these polls. Brian Fallon, a spokesperson for the campaign, tweeting that they have always viewed themselves as the underdog in this contest, and they still have that mentality. They recognize that they have a lot of work to do in the 50 plus days until the election. Meanwhile, they're already telegraphing what they're going to do after the debate, a battleground blitz, they're calling it, with the vice president campaigning in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, Governor Walz taking to Michigan and Wisconsin, and their respective spouses fanning out across the country as well. The campaign will have a presence in every battleground state. Eva McKend, CNN, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He is believed to be armed and dangerous.Now, police have located a vehicle registered to Joseph Couch, as well as a gun that was inside the vehicle, and they also recovered an AR- 15-style weapon, which they believe was used in this shooting. Now, law enforcement has been focused on one specific area near where the shooting took place, but this is very rugged, wooded terrain. Police have said that there are a lot of trees, it is difficult to get around, and that is making it very challenging for them to continue the search into the night. Once the sun comes down, they said they were going to pull back their officers out of an abundance of caution. Now, the White House has been in touch with law enforcement in Kentucky, which has been using several resources, including at least one helicopter, canine units, as well as a drone, in order to search the area. For now, authorities have not determined a motive behind the shooting, but they do believe that the shooting was planned. And while there were no fatalities, at least five people were critically injured, some of them suffering gunshot wounds to the face and across the chest. In the meantime, schools are expected to be closed on Monday. Gloria Pazmino, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thousands of people are fleeing a massive wildfire in Southern California as forecasters warn of record heat over the next few days. The couple who took this video went to the mountains to escape the heat, but instead ended up near the raging Line fire.

There are multiple factors working against the firefighters, officials here telling me that the terrain is very steep and very difficult to access. I want to show you what that terrain looks like because this is an area where we saw some of the hot spots.And in this area, you see how difficult it is for some of these firefighters to get into this area. It is steep, and they either have to walk in in some of the areas, or I was told by CAL FIRE that you have to fly in the firefighters to certain areas of the fire because it is so difficult to access. You see how they're slipping as they're trying to get down the hill. The other factor of this is the weather, triple-digit temperatures and even overnight temperatures in the 80s, so there is no break for these firefighters. There's also thunderstorms expected in this area, so because you have these thunderstorms, yes, you may have rain that may help this fire, but you also have the possibility of lightning. That starts new fires, and then with the storm also come winds that are unpredictable and that move the flames into areas where the firefighters cannot predict and cannot know where to put their crews, so that also makes it extremely difficult for them. So CAL FIRE saying they're cautiously optimistic about the next couple of hours, maybe the next couple of days, because there is still a lot of work to be done here.

Right now the center is kind of disorganized, but if you look at where it's sitting in parts of the Gulf of Mexico, you've got ocean temperatures there that are incredibly warm, nearing the low 90s. And if you look at its path that it could take as it heads towards the U.S. Gulf Coast, it's going to take this rise through some very warm ocean temperatures in the middle 80s, even in some upper 80s.So what that's going to do is help it organize and strengthen pretty quickly, especially as we head into the work week. We could be looking at some tropical storm force conditions along the Texas coastline as early as late Tuesday, and then this thing could ride the coastline towards Louisiana as we go into Wednesday, bringing with it the threat for some heavy rain, some storm surge, and rough surf as well. When we look at recent named storms that have made landfall in this part of the country, I mean, we had Beryl make landfall over the Texas coastline just a couple of months ago this season, and it brought some power problems to parts of Houston. We also had Ida in 2021, Beta and Hanna in 2020. But when you look at hurricanes, the last time that Texas had two hurricanes make landfall in one season was 2008, 16 years ago, Ike and Dolly. So if this does, in fact, become Hurricane Francine and make landfall on the Texas coastline, this will be the first time in 16 years that Texas has seen two hurricanes in one season. Whether it's a hurricane, a tropical storm, no matter what it's called, it will bring some heavy rain to parts of the Texas and Louisiana coastline. Forecasters are already worried about 4 to 8 inches of rain that could grow to 12 inches in some localized areas. So flash flooding is going to be a great concern as we go into the work week.

On Sunday, he stopped his truck, however. He then exited and started shooting. As we know, three civilians, three border crossing employees, were killed in that event, and then a guard shot the gunman dead. Now, we have heard from the Jordanian Ministry of Interior. They say they're carrying out an investigation, but they also believe that he worked alone, that there were no accomplices that allowed him to do this. The family themselves say that they are shocked at what happened, but the brother did mention his anger about the war in Gaza, saying he believes what was happening in Gaza may have been a motivating factor in his brother's decision to carry out this attack. Now, those crossings were closed instantly. There were three between Jordan and Israel, one that goes into the West Bank. And we also heard from the Israeli prime minister condemning what had happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We are surrounded by a murderous ideology led by Iran's axis of evil. In recent days, loathsome terrorists have murdered six of our hostages in cold blood and three Israeli police officers. The killers do not distinguish between us. They want to murder us all until the last one, right and left, secular and religious, Jews and non-Jews. What prevents the elimination of our people as in the past is the strength of the state of Israel and the strength of the Israel Defense Forces.
