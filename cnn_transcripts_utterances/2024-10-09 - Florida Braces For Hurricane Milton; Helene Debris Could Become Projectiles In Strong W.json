Right now, Milton is back to a rare category five strength in the Gulf of Mexico and while experts predict it may weaken before landfall. They also expect it to double in size.

I have never heard such blunt language from Tampa's mayor ever before, and I've covered many storms.They're telling people to get out. Please heat our warnings debris. That's also a huge concern. Getting it out of the neighborhoods. You're looking at gusts up to 150 miles per hour here in Tampa, those are become flying projectiles, extremely dangerous. But then you have Tampa General Hospital where I'm at right now, Davis islands, that's a neighborhood of Tampa. This is the region's only level one trauma center. They cannot evacuate. They're too big, too specialized. The patients that they have are too sick. So, what do they do? They put millions of dollars in tools like this. This is the aqua fence that they have bolted down to the ground. It can withstand storm surge in different parts, different heights up to 15 feet high. We're anticipating 10 to 15 feet here in the Tampa Bay. But look at this. This is why it's so serious. They're on a manmade island. Look at this. I could throw a rock right over to the Hillsborough Bay. This is the first time this season by Helene that the Aqua fence has been tested and waters did reach right up there. It withstood.

He also says Israel is using the same means and methods of warfare in both conflicts.Well, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has forced tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes in the north of the country. And it's destroyed Lebanese villages along the border. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Serene and picturesque. It's what Al Mashhad once was. Today, much of this Lebanese border village lies in ruins. The destruction is horrific, says Hana Zarov (ph). Homes in Al Mashhad are destroyed, completely devastated by strikes. The face of the entire areas changed. He says war hit his village long before most were paying attention. It began on October 8th when Hezbollah launched attacks against Israel under the banner of solidarity with Gaza, sparking a year of tit for tat cross border attacks. Homes in Al Mashhad were destroyed. Almost its entire population, including local official Zardo (ph) was forced to flee. The border conflict has now expanded to all-out war. The last 10 days, no one can imagine the level of brutality, Hana says. They began using different weapons against the village whenever there is an air strike now it destroys a whole neighborhood, five to six homes destroyed at the same time. Hana thought like previous wars, the Christian village would be spared the worst of the violence. He believes its strategic position right on the border, overlooking Israel, has turned it this time into a battlefield for both sides and its people are paying the price. Like 90-year-old Um Jamil, she was too old to leave, killed late last month in an Israeli strike on her home. Hana, like many of his generation has seen every war in Lebanon since the 1970s. He says the Israeli onslaught in recent weeks is like nothing he'd seen before. He doesn't name Hezbollah but he questions those who started this war. Was that banner of solidarity with Gaza worth all the pain, destruction and displacement? He asks. Now we talk about help for Lebanon and have forgotten that solidarity. Hana and his wife Sarad (ph) show us what's left of the neighborhood where they grew up. When these homes were hit, I felt like a part of my childhood is gone, Sarad says. The memories are gone. It was all erased in an instant. The pain is unbearable. It hurts so much. Aalma El Chaeb is now a ghost town. The last of its residents have now fled. Their livelihood, these agricultural lands, olive trees gone. The big question is, will we ever return to our homes? Will we ever go back to our village? Hana says. Will we rebuild it again, and who will rebuild it? If this had stopped 10 days ago, maybe, but now, with this level of destruction and devastation war has spread far beyond their small village. Home now the mountains above Beirut. What will become of their village and their country has never been so uncertain. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Beirut. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean, really focusing on making each of these different audiences, young women, black men, younger men, which is the stern audience, and of course, kind of working-class, middle-class women in The View feel that they can relate to her personally in a way they can't with Trump.And I think that's a way of trying to get at her response on the economy, right? I mean, if you ask people who they trust more on the economy in a macro sense, they say Trump. If they ask who -- if you ask who you care, who cares more about people like you, who is trying to improve your family's life, Harris does much better. And I think by and large, that's what she's going at in these -- in these media appearances. I did not think that was a great moment for her. I'm surprised she didn't have an answer ready to something to the effect of, obviously, there have been some, but I'm not going to kind of air our internal conversations here in public. I do think overall, The View appearance was the best one of the four by far for her. It was pretty close to pitch perfect in terms of both the policy agenda, in terms of Medicare, creating Medicare program for home -- health care for seniors. But also, that personal relatability and the creating an ability for working class moms to see her as someone who would get their lives because she's lived something like it herself.
