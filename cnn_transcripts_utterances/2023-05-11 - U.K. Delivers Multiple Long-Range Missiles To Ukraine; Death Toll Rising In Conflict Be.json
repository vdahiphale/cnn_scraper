Tonight, Ukraine finally gets its wish for long-rage cruise missiles with a shipment from the U.K. Could this be a game- changer on the battlefield? Then no sign yet of a ceasefire between Israel and militants in Gaza as the death toll rises after days of violence. We are live for you in Jerusalem. Plus, just hours to go until the end of America's Title 42 border policy. We'll explore what this means for those seeking asylum in the U.S. But first tonight, Ukraine's president says it's not quite the time to begin the long-awaited counteroffensive against Russian forces. Mr. Zelenskyy telling the \"BBC\", Ukraine is still waiting on deliveries of western weapons, armored vehicles and air defense systems from its western allies. And he says timing is key. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator):  Yes, we're still expecting some things. They will reinforce our counteroffensive. And most importantly, they will protect our people. We're expecting armored vehicles. They arrive in batches. We can advance with what we've got, and I think we can be successful. But we will lose a lot of people. I think that is unacceptable. We need to wait. We need a bit more time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Ukrainians had beenasking for some time for the capability to reach deep into the Russian lines and try to break the back of the logistics chain in Russia. This weapon can do that. It's long-range, no doubt, but the Brits would have demanded from Ukraine an undertaking that it would never be used against Russian territory. That would be seen as a significant escalation. But there are plenty of targets it can hit at range inside Russian-held Ukraine. So, that is a step forward from the Ukrainian perspective. The sort of step-forward, once that becomes operational, that would be very significant in prosecuting this offensive that Mr. Zelenskyy is saying is not yet quite ready to be launched. But that is not necessarily meaning that the Russians aren't making their own precautions. That includes plans, perhaps, to evacuate even the nuclear experts that they've imported into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station when they captured it last March. This is what the head of the Ukrainian nuclear industry said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They are also conducting -- this is the Russians, a counteroffensive operations, particularly with artillery hitting a large number of Ukrainian villages on the other side of that frontline. And as you rightly point out there in Bakhmut, recently, in the last 48 hours, the Ukrainians seem to have exploited poor communications at the very least between different elements within the Russian Armed Forces and the Wagner Mercenary Group, Isa, to make some significant gains there.",

So let's not give any credence to anything he might say, unless it's coincident with what his enemies agree is happening on the ground. Now, what they both agree on is that, there have been some significant gains made by Ukraine on the western and southern flanks of Bakhmut. Now, his reasons for explaining that away can be discounted, because he is a notorious figure. But what we are seeing though, agreement from him that these gains made by Ukraine have occurred. Who's to blame for them? He blames the Russian military machinery for failing to provide his men with enough artillery, and indeed, accuses various Russian units of cowardice. As far as the Ukrainians concerned and their own report is on the ground, agree on this, there doesn't seem to be any reduction in the amount of artillery being fired by the Russians against Ukrainian targets. If anything, the Ukrainians are reporting an uptick in artillery use along that area of the frontline in the east. So, I think that Prigozhin frankly is getting too much publicity. He's a big player in all of this, and may well now be one that is being effectively, militarily, if not, sidelined and potentially crushed. Isa?",

The controversial COVID-era rules are set to expire in just under 10 hours or so. Some are downplaying concerns about a surge in migration, but video from earlier today shows people being loaded onto vehicles by officials in Texas, and many communities are bracing for a wave of new arrivals. That's on top of course, of those already camped out on both sides of the border. Title 42 was launched, if you remember, back in 2020 as the U.S. struggle to stop COVID-19. It lets authorities expel migrants on the border in the name of public health, often, depriving them of their chance to claim asylum. But Title 42 carried few legal consequences. So if migrants were pushed back, they could try to cross again. Once Title 42 ends, the U.S. returns to Title 8. The U.S. Homeland Security Secretary has warned that Title 8 will carry more severe consequences. CNN's Nick Valencia is live at the U.S.-Mexican border in Brownsville in Texas.

So what you're looking at here are family members that are waiting for their loved ones that they have no idea where they are right now, Isa. These are mostly Venezuelan nationals, people that are fleeing the crisis, the dictatorship, they say, of President Maduro there, and they're showing up on the streets of Brownsville. And this morning, when we got here, there were dozens and dozens of migrants sleeping on the streets. That's because this respite center, this respite center run by team Brownsville, which is the main nonprofit here that helps out migrants, is just completely overwhelmed. For the last two weeks, they've been taking in 800 to a 1,000 migrants. Yesterday, they took in 902, that included more than 50 children. And we've seen children on the streets here with their parents in some cases, waiting for their fathers or their mothers that they've been separated from. And this is sort of the epicenter of the action, because I want to show you, as we walk over here, just off in the distance is the bus station. So migrants stay here, sleeping on the streets in some cases to collect enough money to move on to their next destinations. We also know though that the city of Brownsville is working with these NGOs to help get migrants to six main destinations, include Chicago, Brooklyn, Houston, Dallas, among others, Miami. All those cities are being requested by migrants to get help to get to. And the city is going to chip in with the work of buses and airlines in cooperation with them. Speaking to the mayor last night, he says they are as prepared as they can be here in Brownsville, reminding us that they've been dealing with this immigration issue really for decades. It's been on the frontline of this. The mayor saying this is -- in some cases, business as usual, that Title 42 may bring an influx of migrants, but that's yet to be seen.

Unfortunately, over the past few years, the asylum system has had an increasingly long backlog and wait for decisions in those cases. And in our system, there are no supports for asylum seekers federally who are going through the asylum process. And they also are not able to work until six months after filing their asylum application. This creates considerable difficulties for asylum seekers, who are just trying to survive while waiting for their case to be decided. And those delays are really devastating for refugees who have been separated from their family members. They can't petition to reunite with them in the United States until their case is finished. So having a timely process is really crucial for asylum seekers as well.

That provided them an opportunity to remain in the country, to have a path toward permanent residence, to be able to work, to enroll their children in school, to get health care. And it was a process that's been much more efficient and much faster than putting people through what has proved to be, in the U.S., a much slower asylum process.
