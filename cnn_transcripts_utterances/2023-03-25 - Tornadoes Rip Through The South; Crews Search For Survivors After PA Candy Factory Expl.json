The mayor of Rolling Fork, Mississippi says his city is gone. And when you see the pictures, it's painfully clear that he is not exaggerating. These were homes, neighborhoods, communities and here and elsewhere. The staggering loss of property is secondary with 25 people are now confirmed dead in Mississippi. Another person was killed in Alabama. For perspective these past 24 hours have seen more tornado deaths than all of last year. Many are just thankful to have survived. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRACEY HARDEN, OWNER, CHUCK'S DARY BARN: My community and thank God we're alive, but also we're so devastated by the loss. The whole trailer park behind the building is gone and we don't know where everybody is. We don't know who's alive and who's gone.",

What are you hearing from people?NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): It is and it's just awful to see this and we apologize for having to go live from our satellite phone. But it's a testament how much damage is here in Sharkey County and Rolling Fork, Mississippi. Cell towers have been heavily damaged here, which is why we'll not be able to go live on air. But what we're looking at here is just utter devastation, Jim. Structures that have just been reduced to rubble. One local official says that his town looks like a landfill, and it really does. There's just debris stretching out for miles here. It is really, you know, hard to say this, but it doesn't seem like any of the town really was able to escape any other damage. A lot of the structures -- most of the structures that we've seen have had significant damage to them. And just in the last several minutes, we've seen some what we believe to be cadaver dogs going through some of the harder hit sites, including the site that we brought to you last hour, which was Chuck's restaurant and diner here, a sort of staple here, a gathering point for the local community that has just been devastated. It's gone. Looking at it right now. There's a car flipped upside down on top of the debris. We've seen cars up in trees, telephone poles that have been snapped like toothpicks. And talking to the tornado survivors here looking in their eyes there's this look of shell shock. Earlier, I spoke to Ernest Hall, who tells me that he went through the storm last night. He was actually asleep. He works, you know lots of hours and he was asleep in his home when he was woken up and went actually to a trailer park that was hard hit and started rescuing family members. He said along with two friends, he rescued six people. Unfortunately one of the people that he was hopeful was alive, his mother in law. He found her body, he said. Earlier, he spoke to me about his experience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

On Friday, a federal judge ordered some former Trump aides to testify, including the former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, as criminal investigations are underway into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. There's also a state criminal investigation underway on the same issue in Georgia.All this comes as Trump's own defense attorney was hauled back to testify about classified documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and there's the possibility, of course, of an indictment involving the alleged hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels. CNN Zachary Cohen joins us now. Zach, it's hard to keep up, but let's start with your new reporting on the election investigation. What can you tell us? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Jim. We're learning about this (INAUDIBLE) decision that was made by a federal judge in that case involving Trump and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This happened under seal, but we're hearing from our sources that the judge decided that several Trump aides including Mark Meadows, have to come in and testify before the grand jury. Now Trump wanted to block them from testifying about certain topics, including conversations that they had with him. But you know this judge's decision, it does mean that they will ultimately most likely have to come in and testify. The Trump team is planning to appeal the decision. That's what we're hearing from our sources, but he's appealed similar decisions in the past without much success, so the expectation is that they will likely have to come in and testify before the grand jury before this is all said and done. And what about the latest in the Mar-a-Lago case, or developments there as well? It's been a busy few days for Jack Smith. This is, of course, the other criminal investigation that he's overseeing. And you know, Trump's own defense attorney in the Mar-a-Lago case, had to come in and testify before the grand jury. And a few days before that happened. It was the expectation set by a judge that he would have to answer questions, which is rare in a criminal case like this. And so the grand jury wants to hear more about the interactions between Trump's legal team and the federal government leading up to the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago, right. And so they want to know why more classified documents were found there after the legal team said to the best of their knowledge that there weren't any more so the expectation is he was asked and had to answer questions about that.",

You can still run for president and be president, even if you've been convicted of this type of offense. So I think a lot of people don't understand that. Now, of course there would be logistical complications. There could be the trial going on the same night as a debate or a primary. Who knows? And the political calculation, I guess I'll leave that to our political experts. On the one hand people seem to say that could rally support and fundraising. On the other hand, I think at a certain point voters look at a candidate and say, do we really want to vote for somebody who's under the threat -- who is under indictment, let's say hypothetically. It seems to me that would drag down someone's political support, but we'll leave that for you know, for the Jeff Zelenys and the political experts of the world.",

They were unwilling immigrants, but they were immigrants nonetheless.And the other subliminal message, as you know from the analysis we did of your DNA, which is quite fascinating, very, very extraordinarily rich and comfortable is that at the level of the genome, no matter how apparently different we are, no matter our (INAUDIBLE) differences, we are 99.99 percent the same.
