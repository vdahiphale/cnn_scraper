This, as those leaders have announced new sanctions on Russia, as the war in Ukraine drags on.We're live there on the ground in Ukraine and in Japan at the G7 . It's all ahead right here on CNN News Central. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivering a speech at the Arab League Summit this morning calling for support amid Russia's war. Zelenskyy has a big diplomatic weekend ahead of him. He started his day in Kyiv before traveling to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We're told he's set to meet with the Crown Prince at some point. He then heads to Japan to participate in the G7 Summit where global leaders just announced a new round of sanctions against Russia. Support from the group of seven is critical, and this morning Biden and the other leaders vowed to help Ukraine for as long as it takes.

Russia is facing aggression from NATO.But what Zelenskyy has told them today, those gathered Arab leaders is, look, it's our country. A third of it has been taken by Russia at this time. It's our children that Russia is taking and stealing to their country at this time. So really, he's just trying to interrupt the Putin's narrative and explain to potential friends and partners. And in Saudi Arabia, he's sees that as a potential ally here, a supporter, a country that's providing huge amount of humanitarian support and potentially further support in the future. When he gets to the G7, it's a different message. He will be sitting down there with the leaders that he knows are the ones that control the military fate of his army because they have the weapons that he wants. He wants more ammunition. He wants those fighter jets. And we heard from the European Council President today, European Council President Charles Michel in Japan today saying that the F-16s, the fighter jets Zelenskyy wants, will be getting discussion that we've heard just this week. The British and the Dutch Prime Ministers at a meeting of European leaders in Iceland have said they will form an initiative to help get those F-16s to the Ukrainians and help train their fighter pilots too. Zelenskyy's officials feel that he needs to be there in the room face- to-face with the G7 leaders to put his best persuasive case forward for this better, stronger support.",

The sanctions regime that has been put in place, driven by the G7 leaders and their finance operations over the course of the last year and a half have been critical to cutting off Russia's ability to maintain its war effort, and yet they have still consistently found gaps or ways around many of those sanctions.And that's a critical piece of the sanctions that will be announced later today that is trying to tackle the evasion. The ways around the Russia has had to maintain its defense industrial capacity, or at least maintain some semblance of that capacity. What you were going to see is a new effort to basically block all exports for tools, machinery, technology that feeds into that defense industrial capacity in the U.S., in particular, will be blocking 70 entities, putting them on the Commerce Department blacklist. [09:05:14] Another 300 entities will be slapped with sanctions. So continuing to expand into some degree evolve on a sanctions effort that has been underway since the first day of the invasion. Obviously, the Defense capabilities, the lethal assistance are a central part of these discussions as they try and map out how things will move forward here. Obviously, the G7 support has been a cornerstone of the Western democracies that have really stood behind in a very steadfast manner. Ukraine throughout the course of this conflict that -- and when we talk to U.S. officials, they make clear that has to be maintained, that has to continue. And the sanctions piece is a critical element along with that lethal assistance and economic aid. Now, keep in mind, Sara, President Biden throughout the course of this day, also focused on what's going on back home. The debt limit debate is still very much underway. Negotiations behind the closed doors from the president's top negotiators and House Republicans for several hours yesterday. The president this morning here was briefed by his negotiating team before starting his day. He also left the dinner of the leaders, a working dinner of leaders here at the summit early in order to be briefed once again by his negotiators. So a balancing act here, a lot of juggling going on, but two very consequential issues at a very consequential moment for both, Sara.",

These brigades, battalions have been training all over Europe at Grafenwohr (ph), Drawsko Pomorskie in Poland and other places. So there's an integration process to get them from those European countries to the frontline. That takes a long time and a lot of effort. Coordination through commanders, ensuring the training is good.Once that happens, though, and I think that's about to happen in my view, you're talking about -- and we use this map all the time. I just point out that this is a 400 -- about 400-kilometer front. So that's a couple of 100 miles. It's easy to draw on a map. It's easy to draw big circles and arrows. It's a whole lot tougher to conduct an offensive. So when you are seeing an offensive taking place, you're going to see not only what's going on in Bakhmut and the cities surrounding them being attacked, but I believe you're going to see the Ukrainians going into the south where the critical point, Russia has been supplying Ukraine through this supply line that goes across two provinces, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, as well as up from Crimea. If the Ukrainians can cut those logistics lines, they have a better chance, but that's going to be tough.",

That number you just mentioned is a key metric. It was at anywhere from 200 to 300, just a week -- a few weeks ago.But now my city source is telling me that that goes up to 600. In fact, on Monday, they received as many as 900 in just one day. Hence, the need to open this asylum-seeker arrival center, which is the hotel that you see here over my shoulder, it's serving in two separate ways. One, it will be one of the main first stops for these asylum seekers who arrive by bus in New York City, where they will be in touch with not only city officials, but also some of the nonprofits that have really been at the front lines of helping. But also will serve as shelter for some of those families with children. We know that it has a capacity of about 175 rooms. They hope that this will be scaled up to about 850 very soon. That really what this does, it just speaks to those ongoing efforts on behalf of New York City officials to try to find some space for these asylum seekers as they are still trying to plead with other council members to look in their districts for any potential facilities that might possibly house them. In fact, by the end of June, there is an expectation that houses of worship in New York City will open up their doors, those that are willing to, for at least 19 asylum seekers per house of worship.

They're concerned about his waffling on whether he would support Ukraine and whether this Russia is in the right in this war. And so, he has taken a more direct role in assuring these donors that he has a strategy to beat Trump and that strategy is to say, look, I am much more electable, especially in the states that are going to matter in the presidential contest against Joe Biden. Listen to what he told those donors according to the New York Times. He said, \"You have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing. Biden, Trump and me, two have a chance to get elected president -- Biden and me, based on all the data in the swing states\". So not only is he clearly saying, look, it's between me, Trump, and Biden, in a way that just totally dismisses the other Republican candidates in the field. But he's saying Trump can't get elected, and that's not necessarily surprising to hear that from a candidate who's trying to curry support. But DeSantis has really avoided going directly at Trump throughout most of this run up to his campaign.
