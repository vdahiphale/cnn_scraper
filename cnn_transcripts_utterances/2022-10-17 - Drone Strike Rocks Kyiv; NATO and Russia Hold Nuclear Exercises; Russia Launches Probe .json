      "sentences": "Good morning, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga.We are following several developing stories for you this morning. First, if Ukraine, another brutal wave of Russian attacks across Kyiv. Explosions heard across the capital as civilians urged to shelters as Russia launched a barrage of kamikaze drone attacks on Monday. At least three people were killed in the strikes, including a pregnant woman. Those attacks part of a wider assault involving drones and cruise missiles that Ukrainian officials said once again targeted critical infrastructure, cutting power in some areas. And in China, Xi Jinping heads into an unprecedented third term as the leader of the ruling community party. In his address, Xi bluntly threatened to seize control of Taiwan by force if necessary. That line receiving the biggest applause of Xi's two-hour speech. We'll have more on that speech in just a moment. But, first, let's begin with the latest wave of attacks on Kyiv. Our reports are standing by. Let's begin with CNN's Clarissa Ward, is in Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv. And, Clarissa, I want to talk more about these attacks, but first I want our viewers to take a look at what you actually saw firsthand this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Among the dead, an elderly woman, but also a young couple. The wife apparently six months pregnant. Emergency services were able to rescue at least 19 people, and those efforts have been ongoing. Some of those rescue workers themselves have ended up in the hospital.But we spoke to the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, who said that this is clearly an attack on civilians and civilians' way of life and on civilian infrastructure because that area, Bianna, is an area that has been hit quite hard both today, with these kamikaze drone strike attacks, but also last week when there was that barrage of missiles that slammed into Kyiv last Monday. The apparent target, a power plant right around there. A lot of buildings in the area appear to have been damaged. It's not clear yet whether there has been any significant damage to the power plant itself. But the clear goal here for the Russians is to try to destroy crucial civilian infrastructure, like power plants, like heating plants, like electricity plants, as we go into the winter and temperatures begin to plunge. The mayor saying to us, however, that rather than being cowed, the people of Kyiv are not panicking, they're just more angry and resolved to fight, Bianna.",

They are Iranian- made drones.We have heard from Ukraine's foreign minister today who has called for sanctions against Iran for supplying these weapons because they are, absolutely, Bianna, having a devastating effect because they fly so low, because it is much more difficult for air defense systems to intercept them. [09:05:14] And this is why you're seeing also this renewed call from Ukraine's leaders to the international community to supply more sophisticated and more substantive air defense because the arrival of the Shahed drone in the battle space, which has been roughly a month, but today, for the first meaningful way, here in Kyiv, does seem to portend a new, grim chapter in this war, Bianna.",

We will follow that development for you.Clarissa Ward, thank you. Well, as Russia's escalation continues, both Russia and NATO are set to hold separate long-planned exercises of nuclear forces. CNN's Barbara Starr is at the Pentagon. So, Barbara, what should we expect when it comes to these nuclear forces exercises and is there any intel at all that Russia's movements will be anything but routine given the state of war today?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is the big concern at the Pentagon, of course, what Russia may actually do and how much the U.S. will be able to anticipate and gather the intelligence about it.But, first up, today actually, NATO, 14 nations, including the U.S., kicking off their annual nuclear exercise. It's called Steadfast Noon. They will fly about 60 aircraft throughout Europe. They will stay 600 miles from the Russian border, a clear signal that this is simply a training exercise. No live munitions on board. The idea is, including B-52s from the U.S., you fly these aircraft that are the nuclear deterrent aircraft. If it comes to that and you make sure everything works properly. This is an exercise that NATO and the U.S. have been conducting for many years. But, at the same time, while that starts today and goes for several days, the Russians, this month, and there's only a few days left, are expecting to kick off their annual exercise, roughly translated from the Russian to be called \"thunder.\" And it is the one that the U.S. will be watching so carefully to see if the Russians actually do move nuclear weapons around within their training scenario. The expectation is that the U.S. will be able to see any movement, will be able to see if any of it is other than routine. The Russians are expected to conduct missile launches and other exercising of their strategic assets, essentially they're nuclear capable forces. So, this is something between now and the end of the month, all eyes will be on this. You know, the U.S. watches the Russian nuclear arsenal every single day, but right now, with this exercise on, extra vigilance to see what they're up to. Bianna.",

Well, right now, Chinese Leader Xi Jinping is attempting to secure an unprecedented third term, striking a nationalistic and confident tone as China's communist party gathers to choose a new - new leaders. CNN's Selina Wang joins me now from Hong Kong. Selina, it's no question who their prime leader will be and the top leader, obviously, in an unprecedented third term, will be President Xi Jinping.

      "sentences": "Well, Bianna, that two- hour speech was essentially a globing report card about how Xi's decade in power has helped China score these historic victories. And Xi's vision really boils down to this simple message, make China great again. To restore China's rightful place in what Xi Jinping thinks is its rightful place in the world. And his view is that the only way for China to get there is to increase communist party control in every part of Chinese society.And in foreign policy, while he didn't mention any other country's by name, he did make my hints to the threats from the United States. He talked about how China opposes the bullying and the hegemony from other countries. And on Taiwan, Xi Jinping said that while China aims to peacefully reunify with this self-ruled democratic island, he said China promises to never rule out the use of force. And, Bianna, in that moment, that is when you saw the greatest and loudest applause from the more than 2,000 communist party delegates in that room. What that reflects is this growing confidence and aggression in nationalism in China. And every time the U.S. tries to take China on, now, whether it's in trade technology or human rights, it plays into this view in China that it's under siege from western powers that are trying to contain China. So, that's why we should expect to see in the third term increasing tensions between the U.S. and China as China increasingly believes it doesn't need to play by American led international rules. On zero Covid, Xi Jinping also promised to double down on that strategy by saying that zero Covid is what has put Chinese lives above all else, despite the growing frustration in China that cities are still being locked down over just a handful of Covid cases. But what we're really witnessing here this week is Xi Jinping ripping up the playbook set by other modern Chinese rulers, setting himself up to be ruler for life, going from collective rule to strongman rule. So, increasingly, the fate of 1.4 billion people in China and their relationship with the world, well, it hinges on the mind of one man.",

Again, it's ballistics which linked all of these crimes and it's public tips that took us to this suspect.But when you look at somebody who is, as the place describe it, on the hunt, on a mission to kill, that definitely fits a profile of what we would call a heat in a stick thrill killer. And we don't know enough. We don't know whether the thrill or the high that he may have gotten, assuming we have the culprit, came from the hunt or from actually dispatching homeless people, because more than half of them were homeless. Five of the six, I believe, were Hispanic men. We don't know enough to know if these people were targeted because of who they were, or were simply a vulnerable population, wrong place, wrong time, easy targets for him. But the behaviors they're describing, the stalking, the predators, the wearing of the mask, the waring of the black, the driving around looking, that would definitely fit somebody who thinks that he's almost a pseudo commando.

That is textbook to a tee.But that big gap would suggest a few different things. Was he incarcerated for those 400 days? Was he in a relationship that maybe satisfied whatever was agitating him in his life that made him want to go out and hunt people? Did he have a good job? Was he out of town? There is obviously conjecture that if he was not living in Stockton for those 400 days, he may have been in an entirely different location and shooting people elsewhere. So, you can be sure police are going to look at all of these possibilities, all of these options and use ballistics to try to figure out if he could be responsible for killings elsewhere. We know they're looking at Chicago. They don't think he's responsible for those. But they are going to do a nationwide analysis to see if there are unsolved crimes, shootings, that might be linked to this man.",
