Contrary to Schumer's words, the Israeli public supports a total victory over Hamas and opposes the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry again accuses Israel of targeting people waiting for food aid after a deadly incident on Thursday. At least 20 people are reported killed, more than 150 wounded. Hospitals are struggling to deal with the volume and types of injuries coming through their doors. Witnesses say the aid distribution site was hit by what sounded like tank or artillery fire. Israel's military denies it was responsible for the attack and says it's quote, \"assessing the incident\". Well, let's bring in CNN's Scott McLean live this hour in Istanbul. Well Scott, we will get to those dramatic scenes in Gaza. But first, the reaction, I guess, in Israel to Chuck Schumer's comments.

And we have heard precious little about that ship since then.Most of the crew members, 17 of them are Filipinos. And we spoke to the Filipino diplomat who is responsible for negotiations with the Houthis, who essentially said that there is not much to negotiate at this stage except for the decent treatment of the hostages, because there is no indication that the Houthis are going to turn over these crew members or the ship, less importantly, obviously, until this war is over. And in fact, he said that there are indications that they may ask for some kind of an international recognition of their legitimacy inside Yemen before they will turn anyone over. Now, we asked the Houthis for comment on this directly yesterday, and we finally got a response. And they said that actually the ship and its crew, and I'm quoting, \"are in the hands of the brothers in the Hamas resistance movement and the Al Qasem brigades. We have no claims of our own regarding this vessel\". Now, just to clarify, there are no Hamas fighters physically in control of this vessel, but they have turned over essentially the decision-making and the responsibility for the crew to Hamas. So, this obviously complicates things. It adds one more actor into the mix there in what is already a complicated situation.

A spokesperson for the Secretary General says it will take years to clear unexploded ordnances and the nearly 23 million metric tons of debris. For now, humanitarian groups say airdrops in the planned maritime corridor are simply not getting enough aid into Gaza. A top European Union official and the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council say Israel must open more land routes. The US military says it could take up to 60 days to build a floating pier off the Gaza coast to bring in supplies. Well joining me now from Jerusalem is Shaina Low, Communications Advisor for the Norwegian Refugee Council. Great to have you with us. Let's start with the attack on this group waiting for food aid in Gaza City that killed 20, injured over 150. The IDF is denying responsibility. What are you learning? SHAINA LOW, COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER, NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL: You know, we don't have any operations in northern Gaza, so it's really difficult for us to discern who is responsible and who isn't responsible. But what is clear is that there have been far too many of these incidents where desperate Palestinian civilians seeking out aid and assistance in order to survive. People are quite literally starving to death in northern Gaza, are continuously coming under attack and dying while trying to seek out aid, whether it's being shot at these quarters or whether it is airdrops not having their parachutes come out and land and kill people. Far too many people are dying in Gaza. We have over 31,000 reported dead already in the last five plus months. And we really need to stress that all parties need to ensure that there's deconfliction and that it's working, that humanitarians can safely access Palestinians throughout all of Gaza who are in desperate need and that those coming to distribution points in search of aid and assistance will be protected as well.",

I think it's a clear sign of how desperate the situation is when Israel's strongest ally, the United States, resorts to airdrops because it's clear not enough aid is getting in. We desperately need aid to be scaled up. The most efficient, fastest and cost-effective way to do that is for Israel to allow more aid through the land crossings. There are hundreds of trucks waiting in Egypt to enter Gaza with the aid that could help save people's lives, and it's just waiting there.

So President Putin securing what he will at least say is a new mandate support from the Russian people to keep going will signal that Russia isn't going to stop here, that its goals are not just to sort of freeze the front lines where they are in place and to consolidate where they have territory, but also to move beyond that. And I think the big question, certainly for the Russian people, is will there be another wave of mobilization? We know that Russia likes to use sort of waves of men in this war, that manpower has been incredibly important. But of course, the wave of mobilization that we saw in the autumn of 2022 was incredibly controversial and led to a mass exodus of Russian men, which is something that Russia at the moment cannot afford to do.

James Crumbly convicted of four counts of involuntary manslaughter and taken together with the case of his wife.This represents a major moment for prosecutors. It is the first time that prosecutors have been able to hold the parents of children who kill directly responsible for those murders. The prosecutors really drilled in on two major concepts. And the first was that James Crumbly should have seen, should have known that Ethan Crumbly had declining mental health, but instead he ignored all of these warning signs. Meanwhile, he purchased him a firearm. He took him to the gun range. And further, he did not act in a way that was responsible with this firearm. Specifically, he failed to secure it properly. So those were some major pieces of evidence that prosecutors brought forward. The defense, meanwhile, argued that James Crumbly had no knowledge of his son's severe declining mental health, had no knowledge that he was posing a risk to himself or others. The defense in their closing argument said over and over, he simply did not know that James Crumbly had this potential to be so violent. James Crumbly faces 15 years for each manslaughter charge. But the way the Michigan law is set up is that those sentences are to run concurrently. So the maximum time he faces in prison is 15 years. His wife, Jennifer Crumbly, convicted on the same charges. She also faces a maximum of 15 years in prison. She is set to be sentenced April 9th. Meanwhile, their son, Ethan, has been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. We don't yet know what piece of evidence it was that pushed jurors in the direction of a conviction, but it is hard to overstate the significance here.

Chuck Schumer says Mr. Netanyahu has lost his way, allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of the country. CNN's Manu Raju has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he took to the Senate floor and called for a new leadership, new elections in Israel, after for many years aligning himself, siding with Bibi Netanyahu and even going as far back as 2015 when Barack Obama tried to sell Congress on the Iran nuclear deal.Chuck Schumer was one of its leading opponents, siding with Netanyahu at the time, who came and addressed a joint meeting of Congress and urged for that plan not to move forward. But nevertheless, things have changed, particularly the way this war has been waged. There's been growing anger within the Democratic caucus and among Democratic voters across the country about everything that has gone on, the lack of humanitarian relief going to the Gaza Strip, as well as growing calls for an immediate ceasefire. Now, Schumer went and made his separate calls, calling for a new leadership altogether here, calling Netanyahu an obstacle for peace. And that prompted a sharp response on both sides of the aisle, as even some Democrats who have been aligned with Schumer for some time are open to what he is saying, but Republicans are furiously pushing back. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I think the current prime minister has to perhaps rethink some of his approaches, especially on humanitarian aid, which I think has to be done more robustly than he has encouraged so far. I think there are reasons that Israelis might want a different leader. And I think Senator Schumer has raised some of those reasons very powerfully and forcefully.",

That's tied up in a larger aid package that passed the Senate last month. But the House is not acting on it because it includes aid to Ukraine. There's divisions within the House GOP about moving forward aid to Ukraine. But the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, did indicate that he is interested in moving on a standalone Israel bill soon. But he's already tried to do that.He failed to get enough votes to do that. He may try again under a different procedure that would require a simple majority support in the United States House. But he has had so many hardships governing in a razor-thin House majority. It's unclear if that would be able to pass the House. And it almost certainly would not pass the Senate. Given the divisions within the ranks, particularly in the Democratic ranks over Israel, calls to cut off aid to Israel among some progressives, and somewhat conditions on any aid to Israel, all are going to be intensified now in the aftermath of Schumer's comments.

Now, despite those numbers, on Wednesday, the Florida governor's office announced more than 250 law enforcement officers and members of the National and State Guard will be deployed to southern Florida in anticipation of more Haitian migrants arriving. As for the situation on the ground in Haiti, sources tell CNN that armed men attacked the home of Haiti's national police director. We're told that they ransacked and set fire to the place. It's unclear if anyone was hurt. Now, CNN has also learned the country's airport could soon reopen. We're told repairs in areas that gang members broke through last month are almost complete and that 150 Haitian police and military officers are guarding the grounds. Now, exactly when air traffic could reopen is unclear. It is also unclear if outgoing Prime Minister Ariel Henry will return to the country after agreeing to resign on Tuesday. His office told CNN that Haiti's constitution states that only he and his cabinet can appoint a council for the transition of power. Carlos Suarez, CNN, Miami. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
