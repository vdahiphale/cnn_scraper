And so the federal government has said they're going to come in. We know that the Army Corps of Engineers is sending more than 1,000 personnel to start work on getting this bridge rebuilt. And officials, they didn't really want to talk about hope that yesterday, Kasie, they really wanted to stay focused on the search and rescue, but things are obviously evolving today. There are major implications are we know that a lot of those ships are going to move to other ports. They've already been heading further south into Virginia and there could be serious economic impacts here. Officials talk about that yesterday. The amount of cars that come off the line off some of these ships here at the port in Baltimore, it's one of the biggest in the country. So, yeah, major, major issues there.",

JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  We've had one might call it a rash of universal injunctions or vacancies. And this case seems like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule or any other federal government action.

It's also used extensively in health care around women who are dealing with miscarriages, women who are dealing with tragedies later on in a pregnancy where they need to find a safe as possible way to wind their way through that.I think one of the big picture themes is that the fall of Roe via Dobbs has sewn unintended consequences across the country and that is something the Democrats have been able to point to, to say, look, they open the door to all of this and now, there are major questions about whether women in Louisiana, for example, can be cared for appropriately, just while they're pregnant.

We've now seen the increased frequency of cases and legal entanglements surrounding abortion rights, and reproductive freedom, following the Dobbs decision.And this was something that the justices said themselves. It was in that conquered opinion. I don't recall which of the conservative justices it was who said next, were going to be looking at contraceptives. Next could be marriage equality. Next could be looking at those other cases. It's sort of opened the floodgates to having these challenges. Now, when you talk about it from a political aspect, again, Democrats have done a really good job of messaging on these issues. We saw it in 2022. We're already seeing it now. Republicans have an exactly figured out how to make gains on it. So I think that, you know, Republicans want to protect these rights.

So, we'll expect those to move in between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. this morning, coastal flood advisory still in effect, high tide this morning around 8:53 and then well start to see that reversal of the tide. Here's the Chesapeake Bay, so potential for some rip currents for the rescue operations, the recovery operations going forward. So that it consider there's the rainfall in the forecast temperatures will top out into the lower 50s for the base. So this is part of a larger storm system, bringing rain to the east coast, maybe some stronger storms today across the eastern sections of Florida, heavier rainfall into the Carolinas particularly North Carolina. And then you can see the wet weather over spreading New York all the way to Boston showers today, but more so into the day tomorrow. There's a rainfall outlook. You can see heaviest rainfall again across the outer banks and into portions of North Carolina because this low pressure continues to traverse the East Coast.
