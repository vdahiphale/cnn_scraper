Just a few minutes ago, investigators announced they've identified a victim previously known as Fire Island Jane Doe. Officials say 34-year-old Karen Vergata was working as an escort at the time of her disappearance in 1996. Now this is gruesome, her feet and legs were found along Fire Island 15 years later. Her skull was discovered on Long Island proper in Nassau County. Authorities were able to determine in 2011 through DNA testing that the legs and skull belong to the same person. CNN's Jean Casarez is with us now following these developments and a new victim named.",

Not until 2011 was there a skull that was found during the Gilgo Beach investigation. And that's when they started piecing it together to find out who this victim was.

And think about the intricate investigation into Rex Heuermann.We know that law enforcement had eyes on him since March of 2022, ultimately leading to these charges relating to the three victims and the prime suspects as a fourth, who's to say that they aren't conducting similar investigations relating to some of the other victims who are now being identified, and that there aren't other very intricate investigations on that front.

That's what needs to be argued, one prong already fulfilled, probable cause, he's already been indicted.It is a test that is commonly done. So the question is, will they get relevant evidence? And prosecutors have laid that out in a motion that they're looking for DNA to further connect it to the crimes with which he's charged, but the other part of it is, it could connect him to crimes that we have not seen yet, or to potential other victims.

There's a lot of information that the government has collected over two and a half years of this investigation, and there is going to be important constitutional issues that they're going to raise. Of course, one of the important parts of this is that the Trump team says that this is all about free speech.

And I might say, because you just had Trump's lawyer on a minute ago talking about the weakness of the charge of fraud.Remember, there's another charge that goes right along with this, which is the obstruction of governmental functions and conspiracy to obstruct your attempt to obstruct those functions. And that really is epitomized in the case of Mike Pence and his resistance to Trump's efforts to get him basically to violate his constitutional responsibilities. I would focus on that, because I think that is the one that cuts through a lot of nonsense you're hearing about how this case is going after First Amendment rights and that sort of thing. It is not it is narrowly drawn, but it is the Pence case -- the Pence part of the case I think that's the strongest of all.",

I think this could be quite a dramatic confrontation if the prosecution calls Mike Pence to the stand, which I assumed they would.And the Vice President repeats what he's apparently said to the grand jury, that is one reason I think this part of the case is so strong. Vice President Pence is a man of integrity. I think that is perfectly obvious. And, you know, Kate, you can say it's well, he said he said, if it's Mike Pence against Donald Trump, I think almost any juror in this country will know who's telling the truth.",

And every recount of that election has shown that Bush won. But what Gore did was follow the lawful procedures in Florida, to commence a recount and to engage in litigation in the Florida courts.He was ultimately defeated across the board, and he ultimately did concede. But I think the whole process showed that what Gore did, although I didn't like it, was done legally. And in fact, the indictment itself says that what Trump started out to do on the alternative elector set was a permissible legal strategy that morphed into a fraudulent effort to subvert the election. So there's no doubt that when you're given lawful alternatives to contest an election or go to court over, nobody's saying that's illegal. It's when you tried to violate the procedures for contesting the election in an effort to subvert it. That's when you have a problem. And it's that kind of behavior that Trump is accused of.",

And they say it's going to take so long for this case to go to trial. In that very court, I think that the controlling principle is that in considering what Trump did here, they've already decided that the privilege doesn't obtain and they will follow that rule very quickly.
