Kayla's murderer was an illegal alien, MS-13 gang member, among the most vicious gangs anywhere in the world. I took them out by the thousands thanks to ICE. We're going to protect ICE. Kamala wanted to defund ICE. We didn't have ICE, we'd never get anybody out. They're tough and they're smart and they love our country. But an MS-13 gang member who was apprehended by Border Patrol, but under the policy of our border czar, Kamala, he was released into the United States to kill. Tammy, please come up and say a few words, please. Thank you. Please. (APPLAUSE)",

But, no, he did not address it. He did not condemn or apologize or even acknowledge some of those really inflammatory and derogatory remarks made by other speakers on Sunday. So far, we have really heard Donald Trump kind of go through what has been a typical stump speech for him from all the rallies I have been going to, particularly over the last several weeks. The lines that he's been saying are the lines that we have been hearing repeatedly, that, yes, the economy is important, inflation is important, but we really need to talk about the border. He did address actually some of the comments about -- that we have been talking about a lot lately where Harris was asked if he is a fascist, and he said that everyone's calling him Hitler and it's unfair and that that's not the type of language that should be being used right now. So he talked about that a little bit before moving on to some other things.",

Lulu, we should point out -- and I have been listening to these remarks -- he has not apologized for what took place at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night, which continues to be an open sore for his campaign. It has damaged his campaign among Latinos. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  He has not apologized. It looks like he is not going to. They're trying to shift the conversation. This is the closing argument, by the way, that he very much wanted to make, the argument that the borders are open, which, of course, is not true, the argument that the Harris and Biden administration caused massive destruction to the economy. But you heard there that he actually said the economy is quite good. He took credit for it. But he did say that the economy is actually in a good place right now. So I'm not sure which it is.

It is not about missing children.It is about minors who are migrants who either did not show up for court hearings or did not receive notice to appear for court hearings. Now, there is a risk that people who have fallen out of contact may be vulnerable to things like trafficking. But there's no evidence that many of those people have actually been trafficked. At recent rallies, Trump has said that many are dead, their parents will never see them again. It is highly likely, experts say, that these people are alive and well, going to school, working. They're just out of contact with the authorities for various reasons. And, Jim, I will add that he also repeated some other big lies about immigration, saying that migrant gangs in Aurora, Colorado, have literally taken over the town or large portions of it. The Republican mayor of that city, Mike Coffman, has issued a statement in September saying they have not taken over the city. The problems that the gang experienced at a select few properties do not apply to the city as a whole or large portions of it. He also said that the Biden/Harris administration dropped 32,000 illegal aliens in Springfield, Ohio. That is wrong in multiple ways. First of all, the 32,000 number vastly exceeds local estimates, which are about 10,000 to 12,000. Second of all, very importantly, the Haitian community there, by and large, overwhelmingly actually, has lawful status in the country.",

I was going to withdraw, but we were withdrawing with dignity and strength and power. And we were going to keep Bagram, the big air base, because of the fact that it was so close to where China makes their nuclear weapons, one hour away. We should have kept it. And we didn't do that. But the way they withdrew, they took the soldiers out first. No, you take the soldiers out last. I went 18 months without one soldier. I spoke to Abdul, the leader of the Taliban. We went 18 months without one soldier even being shot at, no soldier being killed for 18 months. Then we left and you had this group of incompetent people take over.

With Biden, when -- when Biden made a decision, she said she was there. Oh, she was there. But the Afghanistan decision was a disaster in so many different ways. And now you take a look at it, they're right back to what they were doing before, except much worse, much worse to women. They're worse to women right now than they were even before it started. But Kamala never reached out to the family members of the warriors. And she said she was going to, but she never did. She never called anybody. And, Christy, I'd like you to come up and say a few words, please. (APPLAUSE) CHRISTY SHAMBLIN, MOTHER OF FALLEN U.S. SOLDIER:  Hi. Good afternoon. Good morning. My name is Christy Shamblin. And my daughter-in-law was Sergeant Nicole Leeann Gee. And she was killed in the botched Afghanistan exit at Abbey Gate. She was the cornerstone of a very large family. And instead of planning family gatherings and holiday meals and Christmases and baby showers, our family and thousands of other families plan outings at funeral grave sites. And that is where we as a family celebrate my daughter-in-law, at Arlington National Cemetery, because she is in the ground. Her story isn't unique to our family. She's just ours. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of wounded veterans who came home from that war who need our help and who are ignored by our current administration. President Trump demonstrates peace through strength. I know what he told the Taliban when he was negotiating with them, because I have made it my business to know. And what he said to them when he was negotiating with the Taliban, he said, I will kill you if you harm one hair on one head of an American. (CHEERING)",
