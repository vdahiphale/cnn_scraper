And, of course, this is a man who spent more than 50 years in national politics. But the stakes for this interview could not be higher.The president trying to prove two things, you heard some of it in that campaign message just a moment ago, prove that one. He can do his job right now. And number two, that he can beat Donald Trump in November. Biden's reelection campaigns as the president is going to be doing a lot of travel over the next month to try to rebuild support and confidence within his own party. He along with the first lady, Vice President Harris, and the second gentleman will go to every single battleground state in the country. Pennsylvania is up next, after Wisconsin, they'll be there on Sunday. Nevada, on the schedule for later this month. New CNN reporting those shows, party officials and key donors are far from reassured at this point. Many of them actually shifting their attention to think about whether Kamala Harris behind -- belongs at the top of the ticket. However, the vice president and her aides making it clear she is still with Biden. And also this just in, brand new reporting from \"The Washington Post\" that Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia is trying to assemble a group of Democratic senators to ask Biden to exit the race. A spokeswoman for the senator would neither confirm nor deny that reporting to \"The Post\", saying in a statement, quote, like many other people in Washington and across the country, Senator Warner believes these are critical dates for the presidents campaign, and he has made that clear to the White House. Let's begin with CNN's Arlette Saenz was in Madison, Wisconsin. So, Arlette, we heard him there, very forceful. Give us a sense of how it's been there on the ground at that campaign event.",

Everybody's kind of known Joe Biden's -- kind of miss it a little bit, but nobody wanted to -- nobody wanted to call them on it. When Joe Biden didn't take the softball interview at the Super Bowl, people were kind of whispering, wow, wonder why he's not doing that. Maybe he's off a step.

And you're going to have senators and down-ballot, you know, races and congressmen, they're going crazy because they understand they have a giant anchor around their neck named Joe Biden.

Democrats haven't figured out a way to do both yet. Why is that? HAQ: Well, I think they're looking at this ahead of where most of the electorate is right now, and Democrats are looking ahead to October and the feelings and behavior people will have as voters in October when they realized as of this moment, it is a binary choice between Biden and Trump. That's what will be on the ballot ticket, third parties, very minimal. There are options there. But we all remember the feelings of Ralph Nader tweeting earlier this weekend and folks saying, sit down, sir, you as a third party candidate has played (AUDIO GAP) or played a significant role, third- party candidate in Trump winning over Hillary. So that for Democrats, third-party candidates are definitely a challenge and why they're reminding voters, this is a choice between Biden and Trump. The Heritage Foundation has said that this 900-page document is their plan to institutionalize Trumpism. The Heritage Foundation has been an ally of the Trump administration and all four years, not (AUDIO GAP) many of the policies, but being perfectly happy when Trump himself comes under heat, he will just temporarily reverse how he feels about something. He did that on abortion, right, at one point, he wanted to put pregnant women in jail because that seemed to be the conservative trend.
