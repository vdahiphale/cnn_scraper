Breaking News tonight, Arizona adds itself to the list of states alleging that Donald Trump and his allies broke the law. A grand jury handing up an indictment outlining how 11 Republican supporters of the former president lied to Congress, allegedly acting as part of a conspiracy to commit fraud and forgery. Now, the lie is that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. That lie was memorialized on video, a video posted by the Arizona Republican Party itself. You can see here the fake electors put pen to paper and swore to fraud. The named defendants included the state's former Republican Party chair, two sitting legislators and a former United States Senate candidate. The defendants, whose names are obscured by black ink pierce Trump's most inner circle. It's Rudy Giuliani, it's Mark Meadows, Mike Roman, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Boris Epshteyn. And it's the 1927 Yankees of bogus election fraud, essentially. At the center is one man, unindicted co-conspirator number one, also known as Donald Trump, the former president of the United States. Now, the Arizona indictment is yet another blockbuster moment in a post presidency that has been historic for all the wrong reasons. And it's not the only time today, in a remarkable turn of deja vu, that we learn that the former president could have been charged with crimes in a swing state where he tried to deny the will of the voters. In Michigan, an investigator identified today that Trump was also an unindicted co-conspirator in the alleged plot to change the 2020 election. CNN Legal Analyst Elliot Williams is at the magic wall to explain more about what exactly is in this Arizona case. Elliot?",

Walking through charges at 9 different counts against 18 different individuals, some of whom will be household names and recognizable to many people, as you talked about here at the beginning of the show. What is alleged is number one, conspiracy, criminal act among a group of people, fraud and forgery of documents and information.Now, a little bit of history here, and you showed some of these videos a little bit at the top, Abby, but this is people protesting at a counting center in Maricopa County, Arizona, on Election Day, having alleged a great deal of fraud and misconduct on the part that many people turned out to not be true now. Let's talk through who actually is indicted here. These are the individuals who were the fake electors themselves. They signed their names to these fake elector certificates. And there are a number of these folks here. None of them are recognizable or household names to many people, like some of the folks we'll see in a second. Now, the actual fake elector's certificate, and I think the words you used at the top of the show were, you know, signing their names to fraud on video, this is where they signed elector's certificates, and this will all be evidence over the course of this prosecution, in effect, saying that Donald Trump won the 2020 election despite full knowledge that Joe Biden had won. And, once again, this here is evidence that was put on the Republican Party of Arizona's Twitter account, a video of these fake electors being signed. Once again, it's rare in criminal prosecutions to have evidence that is this vivid. Now, all of these people, of course, are innocent until proven guilty, but they're on video committing the act that they are alleged to have done. So, notice there's a lot of blacked out names here, and as of the point at which we got a lot of this information earlier today, a number of the names were redacted given the identities of some of the people. Now, we at CNN have identified a number of the people who are under those redactions, including Boris Epshteyn, Rudy Giuliani, top aides to the former president, Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, all attorneys around the president, and of course, referring to them specifically here. The former president is identified as unindicted co-conspirator number one, pretty specifically in the indictment, it says, used to be president of the United States. And so more will come out here as we learn where the prosecutors will go with this, Abby.",

Because shortly after Joe Biden came into office the Justice Department sort of been aggressively on the scene very, very quickly, not just dealing with the Trump world, the Trump campaign, the White House, what eventually became the federal case in Washington, but also all the fake electors.Now, some of these same people of course are unindicted co conspirators in Jack Smith's federal case. So, they may get federally indicted at some point. But we have like I think a bit of a constitutional car crash going on in this country at the moment.

But Arizona really was one of the major states, if we put sort of put our ted back in that time where there was so much activity going on to try to change the outcome of the election. So, I think a number of us who have been observing all of the cases since 2020 have been wondering whether Arizona would eventually bring something as a state case, because remember, it is the states that are responsible for administering the election. I do wonder about the timing, why it took so long, and I wonder if they perhaps are thinking about trying to demonstrate for folks in the future, sort of a deterrent effect, don't do this in a future election, because there are consequences for it.",

They surrounded this park where protesters have been gathering since about 4:30 this morning. They left one side open so people who did not want to be arrested and charged with criminal trespass could leave. You can see protesters are still there shouting, shame on you, shame on you, at the police as about the last half dozen people are being arrested. Now, earlier this morning, when campus police tried to clear some tents that were here, it got ugly. There was a lot of cussing. There were scuffles between those campus officers and the protesters. And then during the day after that, it was calm, but the crowd grew and grew. The college closed the gates. They were asking for I.D. for people coming in. They were trying to keep a lid on this. They didn't really manage it. So what you see now, though, peaceful arrests. The organizers told all of these protesters to submit peacefully to arrest. And they also all had written on their arms the number of a lawyer who will help them out. So, right now they're all being processed. The protest is still going on, but this patch of land has almost now been cleared by the LAPD and by the campus police.

He baselessly claims that Joe Biden is orchestrating this prosecution. But a New York Times op-ed in today's paper questions if the Manhattan district attorney is bending the New York law to fit a felony crime. It's titled, I thought the Bragg case against Trump was a legal embarrassment. Now, I think it's a historic mistake.The author, Jed Shugerman, argues that Alvin Bragg is stretching his jurisdiction, pushing untested legal interpretations, and bringing a case without a clear intent to defraud. So, is that a fair argument, or is it just plain wrong? Well, my panel will respond, but first, the author himself, Jed Shugerman, is here to explain his theory.

There's no state case that shows a state prosecutor using the Federal Election Campaign Act, which is really the crime that the prosecutors are alleging here, a federal election violation, a federal election federal campaign filing violation, as the basis, either directly or indirectly, for any crime.So, that is a first example of what's unprecedented here. And this is not just a coincidence. There are good reasons why a federal prosecutor has complete control over this, to the exclusion of the states for enforcing something as complicated as the federal election campaign act. That's the first one. The second problem is that there is no example of this statute that relies on an intent to defraud being such a broad general public, the idea that one would be defrauding the general public or voters. There's no precedent for using it for election interference. And the final problem is the use of this statute. Basically, what the business filing violation is a misdemeanor with intent to defraud, it becomes a felony only if the prosecutors can show an intent to commit or conceal another crime. The Trump lawyers pointed out, made an argument, that in New York there is a problem with trying to use the filing, the misfiling, to upgrade it to a felony relying on another jurisdiction. And the Manhattan D.A. could only point to two examples, neither of which is a judicial interpretation. So, it's an untested theory, those two cases, one was a guilty plea and one was a jury instruction. Neither one counts as a judge hearing an argument and ruling on it. So, those are examples of how this case -- three examples of how -- based on untested legal theories and on unprecedented applications.",

I mean, you don't like the election interference thing, but it strikes me that the whole reason that these election related laws exist is to prevent people from using their money in ways and not disclosing it to the public. I mean, the idea here is, is it not that the American public is entitled to know who is paying for what?Now, it's not to say that if Trump had not made the payment, it would have been fine, but he wanted to lie about that.

Because the technicalities and the applications of the Federal Election Campaign Act, they're so complicated with such a long history of different interpretations that it's for the Federal Election Commission and the DOJ.It's important to give credit. I mean, this is one point against Trump. Trump has claimed that this is, you know, Joe Biden do -- it's the flip of the allegation to say that it's Biden's election interference.
