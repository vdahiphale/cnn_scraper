New CNN video showing extensive fire damage in Ruidoso, New Mexico. Two wildfires that are 0 percent contained have scorched more than 20,000 acres.And a short time ago, police confirmed that a man who died in the wildfires has been identified as 60 year old Patrick Pearson. His daughter says that her dad was ready to evacuate but could not because of a broken leg. And local officials say about 8,000 people so far have evacuated. We have meteorologist Chad Myers with us. Chad, what is the latest forecast for this area?",

      "sentences": "Well, the winds aren't too bad right now, but the problem is we are in one of the worst drought situations over the entire country. We are now in that extreme to almost severe drought, and this is the problem where the ground is so dry and the land is dry, the brush is obviously now basically crisp, and now we're starting these fires. This is the issue.We will get a wind shift later on tonight with a little bit of the moisture from Tropical Storm Alberto actually makes it all the way to New Mexico, but that wind shift is going to push the fan and fires in the wrong direction back toward the firefighters, so that is always a danger, but if you push it back on land that has always burned, it already burned, that's some good news. Now there will be obviously smoke in the forecast, and that's going to be I think the forecast for the next few days until they get this out. Right now with 0 percent containment, that's a problem. Across the east, talk about the heat dome, it's still here. It's like closing your windows and shutting the car up and parking in the sun. We are just baking the ground here. Temperatures are very warm, all the way up to Maine, where the heat index is over a hundred. Look at Syracuse, feeling like 103 right now. So the main bulk of the heat is now in the Great Lakes, tomorrow farther to the northeast and into New England. This is going to be a much anticipated cool down for Boston, as we see for now, heat warnings all the way into Maine, but look at Boston by Saturday, 70. Nope, not for you DC, 99 for your weekend. And that's the air temperature in the shade. You stand in the sunshine and feel the humidity, it'll feel warmer than that -- Brianna.",

It was a potential tropical cyclone for so very long, kind of like waiting, it's like, is it really going to get there? But we knew it would make rainfall and that rain is now into parts of Texas and Mexico.Ironically, in the places that we saw Rosa Flores do all these stories the past couple of weeks about the water wars between Texas and Mexico, now we have flood watches in effect for that area and likely flood warnings. Some of the areas in Mexico, northern Mexico, may pick up 10 inches of rain as this very slow-moving storm. Not going to be a hurricane, not going to gather any strength anymore, but it's just going to take that Gulf moisture and make very heavy rainfall in places that need it. Obviously, South Texas needs the rain desperately, just need to kind of spread it out a little bit. Looks like four to six inches in many areas, I think that's going to be really the rule. It's just these purple areas here in parts of Mexico, that's greater than 10 inches in 48 hours. That's a lot of rain in a place that's already parched.",

While testifying in front of senators, the outgoing chief of the National Guard, General Daniel Hokanson, criticized the deployment of U.S. troops to the southern border, which has happened under both the Biden and Trump administrations. Here was the moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. DANIEL R. HOKANSON, CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD: There is no military training value for what we do. This is a law enforcement mission under the Department of Homeland Security. I know that we're providing additional support along there. But for our guardsmen there, they might as well be deployed to Kuwait or somewhere overseas because they're away from their families. They're doing mission sets that are not directly applicable to their military skill set. And so it increases their personal operational tempo. And that time, I think, would be better utilized building readiness to deter our adversaries. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Immediately after that incident, he helped to escort Roseboro to the locker room so that he could be taken care of.And I thought, and I still look back on that as this is one great human being right here. He could be a competitor, but at the same time, he was compassionate, and he was a human being. KEILAR: Yes, and I think that's what everyone's sort of missing today and is on their minds. He began with the Birmingham Black Barons when he was still in school. He wound up playing most of his career, of course, with the New York and then the San Francisco Giants.
