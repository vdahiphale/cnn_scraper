Air defenses ended up intercepting many of those missiles that were fired by Iran, though, I should note some did land in the central and southern parts of the country. One Iranian missile hit a school in central Israel, and this burst out of Iran is just the latest moment in a year that has been filled with many of them test new ones. Israel's warplanes assassinated Hezbollah's leader just last week, months after erasing Hamas is political leader from the battlefield, and now tonight, Israelis Prime Minister says Iran has made a mistake with this attack and is also dramatically underestimating their determination to retaliate. We have CNNs reporters posted around the globe tonight, from Tel Aviv to Beirut, even at the Pentagon, covering every single breaking development on this fast moving story. I want to start with CNN's Becky Anderson. Becky, obviously, as we're looking at all of this, the major question as it stands right now is how and when Israel is going to respond to this attack?",

The southern suburbs is where Hezbollah had a heavy presence in the past. You still have a lot of supporters of the group in the southern suburbs.So really no surprise seeing that sort of moment of celebration that they had with the Iranian attack on Israel, considering the heavy blows that the group had has incurred in recent days. But overall, the mood in this country is one of apprehension and anxiety. I mean, people are very, very concerned about what is coming next. As that attack, the Iranian attack on Israel, was unfolding, it did appear for a bit like there was a low in the air strikes that have been pretty much continuous in different parts of the country, mostly in the South, in the eastern Bakar region and here in the southern suburbs. But within hours of the attack ending in Israel, it seemed that the airstrikes resumed again, with reports coming in from southern Lebanon of intense strikes there. But here in Beirut, we began seeing evacuation orders being posted by the IDF Arabic language spokesperson on his account on X telling the residents of a number of neighborhoods in the southern suburbs to evacuate. And shortly after that, we began seeing and hearing air strikes there. It's unclear what specifically was targeted. The Israeli military said that it is going after Hezbollah targets and infrastructure and facilities there. But keeping in mind Kaitlan that was these warnings from the IDF for coming in at about midnight until 3:00 am. This is a time where you would expect most people are sleeping, not really looking at social media. So many people may have not seen these warnings, and those airstrikes started soon after that.",

April 13 was a mixture of drones and ballistic missiles, more drones, and that's what makes this attack much more powerful, even though there was a smaller number here, only 180 ballistic missiles, but they are far more powerful than the drones that were launched back in April.There, it seemed Iran was more sending a message that they were willing to attack Israel. You're right, that most of that was intercepted, and President Biden pushed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take the win, essentially to say, look, the attack didn't do much damage. Israel had a limited response in Iran that was much the same way. It was essentially sending a message to Iran that Israel could strike sovereign Iran if it wanted to. Now, this attack much larger, and the expectation is that Israel will carry out a much larger response. And we've certainly already seen that threat coming from Netanyahu, from the IDF and from others. So the expectation is that this one will be bigger. Israel showed in April that it could attack Iran. Now the question, will they go after Iranian nuclear facilities? Will they go after Iran's oil and natural gas that's essentially the lifeblood of Iran's economy right now. So the question what will they do? President Biden huddled with his top aides to try to get a better sense of what the possibilities might look like and how they will play out, not just Israel's response, but how Iran might retaliate for that. So, very complex discussions to try to figure out how this goes. The U.S. has made clear they want to talk to Israel about what this might look like over the course of the next several days. So likely those conversations are already happening, but it's a question of when and how big does Israel go here? And what role will the U.S. play in that response. If any the U.S. making it clear that they will back Israel when it comes to air defense, but offensive, that's a whole different question.",

They could go try and attack the ballistic missile production facilities and maybe their air -- their missile launch sites.

And that crossed that threshold at this point in time. So I think the fact that if Israel decides to respond to attack Iran directly. [01Yes, Iran may respond. But the fact is, Iran does not want a wider war. I think at this point they've realized they can't -- certainly can't win it, and they've once again proven that their missile capabilities, which we paid close attention to when I was in office, is rather feckless. It's the second time they struck. Last night with over 180 missiles, and they were completely proven ineffective. So, I don't know what Iran has left to respond with their proxy groups have been decimated in in southern Israel with Hamas, Hezbollah is on the ropes. We see today, this morning, Israel still pressing and will continue to press into southern Lebanon, and we've seen no other reactions out there, with the Houthis are out there, but Israel struck them the other day. So we could see a tat for tat -- tit for tat response. But at this point in time, Iran is signaling that it does not want a wider regional war. In fact, Kaitlan, what struck me about last night was, after the attack, what the Iranians said was, we're done. This is a response for the killing of Haniney, Nasrallah and others, but there was no mention the fact that they might attack if Israel goes further into Lebanon. So they kind of left their Hezbollah partners hanging out there. So it remains to be seen. But I think at this point in time, we're all going to watch and see what the next move is by Israel.",

They Israel was still fighting. Hamas in Gaza. You still had Ismail Haniyeh in charge. You had Yahya Sinwar there as well. At the same time in in Lebanon, you had Hezbollah intact, its leadership intact. They still have anywhere up to 150,000 rockets and missiles and drones.And now you have a situation months later where the leadership has been decapitated from both Hamas and Hezbollah, and you've had several Iranian IRGC leaders killed as well. And so I think right at this point in time, Gaza -- in Gaza, they have the situation pretty well under control. And Hezbollah in the north, they're -- they are on the ropes. And so the fear that if Iran -- if Israel responded to Iran, and Iran would tap its proxy Hezbollah, to shoot 10s, 20s, tens of thousands of missiles against Israel. That seems to be far less of a concern at this point in time. And so thus, as you said up front, Israel has a much freer hand. And as you said in your earlier at the tee up here, it appears that Hezbollah has been so decimated, both the elimination of their leadership and their inability to conduct command and control that we aren't seeing much response from them in the north when it comes to rockets and missiles.",

      "sentences": "Well, there are real questions, Kaitlan, about the latter part of your question, the level of influence that they could have over any potential response, but what they're trying to do in the meantime is just to keep those lines of communications open, to make sure that if there is a decision by Israel to move forward with a determined plan on how to retaliate against Iran, that they are in the know, they are in the know early, and that they have an opportunity to shape that potential outcome in the hopes of trying to contain any fallout in the region.Their goal for the better part of a year has been to try to contain this situation from becoming an all-out escalatory conflict in the Middle East that engulfs the entire region, but this is slowly tipping toward that point which has officials on edge. I'm told that in the Situation Room, that the mood was nervous, that they were pensive as they worried about what this could potentially do to upset whatever balance was left in the Middle East. Now I'm told, when I talk to senior U.S. officials, that they don't necessarily expect to veto power and whatever Israel decides to do, and they know that they don't have it, but they do want some level of input, considering that there's so much aid, both financial aid and military aid, that the U.S. is sending, and there's also a heavy military footprint in the region that remains there. That was what President Biden said today when he offered his continued ironclad support for Israel, but also said that he was determined to keep American assets and personnel in the region safe. Now, it's also important Kaitlan to note the distinctions between this strike and the strike that Iran carried out in Israel on April 13, six months ago. Officials acknowledged that what happened in the last 24 hours was on a much bigger scale than what happened six months ago. Six months ago, the Biden administration was able to encourage Israel to have a more limited response, but they acknowledged that is not possible or not likely to be the case in this situation just because of the size of the barrage of the missiles that were headed toward Israel, the targets, the sensitive military and intelligence targets that they were headed toward. And of course, you know, the lack of notice that they got from Iran that these missiles were coming, that was also a key difference from now and back in April. So there are many key differences. The Biden administration is monitoring the situation. They understand that they don't have complete control over what Israel ultimately decides to do, but they're trying to exert what little control they may have. Kaitlan.",

And this is a very intense period in the Jewish calendar and clearly in Israel, the commemoration of the October 7th attacks really brings the country right now, is bringing the country together. And I think to Bobby's point, these taboos have now been broken and that's the real risk. The taboo of Iran and Israel directly attacking each other was broken in April, a little bit. the door is now wide open and that's the big concern is that these attacks, unlike in April, they seem very emotional, they seem very aggressive. There was no choreography. No sort of pre-warning the United States and our allies in the Middle East that these would be a limited response and therefore Israel should be careful and calibrated in what it does. And so yes, I think these are heady (ph) days just to get to your point here, heady days inside Israel in its defense sector and its planning in the prime minister's office. They feel like they are on the offensive. They feel like now, in many ways they took this blow. It was unsuccessful in terms of having casualties gratefully, thankfully. But now there's this sense of, ok, we've taken their shots and maybe this is now the time to strike in a way that we have been afraid to have been held back from before, which is very concerning and hopefully will be something that the Biden team is able to continually counsel the prime minister to be very calibrated in any response to not have this continue to grow so that the taboos not only are broken, but that we really do escalate into an all-out -- a direct conflict.",

      "sentences": "Now that comment is not new, but it's worth noting that Trump underlined what he has said previously, denying that service members were injured during that attack.I spoke earlier about this with the former defense secretary Mark Esper. He was in charge of the Pentagon at the time. He recounted how serious this was and also how many of the cases became more severe over time. He even visited one of the soldiers at Walter Reed Military Hospital. Joining me now is Iraq war veteran Paul Rieckhoff, who is the founder and CEO of the Independent Veterans of America. You obviously had some strong feelings about this. You called it ignorant and absurd to hear Donald Trump hear this. I mean, if you are a U.S. service member who was there that day, what's it like for you to hear the former commander-in-chief downplay that. PAUL RIECKHOFF, FOUNDER/CEO, INDEPENDENT VETERANS OF AMERICA: It's insulting. It's a slap in the face. And it makes life hard for you. I think what I really want to underscore is it's ignorant. It fails to understand that traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Almost 500,000 men and women have experienced a traumatic brain injury. And he is the former commander-in-chief. He should know that. And in this incident in particular, over 80 people got purple hearts. So if they don't get recognized as being injured, they don't get benefits, they don't get care. One soldier got 90 percent lifetime disability, so it's a very significant issue. And it's asinine, it's ignorant, it's confounding. He has no excuse for this. And I think the bigger issue too is you're talking about the Middle East. Weve got 2,500 troops in Iraq right now, 900 troops in Syria, plenty of troops on ships that could experience exactly this type of injury if rockets continue to fall from Iran and their proxies.",

The importance of someone understanding your injury but also, you know, this is something that soldiers have struggled with, is actually saying, hey, I am injured just in a different way that you may not be able to physically see the same way you can with someone else.

We're constantly trying to make the public aware of our sacrifice, of the kind of injuries we're experiencing and to have the former commander- in-chief say this and double down on it, I think is really problematic.And ironically, it's happening on the night of a debate that's really historic because it's between two post-9/11 veterans. Weve never had two post post-9/11 veterans on the major ticket together. So you've got Vance and you've got Walz, they both served overseas and they may have experienced, you know, troops in their units who had traumatic brain injuries. I wish we got to that more. I wish there were veterans issues in particular, we got two more tonight. But you know, this is the latest in a long string of insulting and ignorant remarks from Trump having to do with the military and veterans. It's a constant thing with him.",

They're only doing this when Joe Biden is in office.I mean, they did actually hit the base. There were 11 missiles, I believe that actually hit the base and damaged it. There was real damage. But you just said that Trump has a long history of this. I'm kind of surprised this didn't come up tonight, which is that I think Trump just says so many things that people just let them go. But, but when he recently was comparing the Medal of Honor and the Medal of Freedom, we saw the altercation at Arlington National Cemetery.

Independent, unaffiliated voters in places like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio -- those are largely veterans. Many of them are independent and are watching issues like this. And they vote on character. They vote on integrity and they vote on who they can trust to be the commander-in-chief.
