Let's start with what happened in the supposedly more gentlemanly Senate where the fist-a-cuffs were only theoretical and the assault did not become actual battery. In the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee chaired by Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, there was a hearing called \"Sanding up against corporate greed, how unions are improving the lives of families\".
