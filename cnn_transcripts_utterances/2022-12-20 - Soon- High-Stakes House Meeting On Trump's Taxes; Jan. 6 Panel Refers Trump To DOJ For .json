First, it is decision day for Congress on Donald Trump's taxes. Next hour, the House Ways and Means Committee will decide whether to release details of former President Trump's tax returns to the public. We're also tracking the fallout from the unprecedented actions of the January 6 committee. For the first time in American history, Congress recommended criminal charges against a former president. Now, the committee accused Trump of four federal crimes including inciting an insurrection. Also today, the Biden administration is just a few hours left to respond after the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on ending Title 42. That Trump administration rule allows officials to turn migrants away at the border because of pandemic-era concerns. As a lot to get to, let's start with Trump's tax returns. CNN's Lauren Fox is live on Capitol Hill. So, first, what do we know about the meeting that's going to happen pretty soon?",

We expect that once this meeting begins, they will vote to go into a closed-door session. Everyone will be kicked out of the room, then they'll deliberate. That could go on for several hours. After that meeting, they will open it back up to the public and they will have a vote on what they want to do.Now, we don't know what their decision will be or what information they are looking potentially to release publicly. Is that going to be full tax returns? Is that going to be some kind of comprehensive report? But we are going to be watching very closely. Obviously, it's a momentous day, given the fact that this fight started years ago, Victor. This is something that House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal vowed to do when Democrats won back the House in 2018. And today, almost four years later, it's something that they are going to have to make a decision about, Victor.",

Thank you.The January 6 committee now, it describes its report recommending criminal charges against former President Trump as a \"roadmap to justice.\" The decision on whether to charge him will be up to the Department of Justice. Now, the DOJ has its own investigation, as you know, but will now have access to the committee's transcripts and their findings. All of those files. The panel plans to release its full report beginning tomorrow. CNN political correspondent Sara Murray is with us now. So, what does this mean for DOJ to finally get access to the committee's work?",

Part of what he wants to do is he wants to set up an office outside of the Justice Department, get these prosecutorial teams under one roof in a special counsel's office. That has not happened yet. So, we expect that to happen.But again, these investigations, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation, the January 6 investigation that the Justice Department is conducting, these have been ongoing but obviously, him being here back here in the U.S. will have a more day-to-day role in overseeing these investigations no longer remotely, Victor.",

Trump, they use the federal law that says those returns shall be furnished by the IRS over the Ways and Means upon written request. Donald Trump can challenge this in court. And in court, what the Ways and Means Committee said was, we are not seeking these returns because we want to investigate Donald Trump or exposed Donald Trump. We need these returns because we're considering legislation. We're considering new laws.Yet, it's always remained a bit of there's a disconnect. Why would you need an individual's private returns in order to consider new legislation that says, well, if there's someone who becomes president or vice president or is running for that they will be audited? It's never been clear why exactly they need his specific returns. And yet here we are, on the brink of the end of this Congress, they've not legislated, they've not taken any serious steps towards legislating yet they're meeting today to discuss potentially making these returns public.

That is a clear violation of federal law. So, that's why I think it would be a good idea to have professionals who are nonpartisan to review the forms, and then the Ways and Means Committee would have the opportunity at that point to decide through an up or down vote with full transparency as to whether or not the forms ought to be released to the American people.

They can only consider them in closed sessions. Of course, because the law is trying to protect the privacy interests of all people.And so, representative is -- Neal is correct. But then he sort of pivots to this non sequitur, so we're going to bring in some outside group that's going to tell us whether it's OK. The law tells him you're not supposed to disclose these.

And we're seeing more and more people see that what we saw throughout the course of this January 6 committee was not just what happened, but we heard it, we saw it, and we felt it. And people understand that that was absolutely wrong. There was no question that this was something that shouldn't have happened. We should have never questioned the outcome of the election. We should have never questioned the certification of the election. And we certainly should not have allowed this insurrection at the Capitol. But let me also point out this as well, Victor, there are also some Republicans that say that this January 6 committee, they view this as a joke. They say that this was nothing more than an effort just to pass forward criminal referrals. Some even agree with Donald Trump that they look at this as a corrupt process.

Why not stand by McConnell's statement? Why not come forward and say, all of this is just gone too far? It almost led to my death. We need to be going in a different direction, and also the Department of Justice. No one is above the law. And if Donald Trump did this, which the committee has done a great job of laying out the facts by Republicans, I will say, Republicans who served loyally in the Trump administration, most of these voices were people who were conservatives, people like Judge Luttig, people like Rusty Bowers in Arizona, all of these witnesses actually are part of the GOP.

There is a lot of uncertainty about what happens now at the border. CNN's David Culver is in Juarez. DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENTNow, that's in part because Mexican officials have cleared them out and tried to dissuade them from coming here. But now, as of today, it's because of what's happening on the U.S. side. So, normally folks were crossing over these stones right here, it was a simple crossing for many, some would even go back and forth to help others across. They leave their clothes and they'd go up and start being processed by border patrol in the U.S. But overnight, we saw barbed wire being rolled out, a convoy of Humvees coming in, and you see them all lined up here and they have now prevented people from trying to cross. In fact, a few migrants, just as we've been here who have made that attempt have been told you cannot come this way. It is illegal to cross the Rio Grande and to try to be processed in this manner. Instead, they're directing people to go all the way down to the formal crossing, if they want to be considered for asylum. So, that's where they're directing a lot of these migrants. Nonetheless, some of these migrants still have the focus of December 21, thinking that's when title 42 will be lifted. Of course, we know now because of the Chief Justice. That is not the case. Title 42 staying in effect for now. And so, for those migrants, there's a lot of confusion, frustration, many of them feel lost and yet they now are looking at a physical barrier that is preventing them from trying to continue the process of entering the U.S., Victor.",

But let me show you where I am because this is Brownsville, Texas and this is the border wall where it meets the Brownsville-Matamoros Port of entry.Now, this is where normally legal crossings happen every day. Now, we are just yards from a camp that's on the other side of the border. I'm going to ask our control room to take this shot because this is a live drone shot by our CNN drone pilot Al Mesh Bergen (PH). What you're looking at is this is a camp of thousands of migrants in Matamoros, Mexico. Now, from talking to advocates there, these are mostly Venezuelans and Haitians and they've been waiting there for the lifting of Title 42. [14:25:03] I've been on the phone with them, and they tell me that they are happy, they're joyous because Title 42 is staying in place, which is counterintuitive because Title 42 allows Border Patrol agents to swiftly return them back to Mexico. But they explain that the U.S. government has provided so many exceptions to Title 42 that they would rather wait in these camps in Mexico to wait for their turn. Now, I want to show you where we are exactly. And why this is important because these migrants say that they want to cross the border legally. Take a look here, if you take through -- take a look through the border wall, you see, those are the legal pathways. That is the bridge leading from Matamoros, Mexico to Brownsville, Texas. Now if we could take the mass camera from our CNN engineer, Michael Humphrey because you'll be able to get a bird's eye view of what we're looking at here. And here's why it's important. From talking to the migrants that I've been talking to, that's where they want to go. That's where they want to cross legally into the United States. Now, their concern was that if Title 42 lifted, that they would not be allowed by the U.S. government to walk to this port of entry and seek asylum. That's what they're hoping for. And hear this. They were telling me that what they were doing is they were preparing inflatable mattresses and life vests and ropes to prepare to cross the border illegally if they were not allowed to go to those bridges that you're taking a look at, to seek asylum. And so that anxiety has been building, that anxiety has been coming down ever since they've learned that Title 42 is in place at least for now. Now, this is what the scene looks like here where I am. It's a very different scene in El Paso, Texas. If we can go to that video because what you see there is it changed overnight. Overnight, we saw National Guard come in and what I want to make very clear is this. We have seen that during other surges. All this is part of Governor Greg Abbott's operation Lonestar. He has invested about $4 billion in this type of security. Ever since March of 2020, Governor Greg Abbott has sent hundreds of boots to the border -- all along the border to secure the gaps that are left whenever there are surges. Now, this is important, Victor, to understand because here is the key and why this is important. Whenever there are migrant surges, Border Patrol usually has to take Border Patrol agents out of their role of law enforcement along the border so they can process migrants. With Governor Greg Abbott's role in sending border -- in sending National Guard is to fill those gaps to make sure that the southern border is safe, Victor.",

As you know, many of these communities have to use their own tax dollars to address the problem immediately. And sometimes it takes years to being reimbursed by the federal government. We're still in a pandemic. I think most people here in South Texas agree that enforcing Title 42, at least for the near future is a good idea.",

      "sentences": "They really do. They -- I think they give the president all the cover in the world that he needs to hold Title 42 in place. I think the administration has been under a lot of pressure from some migrant activists to lift it and allow people in. I personally have been pushing the idea of a Safe Zone Act, which is a proposal to create a safe zone on the border of Guatemala and Mexico, where migrants can come at that juncture and process their asylum claim at that juncture. And do everything that we're doing here on my southern border processing asylum claims, do it 1500 miles away from the border.And if we're going to allow them in under the credible fear standard, which is a pretty low standard, we should allow them in at that juncture, let them go to the airport, and fly to their final destination. And this would do one -- this would do two things. One, it would take the pressure off our border and allow Border Patrol and law enforcement to do what they're supposed to be doing and what they've been trained to do. And it will also take the cartel element who's moving all these migrants through Mexico and moving them around from enriching themselves. Last year, we calculated that cartels had made $5 billion bringing people to our southern border, and this would clip them at the knees.",
