      "sentences": "So, was it intentional or maybe a mistake? CNN has learned that an employee at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence drained a swimming pool back in October, which ended up flooding a room where surveillance videos were stored on computer servers. This happened roughly two months after FBI agents found hundreds of classified documents there.All of this comes as the special counsel's investigation into former President Trump's handling of classified documents. It appears to be nearing its final stages. So, with us now is former Federal Prosecutor Danya Perry, former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. I want to talk about this pool, the draining of the pool. The timing, notable, right, two months after all those documents were handed over. For it to be more than notable, for it to carry criminal liability, what would prosecutors have to prove? DANYA PERRY, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  They would have to prove intentionality. They would have to prove that either the pool boy or maybe his superior told him or were aware that surveillance video was being requested by investigators and prosecutors and that they knowingly drained the pool in order to essentially destroy the equipment. That's what they would have to prove. They would have to show that it was not coincidence, that it was not an accident, that it was, in fact, knowing and willful.",

They have scorched the earth. They have talked to nearly every person, according to reports, at Mar-a-Lago, for example. They have seized phones. They really have left no stone unturned. So, it would be surprising if Trump's lawyers came in at the last minute with some Hail Mary and a defense that actually moved the prosecutors with some argument, perhaps, that they hadn't thought of.

And that can be really problematic because the links that are in these texts are really easy to click on if you are duped into thinking that this is, you know, the IRS coming after you for some payment or whatnot. The scale of this is just massive, Kate. We're talking about 225 billion spam tax sent in just the last year alone, according to some estimates. That's 150 percent more than the year prior.

Number one, there were people upset within the PGA Tour that LIV was basically moving in on their long legacy in the territory traditionally held by the PGA. Then sort of separate from that were those who said that the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Tour, backed by the Saudis, who many hold responsible for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, that this was a form of sports watching, that the athletes involved covering up some of the atrocities that had been blamed by some on the regime.

It did not seem as though we were heading to this point. Golf, professional men's golf has been in a state of civil war, really, for the last year, so controversial, the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Tour.The players, the rebel players who kind of left to join it late last year, their careers were completely upended by this. They were roundly criticized. They were ostracized in some ways. European players were taken off the Ryder Cup, which is going to be played later this year. The Ryder Cup team of Europe even changed their captain because Henrik Stenson had gone to the LIV Tour. And now we have this situation where the D.P. World Tour, which is formerly known as the European Tour, the PGA Tour in the States, and the LIV Tour are now merging. It puts an end to all pending litigation. It was getting pretty unpleasant with these players and tours all suing each other. I'm learning that it means that at the end of this season, the 2023 season, players will be able to reapply to join the PGA Tour or the European Tour, because as soon as they hit their first ball in a LIV tournament, they were suspended from the tours that they'd grown up on. So, this now means, I suppose, that they can rejoin these tours. Some might say that the LIV players are going to end up having the last laugh here, because some of them were paid millions, if not tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars to join the LIV Tour. And now they can come back to their original tours anyway. So, so much to kind of work through here and make sense of, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of response and comment about this, especially with the next major tournament coming up in L.A. next week, the U.S. Open.",
