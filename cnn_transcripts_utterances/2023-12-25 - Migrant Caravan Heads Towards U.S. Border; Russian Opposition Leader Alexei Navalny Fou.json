Then President Trump calls up a fellow Republican and pushes them to block Joe Biden's victory. We already know he did it with Vice President Mike Pence. We heard the recording of him doing it with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Now the Detroit News says they've heard a recording of him pressuring two Michigan election workers.",

According to the Detroit News, hours after two Michigan Republicans voted to certify the 2020 results, they got a call from the Democrat Party. He urged them not to sign the certification, and the pair then refused to sign. In the end, though, it didn't matter, at least not to the outcome of the vote. It couldn't matter to these folks here. We have CNN's Katelyn Polantz tracking all of this for us. Caitlin, I do just want to be clear here. CNN hasn't independently heard this recording. The Detroit News, though, is reporting this and has heard it. What are we learning about it?",

      "sentences": "Correct. And the new thing here, the piece that is so important with this story, out of the Detroit News, is that the audio exists of this call. This is a call that had been known about where Donald Trump in November of 2020, just after the election, did call two Wayne County officials, so that's the county that Detroit is in, in Michigan, and essentially pressured them to not certify the election result, his loss of that state. Two of the things he said on this call that we're learning because of this Detroit News report, the specific wording captured on that audio saying we can't let we can't let these people take our country away from us and everybody knows Detroit is crooked as hell.So, another instance of pressure here. But the reason that audio is so important is that everyone knows what Donald Trump wanted after the 2020 election, but there are ongoing investigations, including in Michigan, and the federal criminal trial coming up of Donald Trump. And so, there's a big question mark of what the evidence is to show Trump's interest in blocking the election results and the steps he took, the exact words he said. Will this sort of thing come up in some sort of cases in the future? Would it be something that even special counsel Jack Smith could use at trial? The answer to those questions we just don't know right now, but every time there is specific audio captured of Donald Trump, like that call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger out of Georgia and some of the other instances we've heard of calls, every time there's audio, it is the encapsulation of what happened in real time and not just people recreating what they remember. And perhaps even downplaying exactly how forceful Donald Trump was in wanting to pressure people to let him win.",

We have 500,000 registered voters, and we had about 250,000 turnout to vote. So, this is an ongoing thing. Often, it's Republicans who like to repeat that about Detroit. And it's just patently untrue. The state came in. They audited. They found that the imbalances out of 174,000 mail ballots were 150 ballots. That was the only thing that was somewhat unaccounted for.

As you know, they tried to work the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader with trips to Washington. Neither of them capitulated to his demands. He has a lot of supporters in Michigan that were willing to show up and protest on Election Day and the day after. But why he thought he could ever turn that around is beyond me.

And that's in part because of what Susan said. We don't typically in America want judges to be the ones that decide who gets to vote on a certain candidate. And so even Democrats know that some of this could inure to Trump's benefit by having people rally around him, by having people say that you're trying to take away our vote, take away our voice.

So why is the death toll so staggering? Because it's not just about the point of impact. This is a crater caused by a 2,000- pound bomb. The potential kill zone from that crater can spread up to 365 meters. That's 1,200 feet, an area equivalent to roughly 60 soccer pitches, or around 90 American football fields. The IDF told CNN, in stark contrast to Hamas's intentional attacks on Israeli men, women, and children, the IDF follows international law. And takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm. But is that true? This is just north of the Shati (ph) refugee camp along the main coastal road. When you go in closer, you can see, in just this small neighborhood, at least nine craters consistent with 2,000-pound bombs. Which means the potential kill zone could encompass this entire area. CNN and Synthetic's analysis of the devastation of Gaza shows extensive bombardment. In an area this densely populated and using these bombs, it's inherently indiscriminate. And the human cost continues to soar, surpassing 20,000. Many of the dead still unburied, still under the rubble, with no end in sight. Nima Elbagir, CNN, Sderot. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
