Thank you for sharing an incredibly busy news day with us. 13 counts, the Justice Department on sales and indictment against Republican congressman and serial liar George Santos. Among the accusations that he used campaign cash to buy designer clothes, laundered money, lied to Congress and get this, stole COVID unemployment insurance money at the height of the pandemic.Plus tonight, Donald Trump gets a primetime audience in New Hampshire, right here on CNN. That happens the day after a New York jury delivered a stunning verdict, finding the former president liable for sexually abusing a woman and then telling malicious lies about her. And an agreement to meet again. Read yesterday's White House debt ceiling huddle on a curve. And I guess it wasn't a failure. But listen to the principles and everybody still pretty much dug in.

Surrounding really the 2020 campaign for the congressional seat, which he did not win.And then of course, the one he did win in 2022. This indictment details how George Santos allegedly operated a company and used a consultant to essentially get people who were supporting him to give him money, that money would go into this account, which would then go into his personal account. And he would, as you mentioned, buy lavish clothes, paid a car payment, paid off some loans. And there's also allegations, also as you mentioned, John, that he while having a salary at an investment firm in Florida making $120,000 a year. He was applying for unemployment benefits, getting monthly payments from the state of New York allegedly, totaling about $24,000. And then there are also charges related to the fact that he lied on financial disclosures to the House of Representatives at times and pleading his salary other times, bringing it down lower than actually it was. So, there's a number of stunning allegations in this. And again, he is going to go in front of a judge sometime this afternoon on these charges. It's unclear if we were actually hear from him. He turned himself into the FBI this morning and then was brought here to the courthouse. So, we have not seen him. We are fully expecting him to appear though on those front steps.

I want to read from one of the counts. This is a wire fraud count that George Santos fraudulently induced members to contribute funds to company number one under the false pretenses that the money would be used to support his candidacy. And then actually spending thousands of dollars of the solicited funds on personal items, like luxury designer clothing, credit card payments.

So, as Brynn said, he was being paid a salary of about $120,000 a year. In the middle of the COVID pandemic, when the country is stressed, when New York is being hit harder than many parts of the country, he applies fraudulently.

I have talked to a number of advisors who huddled with the former president, they said they went through, what the event was going to look like some possible questions, had conversations, but that there was no real intense prep, because Donald Trump is not somebody that you can actually prep ahead of an event. But it will be interesting to see how the voters interact with them. We know that this is part of a larger strategy with his Trump advisors in the campaign to really reach voters outside of conservative media, outside of his base. We know he's not only appearing on CNN, but he's also been running ads on CNN as well. They are trying to talk to voters to connect with them, especially voters who might have once supported Trump, but no longer do, John.

Is that how you response in a town hall tonight when asked about this, and then you're into the Trump paradox again, which is that may well help him with his core supporters, attack, attack, attack, but it may well hurt him as well with the suburban voters who sent the Republicans packing in 2018, sent Donald Trump packing in 2020 and. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's fair to assume that he may react that way in tonight's town hall. I think that there's also important context that the former president is a serial liar has demonstrated himself to be a serial liar. And so, you know, our job as reporters is to provide that context that a lot of what he says needs to be scrutinized extremely heavily. When it comes to the voters that that he needs to actually win in a general election. In regards to this case and in regard to the found that he was found liable for sexual abuse. I just think about a lot of the voters that I've talked to in Arizona in 2020. In his key swing state that he would likely need to win if he was going to win in the general election. And I spoke to a number of former Republican voters or voters who call themselves still Republican, but we're not going to vote for him because of who he was as a person, because of the fact that he lied, because of the fact that they believe him to not have strong moral values, strong family values, and they didn't vote for him because of that.",

No, he didn't win in 2020, but he won a lot of Republican voters and conservative voters in 2020. And I don't think they're necessarily going to leave him behind what Trump is banking on, is that perhaps in spite of what came out in this trial, that he'll still be able to get enough support from the folks at the middle on things like the economy, on things like perhaps President Biden's shortcomings when it comes to immigration.
