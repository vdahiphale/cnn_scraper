Coming up Russia says the Black SeaGrain Deal with Ukraine has been terminated, sending wheat prices up immediately. We explore what it could mean for global food prices. Now making heat waves being felt all across the globe in Asia, Europe and the United States. This while the climate envoys for the world's two biggest polluters, China and the U.S. meet in Beijing to see how they can put their differences aside and advance climate policy. And many in tennis are celebrating what looks like a changing of the God at the top of the sport. How the 2023 Wimbledon winners stunned the world. Welcome back. Now the head of the United Nations and Western officials are strongly condemning Russia's withdrawal from a critical grain deal. The agreement had allowed Ukraine to safely export its grain from its Black Sea ports despite a wartime blockage. The effects of Moscow's withdrawal will be felt worldwide and it raises fears over the fate of global food supplies and the price of grain. Here is UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: Ultimately, participation in these agreements is a choice. But struggling people everywhere and developing countries don't have a choice. And that is if millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost of living crisis, and they will pay the price. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now also today, Ukraine claiming responsibility for an explosion on a critical bridge connecting Russia to the annexed peninsula of Crimea. Two people traveling along the bridge were killed. Ukrainian intelligence officials say the damage will hurt Russia's ability to move supplies for its war in Ukraine. Monday's attack is the second one to take place there. Last October a fuel tanker exploded, destroying a large section of the road. CNN's Scott McLean explains why the bridge is so important to Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've already seen grain prices go up major questions now about what effect that's going to have on suit food supplies around the world is as well, of course as the -- as the Ukrainian economy. That deal was set to expire at midnight here local time. The Russians beat that by several hours. The Russians, we should note are not linking this at all to the explosion, the attack on the Kerch bridge, they say this was in fact a long time coming. You remember, Eleni, this deal was brokered a year ago by the United Nations and Turkey, of course, between Russia and Ukraine so that Ukraine could support -- could export rather this grain from its ports on the -- on the Black Sea, most importantly, most notably the port here in Odessa, so that that grain could get out to the rest of the world safely. Now, Russia has been arguing for quite some time now that the deal is one sided that only benefits Ukraine and the West. That in fact, Russia, because of sanctions is not allowed to export its own foodstuffs or its own fertilizer. And so it had been indicating for some time that this this that it would allow this Grain Deal to expire. Now, according to U.N. official I spoke with their decision does appear to be quite final. So the U.N. which is still trying to help Ukraine and figure out how to get grain and other foodstuffs out of this country. This official tells me that they are going to be focusing on those rail and road options, because it certainly does seem to them. And they have been at the center of the negotiations, that Russia will no longer be allowing these ships to leave Ukrainian ports and transit through the Black Sea, Eleni.",

And since then, of course, he's argued that Crimea is very much a part of Russia. He ordered this bridge built at great expense at $3.7 billion, it's some 19 kilometers long. It is the only direct artery between southern Russia, between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which is which has a population of millions of people. And so what it's going to mean that is that at least for now, that road traffic is going to be crippled. Anything that would be carried across by car or by truck is not going to be able to get into or out of Crimea. But we should note that the rail lines are still running. That's vitally important for the for the Russians, we have seen them supplying their troops via rail. We've seen all kinds of Russian weaponry and armored vehicles being transmitted by rail. Russia can also access the Crimea peninsula by land. Very early on in the conflict, they established that land-bridge by occupying southern Ukraine. That's why there's such emphasis by the Ukrainian forces right now to try to cut down south, split those Russian forces and prevent Russia from being able to access Crimea by land, Eleni.",

Heavy monsoon rains have caused dozens of deaths not just in the tunnel but across the country. 1000s of people forced to evacuate because of floods and landslides.

As the bodies of refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean continue to wash off onto Tunisia's shores, there are also fears that others could be left to die in the desert.

New data showing that China's economic recovery continues to lose steam, the world's second largest economy expanded at anannual rate of 6.3 percent in the second quarter, that's slower than expected. And compared to the first quarter, it grew just 0.8 percent. Post COVID consumer spending has slowed after what appeared to be a strong start. CNN's Marc Stewart joins us from Tokyo. If you look at that overall number, one would say this looks pretty strong. But it's not good enough for an economy like China, especially after the zero COVID policy that every -- had everything shut down. Should we be worried?",

But considerit was one year ago there was pretty much no accurate economic activity happening in China. So it's a dramatic increase from a year ago. But still, it is not good enough to answer your question. And right now China has this real struggle of how to raise its GDP, how to raise productivity, basically how to get money moving, and the way that will likely occur is through investment by businesses or to increase consumer spending. So what is China to do right now? Well, we have been hearing some cries. And this is based off of a note I read earlier today from -- from Deutsche Bank. There may be a push louder cries for China to start doing some kind of stimulus plan which other economies have done around the world to try to get out of the hardship from -- from the pandemic and to increase their productivity. The Chinese Politburo, which is the big legislative body will be meeting later this month. And as that approaches, we may hear these cries to do some kind of stimulus come a bit, come a bit even stronger. Other options perhaps on the table already. We have seen some rate hikes. But as we have seen just historically speaking, that does take some time to get things moving once again. Interesting Eleni, electric vehicles are seen as a way to help China increase its productivity. There are incentives to get Chinese citizens to buy electric vehicles. And that's been a bright spot in the economy. Also, we can't mention China's economic woes without talking about regulation, especially in the tech sector. There has been a big crackdown, as we've seen in recent years. Now, there's some efforts to kind of ease that and make this a little bit more of a business friendly environment. We saw top government leaders meet with the heads of Alibaba or officials from Alibaba, and from ByteDance, which are big -- are big Chinese companies. And finally, AI could have a role in all of this, China unveiled some new guidelines about AI, but those two seem to be softening just a little bit. That's what we're reporting to make this more of a business friendly environment. But Eleni, all of the reality that we have seen, these realities such as decreased consumer spending, high youth unemployment, some of the issues with the housing sector and -- and the issues that go around that. Those are very much being reflected in the data that we are seeing from China. So this is going to be a long haul proposition most likely.",

The -- Elon Musk has said that about 6000 people left the company since he took over. That's what he told the BBC. But we're talking about 11 people in Ghana. These are the people who were claiming severance from Elon Musk who feel that they have been one of them told us, they were literally ghosted by Twitter because they didn't even begin negotiations about the severance pay until CNN reported on their case. And when that happened, they feel that Twitter lowballed them and only offered three months' severance pay. No stocks vesting, no other benefits, but because it had been already a long process, they didn't want to take on the extra burden of a legal case. They don't want to go to court, they accepted it. And then silence. I want to read a statement for you from their lawyer Carla Olympio who has been representing them from the beginning. And she says unfortunately, it appears that after having an ethically implemented their terminations in violation of their own promises and Ghana's laws, dragging the negotiation process out for over half a year, now that we have come to the point of almost settlement, there has been complete silence from them for several weeks. Their attorney says they're considering legal action against Twitter in various jurisdictions, including Ghana. But this just the latest in a long saga. There's other employees in other parts of the world suing Elon Musk for reneging on his promise to pay them full severance or only paying them half of that. But for these Africans, they haven't received a cent. Their last day on Twitter was on December 4. So we're talking about seven months plus here. And when CNN reached out to the official press account for Twitter to ask about the status of these employees, we got what is now a standard responsibility. A poop emoji.",

And the fact that the world's richest man cannot pay severance to 11 people is especially striking in this case. So that's what we're talking about. They're not hundreds of employees, it's literally 11 people, some of whom moved to Ghana, from Nigeria or other countries and are waiting for the severance so they can move back and try and rebuild their lives.",
