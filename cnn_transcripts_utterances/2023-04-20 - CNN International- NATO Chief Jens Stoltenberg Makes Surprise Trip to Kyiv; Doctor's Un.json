And Jens Stoltenberg arriving in care for the first time since the war began saying he went to see the area of Bucha out on the outskirts of the Capital scenes of great brutality by Russian troops in the early days of the invasion. And standing there, tweeting saying very clearly that Ukraine's rightful place is in NATO as we continue to see a list of pretty good equipment that slowly turning up now in Ukraine patriot missiles, Ukraine's Defense Minister arriving yesterday or more announcements of Leopard tanks from other NATO members turning up imminently. The list continues but Stoltenberg's presence there next to Zelenskyy talking about how Ukraine as a matter of time. It's going to take a while we've become part of NATO and clearly too. The volume of NATO equipment that's now becoming integrated Ukraine's Armed Forces is certainly a nightmare for Moscow. They've had plenty of bad dreams, I'm sure since this war began, but Stoltenberg's presence deeply symbolic, the message very clear quite the opposite of what Putin thought his invasion was about and the timing, deeply clear here, the Patriot missiles, Stoltenberg turning up. You couldn't have a clearer a series of messages from NATO here about enduring support, but frankly, all eyes on the months ahead, whether you Ukraine can change the battlefield reality here in its favor. Zelenskyy saying they see the prospect of liberating all their territory, that's the ambition. It's really in the weeks and months ahead, that we'll see whether it becomes a reality, Max.",

Uganda's President has been meeting with lawmakers as he considers whether to sign into law or veto a bill that criminalizes homosexuality. The bill makes it a crime to even identify as LGBTQ Plus and calls for the death penalty in some cases. 50 leading scientists from around the world have signed an open letter urging the President to veto the bill.

What is frankly one of the harshest Bill anti-gay bills in the world into law?We'll know later today and if that will become law, but the President has also said he wanted to hear from scientists around the world. He's called homosexuals deviance in the past, but he wants to know, is this a nature or nurture debate? And scientists have been clear and unequivocal in their response to him. And I'll read you some of what that open letter said, Max, were some of the scientists said in their response to Mr. Beenie. We cannot say this enough. Homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality. The science on this subject is crystal clear and we call on you Mr. Beenie in the strongest possible terms to veto the bill in the name of science. Now, it remains to be seen if he does veto the bill. Some say it's unlikely given his stance on deviance and he's anti-gay stance. Uganda already has some of the harshest penalties for being in same sex relationships, it's currently illegal. So what the MPs are doing is taking a step further to even just say. And there's a 10-year sentence being proposed for promoting what they say is promoting homosexuality and worst of all is aggravated homosexuality, where which carries the death penalty.
