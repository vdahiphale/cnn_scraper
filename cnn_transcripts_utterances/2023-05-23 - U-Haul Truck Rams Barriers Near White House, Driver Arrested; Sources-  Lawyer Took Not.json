Video shows police inspecting a Nazi flag with a swastika, a roll of duct tape, a notebook and a black backpack that the suspect apparently had with him. Eyewitnesses say the driver crashed into the barriers, reversed, but then tried to smash through them again.

And according to the police, the driver of this truck came onto the sidewalk here. You can see the tire marks here down on the sidewalk. Rammed into the ballyards right there, the -- the barriers that are protecting the park and -- from access to the park and to this -- the White House. Rammed it a couple of times before they were arrested and charged. Now they're facing multiple charges right now. This person has not been identified. But they're facing charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, threatening to kill or kidnap a president, destruction of federal property, trespassing, a number of charges. We're expecting to learn more about the suspect later today. One of the things that happened immediately afterwards, of course, is the concern that there could be explosives inside that U-Haul truck. According to the FBI, which did a search of it, no explosives were found. But for a time, the Secret Service evacuated the Hay Adams Hotel, which is across the street. Now right over there, you see Black Lives Matter Plaza. This is a -- this is, of course, the scene of a lot of protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. And, you know, looking at what you see in one of the videos there, according to the police who are doing a search of the U-Haul, what you see there is someone holding what appears to be a flag with a swastika on it. There's a backpack. Those are things that apparently were found inside that U-Haul.

We knew that they had been fighting for, an extraordinary court fight to get access to them.And now this is a first glimpse that we are getting. A whole team of us were speaking to sources about what those notes say, what they represent, and what they are. And what they represent are extremely detailed notes from Donald Trump's lawyer, Evan Corcoran, from May 11, the moment that they got a subpoena saying Donald Trump must turn over all classified records or records with classified markings on them in his possession back to the federal government, to this grand jury criminal investigation. And then the notes span the entire way up to June 3, so the period of time where Evan Corcoran, this attorney, went and searched Mar-a-Lago, specifically through boxes in a storage room, and then handed over what he found to the Justice Department, telling them, I don't believe there is anything else at the property. Now there's a lot of questions there, and we don't have the full extent of what these notes say. So we don't exactly know whether this could factor into the obstruction investigation. But we do know that these notes reveal that Donald Trump was asking whether he could push back against the subpoena, not comply with it potentially. That might be something that he was just raising with a lawyer like he normally might, like any client might. But it could be factoring into this larger situation. And the fact that these notes are so detailed, one person said that they were overly detailed. Another person was surprised at how detailed they were. That's pretty significant, because the Justice Department appears to be getting the amount of evidence that they really were seeking there.",

Perhaps offering some glimmer of hope that these talks could be heading in the right direction. But they still emerged from that hour-long Oval Office meeting without a deal in hand. Now negotiators met late last night up on Capitol Hill, breaking up a little before midnight. And they are expected to continue talking throughout the course of the day. Much of the disagreements that they have acknowledged still remain around that issue of spending levels as the president has proposed freezing them at current year levels, while Republicans insist they must be cut back to fiscal year 2022 levels. Now one thing in this meeting that the president really stressed, and we've heard from the White House over the past few days, is that they need to be able to sell any type of agreement to both sides, Democrats and Republicans. And that is one of the key challenges in these negotiations, is reaching some type of bipartisan compromise. Now this all comes as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen really doubled down on her warning that the U.S. could default on its debts as early as June 1. She said it's highly likely the U.S. would be unable to pay its obligations if that were to happen. And look, it feels like every morning we are here talking about the timeline. And, yes, on paper, it is nine days away from a potential default. But if you take a look at the way things work up on Capitol Hill, it is a much tighter, tighter time line. They need to write legislative text. There's a rule in the House that requires a bill be posted for 72 hours before it's voted on. And then, even if they get through that, it still needs to go through the Senate. So really, it appears that they are heading into crunch time at this moment, but both sides have acknowledged the urgency of the moment. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says that he plans to speak with Biden daily until they can reach an agreement. SIDNER:  All right. Arlette Saenz with all of the details there. Thank you so much.",

It happened last Monday.U.S. Customs and Border Patrol just released this video. You see somebody hangs from the top of the barrier, pulls the child over and then drops him to the ground. Our Rosa Flores is live in Houston this morning. Rosa, we talk so much about the numbers and the law and Congress, but this is about humans. This is about the human toll of what is going on.",

And according to Border Patrol, they came under fire once they went to this area to try to render aid to this little boy who was injured. Now, this happened in San Diego. The fire department also responded.And according to CBP, even their air and marine operations responded via helicopter to provide cover while they were trying to help this little boy, because they came under fire. Now, Poppy, all of this is under investigation. We don't know the condition of the little boy. We've asked, but CBP says that they're investigating -- Poppy.",

And they account [SIC] to about 3,000 migrant encounters per day.That's a 70 percent drop from the days leading up to the ending of Title 42, which the numbers were at about 10,000 migrant encounters per day. So the question is why, of course. What I'm hearing from sources and contacts on the border is that there's a few reasons. First of all, that Mexico has upped its enforcement. They're returning migrants deeper into Southern Mexico. And also, those thousands of migrants who were waiting have decided to wait in Mexico for the CBP One app to get one appointment to go into a port of entry, rather than entering the country illegally. Because in this post-Title 42 world, they've learned that there are legal consequences to entering the country illegally. So Poppy, what I'm hearing from sources and contacts is that what we can expect to see are migrants taking riskier measures like what we're seeing here to enter the country undetected, and that could mean, of course, and unfortunately, more deaths.",
