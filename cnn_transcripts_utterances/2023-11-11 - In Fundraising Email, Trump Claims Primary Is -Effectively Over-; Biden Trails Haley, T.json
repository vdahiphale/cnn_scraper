They want to make sure that they are showing up in the states and hitting a lot of ground and they also are hoping that they can build enough momentum in the primaries to potentially carryover into a general election. But even so, they are really spending most of their messaging attacking Joe Biden. We heard him talk a lot today about the president's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, attacking Joe Biden, saying that he would do a much better job of bringing peace to the United States and really setting this up as if it is a general election rematch between himself and the president, Jim.",

He says that, \"As a former member of law enforcement, I expect all members of my staff to follow the law and fully cooperate with any investigation and I will continue to do exactly that.\" We should also mention that the campaign attorney, Boyd Johnson, added to the mayor's response, saying that after this campaign funding investigation came to light, the campaign launched an internal review. And through the review, it was discovered that the individual within the campaign acted inappropriately, though they declined to say who the individual was. They did, however, say that that information was immediately and proactively handed over to investigators as well.
