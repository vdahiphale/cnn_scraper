It just gone 1Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have been unrelenting with more than 2,000 Hamas targets destroyed according to the IDF. And with no timeline at this point when the airstrikes will end. Hamas fired another barrage of rockets at the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, Tuesday, with three Hamas militants also died in exchange of gunfire with Israeli troops. More than 300,000 Israeli reservists have now being called up and civilians living in towns and villages near the border with Gaza had been evacuated to safety. On Tuesday, Israel's defense minister toured towards southern Israel, where tanks and troops have been massing for days. Hamas will soon face that military assault not just from the air, the defense minister said, but also from ground forces as well. Meantime, the IDF says rockets launched from Syria fell in open areas Israel's North. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops have been deployed to the northern border with Lebanon. In Washington, President Joe Biden confirmed at least 14 Americans were killed in the weekend attack by Hamas. The White House says 20 or more U.S. citizens are unaccounted for. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But of course, there isn't going to be an element of surprise rarely if this ground invasion does take place, because Israel is talking about it. And Hamas is not only expecting it, but it's probably going to welcome it because it will give Hamas another opportunity to take more Israelis captive and to try to kill more Israelis.But it is expected to happen. We don't know when, we don't know how point or if it will be jointly with, you know, airstrikes or anything else. But for now, the attacks or the retaliation from Israel on Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip in the wake of that unprecedented surprise attack that began in the early hours of Saturday morning. For now, that campaign remains in the air, Israel saying that it's struck more than something like 450 targets over the past 24 hours. And in the last couple of hours. It's also told us about attacks on the port and docks in the Gaza Strip, which is said we're also being used by Hamas militants. Of course, overall, you've given the headline figures which have come out this morning, which is that the death toll in Israel more than 1,200 now. And as Matthew Chance was saying in his report, hundreds of thousands of reservists now called out. We're talking about the equivalent about 3 percent of the Israeli population, and with the death toll in excess of 1,200 Israelis. We're now at about half of all the casualties that Israel suffered in the Yom Kippur War, which began almost 50 years ago to the day. And of course, every day, we're also seeing more and more evidence of the savagery rally and the brutality of this attack by Hamas. Yesterday, our own Nic Robertson was in Kfar Aza, which is just to the east of the Gaza Strip, with IDF soldiers. And the IDF saying that women, children, toddlers, the elderly were brutally butchered, in its words, in an ISIS way of action. And Yoav Gallant the Israeli Defense Minister, talking about some of the Israeli victims who were killed by Hamas militants were beheaded as well. So really just harrowing tales of what happened. I know we've had a few of them speaking to us. It was all about how they hid under bodies in order to survive that attack on that music festival next to Gaza as well. John?",

They also have human intelligence and informants on the ground. Nothing happens in Gaza, really without Israelis getting some kind of wind of what's going on.So is this the case that they got all the information but drew the wrong conclusions? Or do these Hamas, you know, planners and Jihadis go so deep underground went so low tech, that they managed to pull this off without the Israelis having much of an idea of just the extent of the operation?",
