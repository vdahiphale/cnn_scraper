What lawmakers are now demanding. Good evening. Tonight, Syria is entering a new phase of rebuilding as they celebrate the collapse of their country's brutal dictatorship. For the first time since the Assad government was overthrown, thousands you can see there, gathered across the country for Friday prayers. There is much work to be done during this political transition, and rebel leader Mohammed al-Jolani is urging people to use caution by celebrating without firing shots.

There are other senior State Department officials, John Bass, Barbara Lee, who have also made stops in the region. And right now, in this moment, Isa, of course, you really have two main initiatives by the Biden administration in these waning days that they are in office. The first is to help jump-start the process to get Syria on the right path to a representative Democratic government. U.S. officials, very keen to say that this is a story for Syrians to write, that this is not a U.S. effort, but they certainly want to help guide the Syrian people along with European allies, regional allies. That's why you're seeing Blinken make these stops in Turkey, Iraq. And he has just arrived in Jordan, and tomorrow in Jordan, there is a ministerial meeting of foreign ministers from across the region, from European countries as well, to get on the same page, really establish a unified effort to help the Syrian people in this -- in this transition process. At the same time, Isa, there is very much a push from the Biden administration to try to get a ceasefire deal across the line before they leave office before Trump comes into office on January 20th. The Turks, of course, are very important in this process because many of the Hamas leaders have gone to Turkey after Doha kicked them out. At the same time, the Qataris and the Egyptians are still playing a big role in this. That's why you're seeing Jake Sullivan in those places as well as Israel.

The images show at least two transport aircraft, as you can see there, a helicopter and a missile system being packed up in an airbase in Latakia. Russia also has a naval base in Tartus but images from that base showed the situation largely unchanged. The Kremlin was major backer as you all know of the Assad family for decades. Russia says it's in contact with a new leadership in Damascus, but at least one analyst says this looks like a withdrawal. We'll stay across that story, of course, for you. Now, the fall of Bashar Assad's brutal regime carries weight not only in Syria but also across a wider region. Israel's defense minister has told his country's military to prepare to remain in control of Mount Hermon. That's right here on Syrian territory Israel seized this week, just this week, earlier this week. And it comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military to take control, his words, of the buffer zone that separates the Israeli, occupied area of the Golan Heights from the rest of Syria. So, you're looking at this chunk here of land. For context, Israel captured the Golan Heights during -- from Syria during the 1967 war. And that territory is considered occupied Syrian land under international law. All this against the backdrop of Israeli strikes on stockpiles of weapons as well as naval facilities in Syria amid rising concerns about its security.

First of all, Israel seizing some land, and according to the official line we are hearing from the government from the military, this is a temporary step, not some kind of an attempt to create a long-term reality.

I think there's also a level of understanding towards some of the other military moves Israel has taken including by the way sending military forces to the Hermon, but there is a concern about two aspects. One aspect that we're hearing from some of these European governments again is the question of is this temporary step based only on security considerations or some kind of a new permanent arrangement that would sour the relationship with whoever takes over in Syria.

He's returned a week later. He is wealthy. The money that put him in danger in the first place saved him via ransom.

And I think a question I have especially since I spend so much time with people with money is would I have been better off -- would I have been happier if I had grown up with money and had less of a survival skill than I -- than I've had to earn through making my own path in the world? And I constantly want to know that does money doom you or does it save you? Is it better to be someone who has those survival skills or is it better to be somebody who never had to think about their survival? Those are the essential questions to me.",

But there's another aspect of this that, you know, my team and I kept in ourdiscussion, our own private book club having our discussion about, and that is the aspect of trauma coming back to that. How much of kind of the trauma that we see is the family? How much of it is the fact that they just didn't talk about their problems? They kept pulling things under the rug, right? How much of that is the lack of conversation of opening up compared to wealth? How would you -- how would you see that? BRODESSER-AKNER: I think that they did the best that they could. On the day that Carl Fletcher, the man who was kidnapped, was returned home, his mother -- and this is in 1980 -- his mother said to him, keep it together. This didn't happen to you. It happened to your body. And that is the ethos he tries to keep in his head. Of course, that doesn't work because what's the difference between you and your body? But in 1980, we barely had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. We had people coming back from Vietnam who felt insane and didn't really understand why. Now, we have all of these different ways of dealing with trauma. And we have a generation of people who use the word trauma freely. But back then it was something that was -- that was shameful, it was terrifying people, didn't take medication. There were no medications. And what happens is he is just trying to move on. So, they don't talk about it. They treat him like a bomb that could go off at any point. And his children go out in the world and what the book is, is the story of his three children, the oldest one, a land use lawyer who is so terrified of everything that could go wrong that he keep -- that he thinks he sees kidnappers in his rear view mirror. The second son is a screenwriter with a bright future behind him whose only successful weekly activity is reenacting his father's kidnapping in various hotel rooms with people he has hired for the occasion. And then the third child who is so disgusted by the money and so sure that the trauma her family endured and their money has stunted her so much that she just gives away her money and works at a university in their union and actually comes to define the family ethos instead of running away from it. So, it's about how do you figure out how to survive the circumstances you were -- you were brought into.",
