Rockets launched by Hezbollah in recent days have ignited wildfires like these images you're seeing right here in the northern part of Israel. And thousands of people on both sides of the border have been uprooted. In Israel alone, some 60,000 residents have been forced from their homes for months. Visiting northern Israel earlier, Prime Minister Netanyahu promised to take action.

It's not in Beirut itself. Now, this is a highly fortified diplomatic compound. Now, what we've seen in social media video is a single gunman wearing what appears to be body armor with an automatic rifle, which is firing in that area. Now, we understand from the Lebanese military that he was injured in an exchange of fire, we assume, with Lebanese security forces that are manning the perimeter of the U.S. Embassy, or, of course, embassy security itself. Now, the U.S. Embassy put out a statement saying that no member of the staff was injured, that the embassy wasn't damaged, but that Lebanese security forces and the embassy security personnel reacted quickly to this incident. Now, the Lebanese Prime Minister, acting Prime Minister Najib Mikati has said that an intensive investigation is being launched. In fact, the Lebanese military just put out a statement saying that they've conducted raids in two towns near the Syrian border in eastern Lebanon, that they've detained a Syrian national, a Lebanese national, and three members of the shooter's family. The shooter also identified as Syrian. Now, the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon is closed for the day after this incident. It says that they will open tomorrow. But, of course, as I said, it comes against the backdrop of these mounting tensions between Lebanon and Israel. Of course, Hezbollah, since the 8th of October, has launched basically daily rocket fire and other fire at Israel. Israel has responded. It's been a fairly busy day yet again on that border with the exchange of fire. I think the latest was six Hezbollah strikes on Israel, a similar number of Israeli strikes on Lebanon. Yesterday, the number was 10 from Hezbollah. And we expect that situation to really escalate as it appears that pressure is growing on the Israeli government to do something to restore security on the northern border. There's also pressure on the Lebanese government to do something because a similar number, about 94,000, according to the Lebanese government -- 94,000 people have been compelled to leave their homes along the border on the Lebanese side, as well. So, tensions are mounting. And this event, this incident in Beirut certainly doesn't help the situation. Zain.",

None of those have worked because we are talking about a group of vulnerable people who are risking their lives, coming from all over the world to present themselves at the border for lawful, and I want to be clear about this, for lawful humanitarian relief. They are not following executive orders out of action. Rosa made a good point that this is, you know, it's sort of a numbers game and very nuanced and complicated. People on the ground, they will not be able to keep up with this. It will lead to nothing more than confusion and chaos. And long-term, what we'll see along the border is people with asylum claims being denied due process, people remaining in dangerous conditions in Mexico, and just more of a humanitarian crisis that is as much of our own making as it is forces beyond the United States' control.",

Most of these warnings go through Friday. We're looking at more than 100 daily records, both daytime highs and overnight lows, dropping over the next couple of days because, I mean, look at these temperatures. Our average for this time of year is 96 degrees in Las Vegas, with temperatures likely getting to 110 degrees or hotter. Again, this would be one of the earliest occurrences on record. Same thing for Phoenix. Your average is 100, and we're looking at those temperatures getting well above that. Again, about 43 degrees Celsius. Same thing in Palm Springs. So, these temperatures are much above average. By 15 to 20 degrees above average, you've got highs in the 90s stretching as far east as Denver. So, again, staying pretty hot. We have a new tool that tells us where we can have major and extreme impacts when it comes to heat sickness, and it's showing that we do have these major impacts up and down in California, across Arizona, and then even into Texas as we go through the week, just making us more vulnerable to heat sickness because we're just not acclimated to it yet. Here are a couple of stats I find remarkable. Las Vegas has not had a cold overnight record temperature, a record for cold, since 1999.

Kfir, who was just nine months old at the time of his abduction, is the youngest hostage held by Hamas. Images of a terrified Shiri holding both young boys being taken by Hamas terrorists has in part led to the Bibas family becoming one of the most recognizable hostage families. Oriya Yahbess joins us now live from Israel. And Oriya, you are the cousin of Yarden Bibas, and we want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us right now. As noted, your family, your cousin, those young boys, their red hair are forever permanently just ingrained in our minds as we look at the images of these hostages being held now for so much time, over 200 days. How is the family coping, knowing that it's been months since you've had any proof of life, seeing that once again a new ceasefire proposal has at least been laid out, and now there's pressure on both sides, the Israeli government and Hamas, to agree to a deal and release these hostages, including your family members?",

We don't know if they have medical care. We don't know if Kfir received the food that he needs formula when he needed it. So, I don't even have more words to say about that.

You mentioned that the world, though, needs to put more pressure on this deal coming forward. I was really struck by a story I read about an Israeli couple visiting a restaurant in Naples, Italy. And when the waiter there found out that they were from Israel, he said, I have a friend in Israel, and it actually happened to be your cousin, Yarden Bibas. This waiter brought a photo that he had taken of Yarden and Shiri when they had been there before October 7th. And what really struck me is that this waiter, as kind and thoughtful as he was to reflect on this couple that he met, had no idea that they were abducted, that they were part of those being held hostage in Gaza right now.
