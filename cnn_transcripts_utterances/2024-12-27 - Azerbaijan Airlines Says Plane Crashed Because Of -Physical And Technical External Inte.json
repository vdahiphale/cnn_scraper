This is happening in an open conflict zone, this airspace specifically, which is what leads me to my next question.I want to step back a little bit because the Ukraine conflict is still very ongoing. It is still a hot war. There has been no sign that anybody is coming to the table. There has been a promise from the president-elect that he can reach an agreement very quickly. I want you to listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): I don't know when we'll meet because he hasn't said anything about it. I haven't spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I'm ready for this at any time, and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Got to be a deal. Got to be a deal. Too many people being killed. That is a war. That's too many people. We've got to make a deal. And Putin has to make a deal. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, first, if we can go back to what Mr. Putin said about he hasn't met with the president or hasn't spoken to him in four years, that may be true. But President Putin was also the guy that said that what took down this airplane was a bird strike. So what you have to first point out is the fact that every time Mr. Putin talks, he lies.The second thing, in terms of the relationship between the two presidents, one of the first questions I would ask is, where are they going to meet? Because President Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague of being a war criminal. And there are warrants for his arrest in countries that abide by the ICC. So that would put a little bit of an imposition on where they might meet. Are they going to talk for sure? President Trump has already said that he's going to stop the war. And in order to do that, he's going to talk to Putin. If that occurs, I certainly hope that Ukraine is at the table, too, because there have been indicators that there is going to be a dual conversation between Trump and Putin to help solve this problem. Certainly, Ukraine has an interest in this as well, and they should be at any negotiating table. But the last thing I'll say, Phil, is the fact that President-elect Trump has said on multiple occasions that he would like to win the Nobel Peace Prize. This would be an opportunity for him to try and do that. So I think there's going to be a great deal of pressure on a potential peace process between Russia and Ukraine. But I got to tell you, too, in my assessment of the situation, Russia is at a very tenuous point right now. Their military is nearly destroyed. Their economy is a shambles. They're having problems at home. And whereas Ukraine is having some of the same situations, I think, truthfully, Ukraine still has the upper hand in terms of a potential for negotiations in this whole fight. And Putin wants to get out of this war.",

I mean, I think back to 2004, which is where a lot of Democrats say, when I talked to them, they feel they are right now, right?And that was right after George W. Bush's re-election, again, after not winning the popular vote, but then winning the popular vote with a bigger win in 2004. And Democrats galvanized around this battle against privatizing Social Security. And that was the beginning of the formation -- Karen can give you this history better than I can -- of what led to this successful 2006 midterms for Democrats to win the House and the Senate, which fed directly into the 2008 campaign. Obviously, history doesn't always repeat itself exactly. But I do think how the initial legislative policy battles are framed and who wins them is going to help define how the party organizes itself going forward. I will say this, though, Phil, I think we get caught a lot in labeling the intra-democratic battle between progressives and centrists. I don't think that's what this is. And I think the smartest post- election analysis have said, whoever's going to grab the mantle to be authentically back to fighting for working-class Americans and sort of anti-elite establishment, who can define themselves, to your point about brand, the Democrat that's able to step forward and do that most successfully is one that is going to go far. FINNEY: I love the analogy to 2004, because obviously I was at the DNC in 2005 when we were struggling with these questions. And I think that authenticity and the fact that I think there was a little bit of buyer's remorse with George W. Bush once the Social Security battle happened. People said, wait a second, that's not what we thought we voted for. And I could see that repeating itself, frankly. I think the other piece, though, on this brand question and authenticity, I mean, look, all of the people you mentioned have -- they are stellar potential candidates. They are all sort of, I think, staking out sort of different parts of the landscape for themselves about why they're a champion for the people. And the other thing I think will be important in 2028 is, remember, the percentage of younger voters in the electorate will be higher. So what does that do to what the issue landscape is going to look like? And the percentage of, you know, we've been seeing women candidates gaining increasing numbers of voters, right? 65 million for Hillary, 75 million for Kamala. Americans are getting more used to voting for women. So I think it'll be a good year for women candidates as well.",
