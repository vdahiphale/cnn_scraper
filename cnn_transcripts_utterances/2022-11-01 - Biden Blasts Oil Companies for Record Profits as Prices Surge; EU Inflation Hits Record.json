Right now, as you can see, they're kind of in the red, not doing so well this morning. The Fed meets on Wednesday and is expected to hike interest rates again ahead of the October jobs report. U.S. markets dipped on Monday but actually they had a very good month. The Dow ended up in October with up 14 percent. Its best monthly gain in more than 45 years and the Nasdaq rose 4percent and the S&amp;P rose 8 percent.Oil companies like Exxon have seen their stocks suddenly climb all year. In recent days several global energy giants have posted massive corporate profits and in just the last hour BP joined the list reporting that its third quarter profit more than doubled from a year earlier. Now U.S. President Joe Biden is calling out major gas companies for racking up record profits from a surge in prices at the pump. This coming just days ahead of midterm elections as the economy and inflation remains key issues for voters. And CNN's MJ Lee has more from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

That was an acceleration from previous months. As you noted, their food prices were up some 13 percent.All of this is compounding these events that we've been seeing over the last few months. And now this grain deal potentially has the suspension of it by Russia has the power to make things worse. But I think it's also worth noting that this was not happening in a vacuum. Yes, this war has made inflation worse. Before even before it started, in February of this year inflation in both the U.K. and EU was close to 6 percent. In the U.S. it was close to 8 percent. This is because of the supply bottleneck as the result of the pandemic, the fact that demand was outpacing supply in a lot of areas. That probably would have started to abate over the summer and growth would have accelerated with services. Obviously, the war and the acceleration of inflation as a result of that have put pay to those sort of silver linings we might have seen. And now this is persisting even in the U.S. which is less exposed to this war. Inflation is proving very persistent at over 8 percent.",

But meanwhile, is worth noting that this grain deal, this was not a solution to the problem. This was an emergency sort of band aid.
