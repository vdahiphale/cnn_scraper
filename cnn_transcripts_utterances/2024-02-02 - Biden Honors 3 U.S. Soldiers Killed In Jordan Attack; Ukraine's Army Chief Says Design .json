      "sentences": "It is a Friday, you are most welcome, I am Richard Quest, Isa is off for this evening. Tonight, a solemn moment as PresidentJoe Biden is meeting the families of the American soldiers who were killed in Jordan, expecting to oversee when their bodies are returned   home, the dignified return, as it is known, from the president and the first lady. Ukraine's Army chief is not holding back to an exclusive frank assessment to CNN of where the war is at the moment, all at the same time as the rumors are, he's about to be sacked. And El Salvador gets set to go into the polls, the president is poised for re-election. The controversial crackdown on gangs and how that cool-down would play into the result. Any moment now, President Biden is to attend the dignified transfer as it's called, the remains of three soldiers who were killed last Sunday in the drone attack in Jordan. The dignified transfer will take place at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Earlier in the day, the president met with the families of the soldiers, the president  flew there, of course, from Joint Base Andrews. A dignified transfer is best described as that solemn moment when the remains of those who have died in the service of their country are transferred back to their relatives, and indeed back to the military. The fallen members are Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Kennedy Sanders and Breonna Moffett. Now, both of them have now been promoted to the rank of sergeant. CNN's Oren Liebermann is with me from the Pentagon. And the dignified transfer is exactly what it says. It says -- but it is an extremely -- besides just solemn. It is a significant moment because it is the country saying, you know, welcome home under the most terrible of circumstances.",

      "sentences": "That's absolutely right. These are -- these are never easy to watch, I can't even imagine what it'slike to participate in these ceremonies. This is the second time President Joe Biden has had to participate in a dignified transfer of remains. The first was after the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members at the end of the Afghanistan withdrawal just a few days before the U.S. was officially out. That ceremony very difficult to watch, it obviously lasted quite a while, because there were 13 killed here. So now, several years later, he is attending one more after a drone on Sunday struck and killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Sure, the number might be smaller here, 13 versus 3, but the ceremony no less easy just because of that, again, as you point out, these are solemn events. President Biden met with the three families for a while for about an hour, if I'm not mistaken, just a short time ago, that meeting wrapped up about 45 minutes ago, and that will lead to the dignified transfer of remains of these three soldiers, Sergeant Jerome Rivers, Sergeant Kennedy Sanders and Sergeant Breonna Moffett. The last two of whom were posthumously promoted from the rank of specialist. So, a difficult moment, certainly one that no president wants to take part in, in the sense that you never want to see service members killed. But President Biden has made the trip to Dover Air Force Base, first to be with the families, and then second, to pay his respects as these three soldiers come home under the most difficult circumstances.",

They know what it's like to be a soldier in harm's way. Certainly, Austin does as the former commander of U.S. central command.

He wrote an exclusive opinion piece, he said, \"we must contend with a reduction military report from key allies. The number one priority here is mastery of an entire arsenal of relatively cheap, modern, and highly effective unmanned vehicles and other technological means.\" He did not comment on the rumors that he could be out of a job following a rift with President Zelenskyy.

Israel'svowing its troops will soon reach the town and they're pressing ahead in the war in Hamas. Now the U.N. says Rafah is now sheltering more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people. The town's under -- is a pressure cooker of despair in the fears of what happens next. One man there says if Israeli tanks keep coming, people will have two choices. Stay and die or climb the walls into Egypt. Thousands of those in Rafah recently fled to face fighting in nearby Khan Yunis, and many Palestinians have been displaced again and again as they keep moving, searching for safety. Now look at the satellite analysis here. How much of Gaza has been damaged? In some cases completely leveled in the war. The video shows what used to be enabled in northwest Gaza. There's not a single building left. Not even the paved roads remain. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv. It is very difficult for the Israeli authorities to somehow put forward a justification for this level of destruction, which, you know, look, we were talking a moment ago about proportionate in terms of how the U.S. will respond to the drone attack in Jordan. But this also comes again this question of proportionality.",

And this is something that President Biden, who's in an election year, is acutely aware of. That an element of the progressive younger generation that he might normally expect to readily come out and vote for him with a little persuasion, a little time on the stump, is really put off from it. And the protest that he meets are a real indicator that there is a [00:03:36] 35 nonise. And we've heard a noise from civil servants, more than 800 who've signed a letter transatlantic calling on their governments to take -- calling their governments and telling them that, look, what you may be doing here ma ybe making the situation worse. I think when you understand that's happening, and when you understand how people feel about it, the popular mood, the sentiment, the big demonstrations seen around the world, that does get to that issue. But it is a determination that the Israeli government, that they'll crush Hamas. They say they're going to defeat them. And they believe that what they have done is justifiable to themselves and therefore should be to everyone else. That this is what it takes to take on a terrorist organization, as they say, one that they say would be a threat to the wider world. That's their justification. But it clearly has a lot of people doubting it.",

The United States hasnever sanctioned Israeli individuals, although going back to the 1990s, President Clinton did label certain groups extremist groups. So, I think it is an important first step for the Biden administration. I think it's an important signal to the Israeli government that the president of the United States takes very seriously the kind of violence that Israeli settlers enabled by ministers in the Israeli government and embedded by ministers in the Israeli government. Takes this very, very seriously and is willing to actually take action. That is something that we have not seen before.",

Thus far, Prime Minister Netanyahu's offerto kind of measured response, indicating that the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces and Israel's internal security agency, the Shin Bet, are on top of this situation and that three of the four individuals sanctioned have already in the Israeli legal system. At the same time, Netanyahu's partners, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, his public security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of whom are settlers have responded rather aggressively to this -- to these sanctions, in part because they may be next. But I think we raise an important point because the Israeli government, particularly this Israeli government, is interested in advancing the project of settlements and in fact annexing territory in the West Bank. So it's clearly -- if this has not sent the message and President Biden has to sanction more individuals, we're looking at another point of tension between Washington and Jerusalem.",

And I think, you know, thus far we'll have to see how Israelis actually respond on the ground. I suspect that they will crack down on some settlers. But, of course, as I pointed out, you have two ministers who are determined to resist and continue to enable and abet settler violence.",
