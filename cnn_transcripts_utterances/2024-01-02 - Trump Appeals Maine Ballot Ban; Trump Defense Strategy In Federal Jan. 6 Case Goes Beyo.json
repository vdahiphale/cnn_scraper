I'm Jake Tapper.This hour, just in, brand new charges against Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey going further than the accusations about gold bars, luxury cars, and cool hard cash. Now another country is in the pockets of the New Jersey Senator allegedly. Plus the scramble to learn how two planes ended up on a collision course on an airport runway in Japan before bursting into flames. Video shows the panic on the passenger plane as nearly 400 people on board all escaped alive before the inferno. And leading this hour, the breaking news, the first major court filing from Donald Trump in 2024. Just a short while ago his team appealed the decision from Maine to remove him from the state's primary ballot. This is just one of many legal issues facing Mr. Trump colliding with the 2024 presidential election. CNN's Evan Perez is here. And Evan, what is Trump's team basing this appeal in Maine on?",

They say also that the 14th Amendment, the section three which says that you can't hold certain offices if you have engaged in insurrection against the United States, that that doesn't apply to the Office of the President, that this is not something that should even apply here. And they also say that, you know, she is basing this on all kinds of facts that are not true, that Trump is not actually and insurrectionists. So, on -- based on those arguments, the former president and his legal team are saying that the action by the secretary of state in Maine to disqualify the former president from the ballot should not be allowed to stand.Of course, what this means now, just by filing this appeal, right, this stays that action. This means that he will continue to be listed on the ballot there in Maine pending the litigation that this now kicks off.

Tom, let's start with Trump's appeal in Maine, which just dropped. His lawyers are arguing that the Secretary of State in Maine who made this decision to remove from the ballot, they say she exceeded her authority. And she is politically biased against Trump, she's a Democrat, I believe, and certainly not a fan of Trump. That's true. But are those solid legal arguments? TOM DUPREE, FMR. PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASST. ATTORNEY GENERAL.: I think the Trump legal team Jake is on much stronger ground on their legal arguments about whether the 14th Amendment applies to the president whether it's self-executing, so to speak, rather than going after the alleged political bias of the Maine secretary of state. I don't think that's an argument that will get a lot of traction in the upper courts. I understand why they're making that argument to kind of set the table and try to put this in context of what they view as a politicized decision. But at the end of the day, I think their legal argument is going to rise or fall, depending on those other constitutional challenges to her ruling.",

I think as Evan reported, it's really the Colorado case that's kind of the lead dog in this fight. That's the case that's going to go up first to the United States Supreme Court. And I think there's a very good chance that if and when the United States Supreme Court takes the Colorado case, it will announce a rule of law, a rule of decision that will apply to all of the states considering these 14th Amendment challenges.

And I think that danger is heightened anytime the Supreme Court dives into the political fray. I think the justices themselves are very aware of that concern. Certainly Chief Justice Roberts is very protective of the institution. And so this is not a job that they take lightly. I don't think any of the justices have any eagerness to get involved in the 2024 election. In fact, they'd like to stay away from it if they can. However, I think events are leaving them virtually no choice. So I think it's something they are going to have to get involved in, but I think they are going to be very judicious in the number of cases that they decide.And they are going to do their absolute best to decide these cases in a way that insulates them, if possible, from any taint of politics or suggestion that they're politically motivated here.",

But there's still more of this tale to be unfolding here. And that is the relative confusion that can exist between the person on the frequency talking to landing aircraft, the tower frequency, and the ground frequency, which is another frequency and another person. And if there was some sort of disconnect between those two individuals, that could be a factor. There are reports that the Coast Guard aircraft was told to hold short of that runway. And for reasons we don't understand had obviously taxied into it. So these things will get sorted out. There are tapes that will be played both in the cockpits and, of course the air traffic control radio communications, and of course, individuals in each of those three places, air traffic control, the air bus, and the Coast Guard aircraft are all able to testify to what they thought was happening.

And so some of that, perhaps to the crew, it appears might have seen something at the last minute and tried to make it hop over the aircraft somewhat to make it more of a glancing blow. But the fact is, it's still an extraordinary event here that we're talking about this really dramatic collision. And 379 people, every last person on board that airliner survived. It's truly extraordinary, and a testament to a little bit of technology, a sharp cabin crew that did their job well.

All that came together here. But I will say this, Jake, a lot of us were skeptical on these big wide bodied aircraft, whether it really was practical to get some group that large out of an aircraft in that much time. And here we have a real life demonstration that it can be done. So, you know, all of us who fly should bear this in mind, pay little attention to that briefing. There are crashes that are survivable. But it's not purely by chance.",

I spoke with the local sheriff here a little while ago who said that it has been under 100 on a day like today so it slowed down.

This has been going on for months now where Texas authorities in various places from El Paso all the way down to the Rio Grande Valley have been putting razor wire right on the river's edge, where it's making it much more difficult for people to get onto the shore after wading through the river. You might be able to see it there in the distance. In some of those places, border patrol agents that I've spoken with over the last year have needed to cut through that wire to reach people who needed help or to just take people into custody and this has become a huge flashpoint between Texas and the federal government.This has been tied up in courts, the Texas suing to keep border patrol agents from cutting this razor wire. And now the Biden administration asking the Supreme Court to reverse the previous court rulings to allow border patrol agents to cut through that wire if they need to.",
