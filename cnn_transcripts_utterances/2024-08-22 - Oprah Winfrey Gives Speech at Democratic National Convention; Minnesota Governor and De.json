He wrapped everything -- it was a political speech. Make no mistake. It has edges to it, but it wasn't a partisan speech. You didn't hear the words \"Republican\" and \"Democrat\" over and over again. He talked about working with Republicans. He framed everything around the very simple, basic idea of being a good neighbor. We do these things because it means being a good neighbor, taking care of one another.

We don't come here for a laundry list of 30 policies. That's not what this is about. This is the thematic beginning of the general election campaigns.

Now, they said it was for any Republican potential president, but obviously, now it has been linked to Donald Trump, particularly given the fact that, again, so many people who currently advise Donald Trump and served in his administration were part of crafting it.And it's very controversial. Some of the policy decisions in there or policy rights in there are very far right. And Donald Trump has really had to distance or tried to distance himself. And Democrats have seized on that. We've seen it throughout the convention, and that's something that's annoyed Trump, which you heard today when he did an interview on FOX. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  No idea what it was. A group of people got together, they drew up some conservative values, very conservative values, and in some cases, perhaps they went over the line, perhaps that didn't. I have no idea what Project 25 is. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES:  Now, obviously, he does know what Project 2025 is. And again, it has become quite a thorn in his side and something that he and his campaign have had to contend with. He has continued to say he had nothing to do with it. But Kate, I cannot stress this enough. Part of the reason why Donald Trump is linked to Project 2025 is because of the authors who crafted it.",

We're not talking about stripping away women's right to have an abortion, like one out of three women in America today live under an abortion ban because of Donald Trump. They want us to have a sense that things are going to turn better, that we're turning the corner on all that negativity. And when this election is over, and Kamala Harris is elected because of all the people who may not have been tuning in politically, but are so sick and tired of being taken down to a dark place by Donald Trump, it is going to change the political discourse and the body politic, for I think for the next generation. Once we have the post-Trump era, which I can't wait for, the post- Trump era when the Republican Party starts rebuilding itself, using statesmen of the past as their role models and not the cult of personality that is Donald Trump, everything is going to change for the better.

It's a big pep rally, it's fun, it's exciting. So I don't think it's a fair criticism to say that, oh, that means she doesn't have a strong economic plan. I don't hear a lot of people saying, well, where's the economic plan of Donald Trump other than Project 2025? So let's be fair in the comparison. You will hear her plans. There's plenty of time for that to get out there, but this introduces the people to the American public and that's exactly what they did already with Tim Walz. I think he just created an expectation and excitement and energy that people didn't expect in this. And again, that goes back to Kamala Harris' decision-making. Her first major decision that she made on the national and global stage was to select an individual who represented the heart and soul of Middle America. And he's so relatable. Now, that's going to bring people to the election with a sense of -- we can do this, we can turn this around. He have a coach who's one of our leaders. And Kamala Harris, you'll hear all her plans. So why don't you ask where Donald Trump his like 20-point plan is to get more money back in the pockets of America? Have you ever heard that?

So lucky for you, we're talking about you right now. When you were running, do you feel like -- and watching what's happening with Walz and Harris, do you feel like you came in -- would you change the way that you that you tried to run for office, the way that you spoke, what you said on the debate stage? VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, I was a first-time run for office. I ran for US president. I was the youngest ever presidential candidate in US HISTORY for the Republican Party. And one of the things that I learned is, the more you can stay on your own vision for the country, the better off you're going to be.  My best moments in the campaign were when I stayed true to our vision of reviving our national identity. And also when I was able to engage with people who had disagreements with me. I think we don't do that enough in our politics and those are my favorite moments from the campaign. What I would do a little differently is I realized it is to directly address your question is, one thing that happens in politics, just new to me coming from the business world, is people come at you personally and they come directly. And the approach I took is if you're going to hit me, I'm going to hit you back 10 times harder, which you've got to do but you've got to do more than that as well. And I would say that was part of a learning you're only going to get from running for US president and it was an experience of a lifetime that I'm grateful for.",
