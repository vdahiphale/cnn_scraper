Hamas is so terrible. They're the worst enemy of the Palestinian people.What they do is use innocent Palestinians as human shields. It is clear from just listening to your reporting they are firing bombs from certain buildings, and they have Palestinian people around those buildings. And Israel has no choice but to fire as indicated by where they see that fire coming from. They've got to fire and destroy those buildings to stop the incoming that are happening -- is happening. So -- and so the government -- the administration that I have spoken with in a non-classified session has said that they are working and talking and trying to find a way to make sure that we can have some paneling to get some of them out of the Gaza Strip. I don't want to talk and can't talk about that specifically, because we don't know -- you know, the Hamas is so terrible. They will go and kill their own folks who don't agree with them or know that there's a pathway out. So, we don't want to discuss that. But we've got in looking and working to figure out how we can get -- we have American citizens still in Gaza. And so, we want to make sure that we are able to get them out. We want to help to get the hostages that are being held. So, some of the specifics I cannot talk about but know that there is, within the administration and others, the dialogue and conversation and trying to work with the Israel -- Israeli government to figure out how we get them out.",

Hamas has denied reports that it attacked children, but it's also denied reports that it had killed anyone. And we saw the clear view on video of killing civilians. BOLDUAN: The death toll continues to rise in Israel, at least 1200 people have been reported killed. They are afraid the death hole will continue to rise as they go and grasp the enormity of that terror attack. The death toll in Gaza is rising as well. Now, more than a thousand people killed.",

These are people that the U.S. were very, very concerned about. People like Ben Gvir, Smotrich, these names that you've heard. And now on their watch -- on their security watch, this carnage has unfolded, and this massive breach has unfolded. So, the previous prime minister in waiting, of opposition Benny Gantz, also a general, has agreed to come into an emergency war cabinet government with Netanyahu to try to -- I guess he would say to professionalize the government and its military response at this particular time. So, I think that's the reason for that, and they need to make sure they have -- you know, for them the best hands on deck.",

If this ground offensive happens, what are the realities in trying to get rid of Hamas with all of the tunnels and all the things that they have built up over the years? And if they do it, then what?

You can see just how dark it is, as the main -- the one and only power station in Gaza reports that the power is out. And generators that are there, they will have or will soon be running out of fuel. This is our first look at what a power-out in Gaza is going to mean.And to your point about how civilians that want to get out of harm's way, want to get out of Gaza, what they're up against in doing so, there are these third-party talks about potentially getting humanitarian corridors out. An IDF spokesperson was on with us earlier this -- earlier in the show, and I asked her where she -- where the IDF thinks that civilians in Gaza should go if they want to get out of the -- out of harm's way. Let me play what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. LIBBY WEISS, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: First, I would say that if they do receive any kind of advanced warning to simply put distance from where they are and go somewhere else, even within the street. And beyond that, there is another border that the Gaza Strip has with Egypt. And I -- you know, I can't speak to that -- to that situation at this stage. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

AMANPOURThe \"small rocket\" warning people and hopefully they can get out in time before the big ones -- the big bombs come down and level the buildings which is what's happened. There are, according to the U.N., some 150 or so thousand Gazans who've already taken refuge at U.N. facilities, including UNRWA, as it's called, schools, and other such facilities. But that's only a small percentage. And I think really it goes to the question that Sara also asked, what is the end game? Because it is, for instance, Hamas setting up traps for Israeli forces as has been worn. Does it want to try to drag Israel into a quagmire? Does it want to spark a regional conflagration by doing this? And more importantly, even if Israel manages to decimate Hamas, then who takes over? Does Israel re-occupy, who then? What then? There are so many questions. But Israel's aim right now should not be misunderstood. It is to retain and -- regain, rather the deterrence that it has lost since Saturday.",

Rabbi, thank you for joining me. Your congregants, your families, they're missing their loved ones. Judith and Natalie missing. Daughter -- mother and daughter are among those missing. We're going to put up their picture so people can see them. What do you and the family know about what happened to them? RABBI MEIR HECHT, DIRECTOR, JEWISH LEARNING INSTITUTE OF METROPOLITAN CHICAGO: I just got off the phone with family members just a few minutes ago. And to say that they are full of grief and fear and pain is an understatement. One of the things that they conveyed is that the endless frustration to be sitting in a situation where they have no answers and they're just waiting -- they're waiting with some hope or glimmer of hope to find out something.
