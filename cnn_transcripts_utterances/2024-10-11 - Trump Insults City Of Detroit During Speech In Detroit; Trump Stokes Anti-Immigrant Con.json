Barack Obama appealing directly to the men that team Harris desperately needs to win. Even calling out those who he says, may be uncomfortable with a woman in the Oval Office. And CNN is on the ground as first responders in Florida, search for survivors of Hurricane Milton still trapped in their homes. The death toll is rising as so many return to communities obliterated by that storm. I'm Jessica Dean in for Dana Bash today. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. The Democratic Party's biggest star injected a shot of energy and emotion last night in this election's most important state, Pennsylvania. Listen to him last night in Pittsburgh, taking on his successor for pushing dangerous misinformation about disaster relief. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: You have a guy who will just lie about it to score political points, and this has consequences. The idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments. And my question is, when did that become OK? I'm not looking for applause right now. I want to ask Republicans out there. You know, people who are conservative, who didn't vote for me, who didn't agree with me. I had friends who disagreed with me on every issue. When did that become OK? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've actually heard from some state officials who hope the fact that he's visiting Aurora will show that it's not true. But of course, we expect Donald Trump to be on that stage hammering this message about immigration. And one other thing to point out here, yes, this state is solidly blue. But if you talk to a number of Trump's advisers, they don't think that that matters. They believe that some of these events in blue states, like Colorado. He's going to be in California tomorrow, will garner so much attention, either within the media or online in different snippets, that they'll get the same level of attention. If not more, that he would get if he was at a rally in a swing state. Of course, that has yet to be seen, but this is one strategy that they're banking on. Now this trip to Aurora and all the backlash that it is getting from these local officials, comes a day after he got backlash from a different set of local officials. This time in Detroit, when he was there giving a speech and went after the city of Detroit. Take a listen.

Our whole country will end up being like Detroit, if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hand. She destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed along with new- scum California, and we're not going to let her do that to this country. We're not going to let it happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to get your take on what Tim Walz just said in response to Trump going to Detroit, saying what he said to that economic group there.ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I mean, for the Harris campaign, this is going to be a moment that I think you're going to see them sort of seize on here. I saw that the Harris campaign put out a statement where they sort of use Trump's comments to say, look, he's not just criticizing Detroit, but it's an American city. Patriotism has been such a theme for the Trump campaign. So how patriotic is it to then go ahead and insult a city? A city, by the way, and a state that the Democrats need to win as well. So now you have an image of Tim Walz standing behind, standing with union workers and sort of labor is something that very much resembles Michigan, or something they need in Michigan. While the former president is criticizing a major city in that state, I'm sure hanging over this is the fact that the Harris campaign knows they need not only labor support, but also Michigan in order to win this election.",

And so, we see this kind of playing out. And we can go back to his record when he was at the White House and some of the policies that he put forward.I mean, this is a very strategic move on his campaign to really double down when it comes to his immigration rhetoric because he sees this as a vulnerability to the Harris campaign. This is something that Republicans have really gone after the Biden administration about saying that they're not doing enough on the southern border, and therefore it's hurting Americans who are living in different parts of the country. And so, this is something we're going to see him move forward. And some voters I've talked to say that they find this very effective because they feel like the Biden administration has not done enough in the last three years when it's come to this issue. KANNO-YOUNGS: The border is definitely a vulnerability for the Biden administration. But it is important to note too, that the language that Trump is using, and the dehumanizing sort of nature of it, it is an escalation. You know, from the time that he was in office to his first campaign. And it's backed up also by more extreme policies as well. Talking about setting up mass detention camps, using the military as well in deploying them to the border. I mean, this type of language describing immigrants as a threat.

I mean, for some Democrats I've spoken to this morning, the former president's comments are that of, he's the latest official to confront that uncomfortable truth and connected to a concern many Democrats have. That a slight minority of black voters, it's not a monolith, would feel hesitancy in supporting Vice President Harris. And that could be for a variety of reasons, depending on who you talk to. That could be because of her career in law enforcement, and also, even more uncomfortable, the elephant in the room, as described when we talked to many black leaders last month. Also, a historical trend for some black men to not always rush to support a black woman in a position in power, and that is due for a variety of reasons. That could be a streak of social conservatism in the community. It could -- and it's also -- I mean, it dates back to also Shirley Chisholm being in Congress and saying, that she wasn't getting the support that she needed from black men in Congress. Again, it's not a monolith. This is not every sort of black voter, and for some, this was a really necessary message from the former president, who isn't just a former president, but also a trusted messenger in the community. But for others, there's also a risk here. You know, when I'm talking to black leaders, they've said, look, black voters are ready to support a woman in power. Are ready to support Vice President Harris. But also demand more from their government and feel that their votes have been taken for granted year after year.
