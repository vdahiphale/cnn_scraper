Democrats still scrambling to figure out what to do about the top of their ticket. I'll discuss with my panel. Plus, a mass exodus continues from Gaza City amid intense Israeli military action around the area. We're live in Jerusalem with the latest. And wedding bells are ringing for the youngest son of Asia's richest man, among the guests, some of the world's biggest celebrities. And we begin with the fallout from the U.S. President Joe Biden's closely scrutinized NATO press conference, the President's performance, something of an illustration of why there is such a deep divide in his own party right now over whether he should continue his campaign. There were notable flubs coupled with strong in-depth takes on U.S. foreign policy and the economy. It was a rough beginning for the President before he even faced White House reporters.

It really did seem like they were waiting, regardless of how he performed at the press conference, whether he bombed or whether he tapped dancing upside down at the ceiling, that they wanted him to go, and they were really waiting for just kind of out of respect for this international summit, waiting for that summit to conclude.I think the lack of substantive plan B is just pointing to the fact that President Biden has really dug in. He has said over and over that he is still in this race, that he wants to move on. I think you're going to start to see a more forceful message from this allies and advisors that we need to turn the page from this intra-party fight and focus on Donald Trump, and the threat, in their view, the threat that he poses in November. But, certainly, at least for the time being, that's not going to stop the chatter about what that plan B should be. Of course, a lot of that attention is focused on vice President Kamala Harris. But, that's also not stopping the speculation around certain governors or other rising stars of the party about who that next generation of leaders should be, and how quickly that next generation steps and even perhaps as early as this presidential cycle.",

And actually, looking at what Kamala Harris would look like as someone at the top of the ticket is going to be different than perspectives of her as Vice President. There is no question that Kamala Harris would have some real vulnerabilities if she were to ultimately become the presidential nominee.And most people I speak to agree that she would really be the only plan B option at this point. It would be very unusual for the Democratic Party to decide to move past their -- the first black female Vice President and look for someone else. She also has her name on the campaign. So it'll make it easier. It would make it easier to move the campaign funds and use them to support Harris versus some other candidate. But, yeah, right now, it seems very clear that Biden is dug in and thinks that he can just kind of keep pushing through and outlive this new cycle, which has dragged on now for about two weeks. And the responses I was hearing from last night's presser were very varied. On one hand, I heard from some lawmakers, Democratic lawmakers who said that was a perfectly fine presser. If he had acted like that during the debate, we never would have been -- we never would be here. But, on the other hand, I had other lawmakers say, yeah, sure, that wasn't that bad. But, it also wasn't enough. There is already so much concern.

They had ordered the evacuation of several hundred thousand people. And this morning, it appears that the majority of that operation is now complete, the Israeli military partially withdrawing from Gaza City, many residents who were displaced from that area beginning to return. And what they are finding now in Gaza City in many of these neighborhoods that saw some very intense fighting over the last several days is just absolute widespread destruction. And particularly, it appears that much of the destruction was concentrated around the headquarters for UNRWA, that main UN agency based in Gaza.It should be noted that the -- that UNRWA has not been inside that building at that headquarters for months now. Instead, the Israeli military says that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad began using that building as an operations room where they say they found weapons as well as a surveillance room that Hamas was running. We can't independently verify that information in part, because we are currently barred from actually entering Gaza and being able to independently report there. But, the Israeli military says that there has been intense fighting in that area for several days and that they completed that operation in the early hours of this morning and began to withdraw from that area. Not only was that UNRWA headquarters damaged, but several high-rise buildings, including one housing the Palestine bank, were severely, severely damaged, almost completely destroyed, other than the fact that they are still standing as kind of skeletons of the buildings that they used to be. And as you mentioned, the Palestinian Civil -- Civilian Defense, the rescue crews, they have been finding more than 100 bodies already in the wake of this fighting, and they believe that many more bodies are still buried in the rubble.",

But, for so many of them, not only are they finding inadequate resources at those areas because of the lack of humanitarian aid getting in, the lack of infrastructure in those areas, but also for many of them, this is the second, third, fourth, even fifth time for some of them that they are being displaced.And so, there is no question that there is a sense of immense, immense fatigue, and a lot of hopes that these ceasefire negotiations that are still ongoing in Doha and Cairo could perhaps bear fruit and perhaps provide much needed respite for the people of Gaza.",

So, overall, it's a fairly positive review. I know I was -- we were watching it together. They all just got out of exercise class. So, that's why they're dressed like. I need to -- I told you I won't tell everybody. But, we're watching all together, and when he confused the names of Trump and Harris, I am talking about Vice President, (inaudible), but it got better. Right? So, is that what you think?

So, the judge has asked to see that photo. They're going to take a look at it.

This is very technical, very legal, but the judge is going through it methodically. So, the jurors understand before they go back behind closed doors to deliberate what they need to look at and how they need to understand all of the evidence that they've seen in this case for the past nine weeks.Now, the judge is getting toward the end. He did say he expected the jury to have the case before lunch. So, we're waiting to see when he will finish this. But then, at that point, the jury will begin their deliberations. The Senator is accused of accepting bribes, those gold bars, nearly half a million dollars in cash that the FBI found when they searched his home, also a convertible. And in exchange, prosecutors say that he took steps to try to interfere with criminal investigations to benefit those New Jersey businessmen, and also that he took steps to help the government of Egypt, including by ghost- writing a letter for the Egyptians to use to try to sway other senators to move -- take actions in their favor. The Menendez team has been adamant that these were normal, that these were routine actions that the Senator was acting for his constituents, saying that he was doing his job and he was doing it well. As for the alleged bribes, they say those were just gifts from friends. Soon, this will be in the hands of the jury. Fred.",
