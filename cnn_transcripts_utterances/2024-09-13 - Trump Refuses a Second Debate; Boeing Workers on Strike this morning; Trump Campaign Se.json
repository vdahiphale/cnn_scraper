And, you know, the fact checking, ABC had an, a very easy job in the sense, because he repeats himself all day, he'd been talking about cats and dogs for two days. He was sending, you know, Truth Social, whatever they're called, notes about cats and dogs and pictures about cats with, you know, AR-15s. So, it gave them an opportunity to call him out on it. And that's important because to what the vice president did that night, she did basically the job of four or five people. She did her job of speaking to the camera and saying, here's what I want to do. She did the job of calling him out. She did the job of saying, what are you talking about? And that's tough.

I think it's weakness though. If he's really doing this to set up a Fox debate, I think it's weakness. And if he does well, people will say, well, it was on Fox. Do you know what I think Donald Trump should do? I think Donald Trump should say, I'd like Rachel Maddow to host the debate, and I'm willing to go to MSNBC or let Joy Reid ask me questions, that would show strength in the aftermath of what was clearly a defeat. I also think, in retrospect, having gone back and watched that debate a second time that there was so much more going on that was all cast in advance, all planned, all deliberate on Kamala Harris' part. Yes, the shaking of the hand like you talked about, but the reliance on, of all places, Wharton in terms of assailing his economic plan, the reference that she made to being a gun owner herself. And of course, talking about his rallies. Honest to God, I think when it's all said and done, Kasie, there'll be a book written and we're going to find out that there was professional psychological help relied upon on how you push his buttons, and it worked.",

Like there is something about him where if you touch on these certain things, he cannot resist going after them, and I kind of wonder if that's how perhaps you're thinking about the possibility of another debate, that he simply cannot resist the opportunity to get back on stage with her.",

The metric is that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by two and it wasn't enough. Joe Biden won the popular vote by four and it was a tell that therefore he was going to do well enough in the battleground states.So, if she is where she is in the national poll, it doesn't bode well for Trump in the battleground states.
