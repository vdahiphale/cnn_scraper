I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Straight ahead, from Washington to New York, a major morning of legal drama ahead for Donald Trump. In just a couple of hours, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider his claims of presidential immunity in a case that could have huge implications for this year's election. And next hour, Trump is due in a New York courtroom for the resumption of his hush money trial. We'll have full coverage for you right here. All right. We're about to witness one of the most significant days in U.S. legal history, and Donald Trump is at the center of all of it. In less than two hours, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider a monumental constitutional question, does the U.S. President have absolute immunity from prosecution for crimes committed while in office? The court's answer could determine whether Donald Trump can be tried for attempting to overturn the 2020 election. And at the same time, arguments are unfolding at the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump will be in a downtown Manhattan courtroom for continuing testimony in his hush money trial. Former tabloid executive David Pecker returns to the stand and is expected to finally start talking about his connection to the payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels. Trump got his day started early, making a campaign stop at a New York construction site where he visited with union workers before heading into the courthouse. We're covering all of the many angles of courtroom action today. Let's start with CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz in Washington. Good to see you this morning, Katelyn. So, a day like none other for Donald Trump ahead. The U.S. Supreme Court hearing on presidential immunity amid the hush money trial in New York. Take us through what we might expect today.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is going to be a major day for Donald Trump as a criminal defendant, somebody who is running for office again, but somebody who first and foremost has to face the courts. So, in New York in that hush money trial, he is going to be watching his longtime friend David Pecker, the tabloid king, the man over the National Enquirer, former chairman of American Media Incorporated, take the stand again to continue speaking about catch and kill schemes where his publication was in cahoots, and he is admitted to that with Michael Cohen, Donald Trump, the Trump campaign in 2016, to burry stories that would be negative about Donald Trump, especially related to alleged affairs with women.David Pecker has already articulated some of that. He is going to continue on, and we're going to get to see what the defense team, what Trump's team does to try and impeach someone like Pecker on the stand, try and discredit him, whenever they get to cross-examine him. That's in the courtroom that Trump will be in today. That's in New York in the hush money criminal trial ongoing in front of the jury. Separately, he is having lawyers before the U.S. Supreme Court in one of the most consequential cases about the American presidency in years where the U.S. Supreme Court justices are going to be hearing from the Justice Department and from Trump's team about protections around the presidency. How far that protection can go? Can someone who served as the President be charged with crimes for things that happened while he was in office? In this case, particularly, those charges are about the 2020 election and what Donald Trump was doing, leading up to and on January 6 of 2021 for that Capitol riot. One of the big things there I'm watching, Fred, is how much the justices want to talk about Donald Trump himself and the allegations against him, this specific case in federal court related to January 6 and the 2020 alleged conspiracy he is charged with, or if they want to draw back, take this out of the Trump piece of it and talk much more about the history of the American presidency, which direction they're going there.",

We know that from their legal briefs.But, we've also seen Trump's team trying to say that. Trump is -- they're trying to say Trump is being treated differently than other former presidents. And really, if the justices want to protect the presidency for all time, they need to make sure that there can't be charges against the President because it would spell disaster because of the way American politics currently is. That is a -- that's the other side of that argument. And we will have to see how much of the justices actually give credence to that.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Fredricka. Yes, there is just so much suspense, because this is an untested question. We know that in 1982 the justices ruled that a former President could be immune in a civil proceeding, but left wide open the question of a much weightier situation involving a criminal prosecution. So, I'm anticipating how they look at that precedent from 1982, involving former President Richard Nixon being immune in a civil context, and how much they kind of look and examine whether the criminal situation is just so much more serious that a President and cannot be shielded there. And I think, frankly, that the precedents that former -- that Special Counsel Jack Smith has raised will likely lead to that. So, that's kind of the overall framing of just basic immunity question.But then, Fredricka, I'll be listening for questions as to how the justices might start parsing some of the details. Are we talking only about official acts, or will they buy into the fact that maybe there were some private actions here that could be separated out? If the justices start asking questions, trying to parse whether Donald Trump's actions related to the 2020 election results, as he was protesting them, might have different characteristics in terms of being official, r being private in an effort to achieve a private gain, that could suggest that they might then want further proceedings in a lower court. And as you know, this has already been delayed from the original start date of early March that the trial judge was seeking to try Donald Trump on these four federal accounts that have been brought by the U.S. Justice Department and Jack Smith. So, we'll be looking for clues to whether they can have a clean ruling here that will just send it back for a trial, or if they, by Donald Trump's claim that he is number one, absolutely immune, or number two, maybe give him a partial victory here that allows him to keep delaying and delaying and stop the start of trial.

      "sentences": "All right. Let's take an even closer look at the legal arguments in both Mr. Trump's cases today. We're joined now by Bernarda Villalona. She was once a New York prosecutor, and now as a criminal defense attorney. Good to see you.So, Oh, my gosh, there is so much and we say there are two, but there're really kind of around three that are rising to the top today. But, how do you prioritize? Let's focus on the two. How do you prioritize the importance of the cases today, more immediately, the hush money trial where Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche is credibility is on the line, using the word from Judge Juan Merchan, while once good friend David Pecker is also back on the stand today? Or do you think the U.S. Supreme Court hearing today upstages and potentially threatens these criminal cases against the former President? BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, &amp; FORMER NEW YORK PROSECUTOR: No. I don't think that the United States Supreme Court hearings today is going to affect the New York cases, because I think the hearing before the United States Supreme Court, I think, is frivolous, in a sense. There is just no way that a President will have absolute immunity from any type of crime. And just to be clear, in New York, the Appellate Division has already ruled on that and told Donald Trump that he wouldn't be able to proceed with that type of argument. Also, Judge Merchan, that was an argument that was put before him, and Judge Merchan had said that the argument was too late in nature, and decided that the case must go forward. Either way, today, we're in New York. We're waiting for a decision on the contempt hearing for that gag order violation, and we're also continuing with the jury trial having to deal with the 34 counts of falsifying business records. Good thing that Donald Trump does have a team of attorneys in order to deal with both of these matters. But, as we go forward today, who knows at what time Judge Merchan is going to render a decision on those contempt charges. Hopefully, he'll do it before he starts court, because we know that every minute, every minute counts, because unless a decision is rendered, Donald Trump can continue making statements violating this gag order.",

      "sentences": "Right. And why wouldn't the judge render a decision before eyewitnesses, whether it's Pecker or others, who would take the stand today? Because, as you say, I mean, even this morning, Donald Trump went to a construction site, and again was saying disparaging words about the process, that he is being victimized and persecuted. So, what would preclude the judge from rendering a decision now before witnesses take the stand again?",

You had Wednesday off and they're back in court today. So, I don't think anything is stopping Judge Merchan from rendering decision. I think he is taking his time because he wants to be very meticulous with his words and the language that he uses, because this is going to be the first time that he is going to actually admonish officially in a criminal contempt hearing Donald Trump. And he wants to set the stage that if this happens again, if Donald Trump violates this gag order again, what are you going to do? What are going to be the ramifications of that? And he has to set that very clearly in his decision.So, if this happens again, Donald Trump knows that there is a possibility that he can face jail time, whether it's a couple of hours, where it's days, or whether it's up to 30 days, which is highly unlikely.",

And then, let me ask you about what now seems to be kind of a third case, even though we're talking about Arizona, even though the former President is an unnamed co-conspirator, but it does say former President in the complaint, in an attempt to influence or undermine the 2020 election results in that state of Arizona. So, former chief of staff Mark Meadows, former attorney Rudy Giuliani are among those indicted, their potential cooperation in exchange for say possible deals, that could change a lot potentially for the former President.

As a former prosecutor, sure, you can go forward with certain defendants and indict them in the grand jury, and that doesn't necessarily mean that you forego the chance of indicting others. Usually, what you can wait is to see if any of those, the defendants, that you've already indicted, whether they will be cooperating, whether they want to cooperate, and then tend to you better evidence, stronger evidence in a stronger ironclad case that would allow you to move forward with indicting possibly Donald Trump.So, if I were Donald Trump and his team, I would be concerned because we know Rudy Giuliani, he is running out of money. Actually, he is out of money. He can barely have made it to the arraignment in Georgia. Exactly. He had to have someone give him a ride to Georgia in order to make it there for the arraignment. So, in terms of Rudy Giuliani, I will be concerned, Mark Meadows, I will be concerned, because the cases are piling up against Rudy Giuliani and Mark metals. And we know that pressure, where applying a pressure does push people to make decisions. So, I will be highly concerned if I were Donald Trump.",

As you say, he has complained about that. And we now do see him next week starting to schedule some campaign events in between the days that he has to be in court, although he does have to be in that New York courtroom four days a week.It's also a distraction from the message of his campaign. The more the news is about these legal cases, whether it's the Supreme Court case, or the hush money case, the less he is talking about the issues where we do see him winning. Right? Voters do like his message on issues like the economy, issues like immigration. They do think that he is stronger on a range of issues than the current President. But, those aren't the things that he tends to be talking about, because he is so tied up and so fixated on these court cases, and because I think the court cases have become the core message of his campaign, as he makes this argument that it is a rigged system that is attacking him, and that the whole apparatus of the state, the establishment is in fact what he is campaigning against, as he runs for President.",

He used to be a great friend, as we just heard David Pecker describe. Now they no longer talk. But, Pecker is kind of telling all and is likely to elaborate on the arrangement made about how the former Attorney Michael Cohen would ask him and also participate in either collecting payments or keeping certain stories out of the headlines.I mean, this continues to be very damaging, does it not, for the former President. I mean, it speaks to his credibility as well. He says he is being railroaded, persecuted. But then, now you've got this corroboration on the witness stand saying he was an active participant in all of this.",

And this has been wall-to-wall, and it's only been a few days. We've got six to eight weeks of this in store. So, there is going to be a constant drumbeat of reminders of this years- old behavior. I do think there is a danger. If Democrats are hoping that this issort of a silver bullet for them, the voters sort of tune this out. I think there is a very high degree of cynicism in the American electorate about politics and politicians and Trump, in particular, voters sort of long ago made the assessment that particularly when it comes to his behavior with regard to women, his behavior before he was President, they didn't have a very high opinion of that, to begin with, and I do think a lot of them are probably tuning this out as just sort of a tawdry tabloid mess, and not necessarily following the details of it very closely. So, it will be interesting to see if it actually changes people's opinion of a man who they already have very firm opinions about and who has already been a very polarizing political figure for many years now.",

Nine counts, including multiple felonies in this indictment, and it broadly alleges that 11 fake electors from Arizona plus seven of Trump's closest allies after the 2020 election engaged in a conspiracy to quote \"deceive the people of Arizona into thinking that Donald Trump had won this state\" when he actually had not. And look, Donald Trump is not charged in this indictment, but he is referenced as unindicted co-conspirator number one. And the charging document makes very clear that this alleged conspiracy was carried out in service of him.I want to go through a few of these names that you mentioned, Mark Meadows and Rudy Giuliani, both very close aides and allies of Donald Trump. They're both charged in this document. Boris Epshteyn, who remains very close to the former President and was actually in court with Donald Trump when he was arraigned in the New York hush money case, he is charged in this case as well for the first time. We have not seen him face criminal charges for his alleged role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Christina Bobb, who you may remember, is a former Trump attorney, a former OAN host, she is also just was put in to a job at the Republican National Committee related to election integrity. She is charged for the first time in this case as well. So, prosecutors in Arizona, it's been about three years in the making this case has, but prosecutors in Arizona bringing this case in the immediate run-up to the 2024 presidential election, and bringing criminal charges against several big boldface names that were very close to Donald Trump in the time period after the 2020 election. Now, look, Republicans, and including some of the fake electors that are charged in this case, are already pushing back. The Arizona GOP is essentially calling this a politically motivated indictment. They're saying -- they're calling it a blatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power aimed at distracting the public. One of the fake collectors, Jake Hoffman, who is a sitting state Senator here in Arizona, also pushing back and calling this indictment political and saying he unequivocally did not commit any sort of a crime. But still, the wheels of justice are moving forward here in Arizona, and we're going to have to wait and see how this plays out. Donald Trump, again, not charged, but several people very close to him are, and prosecutors making very clear that their alleged crimes were done in service of the former President.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, this really isn't about the money. It's a little bit more about trying to control the flow of traffic. This entrance fee, this tourism tax, will be in effect for 29 days during the summer months. Today is a national holiday, Liberation Day here, and May 1 is a national holiday. And so, they're trying to integrate this or introduce it, let's say, during this very heavy time when people go to Venice. Now, Venice gets about 20 million people a year, and about two thirds of them don't spend the night there. And so, this tax is only for the people who do not spend the night. This is just for the day trippers.What you have to do essentially is to make your reservation online, and you get a QR code. And when you get into Venice, when you get to one of these control gates, you show the QR code. But, we were told, of the 107,000 who have registered so far to enter Venice today, only one in 10 have to pay because of course there are exemptions. If you were born in Venice, you will be free for life. If you have a house in Venice, if you live there, if you work there, if you're staying in a hotel, you don't have to pay. But, those two thirds of all the people who come to Venice, who stay in another city, who stay on a cruise ship, they will have to pay this five Euro. And the Mayor of Venice was telling us a couple of weeks ago that the purpose of this is to maybe deter people. People come to Venice seven days a week, but people tend to come on the weekend. And so, you only have to pay this tax during this heavy period of time, from April 25 to May 1, and then every weekend through the summer. So, there may be a family of four who don't want to spend an extra $20 -- 20 Euro. Maybe they'll decide we will go on a Monday, and that will sort of spread out the tourism. That's the idea. But, it's still very experimental. And they said they didn't have any glitches, the website, the apps, the QR codes all worked so far today. It's only an effect from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the days, these 29 days so far this year that this tax is in effect. Fredricka.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): About a year before the 2016 election, former Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin suddenly got $30,000 richer. The National Enquirer bought exclusive rights to a fake story he was peddling about a so-called love-child, fathered out of wedlock by Donald Trump with his housekeeper. RONAN FARROW, AUTHOR, \"CATCH AND KILL: LIES, SPIES, AND A CONSPIRACY TO PROTECT PREDATORS\": There was a pattern. That first $30,000 was paid to a Trump Tower doorman to squash a rumor that Trump had fathered a child with an employee. KAYE (voice-over): This was the first time, according to prosecutors, that the head of American Media Inc., David Pecker, who published the National Enquirer, had ever paid anyone for information about Donald Trump. For his part, Trump has always denied having the child in question. This is a copy of the signed source agreement between the doorman and David Pecker, who at the time was a Trump loyalist. The agreement reads, \"Source shall provide AMI with information regarding Donald Trump's illegitimate child.\"",
