      "sentences": "Well, we do begin here in New York, where the defense is continuing its cross-examination of former tabloid publisher David Pecker. Now, this week, Pecker has detailed several so-called catch and kill operations, which the prosecution argues were part of a much broader effort to keep negative stories about Donald Trump under wraps during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Remember, this was meant to influence the election. Those are the allegations.And now, we get to Karen McDougal's allegation of an affair with Mr. Trump, and that in the last hours has been the major focus. We are still waiting for a ruling from Judge Merchan. After his -- after this week's gag order hearing, the prosecution is accusing Trump of committing four new violations, and in response, the judge said he will hold a new hearing on the allegations next Thursday. Now, I want to alert you to what's going on, on the left hand of the screen. You can see some key updates from Donald Trump's trial. You can read along with us because, a reminder, there are no cameras allowed during these proceedings. We have many CNN reporters, though, inside the court, keeping us up to date on what's going on. Everything they see and hear will appear on that side panel. Joining us now is Katelyn Polantz. She is live for us in Washington. We've had the cross-examination now going on for about, what, today, about almost an hour and a half. They're really going through some parts of these agreements right now that can seem a bit tedious to the jury. I mean, what do you think the defense attorney Emil Bove is getting at?",

Katelyn, before I let you go, I do want to ask you about Trump's words coming in to the courthouse this morning. He did wish his wife a happy birthday, and said he would be going to Florida to join her, to celebrate her birthday. But, he also did something that it would seem would again violate the gag order. He called the judge here, again, one of the most highly conflicted judges he has ever seen. At what point will even the prosecution say, look, this cannot continue, because right now, we're looking at a hearing on Thursday and still no ruling?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The judge has very specific reasons for having this gag order, Paula. What he wants to do and what the prosecutors have reiterated over and over again, is that Donald Trump should not be intimidating anyone. He should not be intimidating jurors on this case, and he should not be intimidating witnesses as they're on the stand or possible witnesses that could be called in the coming days. He also is not supposed to say anything that could interfere with the work of the court's staff, the district attorney's staff, the family members of the lawyers involved, the staff or the court. That doesn't necessarily include the judge himself. He can comment about the judge. He can comment about the DA that brought this case, but he can't do things that would try to infect or hurt the integrity of the process in the courtroom.The issues that are going to be heard at this hearing next Thursday on the gag order, whether Donald Trump is in contempt of court for violating it four more times. That is about comments he has made in recent days about David Pecker, who is currently on the stand, calling him very nice. Prosecutors say that he is using his platform to signal to witnesses, he is going to be commenting publicly about what they say. And also, he has commented about the jury. That's another thing that the prosecutors want him held in contempt over. They want him to be fined multiple times. And of course, there is 10 other times he was commenting about Michael Cohen and the jury in this case, where prosecutors say he should be fined $1,000 for each of those 10 iterations that he has made in public.",

David Pecker, from what we can see in court from the transcripts we've seen, has been an incredibly composed witness for the prosecution, and he remains apparently very composed during this redirection. If you're the defense attorneys now for Donald Trump, you may not want to antagonize him. But, what can you do to really get to the heart of the prosecution's case? Because they laid out a very structured case with, as I say, a man who was -- seemed very certainly delivered in what he was saying and thoughtful.",

What I think the defense is trying to do in cross-examination, they've had some limited success here, is sort of dirtied up the issue, identify circumstances, other politicians that Pecker has helped sort of this idea that this is actually just standard operating procedures, as they keep saying, that he has done this for multiple people, this was nothing special. That may be well and true. He may have done this for other people. But, that's not the issue here.The question is, did you do it for Donald Trump? Was there this criminal scheme with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump to do these catch and kill operations tied to and in support of the campaign? And then, did that lead ultimately with Stormy Daniels to Michael Cohen having to falsify business records as part of that pay off because David Pecker wasn't willing to cooperate anymore? It's laying a foundation. Defense is trying to do what it can to muddy up the waters. I think they've done some decent job. But, I don't think they really hurt the government's case.",

This was, remember, just came out of a motion to throw out the indictment based on idea he had complete immunity from all these charges, for all these acts. They seem likely to say, no, you're taking that too far. Some of them, even his own lawyer, conceded in oral arguments, are purely personal acts.What will be interesting to see based off what the ruling is, whenever it does come out is, what instructions they give for the lower courts going forward? Do they want the courts, whether the Appellate Court and D.C. circuit or the trial judge, to hash out between the lawyers with pretrial motions, a legal separation between official acts and personal acts, or do they think that's something that can be better handled in jury instructions at trial? Depending on which path the Supreme Court sort of guides the lower courts, that'll give us a sense of whether or not there is any chance that case ever makes it to trial before the election, because if it's the former, if it's this legal fight, that they will never see the light of day until 2025, at the earliest.",

Law enforcement also used pepper spray to disperse what they call it an unruly crowd. Other schools are allowing protesters to remain in their encampments at least for now.

Of course, since then, that encampment has popped up.But, we know based on reporting from our colleague, Abby Washer, that the pro-Palestinian students participating in that encampment were told last night by the leaders of the group that so far these days- long negotiations have not provided anything that they are satisfied with, that the offerings from the university are simply falling too short based on that long list of demands, some of what you just broke down. But really, the key ones are being a divestment and also amnesty of the students and faculty that have faced disciplinary action in the past. Meanwhile, you have the university as well, what they want is the dismantling of that encampment, especially in this space that's typically repaired during this time of year for that annual graduation ceremony, a massive commencement event. So, this is what we're hearing. Then finally, we also understand, based on what some of the students that are participating in this event are saying, that part of that negotiating conversation is a possible statement that would be released by the Columbia University, or Minouche Shafik, the president of the university, potentially addressing that events of last week when the NYPD detained those students. So, certainly a lot of moving parts. But, I think that one thing is quite certain here is that there isn't really an end in sight, at least at this moment. We will be back on campus later today since it is still restricted access. The university will permit us to once again make our way back on campus in a couple of hours. So, we will certainly see if anything has changed and if there is more progress has been made in trying to bring things to a close.",

We are on a short break and we will get back to that testimony very soon.Now, when they come back, David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, will be back on the stand. This is in fact his fourth day of testimony. He is being cross-examined by defense attorney Emil Bove. Pecker has been testifying about conversations with Trump and Michael Cohen. Remember, he was Trump's lawyer along with a tabloid efforts to suppress stories that could have damaged Trump's 2016 campaign. Meantime, we are awaiting a ruling from Judge Merchan following a gag order hearing earlier this week. Prosecutors say Trump has committed four new violations. And remember, a new hearing on those allegations is set for next Thursday. Now, of course, Trump's trials are no doubt having a political impact on this campaign. A new CNN poll shows just 13 percent of Americans feel that Donald Trump is being treated the same as other criminal defendants. Most of the U.S. is divided on the matter, as you can imagine, with 34 percent saying he is being treated more leniently. And yes, 34 percent saying he is being treated more harshly than other defendants. For more now, we want to go to CNN's Alayna Treene. She is in Washington for us. Alayna, right? So far so normal.

And so, that's the backdrop against which the prosecution is asking David Pecker these questions.Now that we've seen the defense get into cross-examination, we see them trying to draw out from Pecker that this practice of catch and kill was not done only in the context of being for an election. He did it for other celebrities, and indeed other political candidates. He testified about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mark Wahlberg doing the same type of sort of checkbook journalism that we've been hearing about on the stand. So, it's all about context here.

So, those are sort of these extraneous other acts, other bad acts, sort of pattern evidence that could raise some eyebrows. Now, Judge Juan Merchan, in this case, has been very measured in what he chooses to allow and not allow. You always have to weigh in any context in a criminal case, the prejudicial versus the probative effect that the evidence is going to have on the jury.
