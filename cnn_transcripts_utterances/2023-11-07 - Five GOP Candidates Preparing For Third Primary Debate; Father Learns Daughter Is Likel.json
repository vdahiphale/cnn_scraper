She took on Tim Scott.I mean, she was really kind of firing at everybody on the stage trying to take control of the non-Trump lane of the primary. She hasn't quite done that yet. DeSantis is still very much alive and well and kicking, if you will, in that -- in that lane right. Now, the trouble for both of them, of course, is Donald Trump still very popular and still very dominant in this party primary. And so, to me, the real question tonight is, is this as an academic exercise? Is Trump already locked this thing down? And there's a lot of Republican voters who think that's true.",

They like him, but they want to vote for somebody who can win.Well, now you got everybody in the national media and all this polling saying, well, Trump's beating Biden. So, you know, for a Republican, it's like, well, I didn't -- why don't I just nominate the person I like, not the person that I sort of like? And I think that's what's, you know, sort of vaulting Trump forward here. And tonight, somebody is going to have to make an argument about why they would be better than Trump, that this theory that Donald Trump is disliked, or that there's people who want to jettison them out of the party. It's not currently backed up by the polls. So, I suspect Haley and DeSantis will be -- will be fighting over that argument tonight.",

The problem is, even if that consolidation took place right now, there's not a ton of evidence that Trump is sinking or that his image is degrading. I mean, remember underpinning all of this, is that Republicans quite liked Donald Trump.And one of the main problems they had with him after 2020 or even 2022 was, well, you know, we like him, but he's going to lead us to more and more losses. And right now, his campaign has pretty strong evidence that that may not be the case in 2024, that Joe Biden is circling the drain, and we're going to beat him no matter what. And so, that destabilizes this, you know, strategic, let's consolidate, and then we'll see that the Republican Party really doesn't like Donald Trump. There's just -- there's not a lot of polling evidence for that right now. And you know, all these legal travails, everything happening to him, it continues to propel him forward, and his campaign is projecting a lot of confidence about it at the moment. But we'll have a spirited conversation tonight and see if Haley or DeSantis can take control of this thing. By the way, it may also be the last opportunity for Tim Scott here having he's going to have an aggressive posture, but he needs to show the Republicans something if he wants to hang around much longer.",
