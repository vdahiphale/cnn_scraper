You know, today we have Marjorie Taylor Greene trying to -- seemingly trying to out Mike Johnson, Speaker of the House. Democrats are feuding about support for Israel.

While jobs -- were millions of jobs were lost under Donald Trump, you've had Joe Biden be the best job producing president we've had. Joe Biden inherited this crisis where Donald Trump was telling us to inject ourselves with bleach, Biden got us through that crisis.And now, after the whole world really suffering from a tough economy, our economy is showing signs of strength, that are the envy of the world around. We see manufacturing coming back in our economy, we see investments in everything from infrastructure, all the way from the environment, historic investments. And I just sat with some business leaders in the tech sector, and saying that CHIPS and Science Act that we did, is going to pay dividends for generations to come. He's got a story to tell. And even on the toughest issues, the Republicans have shown that they're about chaos and conflict, and not about solving problems. And the best example of that is the border bill that was passed out of the United States Senate, a bipartisan bill negotiated by one of their most conservative members that put tremendous resources at the border to protect us to better adjudicate issues down there. And then Donald Trump said, no. I don't want to get behind a bill that really has in it things that would actually solve problems.",

We're a country right now that is witnessing hunger and suffering of innocent people in Gaza, as well as in a lot of other conflict zones. And this is a tough time to lead.But President Biden on the world stage right now has stepped up in ways that have earned him the respect of our allies and peers all across the globe. Just talk to European leaders about what we're doing in Ukraine. And right now he is, and not him directly, but his team is negotiating between the terrorist organization, Hamas, and Israel to bring an end to this.

The hostages, including Americans that are being held, these are not easy issues and they shouldn't be judged on the politics of them. They should be judged on the work that needs to get done to resolve this conflict.And I'm grateful that President Biden is standing in the saddle, in a very difficult time to lead globally, making tough calls and trying to drive this conflict to a resolution to end the violence and resolve the situation in a way that ends this punctuated violence we've had there, whether it's what we just saw with the attacks on Israel in 2014, or what Hamas and Iran, and their proxies have been doing. This is tough times, and I understand the political ramifications scale. But this is really a time that should pull on our humanitarian heart. We need to get a lot more humanitarian aid into Gaza. But it also should pull on our larger ideals. As a guy who's traveled to the Arab countries in that region, from Egypt, to Saudi Arabia, to the UAE, to Israel, everybody says, ultimately, we have to end the terrorism of Hamas, Iran and their proxies, and ultimately get to a two state solution where the Palestinian people have dignity and security, and autonomy. And Israel has their security and autonomy as well. And that's what the Biden administration is really working towards.",

States where you can literally put a bounty out for a woman if she's trying to get abortion care, or states like Arizona where they're reverting back to a law when slavery was still the law of the land before the 13th Amendment. This is insanity.And for people who are survivors of rape, or incest, or who have serious medical conditions where abortion services could save their lives, we've created a country of chaos and suffering right now. That is all the result of what Donald Trump has done. And if he's president of United States and you don't think this is going to continue, listen to what he's saying. There are leaders in the Senate right now. They're saying we will pass a national abortion ban.

O'NEALgo through this a lot a lot of time when we critique these guys, you know these youngsters and these females they don't understand that all the stuff that they're getting ready to go through. We are the masters of that. So I was just you know, telling her how to handle adversity, how to handle, you know controversy and you know with a person like her you don't really want to come and say do this and do that. I would just come in and you know giving her encouraging words, you know Just telling her you know to hang in there because when you're the best player. And you play for a great coach like Kim Mulkey they stay on you, Phil Jackson stayed on me, Pat Raleigh stayed on me, Dale Brown stayed on me. You know, Dave Maduro, my high school coach, stayed on me. All the coaches that I played for stayed on me because when you're the best player you're expected to do everything. So I just told her I said listen I know your coach is a little hard on you, but you have to accept it because you're the best player. You know just uh, you know move on from that.",
