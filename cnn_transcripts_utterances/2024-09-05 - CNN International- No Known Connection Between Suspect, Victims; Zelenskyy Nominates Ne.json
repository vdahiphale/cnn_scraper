Just ahead new details about the tools Georgia law enforcement officials used as they responded to Wednesday's deadly mass shooting, we'll have that new reporting.Plus, a high stakes court hearing in Washington D.C. could decide the fate of Donald Trump's federal election subversion case, that hearing set to start in about two hours. And then Super Typhoon Yagi batters the Philippines and Hong Kong and heads toward China. We'll have a live update from Hong Kong straight ahead. One day after the deadliest school shooting in the U.S. so far this year, a community is grieving. Police have a 14-year-old suspect in custody, accused of killing two teachers and two students at Apalachee High in Winder, Georgia, just north of Atlanta. Authorities expect to charge Colt Gray as an adult for those murders. They add the gunman used an AR style rifle in the shooting. Investigators have not yet revealed a motive. We're also now learning the suspect was questioned by law enforcement last year in connection with online threats, but no charges were filed. Several students who lived through the terrifying experience on Wednesday spoke with CNN about what they saw, including the girl who sat next to the suspect in algebra class. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's the first hearing since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Trump has some immunity for official acts while he was president. Trump will try to keep the focus on the race for the White House. He is set to lay out his economic plan for the country at an event in New York later on today. CNN's Steve Contorno is joining us now from St. Petersburg, Florida. Good to see you, Steve.

It's one of those issues where his campaign feels most comfortable talking about and feels like they have the most solid ground going into these last nine weeks of this race.You talk about some of the issues. We expect him to talk about some of the issues on the economy that he has put forward for his second term, including an expansion of broad tariffs across the economy. He would also -- he also has proposed cutting corporate taxes and eliminating taxes on tipped wages. And this, of course, comes sort of in response a rebuttal I guess you could call it to Vice President Harris delivering some of her economic priorities yesterday. And it's really no wonder that both candidates are focusing on this issue, because when CNN went out to poll registered voters in across the seven most important battlegrounds, an average of 39 percent of them said the economy was their top issue, by far and away, the largest choice. But it's also an area where Harris appears to be catching up to Trump. Trump, over the spring, had a 20-point lead over Biden in these swing states on the issue -- when it came to the issue of the economy. Harris, though, according to our most recent polling, only trails Trump by about eight percentage points. So, as we get closer to November, as this race tightens, Democrats, Republicans, moderate voters, independents, they seem to be really focusing in on this particular issue is the one where they want to hear from the candidates and understand their plans. Of course, they're going to be delivering that this week, and then we're hoping to get even more of that next week at this first debate, which is now only five days away Fred.",

There are some pretty big decisions that have been made by the Parliament here in Kyiv.On the one hand, they did confirm, actually the dismissal of one of the Deputy Prime Ministers, Irina Vereshchuk, a little earlier. But I think the really big news out of Ukraine right now is that nominee that you were just talking about, that President Zelenskyy put forward for the foreign ministry position has now been confirmed by the Parliament here in Kyiv. His name is Andrii Sybiha. He is the Former Deputy Foreign Minister of this country, but was also for a very long time, the Deputy Head of the President's Office. So, this is someone who is very close to the Ukrainian President, to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, someone, clearly, who Volodymyr Zelenskyy trusts very much, and also someone who is very close to Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Chief of Staff, Andriy Yermak. And if we look at some of the things that the Ukrainian President has been saying over the past couple of days, Fredricka. He said he believes the next coming months are going to be absolutely decisive for the Ukrainians, because, of course, in the next couple of weeks, he is going to travel to the United States to possibly meet, or probably meet, President Biden, to then present a plan the Ukrainians say, to try and win the war. And he has said that in order to do that, he wants to have the strongest team around him, and clearly this is the new man that he wants to run the foreign ministry, which, of course, is so key in trying to drum up support for Ukraine internationally. So that certainly is the big news, as far as the politics is concerned here in Kyiv, is the fact that Ukraine now has a new parliamentary approved Foreign Minister, Fredricka.",

Now, some of the things that we're garnering from the battlefield is that the Russians have actually slowed down a little bit. The Ukrainians have managed to stabilize some of the fronts, but even more importantly, the Ukrainians are actually able to make gains in some other areas. This is one of those areas and one of the units that's doing that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Elite soldiers from Ukraine's Third Assault Brigade, get out of their armored vehicle and right into a massive firefight. One of the soldiers is wounded, the others scream for a tourniquet. [08:20:00] But the unit keeps moving. While Ukraine's army has been losing ground in many areas in this part of the Kharkiv region, they've turned the tide. Later taking several Russian dugouts the deputy commander says. The enemy has no results he says. Moreover, we have positive results. We've pushed the enemy back and captured a battalion line of enemy defense. While the Third Assault Brigade says they'll keep pushing forward Ukraine remains badly outmanned by the Russians. And the Third Assault Brigade wants ever more combat drones to be their great equalizer. This is their drone school they call the kill house. Drone technology is developing extremely fast on the battlefields in Ukraine, and the Third Assault Brigade believes in the future they will need even more drone pilots, so they training as many as possible, as fast as possible, to get them combat ready. They've already trained more than 1500 prospective drone aviators here, not just to fly the FPV drones effectively, but to use them as lethal weapons capable of destroying even tanks and armored vehicles. The greatest effectiveness of a pilot is his or her desire the school's boss tells me. FPV pilots are people of a special mindset. They know how to hit the target, what ammunition to use. The ammo is becoming more lethal as well. A different Ukrainian unit now acknowledging they're using a trial version of a fire spewing drone that drops an incendiary substance on Russian positions. But the Russians keep hitting Ukraine with much bigger munitions, missile strikes killing several people in Lviv in western Ukraine. Search and rescue crews recovering the bodies for hours. Kyiv's leadership has vowed revenge for Russia's aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities, a driving factor also for the soldiers attacking Russian positions on the northeastern front. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): So, as you can see, there are a variety of things going on, on the battlefield Fredricka. The Ukrainians are saying, though, that they continue to hope that the fact that they have their incursion into Russian territory will force the Russians to move some of the units that they currently have fighting in the east towards Russia's own territory and then help relieve some of those front lines in eastern Ukraine Fredricka.",

He said back in February -- you know we prefer Biden. He's more predictable. He's more experienced. But then over the summer, we had comments from him, for example, criticizing the U.S. justice system as political after Trump's criminal conviction. He then said that he supports Trump's detail free plan to quickly end the war in Ukraine. So, it really isn't clear at this point -- you know who exactly Russia supports?

I think that's the other thing we learn as Russia is pro-Trump and anti-whoever the Democratic Candidate is Biden or Harris. This has been since 2016 really about sowing division as well. They've traditionally amplified both extremes on the right and the left. But I will say right now for Putin, his overarching goal is, of course, to win the war in Ukraine, and so anything he can do to weaken Western support for Ukraine does further that aim. And we've seen this with all sorts of sort of hybrid attacks by Russia in various different ways, not just disinformation. The other thing to note, though, is that Russia seems to be growing in sophistication when it comes to these disinformation efforts. If you look at the evidence presented by the DOJ and the FBI, this company that CNN has named as Tenant Media, operating out of Tennessee that the Department of Justice alleges that two employees at RT, the Russian State TV channel, set up and funnelled almost $10 million into to try to sort of build up this bank of online videos. They seem to be, if you look at them broadly, in support of Trump, but that is a more sophisticated campaign than we've seen in the past. And secondly, the FBI, evidence that they've put forward shows that a number of companies that they believe were run directly from the Kremlin have even used AI generated content to try to sow this information online, all of it trying to bolster pro-Russian policies and, of course, influence U.S. voters.",

There are still people who are undecided. She's going to try to lay out very clearly her economic policies, her policies on reproductive rights and on the border. And then she's going to try to draw a really strong contrast between who she is as a prosecutor, as someone who wants to uphold the rule of law, and Trump as essentially a convicted criminal, and someone who only cares about himself. Where she does the strongest in terms of polling is in answering the question, who cares more about people like me? And I think that's what she's going to be trying to do, appealing broadly to the middle class, to independents, to moderates. This is sort of at the end here. She's already really energized her base, and that's what she's going to be trying to do. I mean, based on what Trump said in the town hall, he might not even prepare. He tends to not prepare that much because he doesn't need to know that much about policy. And he's already hedging about the debate. He's already saying that it's not going to be fair, that because it's being run by ABC, she's going to get the questions ahead of time, which is not true. And he's already casting doubts on the legitimacy of the debate and on ABC as a news organization, something that autocratic leaders tend to do.

And I think that's why she wanted the mics to be free. Having the mics off while she is talking means he's not going to interrupt her much. But that doesn't mean that he's going to be able to control himself. I mean, thus far, that's been his playbook. I mean, it's been so bad he's even comparing their appearance that he is better looking than she is. I mean, all these kinds of things, showing no discipline is not going to win him more voters. And of course, I'm sure he's being trained and told by his advisors to really focus on economic policy, inflation and immigration issues, and not to engage in these personal attacks.",

He's been involved in initiatives with the Italian government to try and reverse this trend. And he's talked in the past lamenting couples who don't have children. He's even told the story of seeing a woman pushing a pram in St. Peter's Square and looking in to see that it wasn't a child, a baby, but a pet dog. So, it is something that he has talked about a number of times. But the main focus of his trip to Indonesia has been interreligious dialog. He was at the Istiqlal Mosque here in Jakarta earlier today for a meeting with faith leaders. [08:45:00] And he was, as you said, celebrating a mass in the National Stadium in Jakarta for tens of thousands of people. It's been a whirlwind tour so far. This is the last full day of his time in Indonesia. Next up is Papua New Guinea. Then it's East Timor and then Singapore. For an 87- year-old Pontiff, it's a gruelling schedule.

Before it intensified into a super typhoon as a tropical storm, it left a trail of destruction in the Philippines, where it took the lives of over a dozen people. And here in Hong Kong, the T8 signal has been raised as the third highest typhoon signal here in the first time that has been raised this year, and that effectively shuts down the city. Many businesses here have been shuttered. Flights have been suspended. In fact, 38 flights today were canceled, according to the Hong Kong International Airport. And looking forward to tomorrow, schools will be closed. Ferry service has been suspended as well. And Hong Kong's influential stock exchange that's worth trillions of dollars will be suspended under the T8 level alert. I'll give you some context about where I am right now. I'm in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay, which is one of the densest shopping districts in the world. Usually on a Thursday night, you would see throngs of people behind me going out for a late dinner, going out shopping, very few people out and about.

Well, he's a conservative grandee, but you'll remember him best as the Brexit negotiator for the EU. Now he's considered here by many as a safe pair of hands. But Fredricka, I want you to cast your mind back to that snap election and the hung parliament that was a result of that election. You remember that the left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, did actually win the highest number of seats in that election, so they had that highest number of MPs. And historically, French presidents usually pick the prime minister from the party or coalition that has the highest number of MPs. But this time, Emmanuel Macron rejected the candidate put forward by that left wing coalition and went with Michel Barnier. As you can imagine, this has angered the left. They are now calling for Emmanuel Macron to resign. They're saying that this is a denial of democracy, and they're saying that they are going to start protesting on Saturday Fredricka.",
