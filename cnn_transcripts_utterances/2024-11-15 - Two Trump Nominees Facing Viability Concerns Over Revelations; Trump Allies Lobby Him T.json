Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. Are doors closing in on Donald Trump's cabinet before it's even stocked? Tonight, a woman told the House Ethics Committee that she saw Trump's pick for attorney general have sex with a minor. That's according to her lawyer. Now, remember, Matt Gaetz is Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, the very department that investigated him for sex crimes and ultimately did not pursue those charges. In a statement, Gaetz's team responded to saying, quote, Merrick Garland's DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn't charge him. Are you alleging Garland is part of a cover up? There is, however, trouble for another Trump pick, the defense secretary nominee, Pete Hegseth. Pete Hegseth's past is causing some headaches down in Mar-a-Lago. We are told tonight that Trump's team is now raising questions about his viability after word surfaced of a 2017 sexual assault allegation. The former Fox host was not charged or named as a defendant in any case, regardless, though, the revelation caught Trump's team off guard. And it underscores their lack of vetting, perhaps, among these nominees. We're here at the table. You know, I mean, you have to wonder, is there anything that would tank Trump's nominees in this environment, in which they've got a pretty clear majority in the Senate, in which I think most of the senators seem pretty happy to just let Trump do whatever? FMR. REP. CHARLIE DENT (R-PA): Well, I would say, in the case of Matt Gaetz, I bet they're going to have to withdraw his nomination. I think that's a bridge too far. No one should underestimate how much these House Republicans dislike him. I mean, dislike is actually -- that's a dramatic understatement to use that term to describe how much they dislike him, the House Republicans. So, I think he's got a problem. You know, that ethics report that's looming. There's a good chance that might come out as well, and those reports are not pretty. I was chairman of that committee, and I can tell you, you know, you don't resign from Congress if that report's going to be clean. It's not going to be clean. And there could be a referral in there, too, to the Department of Justice. That happens from time to time, plus sanctions of all sorts.",

It's also true that Donald Trump's DOJ initiated this investigation. It seems to undermine Gaetz's own justification for wanting to wreck the Justice Department. They're not pursuing justice against him, apparently, and that's not a conspiracy, but he's been dealing with this for a really long time.

She had apparently encouraged this minor to sell herself on seeking arrangements, a dating website, and act in a prostitution fashion, knowing the young woman was underage. [22:05:07] Therefore, this witness herself was, by her own admission, essentially guilty of sex trafficking a minor herself. That's the reason, in part, that DOJ never brought these charges.",

But these are interesting picks. Part of it I think is the shock and awe factor of Donald Trump trying to showcase just how far he can go. The other part is him basically owning the party.

Look, in this country, the way that we determine that agencies have abused their authority or violated the law is we do investigations, we look at the evidence and we hold people accountable. The problem with Kash Patel is that, you know, we don't make sweeping decisions based on melodramatic statements like, you know, the FBI is corrupt, so we need to clean house.
