What he did over 90 minutes last night, and not only because she baited him -- many times it was because of his choices and what he chose to emphasize -- he reminded the country of everything else that goes with Donald Trump being back in the White House. I mean, I still think there is room and necessity for her to imprint on voters more of what she would do to make their lives better. But in terms of the personal contrast that was established last night of her as someone who is kind of steady, strong, normal and Trump, angry, chaotic, kind of out of control, it's not clear to me why they would want to risk another debate and have anything other than that personal contrast be what Americans are thinking about.

Talking about sororities and fraternities -- historically Black fraternities and sororities as some kind of party, dismissing their importance. Once again, bringing up the whole Black jobs things.
