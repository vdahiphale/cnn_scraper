The measures unveiled hours ago target Russia's financial sector and defense industry. They also sanction multiple prison officials connected to the Kremlin critic's term in a penal colony.

      "sentences": "Well, that's the big question, Eleni, is whether these sanctions are going to actually have an impact now.Russia is already the most sanctioned country in the world. They have managed to weather, the many, many sanctions that the US and the international community have already put on their economy in the last two years since they launched their invasion of Ukraine, and many of the sanctioned entities and people that were targeted today by this new package, were already subject to extensive sanctions. And so the question now is what difference will this actually make? Now, in one of the more notable aspects of these sanctions, as you mentioned, the US did target three Russian prison officials who officials say were connected to the death of Alexei Navalny. He was, of course being held in that penal colony and these prison officials, according to the US, were involved in essentially torturing him until he died. And so those were sanctions that were added over the last few days to this very large package that the administration had been planning to mark the second anniversary of the war. Now, Russia has managed to weather these sanctions extremely well. They have managed to adapt. And if anything, their military spending, their budget has only increased over the last two years. So now the administration is saying, look, we never expected the sanctions to start working right away. We anticipate that these are going to have more of a long-term impact. But of course, Ukraine does not have that kind of time. They need relief now. They need the US Congress to pass the supplemental funding for them right now so that they can get that $60 billion in aid that the US had promised them. They don't have time for these sanctions against Russia to start kicking in, in a year or two or even more. And so now the question is how is the administration going to get that supplemental bill passed? That is something that President Biden emphasized today is still a very key priority -- Eleni.",

So if you really begin to focus the enforcement of these sanctions, that those that are violating them in a more meaningful manner, it does have the deterrent effect, and there are some lessons learned from sanctions against Iran historically, where more significant enforcement of existing sanctions made a real difference.",

I think the challenge with these sanctions has always been the needs of people continuing to trade with Russia, and even just to note, G7 countries are continuing to export roughly $3 billion a month of consumer goods of apparel, of medicine into Russia. So the trade between Russia and the rest of the Western world still continues.

When you think about what it took to get to Apollo 11 to the Moon, that was inflation adjusted dollars, probably about a trillion. So this is a different way of approaching space. It's very similar to what NASA has been doing in low Earth orbit over recent years. The emergence of SpaceX, Blue Origin, et cetera, and why not take that philosophy and take it to the moon? That's the idea and it requires, you know, it can create some nail biting moments, there's no question. But this kind of lean mean approach, apparently is on its way to success.

You know, I guess the argument is that investment into the space sort of petered out over the decades, but surely, it should have been easier than what we actually saw transpire over the past while. O'BRIEN: Yes, everybody asks about this. Well, you know, first of all, let's go to the budget. It's a less expensive approach, there's no question. Going to a part of the moon, which is much more rugged than the equatorial regions where the Apollo missions landed, and landing on the moon is hard on a good day. And let's not forget that Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong at the controls of the lunar module, if the guidance system had done its job without a human there, they would have crashed on a boulder. And so the human intervene in the final moments to save the day. So what we're trying to do is replicate the human brain here, 80 billion neurons, human vision in a machine that is, you know, built on a tight budget.

Now the company has made a surprising revelation. For the first time ever, NVIDIA now considers Huawei as one of its top competitors according to its annual report. The controversial Chinese chip maker is now a major rival in four out of five of NVIDIA's main businesses, including the crucial production of AI processes. Now it's significant because Huawei spent the last four years facing tough US restrictions, banning its access to technology. Despite that, last year, Huawei shocked the tech world by launching a new phone powered by advanced chips. It's all part of a wider battle between Washington and Beijing over semiconductor technology. Several countries, including the US and Japan have imposed a series of measures to try and limit China's access to advanced computer chips, and Beijing has been investing heavily to try and develop its own domestic chip industry. These rising tensions and restrictions have already hit NVIDIA sales in China, and the company warned that things are unlikely to change anytime soon. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

SEBASTIAN (on camera): Well, in the context of this 1,000 kilometer frontline Avdiivka doesn't actually change much. In fact, the whole second year of the war barely changed this picture. Russia, of course captured Bakhmut in May in Ukraine. You can see here in yellow, that string of villages that it managed to take in western Zaporizhzhia as part of this counter offensive, but this was ultimately a year when neither side was able to gain an advantage. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Russia now might be this video posted on February 12, which CNN has geo located to the area around that of Avdiivka hospital purportedly shows Russian strikes using massive half ton glide bombs. These are known to be increasingly in use on the battlefield and capable of evading Ukrainian air defenses. The satellite image shows several very large craters near the hospital and likely to be the result of artillery strikes weapons experts say. F-16 fighter jets would help combat these bombs.

We do even export the (INAUDIBLE) outside of Ukraine to neighboring European Union. And this is good for that what is happening now. But what we need is not only win this war frontline, we need to win economic war. We need to keep investing in the country. And that's basically what we demonstrated as a company, as a state. We build new wind from during the war. And because it's much more resistant than conventional power stations. So, we try to come to our foreign partners and demonstrate and make a showcase from what we are doing during these two years. We shouldn't see Ukraine as a war zone, you should consider that this country with huge opportunities which will come. It's better to be prepared for these opportunities now.

Instead, they turn to kerosene, coal, charcoal, or even wood for cooking fuel, but in doing so they often expose themselves to household air pollution, which can be deadly. Some 700,000 premature deaths each year are linked to burning harmful fuels at home. And this week's Connecting Africa I spoke with a company in Uganda that's trying to address this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GIOKOS (voiceover): Lively illuminated streets, the hum of the convenience store, and the buzz of a late-night haircuts.

      "sentences": "Yes. So you remember last Friday, the judge issued this ruling, the $355 million that Trump owed plus interest.And the way that this comes about, this is money that Trump is paying back that he received as part as what they call ill-gotten gains or money that ways that he benefited from the fraud. And in this case, the allegations and what the judge found to be true is that Trump received better interest rates when he took out certain loans and got some insurance policies. So it was that benefit that the judge has calculated here. And that was, you know, he relied on expert testimony during the trial as well. That is the money, the $355 million. Now, he also said on Friday that it would include interest which we all back of the envelope calculated to about $99 million. Today that is now official, it is $99 million in interest. So that brings the total that Trump will have to come up with to $454 million. But the judge is saying that this interest will continue to accrue at nine percent until this case is over. And this means that, you know, as Trump is looking to appeal this judgment, which he has said that he will, that money will continue to grow until that's over. And of course, if he is successful and the number now is knocked down, then he will pay less. But -- so now that this judgment is officially entered into the case, once Trump is served as well as his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are also found liable. Once they are served in this case, then they will begin to start their process of appealing and that starts at 30-day clock. So Trump's team will have 30 days to come up with this big number, almost half a billion dollars that he will have to either put up in cash or post a bomb that is backed by some collateral cash, one of his properties. So this really is going to kick off this 30-day window for him to put up that money, to come up with this money while he's running for president, while he's facing for criminal cases. A lot of strain on them and raises questions for the Trump organization and how it will be led going forward. Eleni?",
