I'm Manu Raju.Former President Donald Trump is responding this morning to the attempt at his life at his rally in Pennsylvania yesterday evening. Writing on social media, it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening. And just moments ago, the former First Lady, Melania Trump, reflected on how her family was on the brink of a, quote, devastating change, adding a monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion, his laughter, his ingenuity, love of music and inspiration.\" As you can see from this new video overnight, Trump is OK as he arrived in New Jersey where he spent the night at his Bedminster Golf Club. He says a bullet pierced part of his ear as he was speaking to a crowd filled with thousands of supporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Two others critically injured and the shooter is dead.Overnight, the FBI identified the suspect as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Investigators say he fired multiple shots from an elevated position just outside of the rally and used an AR style weapon. A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation tells CNN the shooter had explosive material inside his car and residence. They are still investigating the motive. The big questions, how could this have happened? Why did this happen? And what does it mean for an already hugely consequential campaign? Now President Biden is back at the White House after rushing back from Delaware. He addressed the nation and spoke with Trump last night. A call described by sources as brief and respectful. Now Biden and Vice President Harris were briefed again this morning. And this all comes right before the start of the Republican National Convention tomorrow where Trump is expected to announce his vice presidential pick. Now let's start with CNN's Kristen Holmes. And, Kristen, you have some new reporting on that call between President Biden and former President Trump. What are you learning?",

Obviously, they communicated through moderators at CNN's debate last month.But other than that, they have had nothing but a tense relationship. But I did talk to a source who was briefed on the call who, as you said, noted that it was good, said that it was short but respectful, but said that they were moving forward. This has been an often very bitter rivalry between these two men. Now I also spoke to aides and advisors of the former presidents who appeared to be shaken, but defiant. I heard people saying, they were very concerned about the teams that were on the ground. Many of these advisors and aides are with Donald Trump all the time asking questions that really all of us are asking, which is how did this happen? How is this able to actually happen? And if they really believe that if he had been just centimeters in one way or another, that he could have been killed. But yet, I also am hearing from them that they are feeling very defiant that the former president himself is in good spirits. Here's what he posted this morning on Truth Social. He said, \"Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who are wounded and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who is so horribly killed. In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand united and show our true character as Americans remaining strong and determined and not allowing evil to win.\" Obviously, a statement there calling for unity. Now we do expect Donald Trump to go to Milwaukee later today, but I am told by a source that this is still fluid. These were the original plans. Obviously, anything could shift at any moment. But as you noted, and this is a really critical time period because it's also the start of the RNC. He still hasn't named his vice president, he's -- who he's going to choose for that role. So all things that we're keeping an eye on in this really unprecedented time.",

Obviously, it has immediate impact into the context in which this convention will take place now, but also into the tenor and the tone at the launch of this convention. Now you're hearing delegates and others arriving here talking much more about, you know, strength and resilience and fortitude and calls for unity. So we have learned, according to somebody familiar with convention planning that some of the program will be impacted, including a moment of silence that will be built into the program now for the one victim that lost their life at this horrific incident in Butler, Pennsylvania. And we should stay on alert for other potential programming changes to be announced in the hours and days ahead here. It is impossible for this event not to impact this convention. But as you know, the RNC Chairman, Michael Whatley, and the campaign advisors to Trump put out a statement saying the convention is moving forward and you heard from the former president himself.

Building explosive devices that actually work is more complicated. Usually it requires some type of expertise. So I think that they'll be looking heavily at that.

I mean, we came millimeters away from losing the major Republican, you know, candidate for the office of the presidency and the former -- you know, who was also the former president of the United States. I mean, the Secret Service can never let that happen again. Never put a protectee in a situation where there's this type of vulnerability. So I do think that this is a real seminal moment.

[11:20:13] ISAAC ARNSDORF, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, WASHINGTON POST: Yes. So the security was, you know, airport style security, very similar to what I'm used to at a -- at a Trump rally, standard, you know, walking through a metal detector, having your bags searched. You know, the only things that stood out yesterday, until about six o'clock when Trump took the stage, it was a very large crowd. I mean, it was a miles long line of cars. It took me an hour just crawling in that line to get into the site. And the fairgrounds were really full with thousands and thousands of people. This was really large, even by Trump rally standards. And then the other thing was the heat. You know, it was 90 degrees. It was -- it was cloudless sky. There was no cover in the -- in the outdoor venue. There are a lot of people dealing with dehydration and heat exposure. And Trump was 45 minutes or an hour late. So there was quite a bit of impatience waiting for him to get there.",

And on a sunny day like that, we were kind of sitting under the platform just for shade. And then when we -- when we heard the gunshots, that immediately became where we were taking cover. And, you know, I remember thinking that -- I remember hearing from people who have been in shooting situations that it doesn't sound like, you know, that deep crack like in movies. It sounds much more like a high pitched pop or a snap, almost a click. And so it did occur to me immediately that that's what was happening. And there were two bursts. And then finally one solitary shot, which was over pretty quickly. And then there was a period that felt like a long time of looking where we couldn't see Trump behind a lector in there, covered by Secret Service until he stood up with their assistance. And, you know, no one -- no one ran, which was partially because of just how crowded it was impact, and particularly for the people on the bleachers, like there was nowhere to go, but also such intense focus on Trump and kind of everyone looking to see what happened to him. And it was when he rose and lifted his fist that you can see that huge reaction from the crowd, which is something of an outpouring of relief, but also anger.

And in my judgment, the better role is the one of being the unifier. That's what Reagan did when he came into office.There were a lot of questions about him. There were a lot of division in the country. And after he was shot, you know, he became a father figure. And he used it to produce a sense of humor about things. For example, as he was being wheeled into the operating room, surgery room, he looked up at all the doctors. He said, are all of you gentlemen Republicans or not? And when he was in the hospital room, people would go in. He would be sitting there with a Bible. And they would say, what are you doing with a Bible? You're a very secular person. He said, I'm looking for loopholes. And that endeared him to the country. I think that Trump has an opportunity now, as he becomes the nominee and becomes more of a national leader as opposed to the sectional leader or conservative leader, he's got an opportunity to do something that he hasn't done so far in this whole campaign, and that is to bring us all together. And to bring us all together in a high plane.",

Who cheered and cheered and cheered because the leader was back.And it transcended some of the smaller issues. And it made it possible for Reagan to go on to be one of our more successful presidents as in his -- in his genre. You know, so I think that the past is clear that this country will produce a wave of support and sympathy if Trump now reaches out and says, ladies and gentlemen, we have to work together.

To dive more into all of this, I'm joined by two great CNN reporters. CNN's Phil Mattingly, the Chief Domestic Correspondent, and Kayla Tausche, CNN's Senior White House Correspondent. Good morning. Good to see you guys. So just on the convention first. I mean, because typically, as we know, conventions are incredibly partisan affairs to say the very least. Now this happens. How does that impact the messaging, the Republican messaging on this? Do they tap it down? Do they get right back into it? How do they -- how do they navigate this?",

      "sentences": "The reason I'm pausing is because I'm thinking about what David Chalian just said about, you know, how's this going to affect the politics of the campaign. And the humility that David just reflected there, if we don't know, I think is an important moment that everybody should kind of take some time to consider here. We have no idea how this is going to play out over the course of the next three or four months.One thing I do think we can be sure of, and I know this, I was talking to some folks who are speaking at the convention, and everyone I spoke to who is, is planning to note this or make a point of what happened and what transpired over the course of the last 24 hours in their remarks. One person told me, they should put the photos, photos by AP's Evan Vucci, Anna Moneymaker, Doug Mills, photographers we all know quite well from the White House press corps, just put them on a loop throughout the convention. And the reason why is because, yes, they have a defiant view right now of this moment in time, but they also think that it shows such a critical component of Donald Trump's campaign, which is strength, the contrast of what they view as strength versus weakness of the current administration, what they view as a president who consistently shows strength against a president that they don't believe does. And so that will be a key component of all this. I think the idea that this is going to be some moment where the country comes together and unifies, to David's point, that seems to be undercut by politics we've all been through over the course of the last seven, eight, nine years. I think the real question right now, coming out of this moment as everybody tries to get their heads around it is, does this escalate? Does this get into even more dangerous territory than it already has to the extent that's possible?",

This is never about the people who are always going to vote either against Trump or for President Biden. This is about those people in the middle.They're -- it's a very small slice of the population of the electorate, but where they decide to go and how this influences them. And I don't think you can take one night in one moment to define what that's going to be. It's going to be how the campaigns play this out going forward.

And the question now is, what does this look like for the Biden campaign?

And look, you already heard, even as they're all just talking about unity and tapping down the rhetoric and stuff, not so much in some of the quarters, some allies pretty close to Trump, including potentially his vice-presidential pick, which we could know maybe today, maybe tomorrow. We'll see maybe earlier in the week. We don't exactly know when Donald Trump will announce his vice- presidential pick, but it could be imminent.J.D. Vance is on the top of that list, the Ohio Republican senator. He tweeted in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination. Now, again, we don't know the motivation of this suspect. They're still investigating that. That is a key aspect of it here. But you're already hearing some Trump allies seizing on this and trying to turn it into something that is a wedge issue of sorts, including someone who could be the number two on the ticket.",

There's -- there's a couple of audiences that perhaps Senator Vance is looking towards.I think there's two pieces of this. The first piece is, look, Republicans are really angry. And that should be like an obvious statement, of course, in this moment in time. But the number of people I heard from last night, people who aren't like diehard Trump supporters who are just have had a visceral response to this and their belief that this was driven by things that have occurred that Democrats have said or Democrats have acted upon over the course of the last year. It's very real whether or not you believe the evidence behind it. The other thing I would say here is, look, every speech that Donald Trump gives, he talks about if Joe Biden wins, the country dies. If Joe Biden wins, everything is over. The Constitution falls apart. So let's be real here. Like, this isn't because this Joe Biden says Donald Trump is an existential threat.
