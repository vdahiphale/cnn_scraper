And new today, the U.S. military is working on a way to possibly detect life beyond Earth.The Pentagon developing what's called portable UFO detection kits as officials investigate reports of unknown objects. CNN's Kristin Fischer is here with the details on this. All right, so the Pentagon says the U.S. has never found any evidence of alien technology. What are they hoping to accomplish with these kits?",

      "sentences": "Well, they still don't know what a lot of these UAPs that have not been identified, they still don't know what they are. And so the Pentagon has announced that they are developing these portable UFO or UAP detection kits. They're calling them Gremlin.And what they're doing is they're hoping that this will allow them to respond faster to UAP sightings. And then once they get there, they hope that it will allow them to collect a bit better data. And I'll let Timothy Phillips, who's the acting director of the Pentagon's office that investigates UAPs, called AARO, explain a bit more about it. He says: What we're doing is developing a deployable, configurable sensor suite that we can put in a pelican case -- those big black kind of briefcases, right? And since the UAP target, the signature is not clearly defined, we really have to do hyperspectral surveillance to really try to capture these incidents. Hyperspectral means across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, so everything from ultraviolet waves and X-ray to radio waves. And then that signature that he's talking about, he's talking about things outside the normal signature of flying objects. So most jets emit a heat signature because they have a hot engine. A lot of these unidentified UAPs don't do that. And so the U.S. military is testing them at a big range in Texas right now, testing these Gremlin kits. And then they hope to actually use them over some national security sites, military bases, Navy ships, places where a lot of these UAP sightings have been concentrated.",

However, Brianna, I will also point out that while it does say that, you know, most of the UAPs, it attributes them to ordinary objects, phenomena, and the result of misidentifications, most sightings. But the report which dropped today still does not explain the UAP sightings by military pilots that testified on Capitol Hill. So some big questions still out there.",

Not enough trucks with supplies are making it in.Even the ones that make it in are then very hard to distribute the food, the clean water, everything else to children and families inside of Gaza because of that fighting and because it's hard to get around.

So instead of seeing an increase of supplies making it in, we're actually seeing a reduction. And once trucks make it inside Gaza, often some of these deliveries then, particularly to the north of Gaza where 250,000 people have had almost nothing over the past 150 days, those trucks are then particularly not making it through to the north.",

You can buy a sauna there, even go on vacation, take a trip to Hawaii or a cruise. So they're really trying to sell themselves as this one-stop shop with these unexpected items, kind of surprising products you can find.And the strategy is paying off for Costco. You know, it's been one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers that has been able to survive this kind of retail apocalypse and all of these bankruptcies that we've seen the past few years.
