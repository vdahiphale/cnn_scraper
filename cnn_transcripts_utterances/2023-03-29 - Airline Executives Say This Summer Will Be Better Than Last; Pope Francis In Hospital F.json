The markets, I wouldn't sayebullient, but they are certainly enthusiastic -- perhaps is the best word -- 278 points, nearly one percent for the Dow. That green has been solid all day. We'll talk about that as the hour moves on. Those are the markets and these are the main events that we are following: Strikes threaten aviation summer. I speak to the Big Three where there is cautious optimism on how the summer will go. UBS is bringing back Sergio Ermotti overseeing the challenges of merging with Credit Suisse. Tonight, the Governor of the National Bank of Belgium here live on the program. And today, flying around the world often means going the long way or the wrong way. A comfortable way if you're in a certain seat. You'll hear from the CEO of FinAir tonight. We are live from Brussels where the Airlines for Europe Summit has been taking place. It's Wednesday. It's March the 29th. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, in Brussels, I mean business. Good evening. We are in Brussels tonight because this is where the Airlines for Europe have been holding one of their meetings. This is when all the major airline CEOs of the member companies, all the three big groups -- IAG, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, along with Ryanair, Wizz Air is not a member, but all the others come here to Brussels and meet with the various regulatory officials. The Belmont Building behind me that you can see, for some reason, it is not lit up tonight. Maybe it's an energy saving measure. But what they are most concerned about, of course, the lessons from the summer of hell, 2022 when pent up demand, staff shortages, there were lost bags, some never came back, delays, cancellations, truly a dreadful business. The senior executives say this year will be better. To be sure though, whilst they may have staffed up and the infrastructure may be better, they are facing labor issues, strikes in Germany, France and elsewhere and the CEOs tell us disruption is not over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL O'LEARY, CEO, RYANAIR: I think we're going to have a very strong summer, but it's going to be fraught particularly where the French Air Traffic controllers are rebelling and revolting.",

O'LEARY: I think that would be generous. No progress has been made. But I mean, that's why we're here. We come here twice a year to Brussels to point out that this Commission led by Ursula von der Leyen, Commissioner Valean has done nothing for the last three years to advance reform of the Airport Charges Directive, to advance reform of U261, which was promised 10 years ago, or to deliver Air Traffic Control Reform, which was promised 23 years ago, and nothing has been done.

Firstly, we've just taken delivery of 51 new aircraft this winter from Boeing. So we can grow -- I think, in the next 12 months will grow from 168 million passengers to about 185 million passengers. We're seeing huge growth in Italy where Alitalia is reducing its fleet; in Portugal where TAP is reducing its fleet. There's extraordinary growth in Central Europe, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovak Republic.

The problem with Airbus is the price has never been right. We have enough aircraft to grow out to 2026 or 2027, but we'll need more aircraft deliveries from 2027 onwards. Firstly to maintain growth across Europe and keep fares down. And remember, if Ryanair doesn't grow in Europe, Lufthansa and BA and Air France will just keep putting up the prices, so it's important we grow so we can keep them all honest, and we want to take out some of our older aircrafts because by the time we get to 2027, some of our original aircraft will be approaching 24 or 25, and it will be time for retirement.

And obviously, the latest headlines out of Washington suggest that you know Credit Suisse still has its fair share of problems. This two-year long Senate investigation led by Senate Finance Chairman Senator Ron Wyden basically accuses Credit Suisse of breaching its 2014 plea agreement with Federal prosecutors. This investigation says that Credit Suisse is \"complicit\" in ongoing tax evasion by wealthy Americans. It even alleges that Credit Suisse may be taking part of this potential criminal conspiracy. Let me read you a key line from Ron Wyden and the Senator here. He said: \"At the center of this investigation are greedy Swiss bankers and catnapping government regulators, and the result appears to be a conspiracy to help ultra-wealthy US citizens evade taxes and rip off their fellow Americans.\" Now we should note that Credit Suisse has said that their new leadership is cooperating with the Senate inquiry, and that their policy is to close undisclosed accounts and to discipline employees when they don't follow the rules. Credit Suisse, in a statement said: \"In its core, the report describes legacy issues, some from a decade ago, and we have implemented extensive enhancements since then to root out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities.\" Richard, all of this just underscores the very difficult task UBS has here who are trying to put these two companies together.",
