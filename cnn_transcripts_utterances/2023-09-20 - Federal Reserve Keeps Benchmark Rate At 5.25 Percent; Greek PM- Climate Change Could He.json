The Fed is obviously the main reason. The markets and the events of the day: The Fed holds steady this month, and forecast one more rate hike before the year is out. The UK Prime Minister faces a torrent of criticism over plans to delay climate targets. And Paris rolls out the red carpet for the King and Queen. We'll be live in Paris. We are now live in New York. It is Wednesday, September the 20th. I'm Richard Quest, of course. I mean business. Good evening. The Federal Reserve has hit the pause button in its efforts to bring down US inflation. Well, the efforts haven't changed, but the central bank decided to keep its benchmark rate at five-and-a-quarter percent for the moment. There is evidence that the previous increases are cooling the economy. However, a majority of the committee even allowing for this pause thinks more tightening is going to be needed. So most participants expect rates will go higher. The dot-plot as we say, shows them expecting one or two more rate hikes. Just a short while ago, Chairman Jerome Powell echoed the view that more might be necessary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We aren't even considering 75 basis point interest rate hikes mean three-quarters of one percent, and then the next month, they did 75 basis points, the month after that they did 75 basis points. They skipped a month and did 75 basis points and 75 basis points. They don't know what they're going to do and they don't know what they're going to do next year.

The reason is, because none of this has ever had a darn thing to do with where they set interest rates.The fundamental function that's important and only what's important is what's the growth in the quantity of money versus the growth over time in the economy because inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. And the fact is the growth in the quantity of money around the world and in the United States of America that the Central Bank and the Federal Reserve focuses on has been reduced to a zero growth rate. With a zero growth rate in the quantity of money, inflation is going to take care of itself. This notion that is so widely articulated, that you've got to hurt the economy to make inflation come down was proven nonsense in the 1960s and has never been learned. You remember the phrase, Richard, the Phillips Curve, and Milton Friedman proved the Phillips Curve was wrong in 1968, and when I went to school once upon a time right after that, they were still teaching the Phillips Curve, they still teach this concept today, it was wrong then, it is wrong now, it's been wrong forever and they still keep thinking we've got to hurt the economy to make inflation come down.

Yes, and you know my primary focus is on the broader markets, and the reality is, since last October,when they hadn't finished raising rates yet, the market has been up on a US and global basis pretty nicely led by higher quality growth. And the fact is, it's a bull market. It's a bull market at the start -- at the beginning of last October, it's 11 months old now. And throughout that we've consistently climbed the wall of worry that bull markets legendarily climb, as people can't quite get themselves to believe that it's real. And they keep trying to say this -- I mean, how many times if we focused on things like in America, which is what you're focused on today, the government might shut down. Didn't we just do that a little while ago? And didn't that amount to nothing? And how many times in our lifetimes have we gone there and had an amount to nothing even when they shut the government down and we've learned that shutting the government down in America doesn't mean that the government in America gets shut down, that something else really happens, which is that most of the government goes on as normal, and a few relatively unimportant things don't happen.

And on the other hand, as you pointed out, we were struck up by climate related disasters, first a catastrophic fire, and then an even more catastrophic flood, the largest flood we've ever seen in Greece. And as you pointed out, indeed, I will be banging my fist on the table to argue that we need to spend more money as a European Union on issues related to adaptation. We're spending trillions, literally trillions over the next decade, on mitigation, and rightly so. We need to bring down our greenhouse gases and bring Europe to carbon neutrality by 2050. But these climate disasters are affecting our lives today as we speak. And frankly, the money that the European Union is putting on the table to support European countries facing these types of crisis is extremely, extremely limited. So we need a proper balance between mitigation and adaptation. And again, this is not just an issue related to the southern countries of the European Union.

It is going to increase the ability of people, ideas, knowledge, and capital to move between countries, therefore, it's going to increase economic activity.

And to that end,  this official telling reporters that the White House is, since coming out of this meeting, is that there's an understanding that there needs to be a way forward there that involves compromise. Now frosty as relations may be between the two longtime allies, there were some areas of common ground for them to discuss. Notably, the pursuit of normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. There is still much work to do and many details still to be worked out.

Iwas watching them on the red carpet earlier on with President Macron and his wife. And there's definitely a chemistry there. They are getting on. It seemed like a really warm relationship. And that's what diplomats on both sides wanted to see. Huge amount of tension between the U.K. and France in recent years, post Brexit. Also during Boris Johnson's tenure, he wasn't necessarily very popular here and you didn't really get the sense that Macron and Johnson got on at all. But Charles and Macron clearly were getting on. There was a big ceremonial state welcome at the Arc de Triomphe, a procession down the Champs-Elysees, roads closed off, everything being thrown at this. Macron wants this to work. He had to postpone the previous visit because of demonstrations over pension reforms in France. That was embarrassing for him. He wants this visit to work. In Versailles, a lavish state banquet attended by the elites of the United Kingdom and France. That's a big honor for the king but also there are some people in France who think it's completely appropriate during a cost of living crisis. The biggest honor probably being afforded to King Charles will be on Thursday at the senate. He's going to be invited to speak on the senate floor, address the senators. That hasn't been afforded to any other king or queen from the United Kingdom ever. So that's a big moment for King Charles. He's expected to speak French there; we'll see how well that goes. But a series of events over three days. Both sides, the British and the French, really want this to work. They want to emphasize the deep ties, the historic ties between the two countries -- Max Foster, CNN, Paris, France. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
