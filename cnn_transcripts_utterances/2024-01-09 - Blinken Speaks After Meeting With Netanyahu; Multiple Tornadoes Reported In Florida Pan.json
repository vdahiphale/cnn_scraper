So there's -- I think also here, potentially a powerful opportunity for the future. Now it's very difficult to get, hard to get there, hard decisions, hard choices need to be made in order to get there. But you can see that possibility. I'm not going to speak for the prime minister or anyone in the Israeli government about their views. I can just share our own. And also share a little bit of what I heard from countries in the region.",

The Israeli government is still refusing to transfer the P.A.'s money and the administer said yesterday there are two million not sees in Gaza and I won't give money to Nazis just like the U.S. won't give money to al-Qaeda. I would like to have your comment on that. The second question is, the cabinet said that they're refusing to let Gazans go back to north Gaza for now. Is that something that you agreed on with your Israeli counterparts? Thank you very much.",

They should have them in order to be able to make sure they can pay their people that are providing essential services.Including doing essential work in the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority security forces, who are playing important role in trying to keep peace, security, stability in the West Bank, something profoundly in Israel's interests. So we believe that those revenues should be released to them. Again, their revenues and they are being used to do something important to Israel. And when it comes to the future governance of Gaza when the conflict is over, of course, people need to be paid. They need to be able to do the work necessary to administer Gaza, to do the other things that are critical once the conflict ends. In terms of Palestinians and moving back to northern Gaza, as I spoke earlier, we have an agreement that the U.N. will conduct an assessment to determine the conditions necessary for people be able to move back home. There are a lot of really challenging important issues to deal with, including things like unexploded ordinance, booby traps, other explosives that have been left by Hamas. Infrastructure questions, proper support. All of those things are going to be evaluated by the United Nations pursuant to this agreement. And as soon as conditions allow, we want to see people be able to move back to their homes. We've been very clear about the necessity of doing that when conditions allow. And making sure that people who want to go back can go back.",

I want to ask about we have heard voices, some Israeli political leaders talking about the threat of Iran in the region and, of course, its proxies, Hezbollah and the Houthis, have been active in and around this conflict. But you are bringing a message to the region of de-escalation. Was your message of de-escalation heard and agreed with when you spoke to your Israeli counterparts and political leaders today or -- we have not seen that in the last few days. There have been strikes on Hezbollah that appear to be an escalation. Do you support that? Is the U.S. and its partners prepared to take a strike against the Houthis because of their continued action in around the Red Sea?",

      "sentences": "Thanks, Will. One thing we have heard clearly every place we've gone, including in Israel, is that escalation is in no one's interest. No one is seeking, and no one wants to see other fronts open in this conflict.[13:35:00] And more than that, as I have already shared, we have countries around the region that are using their relationships, using their influence to try to make sure that that doesn't happen. We had extensive discussions about that today, as we had on other days of this trip. And here we focused particularly on the situation in northern Israel. And it is clear to me from these conversations a few things. First, we strongly support the proposition that Israelis need to know security so that they can return to their homes in northern Israel. And 80,000 or so Israelis have been forced from their homes because of insecurity from southern Lebanon, rocket attacks, other threats posed by Hezbollah. Equally, we believe, and the government of Israel believes, that a diplomatic path is the best way to achieve the security. That's exactly what we will continue to pursue. That is what the government said today and that is what we are focused on. More broadly, we have, you're right, a number of actions being taken by the Houthis, by other Iranian proxies, in Iraq, Syria, with that threatens stability. And it threatens the potential for conflict. And we are determined, again, that we will not see exhalation, that we don't have the conflict to spread, and we've made that very clear. But of course, if our personnel, our forces are threatened or attacked, we will take appropriate steps. We will respond. We will protect them. We have demonstrated that in the recent past. And we will again if we have to. We have talked already about the threat the Houthis pose. That is a threat not just to us directly, or to Israel. It's a threat to the entire international community because they've been attacking shipping through the Red Sea that is vital to providing 50 percent of global commerce every day. These attacks have had very, very negative effects for countries around the world in terms of forcing ships to route around the Red Sea, taking longer routes, more expensive, more time. Insurance rates go up, prices for food, medicine, energy, for whatever is being shipped are going up. And more broadly, it is a threat to the principle of freedom of navigation that every country has a stake in. And that's why more than 40 countries joined us in condemning the Houthis' actions. That's why other countries have joined us in making clear that if this continues there are going to be consequences. But no one's looking to create a conflict or to escalate the conflict. On the contrary, we are seeking to prevent that from happening. But we also have to uphold basic principles of international law, including freedom of navigation. And we have to make sure that our own personnel, when they're under threat, are being protected.",

That is to potentially ease the conflict long term. He did not specifically say what he gathered from Netanyahu. In fact, he said something to be effective, I'm not going to share Netanyahu's perspective on this. He did harp on the fact that there was support in the region by partners to the United States for a two-state solution. And he specifically mentioned that they had offered security guarantees to Israel in order to facilitate that. What are the security guarantees looking like? Is it something you believe Netanyahu may buy into?",

There has to be some sort -- excuse me -- Gaza. There has to be some sort of other formulation before Netanyahu will buy into it. That generally will be the trickiest part. Humanitarian aid, probably a solvable problem. Resettlement back into their homes, probably a solvable problem.

They don't to incentivize what happened on October 7th, that's seems the way they see it. If they move towards a two-state solution, what is the message they're sending to Hamas? They got something, right, out of what they did. But to Tony Blinken's point, he is trying to say that if you want to ease tensions and move towards a future, there has to be a two-state solution. That is where everyone who he has spoken to on this trip is demanding more political rights for Palestinians. How is it possible that Israel can be moved on that by the U.S.?",
