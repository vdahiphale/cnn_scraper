Seven -- seven people dead. This was not just bad-luck situation, where oops, we dropped the bomb in the wrong place or, or -- no, this was over 1.5, 1.8 kilometers, with a very defined humanitarian convoy that had signs in the top, in the roof, a very colorful logo that we are obviously very proud of that that's very clear who we are and what we do.

I want to bring in Sean Carroll. He is the President and CEO of Anera, which is a non-profit that has worked in collaboration with World Central Kitchen, to provide more than a quarter million meals daily, in Gaza. Both Anera and World Central Kitchen suspended operations, in the Enclave, after this tragic attack. And, Sean, I'm so sorry, for your community that is in mourning, and that is more afraid than they have been, throughout this conflict. I know that you spoke with Jose Andres, twice, since this attack. Can you tell us what those conversations have been like? SEAN CARROLL, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, ANERA: Well, thanks, Brianna. Thanks for having me on. You heard it in the interview there. He's -- it's difficult to talk about. He chokes up. He's very close to the people that work with him. We are very close to the World Central Kitchen and all of the people that work there. This is the third time, three years in a row that we've worked with World Central Kitchen, in Gaza. And they've relied on the partnership with Anera, because we've been working in, in Palestine, in the occupied Palestinian territories, for 55 years. We've had the same office, in Gaza, for 40 years. And so, three years ago, in a smaller bombing campaign, they came to us, and we worked together. And we knew on October 7th, we would unfortunately have to work again together. And I called him that day. And they provided, instantly, large support for us to start delivering meals. And now, together, we've delivered 45 million meals, about 2 million a week. And the people that work for World Central Kitchen, like the people who work for Anera, are humanitarians, who are trying to uphold humanity, celebrate humanity, move human development and, in emergencies, provide humanitarian aid, and try to save lives and affirm lives.

Any incident of this gravity, you can't have the parties to the conflict, the ones that may have committed an international crime, a crime against humanity, a war crime, you can't have them be the investigators. There needs to be an independent investigation.But everything we've seen, these photos, you're showing. I mean, an accident? You hit one car. You don't hit three cars. I don't see how it could be an accident. It feels like a targeted attack. Jose Andres and the World Central Kitchen staff feel like it's a targeted attack. If it's not, let's see what an independent investigation says. But what we're all worried about now is what does this mean for humanitarian workers? And what does it mean for the delivery of humanitarian aid? And what does that mean, at the end of the day, for humanity, and for any chance of living in peaceful coexistence? The thing that is so shocking and sad for me is, I think, Israel hasn't yet realized that this kind of action runs against its own interests. This is not increasing the security of Israel and Israeli citizens. And I hope that the citizens of Israel, and the government, and the military, will realize this is -- this goes against their own interests, and obviously, first and foremost against the interest of Palestinians, who are desperately in need of the humanitarian aid that we're trying to deliver day in and day out. KEILAR: We heard, as you alluded to, Chef Andres, saying that he posted a tweet, critical of Netanyahu, somewhat recently, and he's questioning if maybe Israel was upset with him, whether it may have played a role here.

They say they didn't, calling this a misidentification, even though World Central Kitchen has said they coordinated their movements, with the military beforehand.CNN geolocated their path. And the charity says that their workers unloaded aid, at a warehouse, in central Gaza, then made their way down, this coastal road, in what was supposed to be a deconflicted zone. Three and a half mile south of the warehouse, the first vehicle was struck. The other vehicles continued on. And a second strike hit the second vehicle, a half mile further down the road. The third vehicle traveling another mile, and that is where a third Israeli strike took it out. I want to bring in Bob Baer. He's a former CIA Operations Officer, who has spent more than two decades working across the Middle East. CNN recently speaking, Bob, to an explosive weapons expert, who said the strikes appear to have been carried out, by an Israeli drone that would have operated in conjunction with a surveillance drone, meaning they should have been able to see the World Central Kitchen logo.

Once they acquire a target, there's no second-guessing it. And when you fight a war, from the air, like this, there will be tragic civilian casualties, as we've seen in the last couple months in Gaza. And it's the speed with which they acquire target, and then fire missiles is too fast. And plus, Israeli intelligence, if they didn't know this was an aid convoy, is bad. It just it's awful. And this is the problem that Israelis don't know what they're shooting at. And they shoot at anything that moves. And that's the best interpretation by the way. I was in Iraq, and almost was killed in an air raid -- American air raid that somebody who was in front of a house, with a cell phone, made a call. That phone was targeted. The guy walked away. The house was hit, killed 23 people. And don't -- let's not forget in Kunduz, where the Air Force hit a hospital, Doctors Without Borders. They killed more than 40 people in that attack. So, it's when you fight a war from the air like this, there will be collateral. I just don't think it was deliberate. I just think this is such an embarrassment for Israel. KEILAR: Yes.",

Donald Trump has failed, the presiding judge denying his latest Hail-Mary attempt, to delay his criminal trial, in the hush money case, in New York.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee's lawyers are trying multiple ways to delay. All of those motions are also expected to fail. Trump's first criminal trial is expected to begin on April 15th. In the meantime, in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, Special Counsel Jack Smith's team is holding nothing back, prosecutors questioning whether Judge Aileen Cannon fully understands the case. In a new filing, Smith's team tells the judge that she is operating under a quote, \"Fundamentally flawed legal premise,\" one that had \"No basis in law or fact.\" Here's the issue here. In an order that shocked veteran legal analysts, the judge asked both sides, to present possible instructions for the jury. Instructions, I should note, in which Cannon appeared to accept Trump's claim that he had the authority, to take classified documents, when he left the White House, by declaring them to be personal. Prosecutors say essentially, that's ridiculous, highly classified government documents are not personal. And they tell her, the Presidential Records Act, she references, has nothing to do with this case. I am joined now by Brandon Van Grack, who was Senior Prosecutor for the Mueller investigation, also a Senior National Security Official at the Justice Department. This is so interesting here.

And that would be dispositive.The government actually agrees if that is in fact the right interpretation, the verdict should be directed to the defendants. Rather than making that decision, the judge is sort of, I think, wrestling with how important that decision is. Because think about the other way, which is if the court rules against the former President, this has been his central argument, in filings and in public, which is I have the right to do this. And if she rules that he doesn't? Then it -- then it deprives him of that argument.
