Tonight, Ukraine and Russia both warn of animpending environmental catastrophe after a major dam collapse in southern Kherson. I ask nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi about risks to the nearby Zaporizhzhia power plant. Then Pope Francis in hospital for abdominal surgery. We'll bring you a live update from Rome on the 86-year-old pontiff. Plus, thousands forced from their homes in Haiti after an earthquake and torrential rains. The World Food Program on the ground tells me that Haiti is a forgotten crisis. Well, regardless of who is responsible, the collapse of a Russian- controlled dam is threatening lives as well as livelihoods, and driving fears of an ecological catastrophe in Ukraine. Rescue and relief efforts are underway on both sides of the frontline, and freshwater could be running scarce. This video from Ukraine's military purports to show drones being used, dropping water to people inside Russian-occupied territory. On top of concerns about water, there are warnings as well the flooding could move around land mines and other explosives. And the Ukrainians say massive amounts of turbine oil stored at the dam could be leaking into the river. For a look at conditions in the flood zone, CNN's Fred Pleitgen filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): After the catastrophic destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, as you can see, there still is a lot of water here in the city of Kherson. One of the things that we've been really surprised about is how fast that water has been rising. In fact, just yesterday, when we were here, we were -- I'd say about a 100, maybe a 150 yards in that direction. Now, that entire area is inundated. You can't go there anymore. At the same time, the rescue efforts are ongoing to free people from their houses. People were -- the water rose so quickly that they couldn't get out. As you can see, police here, the army is here, they have some boats here and they've been trying to get the people out. Now, this is an operation that was ongoing throughout the entire night. That's what the authorities were telling us, that they would not rest, but it's also one that was ongoing under nearly constant shelling. We were hearing that throughout the entire night, we've been hearing it throughout the entire course of the day. Is that the shelling that seems to be coming from multiple rocket launching systems, but also from artillery as well. And as you can see, if you go over here, there are people that are being saved from the buildings here -- animals as well. There's a lot of cats here that are in these cages. One of the things that we are also seeing is the rescuers coming here, and then they have maybe two victims they picked up from maybe a fence or maybe a rooftop. Obviously, a lot of those animals also very much in danger, as are the people who are still caught in that area. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kherson, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Russians were on the east side, the Ukrainians on the west side. And it would have been a formidable challenge without the flooding to cross it. Now, the Ukrainians claim that even with the flooding, they are not being impeded in terms of their counteroffensive plans. But the counteroffensive plans are clearly getting underway in terms of shaping operations elsewhere on the east-west front, going east from Zaporizhzhia, for example. There have been a large number of probing attacks, NATO and other international observers have said they've seen an -- a significant increase in attacks generated by the Ukrainians.

Well, the dam collapse is down river from theZaporizhzhia nuclear plant, sparking fears, you can imagine about nuclear safety. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says there's no immediate risk, and says they have enough water for months. You're seeing there on your map roughly the position of it. But the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has been quoted by Russian state media saying, they won't be able to keep pumping cooling water from a reservoir to the plant if the water level drops too low. Well, to explain all this, IAEA Director-General, Rafael Mariano Grossi joins me now live from Vienna. Mr. Grossi, great to have you on the show. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us. Bring us up-to-date if you could on the situation as you understand right now, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. RAFAEL GROSSI, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, IAEA: Thank you, thank you very much as always, a pleasant to -- a pleasure to talk to you. What I can say, we are monitoring this by the minute, I should say since this occurred yesterday. The levels of the water are of course, going down, decreasing quite rapidly. Obviously, the dam south being destroyed, the influx of water is unimpeded and this is, of course, having automatic impact on the amount of water that the nuclear power plant has to be integrated into the cooling system of the plant.

I would say we calculate that more or less a month is guaranteed. It could be a little bit more, but it could also be less. So it all depends. You were mentioning, you were quoting us saying that the resource which are functioning of the capacity to pump water from the river, so-to-speak. But there are certain levels you can -- you must imagine that there's a difference in the level of the reservoir and the cooling pond, and the river itself. So you need to pump it up, and then there if the level goes down too much, you cannot do that. So, all of these things are in combination. This is why we say, there is no reason for immediate panic or to believe that the water to cool the plant is going to dry up immediately. But it's a serious situation.

A spokesman says the pope should make a full recovery. But it's sparking renewed fears over the 86-year-old's fragile health. It is the latest in a long list of ailments the pope has faced recently. I want to bring in CNN senior international correspondent Jim Bittermann who has covered five popes, and he joins us now from Rome in Italy. So Jim, he is out of surgery. How is he doing?

Anyway, Dr. Alfieri said the pope came out of it very well, no complications, and that in fact, he was cracking jokes and back to work, hard to imagine, really. But the recovery period as you said is going to be a few days. This kind of surgery we are told by medical folks is something that requires a great deal of recovery period. The pope cannot have any solid foods for example, for a while because this is involving his colon. And as a consequence, he's got to be fully healed up in his abdomen before he can actually get back to eating normally and what not. The Vatican has preventatively canceled all the papal events for the next 10 to 18 days. They have -- I'm told, the June 18th, they have said there will be no papal audiences. And they're hoping that the recovery goes smoothly. And that's one of the things I think Catholics around the world were hoping, as the pope was being operated on today. For no other reason, as the pope has a big travel schedule coming up, he is supposed to go in August to Portugal for World Youth Day, and as well to visit the Shrine of Fatima. And then later on in August, he's supposed to go to Mongolia. So all of this is a very rigorous travel schedule, it remains to be seen whether they're going to be able to keep to that. Isa.",

It just shows you how dense this smoke is that's covering not only New York City, but all the areas across the Northeast. Upstate New York is even worse because they're closer to the fires. And we're seeing it all the way as far south as, say, D.C. even the Carolinas across the U.S. getting in on this smoke. And it really has everything to do with the weather pattern because we have winds that are blowing out of the north. And so what's happening is all that smoke from Canada is being blown right into the eastern part of the U.S. visibility has been very low. Visibility in New York City, less than a mile right now, we've had ground stops across a couple of the airports in the Northeast because of the low visibility. And not only that, as you mentioned, the current air quality is very poor. All up and down the Northeast, you can see unhealthy to very unhealthy, some areas even considered hazardous. And then you can see in upstate New York, we have basically the same situation going on. This stretches all the way as far back as say the Ohio Valley and some cities in the Midwest starting to improve today. But they were really bad just a couple of days ago. So really, it just depends on that shifting wind, who's going to get the worst of it. So that's why people are urged to stay inside, especially people that are vulnerable. We have New York City and Toronto right there, topping top three of the worst air quality and pollution of any major city in the world right now. Now, this graph just sort of updates hour to hour, but we are seeing the top three right now. So here's that stagnant weather pattern that we're in with high pressure off to our west, low pressure to our east, and it's basically just funneling these northerly winds right in between. So until something major happens, a major shift in our weather pattern, and winds, say, start to shift back from a southerly direction and push all that smoke out, we're really going to see this stick around for quite some time. So we could see it, say, really bad across the northeast, and then it sort of shifts to the Ohio Valley and then back. So it is going to be back and forth. But all in all, this could be a problem we're dealing with for quite some time. We're still very early in fire season across Canada, and so as long as these winds are blowing out of the north, we're going to still get some smoke across the eastern half of the U.S. So I really don't see anything in the next seven to 10 days that are really going to change much of this at all and beyond that, where it's really hard to tell. So we're going to see a very thick smoke across New York City. These red colors indicate the thicker smoke. So this evening, and then by the time we get into tomorrow, starts to wind down just a little bit. But as I mentioned, once it improves across the I-95 corridor, it gets worse for people to the west. So I think we're stuck here for a little while, at least for the time being.",

And that's really also what has led to Mike Pence's degradation in the Republican Party in terms of his own image. So the way this is going to shape up is Mike Pence is going to run as a traditional conservative Republican in the mold of Ronald Reagan and the traditional pre-Trump conservative era. And he's got a whole bunch of Republican voters who are pretty mad at him for what they see as being disloyal to Donald Trump when he was his vice president. So I think Mike Pence is a good man. He's a moral man. Christian conservatives love him.

And, yes, most Republicans think they did some great things, but you can't sort of own it and disown it at the same time. It's a real challenge. And if you've got a voter out there who's like, well, I really want Trump back, you know, you've got him, you could pick that. He's already in the race. And so it's a hard message and a hard movement to do if you're Mike Pence, what he wants to do is appeal to the voter who says, I'd like to continue on with some of these policies, but I don't want to continue on with the baggage. But a lot of voters see him as part of the baggage. So it's really, really complicated. And it's also complicated by the fact that there's other choices. Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida, Senator Tim Scott, former Governor Nikki Haley, I mean there's a bunch of people in the race who were talented in their own right.

A crowded field allowed Donald Trump to get less than 50 percent of the vote but still win most of the delegates because of the way the Republican Party apportions out the delegates. You can win less votes but still get more delegates, basically, is how it works out. So him being in the race with all these other people ultimately is good for Trump. Now, what I think is going to happen is a lot of these people who are in are not going to make it to Iowa, certainly not going to make it to New Hampshire. The state that Mike Pence is most likely to do well in is Iowa. There's a lot of evangelical Christian voters. Mike Pence is known as an authentic evangelical, pro-life Christian.
