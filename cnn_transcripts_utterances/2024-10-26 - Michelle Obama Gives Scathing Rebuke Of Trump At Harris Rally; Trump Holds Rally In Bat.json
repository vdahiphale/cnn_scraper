We really appreciate that.Meantime, former president Trump just leaving the stage in State College, Pennsylvania. CNN's Danny Freeman is there. And Danny, I know you were there for all of his remarks. What did he say to the crowd? DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jessica, I think that the last 24 hours and certainly this event here at State College was really all about reaching out to young men. Of course, this event was on a college campus here at Penn State, so it was about reaching out to young voters to an extent largely. But really it was focused on young men, not just this event but his actions over the past two days. Now, specifically with this event, it was about an hour and 20 minutes ago. That's how long he spent speaking on the stage. He just wrapped up a few moments ago. There was much of his normal Pennsylvania type of stump speech, as you noted. He spoke a lot about fracking. He bashed the Biden-Harris administration when it came to immigration. He also actually made fun of Vice President Harris and Beyonce saying that Beyonce did not sing last night at an event that Harris held in Texas, and he was making fun of the superstar singer because of that. But early on, and this is what it comes back to, again this idea of reaching out to young male voters, he really played to the crowd here admiring the Penn State wrestling team. He was admiring their muscles quite a bit, saying, look at them, look at their muscles all over the place, and then he joked, maybe he'd wrestle one or two of them. The crowd loved it here. He then invited the Penn State wrestling team up on stage, had one of the members of the team speak out to the crowd. The crowd, of course here the hometown crowd really enjoyed that. And again, that's the through line of the past 24 hours because you combine that in addition to perhaps the biggest headline of the weekend was former president Trump speaking on \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" Joe Rogan's very famous podcast. And in that interview, which is very interesting because it was, Jessica, three hours long, it didn't really break much new ground. It was meandering a times. He was free-wheeling. The former president brought up more of these election conspiracies that he has brought up in the past. But it is reaching out to perhaps a segment of young men who are maybe not as plugged into the election, maybe less likely to vote. That's who this campaign is trying to reach out to this particular weekend. But, Jessica, I'll tell you the interesting thing about everything that we're talking about today as well, Vice President Harris is going to head to Philadelphia tomorrow. Former president Trump is not going to be in a swing state tomorrow. Instead, he's going to be in New York City having that massive rally, certainly this campaign hopes it's a massive rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City tomorrow evening -- Jessica.",

He says I am going to use the military to arrest my political opponents. And then they dispatched -- Lindsey Graham goes on TV or Mike Johnson makes an utter fool of himself and said, oh, no, that's not what he really means. Then he comes back and says no, I really mean it. So understand exactly what is going on. He's going to have a rally tomorrow night at Madison Square Garden that is going to mimic a Nazi rally of 20 February, 1939. And you know what the media is going to do? Simple, well, he had a rally that mimic Nazis and Kamala Harris was in Tucson, and had 12,000 people for a rally. It's not the same thing. And we got surrogates coming out that are going to point this out and everybody -- always people I meet in airports like, quit being so nervous, go out and do your job and let's win this thing because we're going to win.

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, over the course of about four hours overnight dozens of Israeli military aircraft carried out strikes inside of Iran, including around the Iranian capital of Tehran. We're told that these targets were purely military targets. No oil or nuclear infrastructure targets were hit in these strikes, something that the Israeli government had previously considered.Instead, we're told that this was missile manufacturing facilities, as well as air defense systems. One Israeli official telling me that multiple S-300 air defense batteries that were located in strategic locations inside of Iran were struck by the Israeli military. And this official believes that this will directly translate into giving the Israeli air force more ability to maneuver over Iranian skies should the Israeli government choose to conduct additional strikes inside of Iran. For now, there's no indication that they will unless Iran chooses to retaliate and particularly if Iran chooses to retaliate in an escalatory manner. For now, though, the Iranian government appears inclined to downplay the severity of these strikes carried out by Israel, suggesting that the damage was minimal, even as they acknowledged that four Iranian military personnel were killed in these overnight strikes. And the Israeli government is also working hard it seems to try and avoid driving Iran to feel the need to retaliate further. Israeli government ministers and spokespeople have been directed not to speak about the details of these strikes. Very little limited information has actually emerged about the exact nature of the targets, and also about the amount of damage that is inflicted. And that's because these strikes I'm told by a source familiar with the Israeli government's thinking were intended to show that the Israeli intelligence and military was capable of striking targets deep inside of Iran. But at the same time, limiting the amount of boasting that is done in the aftermath, at least publicly, by the Israeli government in order to give Iran the kind of leeway to manage the fallout of this. Now Iran does face a decision because if they don't strike, they certainly risk of facing a perception of being weak. If they do, though, they of course face the risk of escalating the situation further and perhaps drawing Israel directly into war -- Jessica.",
