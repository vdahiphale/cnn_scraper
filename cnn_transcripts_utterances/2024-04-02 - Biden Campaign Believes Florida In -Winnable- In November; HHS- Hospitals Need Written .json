Florida's State Supreme Court just paved the way for one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country. The justices -- they upheld Florida's ban on abortion after 15 weeks and that triggers an even more restrictive six-week ban, which state lawmakers approved last year. And the whole issue is likely to go to voters in November. Let's get to CNN's Arlette Saenz who is at the White House for us with much more. Arlette, what is behind -- is it really just the abortion issue that is behind this news strategy and this confidence if you will of the Biden campaign?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's a few elements to this, Kate, but the Biden campaign believes that they do see an opening in the state of Florida in large part due to the issue of abortion.In a campaign memo released last night by campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, she outlined how they believe Florida is winnable, especially when it comes to the issue of reproductive rights. They see the fact that voters will be deciding in November, in Florida, whether to approve a state constitutional amendment relating to abortion rights. They believe that is something that can really galvanize voters heading into November's election. It's something that they've long stressed across this campaign as they believe abortion rights -- reproductive rights will really push a lot of women, Independent, and moderate voters to the ballot box for Biden. We've heard the campaign talk about potential ballot initiatives on the ballots in states like Arizona and Nevada, and they believe that this could also help them in a state like Florida. The campaign manager argued that this decision from the Supreme Court yesterday relating to the abortion ban in the state -- it really amounts to a total abortion ban across the southeast is something that she argued. If you take a look there, the southeast has some of the most stringent limits when it comes to abortion access, including in battleground states like Georgia and North Carolina as well. But many have longed believed that Florida would be a longshot for President Biden to win against former President Donald Trump. We have seen Trump perform better than Democrats there in the past two election cycles, beating Hillary Clinton by about 112,000 and beating Biden by an even bigger margin of 371,000 votes. Of course, there have also been Republican governors in the statehouse there for quite some time now. But the Biden campaign is also pointing to another fact that they believe that there are cracks in Trump's coalition and they've pointed to the fact that Nikki Haley was able to secure 155,000 votes in the Florida primary even after she had dropped out. We have seen the Biden campaign make these overtures to Nikki Haley's supporters. They ran a new digital ad that started over the weekend. They've been talking to potential donors that they could bring from -- over from Haley world. So these are all elements that the Biden campaign sees that could be in play for them in Florida in November with abortion rights and reproductive rights really being at the top of that list.",

I mean, I think this is a real game-changer. Look, I had my doubts about whether Biden could be competitive but I thought it was going to be closer than last time already. And with this, there's a couple of other factors going on here. I mean, first of all, the six-week ban is literally in the 20s in terms of their support in Florida. I mean, it -- only about 20 percent of Floridians support the six-week ban that Gov. DeSantis signed. So you have that. The second thing is Rick Scott is not the most exciting nor popular Senate candidate that the GOP, as an incumbent, is putting up. And you have Debbie Mucarsel-Powell on the Democratic side, who I just think is -- has just gotten a ton of support coming in now with money, and that's going to make that Senate race very competitive. She has a real shot. And I think -- but -- that those two boats lifting up can help Biden. If Biden can keep it within single digits, I think she wins the Senate seat, which is really important. But I also think he -- I think this puts both North Carolina and Florida in play where they have weak statewide candidates on the Republican side and this issue is going to be really important.",

It's valued at $3.8 billion but that is down sharply by $1 billion from just the previous trading day. And listen, these gains -- they could vanish in an instant when you're talking about a stock that is as volatile as this one. Now, the trigger was the fact that Trump Media -- they released their 2023 results and let's just say they were not perfect. Now, they lost $58 million. Not totally shocking because we're talking about a startup. But look at this. Just $4.1 million in revenue. That is tiny, especially because this is a company valued in the billions of dollars. Some context. It's actually very much in line with another digital media company that has been in the spotlight, The Messenger -- the one that flamed out earlier this year. Look at that. The losses are similar. The revenue is right in line. Of course, The Messenger ended up just shutting down a few weeks after posting these results. Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen here.

They're saying that there will be retribution and that they will be decisive. Also saying that they hold the United States accountable as well.The place that you can expect this tension between Israel and Iran to go up would be along the northern Israeli border with Lebanon's -- with Israel's -- Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, there. So if there was to be an increase in tensions that's where you would see it. And, of course, the French president has a history of diplomatic political engagement in Lebanon. He speaks to the leadership there. So not that he can have a massive calming effect but he can and France can writ large have some impact to try to deescalate those tensions that clearly ramped up yesterday. But, of course, this meeting with Sec. Blinken, the defense minister, and the foreign minister this afternoon -- this evening, Paris time -- meeting with President Macron -- yes, it's about -- it's going to be about Gaza and about tensions in the Middle East, but also about Ukraine. About talking about the issue that both countries share much industry. You know, France, the fifth-largest investor in the United States and employs 740,000 U.S. workers. So talking about those ties and commonality and wanting to end the war in Ukraine, holding Putin to account for it But this is more, I think, than just a handshake. So there's platitudes because I think there's a nudge in there -- a sort of a gentle diplomatic nudge. Because in Europe, there's a sense that France isn't doing as much as, say, Germany to help contribute and support Ukraine in the war against Russia. And over the weekend, France announced that they would give several hundreds of used armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine and supply some more surface-to-air missiles that Ukraine needs. But you get the sense in the language and statements around this visit the United States is saying that France is an important leader in Europe. And it's important that they're at the forefront of showing support, and solidarity, and supplies, and military equipment, and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. So I think this -- I think in the meetings, there will be something of a nudge there as well to keep that up and maybe do more.",
