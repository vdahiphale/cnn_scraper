It is a pivotal day in the New York attorney general's case against him and his business.Trump is accused of committing fraud by inflating his assets to get better terms on real estate loans. He's rejected all of the allegations, insisting he's done nothing wrong and that the case is a political witch hunt. A reminder this is a bench trial. There is no jury for Trump to play to; just the judge -- the judge who has already fined Trump twice for violating a gag order that prevents him from speaking about the judge's staff. Joining us now, former Trump White House communications director and the founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci.",

And there's really only two choices and usually, the incumbent -- when things are concerning to people -- concerning about their pocketbooks or geopolitically, the incumbent takes a hit. But if it's -- if it's Trump versus Biden, Joe Biden will thump him. And to quote Joe Biden, he'll beat him like a drum.

I can tell you one thing about Americans -- they don't like their top secret documents being shared with people that don't deserve access to those top secret documents. So let's let these cases unfold. It's very, very early. President Biden is dealing with two wars right now. He's got some shaky numbers on inflation, although the economy is quite strong.

With talk of the Israeli military creating a buffer zone inside Gaza and perhaps later in southern Lebanon, the reality today is that those buffer zones exist but inside Israel. SCIUTTO (voice-over):  For evacuees from kibbutz Misgav Am, the pain and fear of October 7 remains raw. SCIUTTO (on camera):  Apollonia (PH), nice to meet you. SCIUTTO (voice-over):  Apollonia still has trouble explaining what happened to her three children. SCIUTTO (on camera):  Do you think the kids understand what happened? SCIUTTO (voice-over):  The eldest children, she tells me, understand that we're fighting for our home. SCIUTTO (on camera):  Do you talk to them about it? SCIUTTO (voice-over):  They see and they're aware. This is the reality of Israel post-October 7 -- a country more aware than ever perhaps of the threat on its southern and northern borders. But that awareness leaves open the question of when they will go home. Ellen and Joseph tell us it's just a matter of time.",
