      "sentences": "Now, one of the key sticking points with the border talks disagreement is how the immigration authority is being handled. The Bidenadministration has leaned on humanitarian parole authority, which includes admitting Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Ukrainians following Russia`s invasion. Other instances, including allowing migrants from designated countries to temporarily live and work in the United States as a way of attempting to alleviate the surges at the U.S.-Mexico border. But Republicans argue the administration is using their authority too broadly and are seeking to keep it in control within limits. With more holidays just around the corner, senators are scheduled to be in the nation`s capital for just two more weeks. A possible option would be for Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to move to advance an aid package without the border policy changes. But House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have insisted that Republican or GOP support for more Ukraine funding is contingent on tightening immigration laws. Let`s head to South America now, where Venezuelans voted overwhelmingly on a referendum to approve the takeover of an oil-rich region in the neighboring country of Guyana. The area in question is the densely forested Essequibo region. Its borders have been disputed for more than a century and this latest largely symbolic referendum is renewing tensions there. Our David Shortell has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The referendum held Sunday in Venezuela over the question of whether that country should essentiallycreate a new state within the land of their neighbor Guyana, passing by a wide margin. This was in reference to the Essequibo region, a very oil-rich part of Guyana that actually makes up about two-thirds of that country`s national territory. It`s land that Venezuela has long laid claim to, but the borders of which were set back in 1899 by an international tribunal. So of course, leaders in Guyana are very concerned in the run-up to this election, calling it an existential threat to their country, and it attempted annexation. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro for his part had been campaigning on the issue for several weeks, calling it an opportunity for Venezuelans to reclaim a part of their country that he says was essentially stolen from them by colonial powers back in the 19th Century. Now, voters were asked five questions and in preliminary results released by the country`s national election, authority on Sunday evening, voters overwhelmingly supported the initiative, voting more than 95% of the time, yes, in those five questions. Now, of course, this is Venezuela. It`s an authoritarian country with no independent election monitors present at the ballot box on Sunday. So these results have to be taken with a fairly large grain of salt. Now, analysts say do not expect an invasion of Guyana anytime soon. That`s because if Nicolas Maduro were to actually try to create this state within Venezuela, it would likely have to involve the use of armed troops to move into Guyana. And that`s not something that he has any support for from even his closest allies. Still, it has raised the threat level considerably in the region, Brazil, which shares a border with the region, sending some troops up last week. And the U.S. actually sending some senior military leaders down to Guyana in recent days in a bit of a show of support for that country. Now, Guyana`s leaders calling it, as I said, an existential threat to their country and the vice president there in recent days actually invoking Vladimir Putin`s invasion of Ukraine, saying that all the options are on the table when considering how to deal with this threat.

If you said nimbostratus, you are correct. In Latin, nimbo stands for rain cloud. Stratus means to extend, spread out, flatten, or cover with a layer. On the weather front, more than 10 million people in the Pacific Northwest of the United States were under flood alert as waves of heavy rain and snow are saturating the region. The cause? A series of atmospheric rivers. Here to explain the science behind these rivers of the sky, our meteorologists my man Derek Van Dam. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "I think it`s best that our viewers think of this as a literal river in the sky. The ability for this to transportwater vapor from the tropical regions of the planet to the mid-latitudes where you and I actually live is just incredible. And we`re talking about a tremendous amount of water vapor so much so that, that has the ability to transport as much as equivalent of 25 times the amount of water that flows through the Mississippi River. So these river in the skies, the atmospheric rivers, we keep talking about produce significant heavy rainfall and mountain snow. That`s when the freezing level is far enough down in altitude where we can get so much snow. But this time it`s a little different because you can actually trace back the origin of this atmospheric river all the way back to Hawaii and that moisture means that it`s pulling in this kind of tropical influenced moisture. So it`s going to be a warmer AR event or atmospheric river event and we believe that this will be more of a rain event. So the snow we got earlier in the week, well that`s going to melt. That`s going to add to the flooding concerns because we have a level five of five according to some of the authorities out there. So this is a significant event for the coastline of Oregon, even in proportions of Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
