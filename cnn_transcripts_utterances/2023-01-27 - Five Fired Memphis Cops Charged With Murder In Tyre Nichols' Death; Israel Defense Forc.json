      "sentences": "Well, what started it was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year. And what's already been a very deadly past year or so, for both Palestinians and Israelis.What happened was there was an unusual Israeli military raid in the Jenin Refugee Camp. Unusual because usually the Israeli military doesn't necessarily enter the camp itself. And it happened in broad daylight hours. Now, the Israeli military says that that happened because they had intel that they believe there was an imminent attack being planned out by Islamic Jihad militants. And when they came to the house that they were targeting, a firefight ensued. And we know that at least nine people were killed in that firefight. Now, while several of them Israeli military says we're militants, we know that at least one was a civilian woman, a bystander in her 60s and then a 10th Palestinian man later died in ensuing clashes that were in reaction to that Jenin raid. The Palestine Authority immediately reacted calling it a massacre. And they did something that was very drastic, they cut off immediately security coordination between the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority. This is something that they've done before, but it does represent a rather drastic step. And actually, the United States Assistant Secretary of State, Barbara Leaf, she actually said that they did not think that was the right thing to do at the time that Israel and the Palestinian Authority should actually continue and even deepen their security coordination considering the rise in violence over the past year. Then just a few hours later, those alarms went off in southern Israel, rockets were fired from Gaza, towards Israel, not unexpected because of the targeting of the Islamic Jihad militants. Islamic Jihad, of course, one of the militant groups in Gaza. No injuries reported from those rockets. About seven of them were reportedly fired from Gaza into Israel and the Israeli military responding with airstrikes. This is all coming at a very interesting time here, not only because of the new right-wing government in Israel, that's been getting a lot of attention, but also because there's quite a few American visitors coming here this week. There are reports that the CIA director is already coming to visit the West Bank in Israel. And we know that the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is expected to land for visits in Israel and the West Bank in the coming days. So really, the incredibly high tensions right now. So it'll be really interesting to see whether the Secretary of State will be able to help sort of manage the situation and potentially help bring the security coordination which is Israel really sees and the Americans really sees as vital to sort of keep the calm as much as they can, whether he can bring that back into force.

And I guess that's significant given that in Tennessee that charge means one knowingly killed another person.

The U.S. Defense Secretary and others saying that Bilal al-Sudani is instrumental or was instrumental in developing ISIS networks across the Africa region and beyond.They -- it looks like they're going after the money here and the organizers and other than that terror, that high level terror suspect that was killed in this raid by special operation forces commandos on early Thursday. Also, several other ISIS members were killed according to U.S. officials. Now the nature of this operation suggests that U.S. officials saw this figure as extremely important. This wasn't -- it wasn't an airstrike, which often happens in Somalia by U.S. forces, at least a week ago that happened. But this was a commando raid, a risky maneuver, would have been months in planning, would have been authorized by U.S. President Biden. You can also assume that there was an opportunity and at least one U.S. official told us this, to gather important and sensitive intelligence information through phones, laptops, anything they would have gathered they would have. And it shows that, especially in the African theater, a U.S. forces are looking to go over after these networks pretty aggressively. Christine.",
