The polling data makes clear that at least thus far, the more he faces legal peril from prosecutors, the stronger his standing among Republicans, which is no doubt why his GOP rivals largely avoid confronting him for the 91 felony counts that he faces. And it's why in Ron DeSantis is prep for next week's debate, his super PAC has advised him to take a hammer to Vivek Ramaswamy but defend Trump if Trump is attacked by Chris Christie.Here was some reaction after -- after Fulton County DA Fani Willis indicted Trump and 18 co-defendants for state RICO violations. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott said this.

Look at DOJs justice manual, look at any State AG, they will say, we have nothing to do with politics. We don't consider politics.But part of the problem, first of all, with, as you say, Michael, with the scheduling of this trial, it's obvious. DOJ and all the prosecutors are thinking about the election, and they're trying to get it in before the election. They're not saying, by the way, but it's very clear that they're very much focused on the election. And this sort of brings me to my second point about why it's problematic for prosecutors to think about counteracting pardons. How are we deciding? We prosecutors, which pardons we're going to try to essentially undo. If you're a federal prosecutor, and you fear a president might pardon your case, which case do you send over to the state? Which of the hundreds of pardons that every president will issue? Do you then call across the street and say, hey, DA, I want you to pick this one up? How are we making those decisions?

And what happened in both instances was state prosecutors picked up the charge. Now Paul Manafort went really poorly because state prosecutors in New York charged him after he'd been pardoned, and the state courts in New York said, no, no, you can't do that. That's not fair play.Steve Bannon was charged federally, then pardoned by Trump on his way out of office, and then recharge by the state and that prosecution remains ongoing. But this makes my exact point. Why should Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon be re-prosecuted, but not any of the hundreds of other people pardoned by Donald Trump, Barack Obama pick your president? Are they being picked out simply because they're sort of seen as politically odious by certain prosecutors? I think that's the only answer. And I think that's unacceptable.",

I'm -- I'm just trying to point out that the polling data makes pretty darn clear that his hand has been strengthened with -- with each subsequent indictment. And I said this in my opening commentary today. This is based on anecdotal information, but I sense that many Republicans were ready for a choice, you know, we're ready to see all those on the stage come Wednesday night, but they take umbrage at now, the perception that outsiders are trying to take that choice away from them, like, hey, you know, let us decide if we want to leave this guy. But don't you tell me what I'm going to do? That's what I sense is going on borne out by the polling data. Still to come.

Despite a meager budget of $3 million, the film took over American pop culture, pulling in nearly 142 million at the box office. Until recently, I saw it as just a chaotic comedy of my teenage years. That is until this week when I read Ty Burr's opinion piece in the \"Washington Post\" entitled \"I was on campus when Animal House debuted. It changed everything.\" He argues that the movie was much more than a celebration of fraternity debauchery. And he makes the case that it was a political and cultural milestone.Ty Burr is the author of the movie recommendation newsletter \"Ty Burr's Watch List.\" In July of 1978 he attended a preview screening of the film as a student at Dartmouth, where he says he saw his classmates inspired by the new principles. The right to say what you wanted, offend whomever you wanted, and grab the rewards you felt were yours. Ty, thank you so much for being here and writing this piece. So, you attending that screening for the movie just off campus at Dartmouth in Hanover at a small theater. What happened that night? TY BURR, WRITER/FILM CRITIC, TY BURR'S WATCH LIST: What happened that night was that the place went wild because, you know, it is a hilarious movie. And I want to stress that you could enjoy this movie absolutely as a movie. But I have to point out that one of the screenwriters was in attendance, that was Chris Miller, and he was a Dartmouth alumni who had gone to one of the more notorious fraternities on campus, the one that actually isn't even recognized anymore because they were branding the flesh of new members. So, nevertheless, the audience went wild. I literally remember him being carried on the shoulders of cheering fraternity guys down frat row at Dartmouth. It was as though all the debauchery and fun was given the OK, had been the cultural OK. There had never been a college comedy that said, yes, we're identifying with the -- quote -- unquote -- \"losers.\" We love these guys. We love the fun they have. We love their outlook on life.

But that it went from -- when even the frat culture sort of have to pay lip service in public to, yes, you know, we're -- we believe in these things, these progressive ideas to -- the movie allowed them to say, no, I don't need to mean that. I can just have fun. I can be -- and do whatever I want to be.And I will say that -- and this is ironic. It resonated with the more conservative forces on the campus at that time. And you may remember that The Dartmouth Review, that's a -- the first conservative college newspaper, started up two years later and the students who started it were in that audience and have written about being really affected by that movie and wanting to be Bluto.
