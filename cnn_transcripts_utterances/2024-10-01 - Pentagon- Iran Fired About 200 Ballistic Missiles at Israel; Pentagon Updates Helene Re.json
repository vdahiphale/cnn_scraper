Can you talk a little bit about why they're there and what role they might fill now in terms of enhancing security for U.S. forces in the region?MAJ. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Yes, absolutely. Well, you know, as we've been highlighting for a while, we have a robust amount of capability in the Central Command and U.S. European Command regions. And what those capabilities provide us is versatility in terms of responding to a variety of contingencies. And so, you know, basically having the right tools in the toolkit to be able to respond appropriately to any type of attack or contingency situation. And so, as you well know, PAT fighter aircraft can perform a variety of missions to include taking down drones, taking down missiles, particular kinds of missiles, as well as, you know, providing ISR, electronic warfare, and types of capabilities. So all of this comes together to provide us with options on how best to respond to any type of attack and to protect our forces. Let me come back to the room here. Yes, ma'am.",

Certainly, the type of aggressive action that we saw by Iran today makes that more challenging.But that continues to remain our focus and remain our goal is to prevent a wider regional conflict. And so we'll continue to stay laser-focused on that. In terms of Israel's operations, again, they're in the best position to answer questions. But our understanding in consulting with them is that, again, these will be limited operations focused on dismantling facilities that Hezbollah has built along the border to stage attacks into Israel. And so, you know, part of those discussions, again, have been focused on, you know, making sure that there's an understanding as far as potential mission creep. And so, as it relates to the broader tensions in the region, but again, we support their right to defend themselves from Hezbollah attacks. And so we'll continue to consult with them on that. As I mentioned, Wafa, ultimately, we do believe that a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security there. A few more -- Phil.",

I don't think it'd be appropriate for me to talk about that.Hey, folks, while there's been an understandable focus today on the Middle East, before we conclude, I would like to provide a quick update on a topic closer to home as DOD continues to work with federal, state, and local officials to support Hurricane Helene response efforts. As of this morning, the department has more than 6,500 service members actively engaged in relief efforts across six states. Florida has nearly 3,500 guardsmen activated, and Georgia has around 1,400 guardsmen on duty. South Carolina has activated nearly 500 guardsmen, along with two helicopters, for their recovery efforts. Tennessee has around 130 guardsmen and seven helicopters activated. And Virginia has activated nearly 60 guardsmen, along with one helicopter and numerous high-water vehicles. Additionally, since the storm passed, North Carolina has emerged as an area of particular focus after the historical levels of flooding that occurred in the western part of that state. A multi-state, multi-agency effort is currently underway, with more than 80 guardsmen and 13 helicopters from Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, New York, South Carolina, and Florida joining more than 800 North Carolina guardsmen in providing support to devastated North Carolina communities. U.S. Northern Command is also providing active duty support efforts to FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing emergency power planning and response teams to Georgia, as well as dam, levee, and bridge inspection to Tennessee and Kentucky, and temporary power to North Carolina. For further questions about National Guard missions, I would encourage you to contact the specific states in questions, and for active duty support efforts to FEMA, U.S. Northern Command is standing by. For service-specific evacuation efforts, it's best to contact the services directly. As the DOD continues to aid response efforts, Secretary Austin and department leaders will continue to be engaged and stay in close contact with federal, state, and local officials to ensure resources are available and to maximize a coordinated response. And in the days ahead, the department will continue to keep our fellow Americans who have been impacted by this storm's devastation in our thoughts. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.",

And thank God for those U.S. military personnel, National Guard, and other troops who have gone in to help those folks who desperately need it.But most of his words were dealing with the crisis that's unfolding right now, the escalating tension in the Middle East. So far, he says no damage to U.S. troops, but he did say, and I think it was significant, exactly what Jake Sullivan, the president's national security advisor, said at the White House, what Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State, said, what Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, said, and basically saying we fully support Israel's right to defend itself, and the U.S. military will do whatever is necessary to help Israel in this effort.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The world right now is spiraling out of control. You might not have seen what's happened because it was a few hours ago. A lot of people were here. There's so many people outside, which we appreciate, but a lot of people were here. A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel. I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true.

Wolf, I know you've been to Israel. I've been to Israel and gotten the briefings over and over and over about the 150,000-some missiles and rockets that Iran has helped Hezbollah store in Lebanon, ready to fire south.Now, the one good thing about this attack, if there was anything good about it, is that Iran says it was aiming at military bases, so Iran hasn't escalated to the next step of hitting Israeli industry, Israeli ports, or even worse, Israeli civilian areas. So it wasn't successful in that it didn't overwhelm Israel and U.S. air defenses, and Iran also hasn't ratcheted it up by trying to attack and cause major civilian casualties.",

They can take about 10 to 12 minutes from Iran to Israel. So this was intended to strike its targets, but the air defense system proved superior. The question is, how is Israel going to respond? Last time it took Israel about a week, and Israel hit the air defense systems near Isfahan. These are the S-300 air defense systems that are designed to protect Fordow, one of Iran's most sensitive nuclear sites. It was like a signal that said, we could have hit your nuclear sites. We took out their defense, but we didn't go that far, so check yourself. Now the question is, will they take that next step and hit closer to a sensitive target in Iran, and that's where you get into what we all call this escalation ladder. One serious hit followed by another more serious hit, and that's where you could spiral into something out of control.",

The U.S. National Security Advisor just confirmed an American Navy destroyer helped thwart Iranian missiles from hitting Israel. Jake Sullivan said Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel. The Israeli military said that no one was hurt.Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps says the attack was aimed at military and security targets in Israel and was retaliation for the deaths of several senior officials in the Revolutionary Guard as well as in the group Hezbollah and Hamas. [15:55:00] BLITZER: Those groups, Anderson, as our viewers know, are all backed by Iran big time. The deaths, the recent deaths include Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary General of Hezbollah, killed by an Israeli airstrike on Friday. The fight against Israel has been intensifying since October 8th. That's when Hezbollah began firing across the border from Lebanon into Israel a day after the October 7th terrorist attack that killed more than 1,000 Israelis. Israel has been firing back, and the cross-border battle has forced the evacuation of more than 60,000 Israelis and 100,000 Lebanese in the area. CNN's Kim Dozier is still with us, our global affairs analyst, along with CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel, first of all, what's your reaction to these strikes? We heard the Defense Department spokesman, General Patrick Ryder, say that two U.S.-guided missile destroyers, the USS Cole and the USS Bulkeley, were involved in sending up interceptors to try to knock down those ballistic missiles coming towards Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel. If the Israeli air defense missile system, the Iron Dome, for example, and the USS guided missile destroyer interceptors had not worked, what kind of damage would those Iranian ballistic missiles have done in a heavily populated city like Tel Aviv? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Wolf, the damage would have been considerable, especially if they had been even somewhat on target. You know, these types of missiles that the Iranians sent toward Israel are designed to have maximum explosive effect. And if they had hit a target, to like one of the intended targets, like, let's say, the headquarters of the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad, the damage would have been probably quite severe. But, as we know, that did not happen. And because it didn't happen, not only is the Mossad headquarters still intact, but other areas, civilian areas and other military or government installations are still operational in Tel Aviv.",

And that operation, as we've seen with the tunnels in Gaza, it takes a while to find them all and then to dismantle whatever weapons they find. They've done something like 70 raids in the past 24 hours. But with hundreds of miles of tunnels reportedly built with the help of Iran and North Korea by Hezbollah, there's going to be a lot to map out and destroy. And each day that goes on, those missiles are supposed to be kept in reserve for Iran's use. And Iran may want to try to do something to keep its strategic reserve from being completely destroyed.",
