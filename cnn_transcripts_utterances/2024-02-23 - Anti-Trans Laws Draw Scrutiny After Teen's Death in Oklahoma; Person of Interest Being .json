But rumors and speculation about what exactly happened and why have raised tensions. Trans rights advocates pointing to a heightened and hostile climate against the state's LGBTQ plus community. And the victim's family says Nex had been bullied at school. Asher Aven is the co-director of outreach at the Trans Advocacy Coalition of Oklahoma. Thank you so much for being with us. And what are you making of the information that we are getting here? Nex's grandmother describing really horrific details that they were badly beaten in the school, in the fight the day before the death here, hitting their head on the floor in the fight.

So many people upset and just not knowing what to do with their feelings. This is the first murder on this campus in some 20 years. So this investigation is ongoing. We still don't have a reason why. And on top of that, this is a very active trail. While we were out there today, we walked parts of the trail, there were still people running and taking their dogs out there, almost unaware of what was going on. So there's so many more questions about this investigation. They've actually brought in more equipment in the last five minutes or so. Heavy-powered lights. It looks like they're going to be working through the evening here. We're hoping to be able to talk to officials to kind of gather more ideas about the motive and what actually happened here.
