That's according to a new study published Thursday by the CDC. They found black patients were more than 1/3 less likely than white patients to be treated with Paxlovid. And Hispanics were 30 percent less likely than non-Hispanics to receive the antiviral pill. Similar trends were reported for Asian-Americans and American Indians too.

There are no beds inside this tent. There are eight bays that the staffed with doctors and nurses. They're only seeing people with minor and mild illnesses and injuries. So, those who have much more serious illnesses are being seen inside the hospital. What's been really noted here in Atlanta is the significant shift we have been seeing. So, the majority of respiratory admissions have been children who are testing positive for the flu. That is the case right now this week. Compare that to last week where 75 percent of respiratory admissions were for RSV. So, what we're seeing here is an early RSV season, and earlier than expected flu season. And one pediatrician that CNN spoke with here in Atlanta says that this trend is likely to move north. DR. ANDI SHANE, CHILDREN'S HEALTHCARE OF ATLANTA: So oftentimes especially with RSV it starts in the southeast and then sort of moves upwards in the United States. And so, what we do probably predict will happen is that some of the northern states will start to see more children with influenza after they see more children with RSV.",
