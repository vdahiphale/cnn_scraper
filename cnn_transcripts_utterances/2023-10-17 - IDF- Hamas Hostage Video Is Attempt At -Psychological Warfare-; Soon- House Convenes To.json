That is, you know, the safe release of the hostages, the Qatari government that -- was very helpful getting five Americans out of Iran last month.They have sent hundreds of millions of dollars into Gaza in recent years. They have relations with Hamas. However, of course, you know, the political situation and the -- and the military situation are all very, very complicated. But if there was going to be a peaceful resolution to some of this for the hostages, the Qatari Government is the most likely venue.",

If you go back to the first Gulf War, Sudan did something -- Saddam Hussein did something very similar, which is he gathered literally hundreds of human shields to prevent any kind of attack against him. This is not quite on that scale, but very close to where you've got at least 200 hostages, it seems.So, A., the -- you know it's kind of dissuading any kind of Israeli military action is part of it. Two. Obviously, some deal down the road. Hamas has nothing to show for this conflict you know, in terms of any real political goal. If they can get some prisoners back, obviously, that's you know something that they want. And maybe that was the intention at the beginning of this. Obviously, the operation became you know much bigger, and they killed more people, perhaps than they initially went in thinking that that was would -- that would -- that was the plan. And is it getting the international attention? I think the short answer is yes. I mean, you got apparently 30 nationalities of various kinds. And there seems to be a great deal of concern around the world, including from the United States about these hostages. And hopefully, there can be a successful resolution starting -- let's start with the children and the -- and elderly, and the -- and people who are sick, and see if they can be released first.",

So -- I mean, the politics -- the politics around this right now may prevent them doing anything at all in having any kind of communications with Hamas. But, you know, this -- and, Kate, this can go on for many months. The military operation in Gaza -- you look at the -- if you remember the attack in Mosul against ISIS, it took many, many months, almost a year of planning for the Iraqi army and the U.S. Air Force and U.S. special forces advising on the ground to extirpate ISIS from Mosul, which is a not dissimilar kind of operation than what we're going to see unfolding in Gaza.
