But it is who's coming next that appears to be the real focus. A diplomat from Western Europe telling Politico this, the real topic, is Trump's arrival.Adding this about Ukraine and beyond, Trump's impact is incredibly visible. There are new ceasefire talks in Lebanon. Scholz is now calling Putin. It's like something powerful just happened. And we're starting to see accelerating shockwaves across the globe. Clearly, Trump's promises on Ukraine, tariffs and the climate already are looming large. CNN's Kayla Tausche traveling with President Biden joining us now. Kayla, Biden is heading. Into this summit right now, right after, as I mentioned, announcing this -- the new position opening, opening things up further for Ukraine to strike further into Russia. What are you hearing about today?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly it is a major shift in policy, a significant decision by the Biden administration after months of deliberating on whether such a change would even be effective to allow Ukraine to strike targets up to 190 miles away using those U.S.-made long range missiles, and that decision could also green light new authorities from the U.K. and France, to use their manufactured long range missiles as well into targets into Russia.Earlier today, the principal deputy national security adviser, John Finer, bristled at the suggestion that the Kremlin is saying that this is going to lead to more retaliation and potentially widening of the conflict to involve the United States or NATO allies. Finer saying earlier today, Russia lit the fire and it was Russia that upped the ante, both with recent aerial attacks on Ukraine, as well as the recruitment of thousands of North Korean troops that they see as an expansion of the war on its own. Now, of course, that is just one of the major conflicts that's going to be discussed here at the G20. Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to attend, even though he's a member of the G20, because just a few weeks ago he said that his attendance could disrupt the gathering. There was also the threat that Brazil could perhaps arrest him if he set foot on soil here. But, of course, as you mentioned, the backdrop to all of this is the fact that in just about two months time, there will be an incoming administration that's going to upend the status quo for these U.S. alliances and adversarial relationships that are, by their nature, the fabric of the G20. The U.S. has acknowledged that this is not a group of likeminded nations, that they disagree on quite a few areas. And so already there is jockeying to figure out where there might be more alignment with the Trump administration, what exactly the incoming president would do. But as we heard from President Biden yesterday in the Amazon, where he was talking about the progress made on climate, he said no one can undo his legacy. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's no secret that I'm leaving office in January. I will have my -- I will leave my successor and my country in a strong foundation to build on if they choose to do so. It's true. Some may seek to lie, deny or delay the clean energy revolution that's underway in America, but nobody can reverse it, nobody. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Overnight, Trump reposted a comment about his plans to declare a national emergency over illegal immigration and use military assets, adding this, true, exclamation point. And the president-elect is refusing to back down over his cabinet picks, even as some of the most controversial ones may face an uphill confirmation battle in the Senate.Now, just overnight, Trump announced his pick to head the Federal Communications Commission. Brendan Carr. Carr is currently an FCC commissioner and authored a chapter on proposed changes to that agency in the Project 2025. CNN's Steve Contorno joining us now.

Take a listen to what Mike Johnson had to say about the cabinet that Trump is currently putting together.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  These are disruptors. They are. I think that's by design. Any president has the right to name their own cabinet, to nominate persons that they think will fulfill their agenda. And the people that are on this list will do that. They will go into the agencies that they're being asked to lead, and they will reform them. These agencies need reform. And I think the vast majority of the American people understand that.

Let me walk through a few of them, the treasury secretary, for example, commerce secretary, labor, housing and urban development, transportation and education. Education, an interesting one because Donald Trump has vowed to shutter the Department of Education. So, it'll be interesting to see who he puts in that role.Of course, he has already taken a number of steps to fill key roles related to immigration. And as you said, Sara, Donald Trump has been threatening to use the military in order to execute some of his plans over the weekend. We learned that that includes potentially declaring a state of emergency that would allow him to use Pentagon resources in order to fund his plan.

He was never charged. He was not actually even named in the police report that we -- the police statement that we saw as a suspect. However, he was involved in that incident in Monterey, California in 2017.Trump and his campaign so far is standing by Hegseth. In fact, yesterday, Karoline Leavitt, his incoming press secretary, defended him in a tweet that she posted on social media. And then Gaetz, we are told Donald Trump is, quote, 100 percent behind that nomination, even as the questions remain over the contents of an ethics investigation related to alleged sexual misconduct.

Of course, Giuliani was not charged in that, but the law firm has filed a suit saying that Giuliani owes them more than $1.3 million in unpaid legal bills, and Giuliani is in court today to try to get that lawsuit thrown out.His argument is that he signed a retainer with the lawyer, Bob Costello, and it was the deal with him that he had struck, saying that he did not sign a deal with the law firm and Costello no longer works there. So, that is one of his arguments. The other, he's saying he never received the invoices to pay these bills. So, he's going to try to convince a judge of that today.

The problem is that these industries are heavily reliant on undocumented workers. And it's simple, right? Fewer workers mean less food.Let's just look at one example, crop farm workers. The USDA found that 41 percent of the people who work as crop farm workers in the U.S. are unauthorized. I spoke to a farmer in Michigan who told me that if there are mass deportations like what the president-elect has proposed, he said it would be devastating to the ag economy because there'd be nobody to pick the crops. But it's not just about farm workers. Across the entire food chain, you have this issue. Many sectors have tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of unauthorized workers, including food production, food related wholesale, grocery, restaurants, of course, all together and estimated $1.7 million people who work in the food industry are undocumented.
