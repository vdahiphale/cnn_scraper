Despite strong international pressure, Israeli lawmakers have banned the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA from operating in Israel. The agency is not barred from operating in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories but because it won't be permitted to transit through Israel.Experts say it will be harder for UNRWA to work in Gaza and the West Bank. UNRWA supports nearly six million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and other parts of the region. It provides food, education, medical services, even jobs. The head of the agency posted this on social media. This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human development assistance and services to Palestine refugees. These bills will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians, especially in Gaza, where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell. Our Jim Sciutto has more on the ban on UNRWA and the backlash. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: This move by the Israeli Knesset to prevent UNRWA, the main U.N. agency for providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza from operating inside Israel is receiving broad condemnation, not just from the U.N. but also from other countries around the world. The U.S. State Department spokesperson said this is a mistake. It's something that the U.S. opposes. And he said, \"there is nobody that can replace them, UNRWA right now, in terms of delivering crucial aid.\" We also heard from the foreign ministers of a number of countries, including Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom saying that UNRWA provides essential and lifesaving humanitarian aid. UNRWA itself says that this will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians. It goes on to call this the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA. Where does that come from? Well, Israeli lawmakers in passing this new legislation have cited investigations that showed that some members, some workers for UNRWA participated in, or were alleged to have participated in the October 7th attacks. Now, UNRWA has said and even others involved in humanitarian work in Gaza, that this is a very small number of many thousands of people who work for UNRWA, and of course, they cite the ongoing humanitarian crisis there with shortages of food, basic medical care, and now the outbreak of disease. In fact, the U.N. is saying that many people, particularly in the north of Gaza, are now in danger of dying because of that shortage. So, this move by the Knesset, though long debated, is getting quite immediate opposition and criticism from around the world. Jim Sciutto, CNN, Jerusalem.",

He would be willing to entertain some kind of an agreement in Gaza. The thing is, an agreement in Gaza, Rosemary, requires two things that he's unhappy with. On a ceasefire which he does not want because he did not achieve what he said so publicly and so many times. \"Total victory,\" or \"eradicating Hamas.\" Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is a post-war Gaza political plan and framework that includes an international force based on an Arab force that includes the Palestinian Authority entering Gaza.
