And if you sort of pull general public opinion about all the federal agencies, FEMA is often the most popular and with good reasons because they go in there and respond on a nonpartisan basis.Whoever needs help, any American who needs help, who's in a place where the president has determined that the local government basically can't handle this disaster anymore than FEMA is on the ground. They will be on the ground. We're going to need to have to pass a disaster supplemental sometime in November, December to replenish the coffers so that FEMA can be on the ground for whatever happens next. And, unfortunately, in this era of climate change where we have more severe and more frequent storms, we have no doubt that there's going to be more to come. So we've got to make sure that FEMA is ready to respond and doesn't have to wait for Congress to give it the money to respond.",

And what that meant is that a lot of people took a month or two before they had enough trust in their government to get access to all the care that they needed to get a rental subsidy so they could have a place to live so their family could be situated.And so this really isn't about politics, this is about people accessing the federal resources that they're entitled to as federal taxpayers. And, you know, I do think it sort of illustrates the choice in front of the voters which is, do you want a president who is going to respond to a natural disaster on an absolutely non-partisan basis or do you want a president who is going to try to figure out, well how do they vote? Are they blue or are they red? Are they for me or are they against me? We've never, ever had a president who treated disasters as a partisan political question and we never should. And in Kamala Harris, we have someone who's going to play it straight down the middle. I don't know whether Western North Carolina or the Tampa area or any of those other regions are blue or red. I mean, I could overlay an electoral map. Who cares? That's absolutely not the point. When Americans need help, we help them.",

I'm seeing that happen to a certain extent in Florida.

This is a real look behind the scenes specifically about how leaders in the U.S., president, former president talk to each other, talk to other world leaders.

But there is really an astonishing conversation and in the book, Woodward has it verbatim. This is during the Trump presidency, and it's revealed that President Trump secretly shipped to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the height of COVID these very scarce Abbott COVID, test machine. So just here's how the phone call goes between Trump and Putin. Putin says, \"Please don't tell anybody you sent these to me.\" Trump, \"I don't care. Fine.\" Putin, \"No, no. I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me.\"",
