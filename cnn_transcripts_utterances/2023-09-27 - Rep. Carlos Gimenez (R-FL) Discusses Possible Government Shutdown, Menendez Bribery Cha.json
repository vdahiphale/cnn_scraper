And that is just one aspect to a potential shutdown.Let's discuss with Republican Congressman Carlos Gimenez of Florida. Congressman, thanks for sharing part of your afternoon with us. Let's start with the stop-gap bill in the Senate. McCarthy says it doesn't have enough support in the House. It doesn't appear that he has a lot of options to avert a shutdown. Should he reconsider and put in on the floor of the House? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): No, I don't think -- look, it may be that it will come to the House floor regardless of what the speaker wants. But at the end of the day, what we need to do, is 98 percent of the Republican conference wants to pass a funding resolution that will control the southern border and reduce government spending by about 8 percent. And give us the time that we need in order to continue with regular order, and pass the appropriation bills that we need to pass. We should be passing four or five of those this week. And then I would hope that we can reason with the four or five other -- the four or five Republicans that right now are saying they won't pass a funding resolution, who -- which, by the way, will be joined by 210 Democrats to vote against the funding resolution. And so look, I think there is still some time to work this out. Hopefully, we will. But if it doesn't happen, remember, it's 210 Democrats voting no along with four or five Republicans. The vast majority of Republicans don't want to see a government shutdown.",
