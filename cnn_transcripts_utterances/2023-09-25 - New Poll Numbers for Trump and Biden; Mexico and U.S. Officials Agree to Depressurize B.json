Donald Trump's going to win with like an 84 Reagan-style level blowout. And that -- nobody sees that happening. What is interesting, though, and what consistent poll after poll after poll is on the economy. And you've covered this issue closer than anybody over multiple administrations. And I'm interested because Shelby makes this point, in terms of connecting what this administration has done, both legislatively and through executive action, the broader macro numbers versus how people are feeling. Where is the disconnect, do you think? SALEHA MOHSIN, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, \"BLOOMBERG\": A lot of it is in the messaging, but a lot of it is just when you're at the grocery store checkout, what are you seeing? You can hear a narrative from President Biden, who is hopscotching across the country to tell everyone that Bionomics is infrastructure, it's construction jobs, but all people are seeing is that egg prices are really high. I'm being told they've come down, they're still really high, and my wages have just not come up. The other side of it is also, it depends on who you ask. Republicans see Bidenomics as inflation. A lot of Democrats see it as job creation. And then there's the people in between. And there's a lot of apathy right there right in between.",
