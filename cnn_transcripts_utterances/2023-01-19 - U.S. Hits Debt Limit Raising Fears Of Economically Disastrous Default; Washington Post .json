The threat of an economically disastrous default is now hanging over Congress, the White House and every American.Also this hour, a new report that CIA Director William Burns made a secret trip to Ukraine to brief President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and share U.S. intelligence on Russia's next moves in the war. And Actor and Producer Alec Baldwin now faces criminal charges in the fatal shooting of a crew member on the set of the film, Rust. Our legal experts are weighing the evidence and whether the involuntary manslaughter charges will stick. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the partisan showdown over raising the debt ceiling and fears of an unprecedented default by the United States. Our Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju explains where this critical fight stands tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, Congress and the White House engaged in a risky standoff as the U.S. reaches its $31.4 trillion borrowing limit. The White House and congressional Democrats say no negotiations to raise the debt ceiling and no conditions attached. Speaker Kevin McCarthy says the opposite. Is a clean debt ceiling off the table? REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  I don't see why you would continue the past behavior.",

Do you think you may pull to vacate the chair if he doesn't follow those concessions? REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO):  I mean, that's what vacate is for but I don't anticipate using it.

But the Republicans swing votes who might sign-on to that effort tell me, Wolf, tonight that they're not ready to go that far. They are calling for the White House to sit down and talk.

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, the reality is it would impact all of us in one way or another. Currently, U.S. debt is considered virtually risk free. It is a safe haven investment. But suddenly if investors start to feel like, well, maybe the government can't be trusted to make its obligations to pay its debts, well, you're likely going to see its rating or the rate on interest rates for government debt go up. And that will have all sorts of impacts, Wolf, for consumer loans, anything essentially with a variable interest rate, you could see that go up if in fact we defaulted.So, let's use mortgages as one example. So, if the average 30-year bounces about 1.5 percent, which is one of the figures floating around today, Wolf, you could see potentially an extra $130,000 added to the life of the loan. We're talking about real money here. Let's talk about the markets. You were talking about the Dow, Wolf. The average retirement account could see a loss of about $20,000, so real dollars and cents here. And yet, Wolf it is hard to fully quantify the impact of a default here, because, as you pointed out, it has never happened before. But every economist, every strategist that I have spoken to today say that it would be devastating if in fact this would happen. We're talking about potential layoffs. We're talking about a potential credit rating threat as, Manu, was just talking about and as I said, market mayhem. One economist, Mark Zandi, he's the Chief Economist at Moody's, he told me a little earlier, Wolf, the closer we get to not being able to pay our debts, the closer we get to a recession.",

And I think when you look at the two sides of things right now with the White House stands and where House Republicans stands is very clear there's going to be no near-term agreement. And to some degree, that's part of the reason why White House officials have been so unequivocal in laying down their red lines this early in the process.They know, even thought, we're now in the midst of extraordinary measures, once again, that they have several months to work through that process, and that work is what I'm told is not going to be done publicly. Much of it will be done behind the scenes as they try and navigate some type of pathway out of this. I think one thing that has been made clear to me repeatedly by White House officials is this isn't a negotiating tactic, because, as you noted, Wolf, they don't believe there would be negotiation. This is responsibility for lawmakers. They understand where House Republicans stand on things, but after 10, 11, 12 years of these type of negotiations, this type of effort to use this issue as leverage, they plan to hold firm on where they stand and try to put a stop to something that, as one official said earlier today, is essentially like negotiating with a gun to your head.",

And what we heard him say today does not suggest that.Now, does he end up getting squeezed by the Senate in some fashion or another? That's certainly possible. The other problem for McCarthy, Wolf, is that any one member can call for a vote, a snap vote to get rid of him as the speaker. So, his hands are fairly tied. And as bad as Phil said, there have been so many of these rough negotiations over the last 12 years about the debt ceiling, I can't remember one that was like this. BLITZER:  Yes, I can't either.

They need to keep working on the agenda that they've laid out. They need to keep talking about the things that they believe people care about. And what they don't think people care about generally is the classified documents issue. Now, it is not minimizing the issue they currently face, particularly now that a special counsel is investigating.

They did very well in the 2020 campaign sticking to what they wanted to talk about and focus on and not getting drag into other issues.

They are serious about basically creating this fiscal crisis in order to exact cuts to social security and Medicare. That's their goal. And I think the Biden administration is exactly right to say you're not going to take the country's fiscal health hostage here. We're not going to negotiate over this. This is something that is -- the debt ceiling applies to debts that are already incurred and we pay our bills. And I think that's exactly the position they should take. BLITZER:  Let me also get your thoughts on a different issues while I have you, Congressman. President Biden, I don't know if you heard it, he just spoke while out in California on the classified documents found in his home and office saying there's no there, there, and he has no regrets. He's been following his lawyers' advice. He's saying that as well. Is that the right tone when this relates to highly sensitive top secret SCI documents?

They should do so here. I think what the president is alluding to is, you know, he's very confident that in his case this was completely unintentional, and I believe that's exactly right. And I think that when they do the investigation, they'll find that there was no intention to hold onto these documents and indeed when they were discovered, they were immediately turned over. That is, of course, a sharp distinction from what Donald Trump did with a far greater number of classified documents. There, there's every evidence that Donald Trump tried to obstruct the investigation and his lawyers may have lied to the FBI about the continued possession of those documents. So, I understand the president -- President Biden feeling I've got nothing to hide here, this is completely inadvertent. I think he's right.

DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), FORMER CIA DIRECTOR:  An unhelpful message I think at this point, Wolf. Look, there are understandable reasons for not wanting to give the M1 Abrams tank, the U.S. main battle tank. It's much heavier than the others. It's a good ten times heavier than the Leopard 2 to the German tank. It's much more difficult to maintain. It's a jet engine basically a turbine 1,500 horse power, turbine surrounded by armor. The spare parts and all the rest of that, the diagnostics are very, very challenging. That said if giving 14 tanks, say armored company's worth of tanks to Ukraine allows the Germans to provide Leopard 2 and as importantly to approved the transfer of Leopard 2 that other countries have Poland, Baltic States, Finland, some other in NATO that have those, then I think it's very much worth it. And I think it's time to get on with this, frankly. This is another one of those pivotal moments in Ukraine. The battle lines have been pretty static. Russia has been making incremental gains at great cost, but they're on the offensive. We know that Ukraine has said that they're planning an offensive for the spring. If they're going to have competent and capable combined arm capabilities, so not just tanks but also infantry fighting vehicles, artillery, motors, air defense, engineers, closer support et cetera, you've got to training for that. Some of that is ongoing right now in our training base in Germany. Tomorrow is a hugely important gathering of the coalition that comes together of NATO and western countries to provide arms ammunition and assistance to Ukraine. I think it would send a very important message for us to say, look, if giving, again, 14 tanks of ours to free up the Leopard 2s and other countries want to give, Poland is eager to do that, and by the way many of those will be replaced by the M1 Abrams tank, ultimately, let's get on with it. In addition to what are reportedly going to be very important other announcement by the U.S., which of course has done an incredible job of leading the world in providing staggering quantities of arms, ammunition and material, over $24 billion just since the beginning of the invasion. And this seems to me to be a pretty modest increment in that, yes, it's a strategic decision, but we should get on with this.

They say that we want to thank the Santa Fe sheriff and district attorney for concluding their thorough investigation and determining that the charges for involuntary manslaughter are warranted for the killing of Halyna Hutchins with conscious disregard for human life. Our independent investigation also supports that charges are warranted. It is a comfort to the family that in New Mexico no one is above the law. We support the charges, we'll fully cooperate with this prosecution and fervently hope the justice system works to protect the public and hold accountable those who break the law. As far as what happens next here, Wolf, the district attorney tells me that those charges against Alec Baldwin could be filed by the end of this month after which time he will receive summons to appear here either in person or by videoconference. Of course, we expect his legal team to put up an aggressive defense. Wolf?",

His legacy will continue to live on through his legendary music. And this was a man who was prolific in how much music he was making. Just went on twitter and he was still tweeting as recently as yesterday. Just so prolific in so many different ways of putting out music, writing songs, coming up with new tunes and so passionate about what he did. We also have a statement in from Melissa Etheridge as well and she posted this because her two children, the biological of them was David Crosby and this is what she had to say there.
