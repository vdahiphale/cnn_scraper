First up the two top Russian Generals have dropped out of views since the end of the aborted Wagner mutiny. There is a report one of them had advanced knowledge of the uprising. U.S. Supreme Court has just handed down its ruling on using affirmative action in university admissions that is deciding to overturn precedent. We'll get you live to Washington. Benjamin Netanyahu is dropping a controversial clause as the Israeli Prime Minister revises his plan to revamp the country's court system. More on that is coming up. You back with us for our second hour of \"Connect the World\", if you're just joining us, you are more than welcome, right now in France running battles between protesters and police breaking out at a protest march. It is the latest display of anger over a police shooting this weekend that killed a 17 year old boy. The French government is deploying 40,000 paramilitary and police officers to patrol the country after a second night of violent protests. French authorities insist the shooting was an isolated incident that many communities in France say they see a pattern of discrimination and excessive use of force, especially when it comes to policing communities of color. So tonight we ask is racial profiling a problem in France? Let's get you the very latest from CNN's, Melissa Bell, who is in Paris and Melissa, let's just start with you walking us through what is happening on the ground right now, if you will.",

He's not said where he is at all. Indeed, he's not spoken since the 11 minute audio message where he essentially clarified that he'd gone along with a deal with Lukashenko. So he could be anywhere he could be in Minsk, in a hotel, taking a breather, we don't know. But the fact that he's not, at this point, under some sort of detention or being interrogated by Russian security services just speaks again to how weak Putin is that he had to let this man go.

The Supreme Court hasended the use of affirmative action in college admissions ruling that colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a specific factor in admissions. Now, this landmark decision up ends a long standing precedent that has benefited black and Latino students in higher education. Conservative justices formed the majority in the opinion ruling against admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. They still suggested that race has affected applicants life can be part of how an application is considered. Well, liberal justices issued a fiery dissent, arguing the decision rolls back decades of progress and further entrenches racial inequality in the country. I want to bring in Legal Affairs Commentator, Areva Martin. Just explain to us what more we know about this decision? And ultimately, you know just how significant it is? AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Yes, Becky, what we know is that this ruling is the culmination of decade's long efforts to end the consideration of race in admissions and in striking down affirmative action programs that the University of North Carolina and Harvard conservative activists have won. They have won this decade's long battle around, including and making sure that diversity is front and center at major universities. Many universities, not just colleges, but also law schools, medical schools and other graduate programs have already indicated that without being able to use race as a factor, not a single factor, but as a factor in the admissions process will result in a significant drop in the number of minority students entering their programs. So this is a huge blow to those in the U.S. that believe in education equality, it's a huge blow to activists that have been fighting to ensure that race could be considered as a single factor in admissions to level the playing field, because so many of these colleges and universities disproportionately accept students who are from non-minority populations.",

And this is a man who can draw millions of crowd, millions out on the streets if he calls on his protester on his supporters to come out. And we saw scores today who showed up outside the Swedish Embassy in central Baghdad. You see video of them on social media that has been circulating with protesters scaling the walls of the compound. We don't know how far they got, how close they got to the embassy itself. But we do understand from the Swedish Foreign Ministry that their staff is safe and that they are in contact with them.

And we are seeing the condemnations coming from different Arab and Muslim countries.

While earlier the pop-star postponed her upcoming tour because of her health. Well earlier, Madonna's longtime manager confirmed the pop singer is recovering from a serious bacterial infection which had landed her in the intensive care unit for several days. Here's CNN's Medical Analyst, Dr. Leana Wen. DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: So if somebody is coming into the emergency department, and they are unresponsive as it sounds like Madonna was when she showed up, and they're suspected to have a bacterial infection, you first want to stabilize the individual. You would first want to make sure that they are breathing and supported, if they have low blood pressure from sepsis and overwhelming infection, you want to support their blood pressure. And you'll also want to start broad spectrum antibiotics that would cover a whole range of organisms in case they are what are causing the infection. And then you start looking for the source. The source could be a skin infection, soft tissue infection that then spread to the rest of the body. It could originate from the kidneys; it could originate from the lungs by way of pneumonia. It could be appendicitis or gallbladder infection or something in the belly. So there are all kinds of infections that could then spread to the bloodstream and unfortunately lead to this level of illness.",
