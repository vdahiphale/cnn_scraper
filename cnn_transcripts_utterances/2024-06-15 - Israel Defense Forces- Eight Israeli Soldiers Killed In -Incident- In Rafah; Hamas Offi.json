And we begin with this \"BREAKING NEWS\".The Israeli military says an incident in Rafah killed eight IDF soldiers, marking one of the deadliest incidents involving Israeli troops since the October 7th attacks. The militant wing of Hamas claims that carried out a complex ambush. The incident happened as the Rafah Civil Defense says Israel launched new airstrikes in the enclave.

But they do say that there has been that incident in western Rafah this Saturday, eight soldiers having been killed in that incident. They say that they are investigating at this point and trying to ascertain the cause of what happened.Now, we have heard from Hamas, they, as you say, claimed that they carried out a complex ambush. They say it was in the Tel al-Sultan area of Western Rafah. What they claimed they have done is that they attacked a military bulldozer, which was then engulfed in flames. An APC with crew that came to rescue those on the bulldozer was then under attack as well. That according to Hamas. But the IDF says they are reviewing the incident and they are investigating the exact cause. Now, what we do know at this point is that this is one of the most deadly attacks that has happened certainly from the Israeli military point of view since January, when 21 soldiers were killed. Now, we know this is also an area where there has been a significant amount of fighting over the past days. We know that according to civil defense official in Rafah that they had, had calls for injuries to be picked up, for bodies to be picked up, saying that there had been Israeli airstrikes and also significant artillery, shelling in that region over the past hours, in fact, since dawn. So, we do know that this is an area where there has been significant military activity. We had heard from the IDF on Friday, they say, that they had discovered tunnels in this particular area. They say they had also located large amounts of weapons and they say also that there had been paths (PH) and holes -- punched into walls between buildings, believing that was done by Hamas so that they could move around the area -- very heavily populated, dense area without being spotted. But certainly, this shows that there are significant military operations ongoing in the Rafah area at this point. And the IDF saying, eight soldiers have been killed. Hamas claiming responsibility. The IDF saying that they are looking into the cause. Fred?",

Now, to a massive protest in France against the far right. It comes on the heels of a week of political turmoil in that country. The French interior ministry estimates hundreds of thousands of protesters are taking into the streets across the country today. Most of them around Paris. This, as all in reaction to the far right snagging some 40 percent of the vote in last week's European union elections. It was a stunning victory that caught the political establishment off guard and prompted President Macron to call a snap election in France.

There is no reason to think that the national front, which was is now called the Ressemblement National, extreme right party here, might come to power. And, in fact, one of the labor union leader -- numbers said today with the snap elections being called for June 30th, the first round of the many way that, in fact, you could see extreme right prime minister just weeks from now. And so, that's galvanized a lot of these demonstrators today with five labor unions, who formed an alliance they call them the Popular Front and their sole aim is to stop the national front, the Ressemblement National from coming to power, sometime in these parliamentary elections. So, it's brought about a lot of disarray. And one of the more amazing things that happened today was that former President Francois alone said the situation is serious enough that he was coming out of political retirement and going to run for a seat in the new parliament. Here is his remark. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, FORMER PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): The reason why I made this decision is because I think the situation is serious.

As you can see behind me, much of those gatherers have now left given the awful weather that we are seeing now.But again, this is an event which typically every year would draw these enormous crowds to mark the king's official birthday. But, of course, many of those gatherings today were also hoping to catch a glimpse of the Princess of Wales. As you mentioned, this is her first public appearance with other senior members of the royal family since she made that shock announcement in March that she was undergoing treatment for cancer. The king, of course, also undergoing cancer treatment. But, of course, we did see her appearing today with her three young children. She was on the balcony with other senior members of the royal family. She appeared to be in high spirits with her three young children. And of course, as you mentioned, this also comes a day after she released a statement on Instagram. She shared a photograph, unclear when that photo was taken. But in that statement, she did explain a little bit about the kind of state that she is in right now, saying, \"On days when I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home. I'm learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much time needed to heal. Now, of course, the Princess of Wales also went on to say that she is not out of the woods just yet she is expected to continue to undergo treatment for cancer over the next few months. It's unclear whether we will continue to see the Princess of Wales at other royal engagement. It may well be that they take it on a case-by-case basis as she -- if she is well enough to take part in other royal engage. But at this stage, she is not making an official return to those royal engagements. Fredricka?",

All it can to help Ukraine recover its territorial integrity and defend its sovereignty.This was a very important step for him, and it draws a line should president should Donald Trump be reelected and return to the Oval Office, Donald Trump would have to renounce this agreement. And renouncing this agreement might unsettle some Senate Republicans. We'll see should that ever occur. In any case, the president -- the current president laid down a very strong marker.

It's going to start to sit squarely over the central and southern plains as we go into the weekend, eventually moves toward the Midwest and northeast. As we go into the workweek, look at all the records that could fall as we go into next week. We're talking more than 360 daily records, both daytime highs and overnight lows. Because we're not even going to get that relief at night. We'll find these temperature staying up near 80 degrees. So again, that's another concern for heat sickness because were just not getting that relief at night. Here's a look at this heat risk map. It's a new product actually by the National Weather Service and the CDC, looking at the risk for heat sickness. And it is extreme across a lot of the northern plains here as we go into Monday. Tuesday, it spreads into the Great Lakes, Chicago. And then by Wednesday, we're talking about parts of Upstate New York and Ohio with some of this extreme heat risk. Because you're looking at temperatures getting up towards 100 degrees. And Atlanta temperatures sit squarely in the middle 90s through the weekend. St. Louis getting up towards 100 degrees on Sunday, going for 98 degrees. Chicago, 97 degrees in Chicago on Monday. So temperatures again, really starting to swelter. I think that the Chicago seven days, just incredible. Because you're looking at these temperatures in the upper 90s in Chicago, which is well above the average of 81 degrees. And then the overnight lows are sitting up near 80 degrees, which is where their typical day daytime high should be this time of year. And of course, an overnight low of 80 degrees, you're just not getting any of that relief at night. So even for a place like Chicago that you don't think of an extreme heat season. Well, their summers are also getting warmer. Since 1970, Chicago has a 1.5-degree fever during the months of June, July and August. So what that means is that that adds eight more warm and above-average days during the summer season. So again, the season just continuing to get longer in extremes as we pump more of those greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Look at the next couple of days. Again, up in even in New England temperatures in the middle 90s by Wednesday and Thursday, up into Boston, New York as well. Philadelphia, temperatures in the middle 90s.

      "sentences": "Working while incarcerated, you know, first of all, I never made any more than $32 a month for a 40-hour workweek.In addition to that, in certain times that I was working like in a detergent plant, I think the chemicals that we were mixing was extremely dangerous chemicals. And I didn't have the equipment to actually protect myself. In the event that I would have refused to actually work, I think that they could've effectively taken me back to the board next, to continue my life sentence. I think that they could have excluded me from contact visits doing the canteen and doing a number of other things. You know, as a result of me going to prison, I also was being given education on the yard by other incarcerated people that taught me how to read and actually taught me how to reason. And I think as a result of that education that I got on the yard and people actually training me or actually educating me, I think that it actually improved the quality of my life when I got out. And not only did it improve the quality of my life, it improved the quality of my kids' life and my community life. So it's like the choice of just making detergent necessarily didn't do anything for me. I wasn't going to be a detergent maker. I wasn't going to be a construction worker. It also enabled me to actually go to college and do a number of other things because I was prepped in a different way of where I was going with my life and what -- how long to engage. At a certain point, I promised to other people who taught me how to read to return as a community asset instead of a liability. And I think that I've done that. So in terms of actually being -- we celebrate this month in Juneteenth. I'm in the middle of Juneteenth right now. And I'm going to go out and enjoy barbecue. But to the most part, I think that the narrative around the question of punishment is so potent. It doesn't allow people to actually see the practices of slavery that's under the nose. I think between 1865 and now, we probably enslaved millions of peoples a little bit at a time. But nobody actually called it slavery. And in reality, labor through force and fear and without consent is slavery. You know? And if you're not paying anybody, it's slavery. So those are the things that I think that I'm fighting for. And I'm fighting to change the constitution because I want to prohibit the practice of involuntary servitude that people are saying that it's something different than slavery. So let's just call it out. it's called all it prohibited involuntary servitude. And call it out as slavery, point blank. And I think that people should consent to the question of labor.",
