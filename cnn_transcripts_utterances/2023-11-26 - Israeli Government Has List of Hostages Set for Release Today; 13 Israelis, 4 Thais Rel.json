And the Israeli government now has the names of the hostages who will be freed today. 13 Israelis and four Thai nationals were released Saturday, but only after an hours-long delay threatened to upend the exchange. While following preliminary medical checks, all of the former hostages were taken to Israeli hospitals for care and to be reunited with their families. The deal also called for the release of 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday. And earlier, Hamas had stalled on releasing the hostages in a dispute over which Palestinians the Israelis were willing to release. And aid groups say some 187 trucks made it into Gaza Saturday with food, water, fuel and medical supplies. It's only a small fraction of what's needed. 61 of those trucks reached heavily damaged Northern Gaza, the most trucks in one day since the war began. Elliott Gotkine is following all this for you and joins us now live from London. Good morning again, Elliott. The second hostage prisoner exchange now behind us, completed, but it has been a nerve-racking ordeal.",

And for several hours, it was unclear if this painstakingly mediated truce done by the -- overseen by the Qataris between Israel and Hamas, it was unclear whether it was going to collapse before even reaching the halfway point.As you say, at issue ostensibly for Hamas, they say, was the amount of aid being allowed into Northern Gaza and also the identity of some of the Palestinian prisoners that Israel was due to release in terms of the seniority or the number of years that they had been serving in Israeli prisons. In the end, it did go through. And as you say, we saw 13 Israelis freed from captivity after 50 days in captivity after being kidnapped by Hamas during that murderous rampage of October the 7th. They were handed over to the Red Cross and then to hospitals where they were reunited with their families. At the same time, 39 Palestinian prisoners, this is women and minors, teenage boys, were freed as well. And they were also reunited with their families too. So, two days of this truce done. And despite that kind of rocky start, seems to be holding for now. Of course, let's remind ourselves that this deal provides for 50 Israelis to be freed and also for 150 Palestinian prisoners to be released as part of this deal. I think there were also some concerns on the part of the Israelis that, although the deal hasn't been published, this deal, we don't know the precise terms of it, but Israel says that one of the terms of this deal is that mothers would not be separated from their children. And with the release of Hila Rotem, a 13-year-old girl, by Hamas, her mother, Raaya, remains in captivity, it is presumed. In fact, the Israelis saying it's unknown where she is and what happened to her. So, a bit of concern that this part of the deal, which Israel says is included in this agreement, is not being kept to. But for now, as we say, this truce two days in, we're in day three, is holding.

      "sentences": "Very much so, it is very good news for them, Laila. But I think it is important to point out that this was a separate agreement. It is not the same as the one that Elliott was just talking about of the 50 hostages that were going to be released. This is a separate agreement between the Thais and all the parties concerned.As for the condition of those that were released, the four that were released on Saturday, in addition to ten that were released on Friday, those four that the prime minister himself putting it out on social media that they were in good health, that they were communicating well. And that's a really important point, given everything that they would have been through over the last few weeks. I do want to mention those ten that were received at the Shemer medical facility, the Shemer Medical Center, reputably the fourth largest government hospital Israel. They were observed by hospital workers as potentially lacking in nutrition. They were speaking to one of our CNN teams. They added that they were stable but not healthy. So, there's obviously quite a bit of work to be done just in terms of rehabilitation at the moment. There has also been a statement from the Thai foreign minister about this. He was expressing how he was elated to welcome the good news that you are speaking of and also sending congratulations to all of those who have been recently released and their families. But with that, Laila, we cannot forget that the Thai foreign ministry has also informed us that they estimate -- estimate, note, it's still very unclear -- that they estimate that there are still 18 Thai nationals being held hostage by Hamas. And the context of this is many of them are migrant workers. Their families back home in Thailand depend on them for the incomes that they send. This has been a trying time not just for hostages, not just in terms of everything that they've seen in the past few weeks, but for their families and their entire communities, there is still a lot of work to be done, Laila.",

A very good day, Daniel, so good to have you back with us. The focus right now is still very much on the war. But we want to look further down the line. How do you see this ending? Where do we go from here? DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S./MIDDLE EAST PROJECT:  Well, we now have -- although this is clearly going to be a bumpy road in the next few days, we now have proof of concept. We know a little more than we did just a very few days ago. We know that political negotiations, not militarily options, can get these Israelis and others being held in Gaza home. Those are going to be in exchange deals for what it seems largely political prisoners that Israel is holding of Palestinians. So, we know the negotiations can work. We know the Qatari-led mediation, with others, but the Qatari-lead mediation has proven highly effective, including during moments of tension with Qataris taking a very pragmatic and unusual step of flying to Israel yesterday. We know America has taken a degree of ownership of this process as well. We know also the level of destruction inside Gaza, an important report yesterday, that the number of women and children alone, civilians who have been killed in just two months, is double the number of women and children killed in Ukraine in almost two years. That's from The New York Times. And, crucially, we know that the Israeli government, having not been keen on this deal, was pressured into this deal by domestic pressure, by the actions of families, especially those being held inside Israel. So, we know that we can go forward with this. But, and that's crucial, it's what you referenced, the Israeli government has expressed its determination to continue with this war and devastation after this phase of releases. So, can one leverage all of the things we've seen in order to bring this to an end? And that's what I hope will be put to the test.",

Randa, a warm welcome to CNN.Tellingly, this group of detainees that has been released is very much like the first group that has been liberated, women and children. And, tellingly, while some have been sentenced for crimes, the majority have been under administrative detention, meaning not charged, not put on trial, not convicted of anything. How common is that form of imprisonment by Israel? RANDA WAHBE, AL-SHABAKA POLICY ANALYST:  Yes. So, just to take a step back, administrative detention is a policy under Israeli military law that allows for Palestinians to be detained in military prisons indefinitely without charge and without the ability to stand trial. They are arrested and held under secret information that neither they nor their lawyers are ever privy to. And since the beginning of the military occupation of the West Bank in 1967 and then military law, Israel has used this policy to routinely imprison thousands of Palestinians, particularly targeting activists, political leaders, students, children. Right now, there are about 36 children under administrative detention, people who work for non- profits and human rights organizations. And this policy is above all a policy to try to crush dissent to Israel's continued control over the Palestinians and to try to fracture and break Palestinian society so that we cannot make our demands for freedom. So, right now, Israel has ramped up its administrative detention policy and it's reached a 20-year high. There's 2,000 Palestinians in administrative detention, 1,000 of them who were arrested in the last seven weeks alone.",

It's not only a gross violation of international law because of the lack of due process and the right to a fair trial, but it also has a major psychological impact on the detainees and their families because they have no idea why they're being detained, they have no idea how long they're going to be detained, and their lives are completely upended and their futures are uncertain.

So, when children are arrested, they're usually arrested -- actually, when all Palestinians are arrested, they're usually arrested during a late- night raid or an early-morning raid on their home. And they're arrested without a warrant. They're taken blindfolded and handcuffed. Their families do not know where they've gone. And oftentimes it takes 24 hours to 48 hours to even be able to locate what detention center they are in.And during that period, children have said and have testified that that's when they are experiencing a lot of torture, where they are being beaten, where they are being put in stress positions. They are not treated like children or afforded any rights as children. They are criminalized like adults and they are treated with the same brutality as adults.
