That seems absolutely terrifying.Let me ask you also in a separate situation that -- with the airline industry. The FAA recently audited the production of Boeing 737-MAX jets after that door plug incident we've talked so much about. And the FAA administrator says that they found through this audit, production plant hygiene issues. What they described as, like, issues that are key to producing a quality airplane. The New York Times adds to this that the company failed 33 of the 89 audits during that FAA review. And here's Boeing response -- Boeing's response to the report, in part. \"We continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers.\" Mary, can you add this all up for me if you will? What do you make of this?",

But to make this kind of a finding -- these many problems and these many failures -- I mean, you know, they fail about half of their audits -- is really troubling for Boeing. Because remember, they're supposed to follow their own procedures. However you assemble your aircraft, there is a -- you know, there are all kinds of proven procedures and you must do it that way every time. You cannot freelance. And a lot of what they found is they're just freelancing.

Witnesses that Republicans say undercut Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony about Donald Trump's actions on the day of the insurrection. Some of those transcripts include testimony from the driver of Trump's SUV on January 6 and also some Trump White House officials.Ever since the Trump White House aide-turned-whistleblower's testimony in 2022, Republicans have tried to question her credibility. This new report says this, in part. \"None of the White House employees corroborated Hutchinson's sensational story about President Trump lunging for the steering wheel of the Beast.\" She was recounting what she heard from someone else. CNN's Marshall Cohen joins me right now for more on this. Marshall, you've been looking through this report. What else are Republicans trying to say here?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Kate. This is the investigation of the investigation. House Republicans releasing this report yesterday to try to undermine and undercut the findings of the January 6 Committee.So what they zeroed in on was this explosive story that you just described of Donald Trump lunging -- allegedly lunging in his presidential limo right after his speech on January 6 where he was demanding to go to the Capitol. That has been at the center of a serious dispute ever since Cassidy Hutchinson described it under oath. And I want to be clear that she said that she didn't witness it but she heard about it. That's what she told the committee. So according to this Republican report, the committee actually interviewed the driver of the presidential SUV, but there's a real distinction between the way that the committee described it in their final report and the actual transcript of what this guy said, according to the way that the Republicans spelled it out. So look at his, Kate. On the top here, this is from the January 6 Committee two years ago. They said that the \"driver testified that he did not recall seeing what President Trump was doing and did not recall whether there was movement\" -- any movement towards the front of the vehicle to try to overpower the Secret Service agents. That's how the committee described it. But this, on the bottom, is actually a quote from the transcript itself as surfaced yesterday in this Republican report. They said that the driver said that Trump, quote, \"never grabbed the steering wheel and that 'I didn't see him, you know, lunge to try to get into the front seat at all.'\" An unequivocal denial from the driver. Republicans are accusing the committee of basically cherry-picking the evidence to portray Trump in the worst way possible. But I want to point out, Kate, that Cassidy Hutchinson's team insists that she always told the truth, and other parts of the testimony in this Republican report corroborated what she said -- that Donald Trump was irate that he could not go to the Capitol that day.",
