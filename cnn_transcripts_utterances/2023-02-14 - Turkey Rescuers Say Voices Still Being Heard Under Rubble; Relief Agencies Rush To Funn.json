The level of destruction is just stunning here.I mean, and you know, we're seeing -- we're starting to see this shift in focus of the mission from search and rescue, to potentially preparing for this to be a search and recovery, more than a week now, but, yes, you do have these miraculous rescues, as you mentioned. Just a few hours ago we met with U.S. volunteers who are here in Antakya and they told us that yesterday they helped save a 17-year-old boy who has been under the rubble for more than a week. And at the same time, you know, they say that it's something, like they have never seen before. They've certainly not seen anything on this scale. It's just so widespread. They have so many buildings here that you don't even have enough rescuers to really carry out these search and rescue missions in these buildings. These American volunteers telling us that they really felt helpless here. They did try to do their part. They have saved at least three lives. But at the same time, they say there's so much to be done here. Even with about 100,000 rescuers across this massive earthquake zone, they say that is enough. And they just feel absolutely helpless, as do many people, here when it comes to trying to save the lives of those who still may be miraculously under the rubble, or retrieve the bodies of those who lost their lives. So, that their families are able to bury them -- Bianna.",

Thanks so much.And for more on the thousands of people who are needing medical assistance, who need some health care, let's bring in Avril Benoit, the executive director of Doctors Without Borders, United States. Thank you for being with us. First, as you just reported with 14,000 in hospitals reported according to President Erdogan, explain the disparity between what they need, and what's available now and how you're trying to fill that. AVRIL BENOIT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS-UNITED STATES: Well, a lot of aid and effort is under way in Turkey. Our focus is actually primarily in northwest Syria, where we are now entering, as we just heard, the second phase of this from a medical standpoint. So that means you're going to have people with the effects of the injuries from the earthquake. But you'll also probably start to see more and more of the knock-on effects of people separated from their medications for chronic diseases. You still have all of the other pressures on the health care system. You have the risk of cholera in northwest Syria. We just had a recent outbreak of cholera just in the weeks leading up to this particular disaster. And so, as the effort now is to retrieve bodies, and maybe the lucky few who survived, the ongoing medical needs will be long term.",

Some 48 health facilities in northwest Syria are unusable at the moment and will need to be repaired right away.So the focus is to shift everyone who is able to work, including many of our staff. We had and continue to have, roughly 500 staff working in northwest Syria, to ship them from the places we had to evacuate, or that are too damaged to be able to work in, to the facilities that are still functioning. And so, that includes the maternity wards that are delivers babies. That includes the trauma hospital where is you've got the operating room theaters that are doing the surgeries.

Another thing that is concern that while the Russians have lost a huge number of men and tanks and such like on the battlefield, their air force is still strong.But for the NATO allies that the joint chiefs of staff and the defense secretary was speaking with today it's about getting all of the nations' contributing integrated any useful way. 11 nations contributing takes, 22 nations contributing armored fighting vehicles, 16 nations contributing artillery and ammunition, nine nations contributing air defense system. So, you need integrated air defense. You need integrated training. And training is one of the things that we've been seeing Ukrainian troops get here in Poland. Important training on tanks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over): After just a week of training, Ukrainian tank crew show off their new skills on a Polish gun range. The first time their Leopard 2 training has been put on display. The crews pulled direct from Ukraine's Eastern battlefront. Too soon to say what's best about the Leopard 2, Ukraine's tank trainer says, but the machine is good quality. And what is most important my soldiers like it a lot. Their training fast tracked 12 hours a day six days a week compared to the Polish standard, eight hours a day five days a week. Polish instructors say the Ukrainians will be ready in a month.

Her name is Marian Proctor, very emotional. She was asked -- according to her sister -- Maggie was asked to go to Moselle -- the hunting property where the murders took place -- by Alex Murdaugh on the day of the murders. She said she had a conversation with her that day around 4:00. She said that Maggie had been told by Alex that they were going to see his father, who was dying. She also shared what she thought was a pretty odd conversation she had with Alex in the days after the murder. She asked him if Paul and Maggie had suffered, and he said no, but then he said this.

That is really interesting because he also told that to investigators, but of course you know, there's that recording from Paul Murdaugh's phone at 8:44 p.m. which the state and many witnesses have already said they recognize Alex Murdaugh's voice on that recording.",
