I'm John Vause at the CNN Center in Atlanta with our breaking news coverage of Israel's war with Hamas.And Israeli airstrikes continue to pound Gaza, more than 1,000 targets have now been hit. According to the IDF, all of them linked to the militant group Hamas. The Gaza based group, which carried out a surprise attack over the weekend. The deadliest on Israeli soil in 50 years. And this is just the beginning of an Israeli response, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned will resonate for generations. As explosions continue to rock Gaza, the Israeli Defense Minister has ordered a complete siege, cutting off electricity and water from Israel, as well as food, fuel and other supplies. There's been no lit up and rocket fire from Gaza. Overnight, mostly targeting southern Israel. Right now, dozens of hostages are being held by Hamas somewhere in Gaza. The spokesperson for the military wing of Hamas, wanting a civilian hostage will be publicly executed in response to Israeli airstrikes on Palestinian homes. The death toll on both sides has soared to more than 1,500 including at least 900 killed in Israel, where officials are still finding bodies after the surprise attack from Hamas by air, land and sea. Here's Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We have begun and I emphasize we have only begun to strike at Hamas.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says anywhere Hamas operates from will be left in ruins. Unrelenting airstrikes could just be the prelude to a ground offensive. Nearly 700 people have been killed in Gaza. That includes at least 140 children according to the Palestinian health ministry. Thousands more have been injured, tens of thousands have been displaced. For the past two decades Hamas has been slowly improving its military capability, building deadlier, longer-range missiles; digging an extensive network of tunnels under Gaza; arming and training jihadi fighters better than ever before.

They swept into Israeli territory and launched a wave of atrocities, killing at least 900 people in the worst Israeli setback in 50 years. Once a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas' Sunni movement won Palestinian elections in 2006 on a platform of social reform and resistance to Israel, driven by corruption and incompetence, rival Fattah launched attacks immediately against the movement which denies the right of Israel to exist at all. In the end, Hamas won control of Gaza. And its grip on the enclave of around 2 million people tightened as Israel and Egypt largely sealed it off causing intense humanitarian problems. Hamas responded with waves of rocket attacks against Israel that got worst as the years went by. Israel counterattacked from the air and with ground assaults that left thousands dead and Hamas still in charge. But Iran's influence has been key to Hamas's military power.",

DAVIS: Well, that's an interesting question, isn't it? If you are Moscow, you'd be looking at the situation in the Middle East now as potentially advantageous because essentially the Americans and the Europeans will need to support both Ukraine and Israel. And that could really strain them. There was a comment made a couple of weeks ago by a European observer in relation to Ukraine where he said we are at the bottom of the barrel in terms of arms supplies to Ukraine. If the U.S. and its European partners now have to support Israel as well as preparing for other contingencies such as, for example Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific, it's really going to put us to breaking point. But we have little choice, because if we don't support Israel, if we don't support Ukraine, our adversaries gain advantages that could very well place western security directly at risk.",

The Israeli defense minister has ordered the complete siege of Gaza and will stop the supply of food, fuel and electricity coming from Israel. Rockets are also being launched from Gaza.
