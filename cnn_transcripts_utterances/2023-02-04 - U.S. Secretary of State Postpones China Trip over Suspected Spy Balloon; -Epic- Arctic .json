Some new weather models show the winds pushing it out over the Atlantic as early as today.The Pentagon has been closely tracking the large object and concluded it's carrying a payload of surveillance gear. Military officials are advising against shooting it down for now but say that could eventually happen. China has apologized and said the balloon entered U.S. airspace by accident. Beijing also claims it's a science balloon but the diplomatic blowback has been swift with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly postponing his long planned trip to Beijing on Friday. But the balloon is very big, about the size of three city buses. The U.S. military is concerned that, if it were shot down, it would create a large and hazardous debris field, that could harm people and property on the ground. CNN has reporters all over this developing story. Tom Foreman is tracking the balloon from Washington, D.C. Will Ripley is in Taipei, Taiwan, with a look at secretary of state Antony Blinken postponing his trip to China after the suspected spy balloon fallout.

ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I made clear that the presence of this surveillance balloon in U.S. airspace is a clear violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law, that it's an irresponsible act and that the PRC's decision to take this action on the eve of my planned visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.",

And it is postponed. It's not canceled.

But they are accusing some politicians and media in the United States of blowing this issue out of proportion, taking advantage of it as an opportunity to, in their words, attack and discredit China, which is usually what China says whenever they're criticized for anything. What makes this situation different, the fact that China actually acknowledged on the eve of the Blinken visit, that this balloon incursion was a mistake. And many analysts that I've spoken with seem to agree. China has very little to gain here by this massive orb hovering over the heartland of America, including my alma mater, the University of Missouri/Columbia.

But even when you have states that are primarily focusing on K-12 courses, you're seeing some bleed-over into higher education.So for example, in Oklahoma, there was a community college -- to remind viewers, Oklahoma has a very significant history of abusive race relations, including the Tulsa race riots, the Tulsa race massacre. But a community college, there in response to a law that is primarily about K-12 institutions, canceled a class on race relations because a parent had complained about it. And the college claimed that they needed to ascertain whether or not the subject matter of the course was prohibited by a state law. And it only took a national outrage over this to get the college to back down from that.",

Ron DeSantis, for instance, overhauled the board of a new college of Florida, which was a left leaning college. Now he is trying to make it more conservative.And overall across the country, I think I saw a number, some 39 percent of bills in 2022 targeted higher ed, compared with 30 percent in 2021. That was according to PEN America. So why do you think the focus is shifting slightly now toward colleges?",

Colleges are supposed to be where you have unfettered debate and where you get ideas -- or as you're growing, up as you are, discovering yourself, you encounter ideas and theories that you might not agree with.And it's about thinking, discovering these ideas and grappling with, them and figuring out what your view on it is.
