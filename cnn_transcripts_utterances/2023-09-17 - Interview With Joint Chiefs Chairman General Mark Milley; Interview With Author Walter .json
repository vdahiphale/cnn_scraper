Plus his controversial appearance with Trump in Lafayette Park and allegations that the U.S. Military has become too woke. GEN.

And then this offensive, although slow, slower than the planners had anticipated, it has been steady and they have made steady progress through these various defensive belts, and they have fought hard up in Bakhmut, they fought down in Donetsk, and of course they're fighting down in Zaporizhzhia and down towards Melitopol and Mariupol and all of that.So it has been steady progress. What I said months ago was it's going to be long, hard, bloody because the nature of this particular fight and the type of defense that the Russians put in, and the capabilities of the Ukrainians uttered for a very, very difficult, long tough fight. But the Ukrainians have been doing that. They have a lot of combat power remaining. The Ukrainians are not a spent force. And there is sufficient weather that allows them to continue to achieve their steady progress. They have not failed. I know there's some commentary out there that somehow this offensive has failed. It hasn't failed. It's at least achieved partial success. They're already through several of these belts and they've got time left. So we'll see where it goes. But the Ukrainians are demonstrating an incredible ability of courage, resilience, toughness, and they are slowly but steadily working their way through some very, very difficult Russian defenses.",

This offensive, although significant, has operational and tactical objectives that are limited in the sense that they do not, even if they are fully achieved, they don't completely kick out all the Russians which is the broader strategic objective that President Zelenskyy have.That's going to take a long time to do that. That's going to be very significant effort over a considerable amount of time. I don't want to put a time on it because a lot of things can happen in a war. It's action, reaction, counteraction. You could see a general collapse, you could see escalation, you could see a lot of different things happen in the future. But I can tell you that it will take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 plus Russian troops out of Russian occupied Ukraine. That's a very high bar.

A lot of times you're experimenting in them. You're introducing new capabilities so you've got to be careful with the conclusions from, quote-unquote, \"war games.\" They're typically not exactly free play and they are designed to achieve certain outcomes to begin with.So I would tell you a couple of things in an unclassified way about, you know, Taiwan. First of all, we the United States still maintain that the Taiwan Relations Act, the communication assurances that go with that, and we the United States want a peaceful outcome between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, and whatever that is between those two peoples, that is the U.S. desire, right? As long as it's done peacefully. So -- but militarily, I think China would make a grave strategic mistake if they attempted to attack to seize the island of Taiwan. That's not the only option, by the way. But to attack and seize the island of Taiwan is a very, very high bar. It's the most complex of all operations to do. And frankly the Chinese military capability is probably not there right this second to do that. President Xi in public unclassified speeches has challenged the People's Liberation Army and Navy and Air Force to develop that capability by 2027 is what he said. It used to be the 2030s and then he moved it to 2027. That doesn't mean he made a decision to do it but that means that he wants them to have the capability to do it. And what that also means is they don't have the capability right this second. At least in his mind. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And what I see on a day-to-day basis -- right now for example, Fareed, in the last 24 hours we've had about 5,000 sorties of U.S. aircraft that are keeping the skies safe. You've had somewhere between 60 and 100 U.S. naval vessels patrolling the seven seas. You've got a quarter of a million U.S. troops -- ground troops, the army or marine corps, on freedom frontier sort of thing around the world maintaining peace and stability.This is a military that's dedicated to maintaining our readiness or capabilities or lethality.

And we can manufacture in the United States again.And people at that point in the '70s and '80s, all of the car companies have outsourced almost 70 percent of what they did.

The car that drives itself. And that is all a software issue.And one of the big leaps he did right -- just a few months ago and sort of the near the end of the book, is they had hundreds of thousands of lines of code that taught the car how to drive. You see a red light, you stop. You see yellow lines, don't cross. Now they're doing it with machine learning like ChatGPT, generative artificial intelligence -- you know, it's filling up the computer with a billion frames of video a day of humans driving so the car learns to do what a human would do in the situation.",

And he said, you know, everybody who came to America must -- came -- were risk takers. Whether they came on the Mayflower or came across the Rio Grande. But we lost the talent for being risk takers. We have got more referees than risk takers and regulators.So, he is willing to try things. And it means that Boeing and NASA have not been able to get, say astronauts in the U.S. into orbit, into the space station, but he's able to do that multiple times. He sent up 5,000 communication satellites which are the only ones that work. And it is that ability to iterate and take risks that I think is just part one of the puzzle.",

People now think of Musk as something of a conservative because, you know -- and certainly a kind of libertarian around COVID. But I'm struck by his biggest businesses are all totally dependent on the government. SpaceX, the biggest customers are NASA and the defense department. Tesla, without the loan he got, Tesla might not have survived. But more importantly as a Tesla owner, you get a huge tax credit for buying it. And Solar, when he did it, said he was entirely based on, again, the federal tax credits, California tax credits. Does he reflect on the oddity of thinking of himself?",

But there is a distinction I'm going to try to make here, which is Boeing and other contractors have cost-plus contacts which means the government pays you and if you're late you get more and you -- get a guaranteed profit. And if it goes, if the cost overruns you actually make more money.What Musk did was that it is a fee for service. If you want the satellites up you pay me this much and I take the risk. And it is a new way of doing business which means the risk capital came from SpaceX and him, not from the government.",

What I want to ask you about the Starlink case is -- so he -- you know, it's now famous because of your book that he told Starlink -- the Ukrainians, I won't let you use Starlink in Crimea if you start attacking it. You can use it in Ukraine, you know, not including kind of the parts that the Russians annexed in 2014, you can use the part they annexed in 2022.The reason he said it is because he thinks -- he thought that that would cause World War III, that the Russians would respond with nuclear weapons. Well, the Ukrainian found ways to attack Crimea repeatedly, in fact, just last week, and the Russians have not used nuclear weapons. Do you think that -- does Elon Musk take feedback that is negative? Does he realize that he was wrong about that?",

And certainly, that night in September when he's deciding not to enable Starlink, the Ukrainians don't know it is already been disabled, he thinks that it's going to cause World War III. They're going to go nuclear.And in the end, as you say, that wasn't exactly true. But I don't know. You're more of an expert than I am. There was a nontrivial chance that it could have caused a more robust response. But it didn't. Yes. And so, Musk, does take feedback not very well. One of his weaknesses, not enough people telling him no. But at a certain point he takes feedback. You've had Mark Milley earlier on this show. He talks to General Mark Milley. He talks to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. And they decide that control of Starlink should now be some of it transferred to the U.S. government. So that the U.S. government gets to make the decision on would it be too dangerous to allow it to be used that way. So, I watched him over the past few months. He said, maybe there is too much power for a private citizen like me and maybe I don't know whether it is going to cause a nuclear war. Let's let the U.S. government do it.",
