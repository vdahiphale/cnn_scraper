And we are following breaking news out of Brazil where a group of protesters have breached security barriers at that country's congressional building and gained access to the structure.The supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro also broke into the federal supreme court building in that country and its presidential palace. Neither House of Congress in Brazil is currently in session. And Brazil's new president, we should note, is not at the palace. But there's still lots to follow in all of this. And let's go straight to CNN's Rafael Romo, who is following this. Rafael, of course, viewers here in the United States and around the world can see the parallels between what is taking place in Brazil right now and what took place in this country on January 6th of 2021.

Then a numerous group of protesters started marching towards the area where government buildings for all three branches of government are located. At one point, protesters stormed the building that houses the Brazilian Congress before other groups did the same at the Planalto Palace, the seat of the executive power, the presidential building, and also the supreme court.Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office only a week ago, Jim, is still speaking about the situation there. And he's been calling the protesters vandals and fanatical fascists, and adding that those who committed acts of vandalism will be found and punished. There is no precedent to what is happening today, he said. Over the last couple of hours, Jim, we have obtained images of protesters vandalizing offices, and clashing with the few government employees who were trying to stop them. There's also a video of a man sitting at the desk of Brazil's Congress president, if you can imagine that. Other videos show protesters carrying flags and throwing objects amid tear gas clouds. To give you a little bit of background, Jim, Brazil has a new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who took office exactly a week ago. His predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, lost the second round of the presidential election in October by less than 2 percentage points. As you can imagine, Brazil is a polarized and deeply divided country. Bolsonaro, instead of attending the swearing in ceremony, decided to leave the country and travel to Florida where he currently is -- Jim.",

Right now, according to DHS, that number has dropped significantly to about 700. But you can take a look around me, Jim, there are hundreds of people still here.

What do you think about the president making this trip now? I know you were with us a few weeks ago and you said that he needed to make this trip. REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX): Well, first of all, Jim, I'm glad that he's come to Texas to see the situation, the humanitarian crisis at the southern border. And I give him a lot of credit for doing it. It takes a lot of political courage for any president, Republican or Democrat, to go engage on an issue that is the number one boogieman for the other side. In the runup to the 2022 elections, the border is what Republicans hit Democrats most. And here you have Joe Biden going right there to the border to see what's going on. So I give him a lot of credit for that. I did take issue with the proposal that the administration put out, the proposed new rule because it expands the use of Title 42, which was put in place by Stephen Miller and the Trump administration really because they wanted to get everybody out, didn't want any asylum seekers in the United States. The Biden administration is not going that far, but it is the recurring use of Title 42. But there's also what's called a transit ban or a kind of modified transit ban that they're using. And the way that works is if these migrants along the way, if they go through Mexico, for example, and don't apply for asylum in Mexico, then they suffer consequence when they come to the United States. They're barred from being considered for asylum. And so there's -- you're essentially setting a new precedent --",

And what they normally do, not only in this case, but many other cases, is check the national database, CODIS, which is administered by the FBI. It started in 1990 and it came of great use starting in 1994. But, unfortunately, despite the huge size of this database, with 14 million profiles, even more than that, they got no hit. And that's not surprising because now we know that Kohberger was not a felon. He was not put on that database. So, they got no hit. That's not what broke the case. DNA is going to finish the case because, as you pointed out a moment ago, DNA was found in the trash of the residence where the Kohbergers live in Pennsylvania in Albrightsville.
