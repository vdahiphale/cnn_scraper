Kamala Harris slamming those comments as the race for the presidency enters the home stretch. Plus, the death toll is rising in Spain following those devastating floods. A year's worth of rain fell in a single day, leaving a path of destruction in Valencia. And to renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon as Hamas officials reject a temporary ceasefire and say they need a permanent withdrawal. Well, presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are making their final push for votes with just five days left in this race. While they're also engaging in tit-for-tat over those garbage comments related to Latinos and protections for women. Trump is expected to speak shortly at a rally in New Mexico before making campaign stops in Arizona and Nevada. Wednesday in Wisconsin, he tried to seize on the garbage remark made by President Joe Biden, donning an orange reflective vest and riding in a garbage truck. Later at a rally, he made these comments despite he says the objections of his advisors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  About four weeks ago, I would say no, I want to protect the people. I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women -- sure, please, don't say that why? They said we think it's -- we think it's very inappropriate for you to say so, why? I'm President, I want to protect the women of our country. Well I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not, I've got to protect them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Recall that one of the keyissues for the Harris campaign over the course of the last several weeks and months is reproductive rights, and part of the reason for that is because they believe it's a galvanizing issue for voters and especially women. And so, that is what they are banking on to bring them out to the polls, and to capitalize on what you heard there from Alayna, that gender gap that the Vice President has been able to lead in when it comes to women. So, certainly, the campaign is leaning in on this issue, I've spoken with multiple advisors of hers who tell me to expect this to be front and center in these last closing days of the election. And you can already see it in their television ads where they are continuing to push out ads on reproductive rights and trying to illustrate the consequences of that. And you mentioned Nikki Haley, this is also an issue that they think can appeal to those disaffected Republicans. Republicans who are tired of former President Donald Trump, or simply concerned about reproductive rights. And so, that is the hope that the campaign is clinging onto right now, that they can continue to attract voters by using this very issue by highlighting the former President's remarks and essentially casting him as someone who does not have women's rights top of mind the way the Vice President does.",

They actually think he helps with that. They argue that some of the policies that he's been pushing, particularly when it comes to healthcare, he's talked a lot about the kinds of processed foods that he wants to ban if he were to have a position of power after the election in a potential Trump administration as well as seed oils. I'm getting into the weeds here, but they think that is the type of rhetoric that actually does well with women. That's why you've actually seen Donald Trump showcasing RFK Jr. in a huge way. Over the last week or so, he's been bringing up RFK Jr. to the stage at a number of his rallies, saying that he's going to ensure that he is in control of healthcare. So, that's one side of it. When I -- when you ask about the concerns -- so, I think some of the concerns about RFK Jr. is one he has a lot of controversial stories that have been written about him over the last year or so, including stories about relationships with women. They think that could be potentially a concern about him. And also just recognizing that there's a lot of policy areas where RFK Jr. is not in the same place as Donald Trump. You know, when he was still running as an independent candidate against Donald Trump, they differed on a lot of things. The Trump campaign had actually framed him as someone who was a liberal in conservatives closing -- clothing. They went after him very hard on his environmental policies, so, that could potentially be a detraction from having him be such a big part of this campaign.",

Look, there's been some optimism expressed, you know, on the Lebanese side, for example, the Lebanese government side, that is. But there's been nothing in terms of concrete progress made to actually securing on the one hand a ceasefire in Lebanon or a withdrawal of Israeli forces there. There are some proposals on the table, but you know, the Israeli government, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister making it clear that any agreement would necessitate Israel having the ability to enforce a Hezbollah withdrawal, for instance, a peace agreement in southern Lebanon. Which is something that Hezbollah may not be willing to sign up to, well, we'll have to wait and see. And in terms of a ceasefire in Gaza, Israeli military operations still continuing there, intensifying there, and Hamas basically rejecting any idea at the moment of a ceasefire without a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent ceasefire. Not just a short-term one being agreed to by the Israeli authorities. And so, yes, there are talks underway, there are possibilities out there, but there's nothing concrete yet in terms of this fighting, this bloodshed coming to an end.",

The remaining hostages of 101 people it's still holding, that it wants that to be worth a ceasefire that's going to last for a long period of time. A permanent ceasefire and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. That's what Hamas say that they want. Look, I mean, part of the problem in Israel is that, you know, whether or not to go for a ceasefire is a -- it's not a military decision, it's a political decision. And Benjamin Netanyahu has right-wing parties as part of his coalition, who want the war in Gaza, for example, to continue. They want the war in Lebanon to continue, they want the war against Iran to be escalated. And if he doesn't do those things, or if he agrees to a ceasefire on any of those fronts, then it's possible that those right-wing parties could withdraw their support from his coalition and collapse his government. And so, that's why it is very difficult for Benjamin Netanyahu right now to agree any kind of ceasefire because it would risk his own political survival.",

For the second straight day, we are getting good news about the American economy.

The Commerce Department reports that prices rose just 2.1 percent from a year ago, and that's just a whisper away from the Fed's 2 percent inflation target, and it will likely solidify more rate cuts. Well, on Wednesday, we learned that the U.S. GDP expanded by an annual rate of 2.8 percent, and that's another sign that America may be approaching the so-called soft- landing where inflation is tamed without a recession.

The Federal Reserve will look at today's data, the look at the jobs report that's coming out tomorrow. And they will likely cut rates again at their next meeting, though, Lynda, their next meeting is right After the election. So, no one's going to get a bump from that rate cut. But this is important data, as you said, for the Biden and Harris campaign, showing that they have in their time in office been able to get inflation under control.

The RNC is certainly pushing this aggressive court strategy to cast doubt on the results. Are voters mentioning to you their fear of the likelihood of another insurrection?",

Just looking at theenthusiasm that people report and the turnout we're seeing in early voting so far, although you can't really compare that to 2020 because the circumstances were so different. It does seem that people on both sides are pretty in -- are pretty excited to turn out and vote, whether that's out of excitement or fear, right, positive excitement or negative excitement, one way or the other, the campaigns just want to get their supporters to the polls. So, they don't really care whether it's because people are hopeful or because they are fearful. And I think there's a bit of a mix of both on both sides in this campaign.",

First of all, Hispanics love Trump. True. I like them. They're smart. You're a lot smarter than the person running for president on the Democrat side. You could say a lot smarter than Biden too, I can tell you. They're smart. They're entrepreneurial as hell. They're great entrepreneurs, actually great small business owners and big business owners too. But they're great. They work their asses off. That's right. They don't want to get anything for nothing. They want it. They just want a fair, nice level playing table. And that's what's going to happen. But you know what? No, but did you hear? I'm at the highest point of any Republican in history.

He was just saying that Hispanics love Trump and that they're smart and they work their butt off, essentially. I want to bring Molly back in, because we also saw in recent days, Donald Trump losing some key endorsements. Harris gaining some. Certainly, Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger -- or former Republican governor, I should say, and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, through his support behind Harris. He's not one to typically endorse any candidate, but he is Republican. We know the two Puerto Rican superstars, Jennifer Lopez, who's going to perform tonight, and also rapper Bad Bunny, also supporting Harris. Trump still is maintaining some support from the likes of astronaut Buzz Aldrin and Hulk Hogan. Molly, how much sway do you think these celebrities have with voters?",
