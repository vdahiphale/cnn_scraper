Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailing a historic 10-year security agreement with the United States. Footballer frustration, a group of players union suing FIFA and saying they're overworked as more games are added to the calendar. And Jin's joy, the BTS band member hugging 1,000 fans after finishing his mandatory military service. All that and plenty more coming up. But we do begin tonight with an Elon Musk Tesla triumph. The electric car company just announcing that shareholders have re-approved Musk's massive pay package, the largest, in fact, in U.S. corporate history, after a Delaware court struck it down earlier this year.

That said, other high-profile investors did oppose the move and two large shareholder proxy advisers recommended their clients vote it down. The news comes as Tesla faces growing competition from less expensive electric vehicles made in China, but it would also help quell fears that Musk might leave Tesla and focus on his other firms like SpaceX and the social media site X. The message from shareholders seems to be he hit his performance target and he deserves the reward. The bottom line, Musk remains the $48 billion man plus. Clare Duffy joins us now. Wow.

So, this is a big win for him, not just in terms of the money, but in terms of the confidence from his shareholders. But it's important to note that just because he got this vote doesn't necessarily guarantee that he is indeed going to get this massive pay package. This case is still tied up in Delaware court. But I think it does, you know, give him some confidence, it certainly gives Tesla lawyers some good material to be going back in court and arguing with in favor of this compensation package. And look, I think this vote also shows that this is not a typical company. Elon Musk is not a typical leader. And I think the majority of Tesla shareholders realize that it's sort of unusual that you would have to pay to the tune of billions of additional dollars, because remember, Elon Musk already owns a significant portion of this company, that you would have to pay your CEO to incentivize him to not spend his time elsewhere. That's sort of unusual. But I think Tesla shareholders realize that and they are willing to go with that because Elon Musk has made them billions of dollars, Julia.",

And this lawsuit claims that because he's the CEO, his tweets were considered like official company documents, and they influenced how people at the company felt they could behave.

And look, we've got a scenario, this time next year, where some players could potentially, Julia, be playing for 12 consecutive months before the next pre-season kicks in. You're right, so much going on in the world of football right now. We've got the European Footy Championships, they get underway on Friday. Germany taking on Scotland at the Allianz Arena in Munich. We got the Copa America over here in the U.S. So, we got the Olympic football tournament as well in France, not to mention the start of those new domestic campaigns before you know it. And then, this time next year, well, we'll also be getting set for the first expanded FIFA Club World Cup, which will involve 32 teams -- being upped to 32 teams. So, you got that scenario. I mentioned the 12 straight months potentially. What do we got? We got the English Professional Footballers Association and the French Players Union accusing FIFA violating players rights and potentially E.U. competition law by creating a calendar that, as you said in the intro, it says is overloaded and unworkable. Those two words certainly resonating. Now, according to World Players Unions FIFA Pro Europe, FIFA has \"failed to meaningfully engage or negotiate and have unilaterally continued a program of competition expansion despite the opposition of Player Unions.\" CNN, well, we did reach out to FIFA. They're the governing body for world football. We want to comment on the legal action. We await that. This is certainly a hot button issue and I expected to run and run. At the recent Global Soccer Forum in Sardinia, we did speak -- our own Amanda Davies spoke with Maheta Molango, who's chairman of the Professional Footballers Association. Take a listen to what was said because it's very impactful. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHETA MOLANGO, CHAIRMAN, PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS' ASSOCIATION:  Maybe like 18 months ago, you still had some skeptical fans would say, come on, you know, you're well paid, you're millionaires, you're privileged. Why don't you stop complaining and get on with it? But all of a sudden now, 18 months down the line, you see that it has become now an industry problem. It's no longer about a few unions, a few player complaining, it's just even the fans, even the most skeptical fans saying, I want to see my player playing because if I don't, I lose games. If I lose games, I'm sad. So, for the first time, I think we're no longer talking about the problem of players. We're talking about the problem of the industry, and we'll talk about the situation that is basically killing the game, killing the product for those who want to call it a product. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, is it possible, Julia, that the 32-team Club World Cup could be rescheduled? Well, back in May, FIFA saying it would not consider rescheduling. Remember, it's due to start in mid-June of next year. And then 12 months on from that, we've got the 2026 Men's World Cup in America, Canada, and Mexico. First time three countries will ever have hosted football's biggest showpiece event. So, it really doesn't stop. It is relentless. And so, players have just finished their campaigns, haven't they?

Really some of the harshest scenes of violence that we haven't seen in Buenos Aires in at least six to seven years. And on the other side, we see today the market celebrating, the market's actually popping up because of these reforms. The level of the inflation, I don't need to tell you how crucial inflation is for Argentina, for everybody who looks at our Argentinian markets. And today, is down at only 4.2 percent. I think that we were in a hyperinflationary cycle just in October, November last year, the fact that Milei managed to bring that down to less than 5 percent is beyond remarkable. But at the same time, that came at a huge cost for tens of thousands of workers who have been laid off, mostly from public companies, in particular the state airline, the state press agency, for example. And those were the ones that took to the streets yesterday, those workers unions who demand to see better subsidies, to demand the state to be there for them. Milei himself, what's interesting, on Wednesday, he was speaking at a ring- wing conference at the Hilton Hotel in Buenos Aires. And this is how he himself referred to this discrepancy.

Like you said, like a Rubik's Cube. And then, when an order is placed, either online or from a store, we have developed robots that drive on top of that cube, retrieving then the goods that are ordered and delivering them to workstations where either people or other types of robots are ready to pick it up and send it to its destination.
