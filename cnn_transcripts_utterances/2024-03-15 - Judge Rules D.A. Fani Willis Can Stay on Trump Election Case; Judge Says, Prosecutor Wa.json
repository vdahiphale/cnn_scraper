      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.This morning, a monumental ruling drops in the criminal case against Donald Trump down in Georgia a short time ago. As we've been reporting on CNN, the judge announced that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is allowed to continue prosecuting Trump and his allies in the Georgia election subversion case. But the judge added that the special prosecutor in the case, Nathan Wade, who has had a relationship with Willis, must be removed for the case to continue. The removal of Willis and her team would have almost certainly delayed a trial until after the presidential election. That is something Trump desperately wants in this case and his other legal cases. CNN's Nick Valencia has had a busy morning. It continues to be busy outside the Fulton County courthouse. Nick, this ruling, I mean, it delivers kind of an ultimatum to Fani Willis over her relationship with the lead prosecutor. Wade has to go where else? So, walk us through it.",

And we know that decision is going to come pretty soon here.We have reached out to Nathan Wade. We have still not heard back. We've also reached out to the district attorney's office, but they have yet to comment. This is a huge win for Fani Willis, but it does not come without its criticism, the judge admonishing Fani Willis for her behavior during her testimony, calling it unprofessional, and also saying that there's a potential for her to receive a gag order. Remember, part of what defense attorneys were upset about was this speech, this now sort of infamous speech that she gave immediately after these allegations at Big Bethel AME, a historic black church here in Atlanta, during which she sort of addressed to it, sidestepped the allegations to just say that she made mistakes, but that she's not perfect. And now she's going to be allowed to continue on with the case that she started investigating more than three years ago, a case that began with an infamous phone call from the former president to the secretary of state here in Georgia, in which he tried to get more votes found so he could win the Georgia election. The judge here, though, handing a victory to Fani Willis, and we are waiting to hear from the district attorney's office. But earlier, we did speak to Defense Attorney Scott Grubman, who represented Ken Cheseboro during his portion of this case, and Grubman gave us some insight into what potentially defense attorneys will do next after this decision.

You've been leading this coverage, a good part of this morning. I have no idea how -- I mean, I guess she stays on the case, Fani Willis on the case, but it just feels like this is not good. It just feels -- I mean, let's read this one part of the ruling. This finding is by no means an indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the district attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing. I mean, that -- it just sounds like, yes, the case continues, but it almost feels like is it going to hobble along? I mean, what do you think?",

And this is in combination with an earlier this week decision to remove and dismiss some of these charges for not having been what they call properly pled.They were too insufficient, too lacking in detail to have them be able to prepare for a defense. You combine those two things, they will use this to suggest that she should not be trying this case. But if she is, then, hey, she's not good enough to actually have a burden of proof met. But this is actually pretty extraordinary as a result. The judge did not have the legal basis to say that an appearance of a conflict was enough to remove. He does talk about the fact that there was the lapse in judgment. He does not condone it, but they did not meet their burden, those who are moving for this particular case, disqualify her to say that this goes to the heart of the defendant's ability to get a fair trial. All of these salacious details and we leaned in for the gossip, I certainly did. But when it comes down to it, none of this trial had anything to do with the underlying facts of this case. Even the speech that has been referenced by Nick Valencia and others, where she talks about what they called playing the race card, identifying why are you just going after one of my prosecutors, not the rest of them. Even that, he said, did not rise to the level of disqualification. So, yes, this takes a hit, but he did say they are so far removed from the actual jury selection to provide a permanent taint on a jury pool. He knows this is down the road. Amnesia might set in.",

I mean, that would be music to the Trump team's ears as well.But, I mean, I just want to show that the part that the judge says about Nathan Wade, I mean, this is also brutal, patently, unpersuasive explanation for the inaccurate interrogatories he submitted in his pending divorce case indicates a willingness on his part to wrongly conceal his relationship with the district attorney. As the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued to result in some form of benefit to the district attorney or even whether the romantic relationship has resumed. And as Laura was saying, I mean, this has nothing to do with -- I mean, as Fani Willis said, I'm not the one on trial. Trump and these co-defendants are on trial.

And some of that is assessing the credibility of witnesses. Can I, as the finder of fact and law, actually believe the things that are being said to me? Now, a number of these statements sort of toe the line of, is this a credibility finding, or are you taking a pot shot at the prosecutor? And there were a few.

And to the point that Kristen and I were talking about a little bit earlier, a lot of this actually sort of hurts the credibility of the office. That said, there's a difference between the legal correctness and sort of the political or moral correctness of all of it. And, legally, this is sound.

We got a statement from Trump's lawyer, Steve Sadow, he essentially said, while respecting the court's decision, we believe that the court did not afford appropriate significance to the prosecutorial misconduct of Willis and Wade, including the financial benefits, testifying untruthfully about when their personal relationship began, as well as Willis' extrajudicial MLK church speech, where she played the race card and falsely accused the defendants and their counsel of racism. Then he continues and says, we will use all legal options available to continue to fight to end this case, which should have never been brought in the first place.That's exactly what you would expect, right? That they're not happy, Fani Willis gets to stay on the case, that, you know, moving forward, they want this case to be dismissed. However, when you actually look at how they're going to use this, Donald Trump is going to repeat some of these lines in rallies.

It might be surprising. One part in particular, this judge called B.S. on the idea that the people who brought this motion had proven that the money that was given as a salary was a through line to what was used for the vacation. It was their burden, just like it'll be the burden of the prosecutors at trial to make their case.Also, another aspect of here, that they said, this was the theory of the defense's case, the defense, meaning Trump and counsel, that they were bringing this case and prolonging this case in an effort to sustain the romantic relationship, go to West Virginia and drive there or Nashville at different points in time. The judge essentially said, well, that can't be true, that she was trying to prolong. Not only did she ask for a trial date in six months after she brought this case, she said that she didn't want to sever these defendants. She wanted them all to stay together. Everything that she was doing was trying to expedite this case, which belies what they were trying to articulate. And so on that realm, she has some legs to stand on. I do agree. This judge, if you thought Robert Hur's one line about Biden was problematic, this is a whole opinion full of things. And no one, I'm sure, in the office wants to hear it, but I'm suspecting it's one of those, you don't have to go home, Nathan Wade, but you can't stay here.",

My answer from the D.A. is she's got a whole office full of very experienced prosecutors. And by the way, that's one of the curious things about this scenario to begin with.Fani Willis is the district attorney for Fulton County. She's got dozens and dozens of deeply experienced, deeply qualified prosecutors in her office who served the people of Atlanta and Fulton County, and yet she decided that she had to go choose this outsider, Nathan Wade, I guess there's a dispute about whether she was already dating him or not, who had never prosecuted a felony before.

Usually, you don't wait for the defendants to raise it, you raise on your own and you do the right thing, recuse yourself. I suppose there's some good faith debate here about whether Fani Willis should have done this. But it's really important to keep in mind, Jim, the appearance of impropriety matters. It's not just superficial. It is not we like things to look good because it is neither that way. It's because the D.A. is trying to take away a person's liberty. That's the case in the Donald Trump prosecution, in any prosecution. She's trying lock Donald up probably for more years than he has left on his lifespan. And that prosecution needs to be pure. It cannot be tainted by conflicts of interest, by the lingering odor of mendacity, as the judge says. So, there's a real problem here. And it goes -- yes, there is a political angle.
