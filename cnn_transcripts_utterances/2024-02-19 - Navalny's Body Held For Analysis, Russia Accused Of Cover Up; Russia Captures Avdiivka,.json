Three days after Navalny's death was announced his family says authorities won't release his body for another two weeks.

It was one of the best fortified towns that the Ukrainians had and now the Russians have managed to take that town. And the Ukrainians, Wolf, also fear that this could indicate that the Russians are going to press in other areas as well.The Ukrainians say that there are certain other areas in the front lines where the Russians are already gaining the upper hand because they simply have overwhelming firepower and the Ukrainians don't have enough ammunition. Now, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, he visited one of those areas where the Ukrainians believe the Russians could start another major push soon and certainly there as well the Ukrainians voiced their concern about a lack of military aid that's making it difficult for them on the front lines. Certainly, as far as Avdiivka is concerned, I was actually in that area about two to three weeks ago and the Ukrainians are already there telling us they were holding up a lot of the Russian assaults. They said the Russians had massive casualties in that area as they were trying to move forward but it was the lack of manpower and especially the lack of firepower that made it so difficult for the Ukrainians to stay in the game and now obviously, they've had to leave that area, Wolf.",

It was quite interesting because I did have the chance to communicate with one of the soldiers who was fighting there on the front line in Avdiivka and then had to leave that area and that soldier said that a lack of firepower, a lack of artillery shells was definitely one of the main causes why the Ukrainians were not able to hold the Russians up.They said, look, even if we had an okay amount as he put it, they would have been able to stop the Russians but they simply didn't have that. Now of course that's in part due to lack of aid from the United States but also some European countries that have pledged artillery shells to the Ukrainians have not come through so far to the extent that the Ukrainians would have liked. At the same time, the Ukrainians say in the long run if U.S. aid does not come through, it will have devastating effects for them on the battlefield. The artillery ammunition, of course, one thing, but all sorts of other ammunitions also a big problem for the Ukrainians as well as gear of course. One of the things that we've highlighted is that for instance, the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle for the Ukrainians is one of the main weapons that's helping them on the ground. If spare parts for that dry up, ammunition for that as well, it's going to be a big problem for the Ukrainians not just on the eastern front but on the southern front as well.",

The president also said he could not rule out the possibility that other towns could potentially fall as well as these soldiers are facing ammunition shortages.

That means criminal, civil and various jurisdictions, some are state, some are federal, to say that they are all because Joe Biden, Democrat president, does not want him to be the next president. Again, there's no evidence that any of these cases are linked, but he seeks to call himself a political prisoner essentially that he is being politically persecuted in this case.

And so, the message from Trump that I am a Navalny here just like he was to Putin I am to Biden that has resonance with many of his voters. They see him through that lens. But I will add politically speaking, Wolf, the U.S.'s resolved as being tested geopolitically on a number of fronts right now. And regardless of the politics here, I think most Americans, 77 percent want to support Ukraine. Many Americans want to continue to support Israel. We need to figure out the best approach and strategy moving forward to secure our standing in the world. You look at China and their brick system attempting to push away the dollar internationally speaking. And so, I think Americans want a leader that will best position the country moving forward for generations to come and I think the president should speak -- former president should speak to those things versus purely politics.

In my personal opinion as a strategist, I think the Republican primary was over after New Hampshire. At this point, Nikki Haley in the eyes of many Republicans who support back the former president, she's become a nuisance candidate.There is a serious percent of dislike among many voters when you ask them what do you think about her in the past or so, she's bright, she's the future, she will have an opportunity in 2028. I'm not certain that those appeals, that sentimentality still remains for her and I would caution the former governor to be very careful if she is looking four years into the future. Now, to answer the latter part, Wolf, I think that many Republican voters for the most part look at Donald Trump as being the individual who brings what they believe is their truth to mainstream politics. He's brought -- he's been a wrecking ball if you will to the political establishment. Whether we agree with the veracity of his claims or not, those of us in Washington, there are many Americans, 74 million of them who voted for him do believe that to be the case. They view those of us on the East Coast as individuals who look down upon them. They view themselves as being a part of the losers in this game of winners and losers that continues to expand.

Dr. Irfan Galaria writes a new op-ed for the \"Los Angeles Times\" and he says this, I have worked in other war zones. But what I witnessed during the next 10 days in Gaza was not war, it was annihilation, end quote. Dr. Galaria is joining us right now. He recently returned from volunteering at the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Yunis. Dr. Galaria, thanks for all your important work. Thanks very much for joining us. Tell us what you saw when you were there. I know you were treating patients including children.DR. IRFAN GALARIA, PLASTIC &amp; RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGEON: Yes. Thank you, Wolf. Thank you for having me on your show. What I saw I don't think it ever could have prepared to be seen. What -- it was absolutely horrific and shocking. You know, it took me just a few minutes once I entered Rafah, Gaza to recognize that what I had just passed through were -- what I felt were the gates of hell. What I saw was an unbelievable humanitarian crisis. I saw over 1 million people struggling to survive, trying to find shelter, food, drinking water, and what was haunting them throughout that evening and 24/7. were these drones. It sounds like a lawnmower or weed whacker constantly hovering over them. And in the far distance, because we were in Rafah, most of the bombings where in Khan Yunis in the fire distance, you could hear bombs dropping, and that was my introduction in Gaza.",

As you approach the hospital, it is surrounded by tents, maybe 10,000 people. They're clustering around it, hoping that it will serve as sort of a safe zone for them. And this humanity is literally spilling into the halls and corridors of the hospital.So anywhere you walk, the hallways are limited to a narrow single file passageway. And either side, you see blankets hanging from the ceiling to corner off and create little secluded private areas for families. This is a hospital designed to host maybe 300 patients and they estimate there's over 1,000 patients and the staff themselves live in the hospital. They too are homeless. Many of them actually are living without their families because they -- while they were working in their hospital, their homes were bombed. And they're now living alone.",

Oftentimes when we took care of these children, there was no pain medication to provide for them to even give them comfort in that circumstance. So it's very difficult to witness that.",

You know, Wolf, to really understand this, you have to see what we saw, as we were driving to Rafah, there were rows of trucks with humanitarian aids, sitting parked on the sides of the roads waiting to get in, you know, a very interesting telling stat was, before this war even happened, there were about 500 to 600 trucks and -- of aid trucks that would enter the country. That's how dependent they were on aid following this war, less than 100 trucks now and on a daily basis.",
