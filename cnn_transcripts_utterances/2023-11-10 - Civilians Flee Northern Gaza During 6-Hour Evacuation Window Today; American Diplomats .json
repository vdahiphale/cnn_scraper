This new video shows people trapped under rubble. Buildings collapsed by Israeli barrages on Thursday, victims being pulled out of the rubble in a desperate search for survivors. And today gunfire sent Palestinian civilians near one hospital in northern Gaza, scrambling for safety.It comes amid reports that Israeli airstrikes have damaged several hospitals. The head of Al-Nasr Hospital says that Israeli tanks surrounded his facilities. Keep in mind the IDF has maintained that it exclusively targets areas with ties to Hamas and that any civilian losses are unintended. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which draws its figures from the Hamas controlled territory, 11,000 Palestinians have died since October 7th. Meantime thousands more fled Gaza -- fled south toward -- fled south in Gaza today, as Israeli forces opened a six-hour evacuation corridor. There are growing international demands to further address the dire humanitarian crisis. As all of this is unfolding, speaking today after meetings in India, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave one of his most direct condemnations yet of the mounting death toll. Watch this.

The figures that are being released by the Hamas controlled Ministry of Information saying, for example, 198 health care workers have been killed.And while Israel is surrounding it appears several hospitals in Gaza at the moment because it believes they're connected to Hamas operations. They say that under some of those hospitals, there are bunker and tunnel networks belonging to Hamas. Health officials at those hospitals deny any knowledge of those systems say they don't exist. The health care system in Gaza, when you look at the humanitarian situation, does seem to be by the statistics that are given by, again, the Hamas-led Health Authority there, dire, 21 of 35 hospitals are now out of service, 51 of 72 health care clinics are now out of service. So the humanitarian situation while the corridor has been open and perhaps open for its longest period, today, and many thousands of people were seeing flee in the north of Gaza to the south of Gaza to clear the area in the north that the IDF calls a battlefield zone. The toll that it's taking on the infrastructure and the ability of people in Gaza to be able to treat themselves is escalating. It mounts day by day by day. The IDF say that they have now targeted 15,000 different terrorist sites. They've rounded up so far 6,000 different weapons. They've discovered Hamas weapons making facilities inside domestic homes right next to the bedrooms of children. There are tunnel networks that have now been demolished and destroyed indeed. Tonight as I stand here, I can still hear the detonations explosions continuing to come from Gaza as they have done throughout the day. So the military operation continues. The humanitarian operation continues. The dire medical situation, like so much else in Gaza, does seem to be getting worse.

And what it says is, it's essentially a warning based on conversations that they're having with people in the region about how the Arab world is looking at to the U.S.'s ongoing support for Israel amid this massive bombardment of Gaza. And what it says is that it warns the White House, the FBI and the CIA, that the U.S. is losing U.S.-Arab public for a generation, it says, and it also says that U.S. support for Israel is being seen as, quote, material and moral culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes.Now, this is a message that has been communicated directly to the Secretary of State, to the U.S. administration by the U.S.'s Arab partners, including Jordan, Egypt, all people that -- all countries that the Secretary of State met with in the last few weeks to try to discuss the path forward here. And what those Arab countries are asking for is a ceasefire. They say that they want to see the fighting stopped completely. They want to see Palestinian civilians be able to get out of Gaza. But of course, the U.S. has stopped short of that. They are not supporting a ceasefire at this point. Instead, what they're saying is they support these temporary pauses. And they are pushing for a three day pause. President Biden has said that he wants it to be even longer than that. But right now, that seems to be kind of the contours of the deal that is taking shape in order to allow not only civilians to get out, but also hostages. But look, this is really what the administration is grappling with. They are having to tow this very delicate line between of course, supporting Israel, and its right to defend itself against the Hamas attack. But also, you know, calibrating that in a way that expresses that they do not support the way Israel is carrying out their campaign.",

Also with us is Hagar Chemali, who is a former spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. She's also the former director for Syria and Lebanon on the National Security Council. Ladies, thank you both for sharing part of your afternoon with us.Hagar to you, the Secretary of State one month ago said that U.S. support for Israel is iron clad. That to me seems different than what we heard today, when he said quote, too many Palestinians have died. Do you think it's fair to say that the scenes coming out of Gaza have forced the U.S. to shift its tone? HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, U.S. MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Well, not entirely, because Israel is has been a non-NATO ally since 1987. And so that support is ironclad, for many reasons, it's a relationship that is both give and take. We both usually benefit from that relationship. But that doesn't mean as you have with any kind of ally, by the way, we have many allies all over the world where we've had to have difficult conversations or press on certain issues or use the leverage that we have. And with Israel, for example, obviously, U.S. leverage does weigh heavily, it doesn't always work. But it does weigh heavily. And so that doesn't mean that we're not able to use that leverage, because either there's a national security objective that we want to achieve. Or in this case, in particular, we believe that a high civilian death toll undermines Israel's broader cause of a more secure Israel and that is the U.S. view. So I wouldn't view it as fraying at the relationship or anything like that. But a shift in public messaging or and private messaging is to be expected even when it's an ally.",

And that is because over the past five or six years in particular, we haven't been able to make progress on a two-state solution. And part of that is because the Israelis don't want to make progress on that at least the government in charge.But you know, across the Arab world, fewer than majorities support the United States. And when you look at the youth, one poll says that, you know, over 50 percent of Arab youth see the United States as an enemy. That poll was taken a year ago. And so we have a problem here. We talk about, we heard President Biden talk about the United States being the light on the hill, the beacon of hope. But we have to recognize that part of that is mythology.

And that's usually because when you have instability in one certain region, especially if the U.S. is involved some way you're going to have other nefarious actors, Iran- backed militant groups, terrorist groups, so on, try to take advantage of that situation and pursue whatever kind of goals or attacks they want there. And they're going to try to do. So in this case you've got, like you said, you've had attacks against U.S. bases in the region. And I expect that to continue, and it's something that the U.S. expected as well.It's something that while, I'm not trying to diminish at all the threat, it is unfortunate. It's something that the U.S. government is used to, and generally prepared for. Now that could escalate further, which is why the U.S. based military assets additional military assets, these aircrafts tried carrier groups in the Mediterranean, in the Red Sea and in the Gulf, and they have already been useful in both intercepting actual rockets. You've had rockets they've intercepted from Iran-backed Houthi militants against Israel. And you also have their ability to kind of use -- to be used as a deterrent, and to prevent things from escalating further. At the end of the day, based on how Iran is behaving and their rhetoric where they have threatened to act when Israel invaded Gaza. Well, they've already invaded Gaza and now -- and Hezbollah's rhetoric. From what it appears, it appears also that, number one, Iran doesn't want to full scale war, they would prefer that their proxies to handle it for them. But not all the proxies are involved. Houthi -- the Houthis are Hamas's perhaps themselves in the West Bank. But Hezbollah doesn't actually seem that interested in an all scale -- in a full scale war. And I think that that will be a continuing theme for the next few months or as violence continues in Gaza, where you're going to have these actors take advantage in these limited strikes and clashes. But I don't expect it to unravel into something more major.",

And but he has to show his, basically his base, and the whole Arab community that Hezbollah, which is seen as the anchor of the axis of resistance, that that's what they are. And so they have to have these cross border, you know, firings and, you know, continue this pressure on Israel, in order to show that they're doing that, whether they want to take advantage of that down the road, I agree completely that I don't think they do right now.I think the question really depends on, you know, what happens on the ground in Gaza? Does it -- is it going to get worse? If it gets -- if the Israelis tune it back, yes, I think eventually it will slow down. But if it ratchets it up, Hezbollah will probably have to do more. And the real danger there is just whether things get out of control, not that they intend to do something, perhaps, but whether it gets out of control. But at some point, you know, maybe rationality goes by the wayside as well. So that danger still is there. But I agree that at this point, it's, you know, not at the front burner.",

And that is exactly what Iran and these Iran-backed militants want. And so that's the last thing I expect them to do on that part, whether they increase, I could see additional military assets in the waters, right, in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Red Sea and in the Gulf, for sure. That is -- that's not new for the U.S. Anytime there have been tensions that increase in the region, whether they've been in the Gulf or in Lebanon and so on, you often see carrier strike groups go to the area to try and send this message to show support for whoever it might be, in this case, obviously, Israel and for our own bases, and to send a strong message of deterrence.And you've heard that over and over again from President Biden, from Secretary of Defense Austin, where they've said, if you even think about doing something, don't. And I would take that as a very credible threat coming from the United States. The -- it would take a lot for the U.S. to get involved in an actual war. By the way, even though Israel is a non-NATO ally, it doesn't necessarily mean that the U.S. would send troops into a war, but I don't even see that scenario playing out anyway.",
