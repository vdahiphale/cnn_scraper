      "sentences": "Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin this hour with new developments in the catastrophic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio and growing concerns about where toxic material will be disposed. Right now, about two million gallons of toxic water are expected to be disposed of in Harris County, Texas, according to officials there.And in Michigan officials say the EPA has now paused shipments of contaminated soil. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine had previously said around six truckloads of soil were headed to Michigan. But officials in both of those states say they never received a warning about those shipments. Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell among them saying, I'm quoting now, \"We were not given a heads up on this reported action. Our priority is to always keep the people we represent safe.\" With us now is Congresswoman Dingell. Good to see you. First, you know, how did you find out about these reported shipments to your state and what can you do? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI) (via Skype): Well, Fredricka, we made a lot of noise. It began on the grapevine late afternoon yesterday that we have two different sites in my district. One is an injection well which is accepting liquids and the other is a ground contamination site in Belleville Township. I very quickly made some calls. The Governor was not aware of this either. We spoke to each other there where it took place. But we did discover that the governor of Ohio had posted it on his Web site that they were headed here. I'd called everybody. I had called EPA, I called the O.T., I called Republic which is U.S. ecology which controls the sites. I called Norfolk Southern and demanded answers. We very quickly realized that nobody has really been given a heads up that it was coming here. There are issues related to the injection well facility that thought it was five trucks of the liquid that were headed for the injection well. Soil had also been headed for the BMV or the Belleville Van Buren site as well. EPA told us last night that they were suspending and I doubt very much that any more of the liquid will go to the infection well in Romulus.",

This Romulus injection well site, I can remember being very loud, townhall meetings about it 20 years ago. So, since I got elected, I had a relationship with U.S. ecology that when they were transporting new material, because community would be concerned that they normally would give us a heads up.When I learned about this yesterday, the first call that I got, I immediately called the governor's office, assuming that they would know about it. I always coordinate with them. And what quickly became evident is that none of -- none of the elected officials, none of the local officials knew that this material was on its way. Quite frankly, there are contracts with each of these sites. And I think some people thought this was just normal business. But there's nothing that's normal about this toxic site in Ohio, and I think many people have now acknowledged that should have been far more sensitivity. And we've got a responsibility to make sure that the communities here that are giving them material are safe, and that we reassuring them that they're not going to be hurt -- (CROSSTALK)",

We shouldn't -- certain community shouldn't be the ones that are benefiting.I mean, certainly the impact of benefiting is not the right word you would ever say for these sites. But we also have to make sure that they're safe, that there's no danger to the inhabitants in the surrounding communities. And I think that what Ohio was triggering is another national conversation about how you dispose of hazardous waste, keeping people safe, and making sure that there aren't certain populations that are more impacted because they can least afford to live in a wealthier area.

It's very important that the federal and state government be inspecting these sites on a regular basis.We do have to dispose of them at a safe site right now. But -- so, we need to find the immediate issue for where this is going to be stored safely and have the longer conversation.

They've been very responsive. I'm working with them very closely on the site.I unfortunately have had more than 10 chemical spills or plumes that I've been dealing with in like the last 18 months. So, I've gotten to know EPA very well. We do need people that know what they're doing, managing these sites. These are very important critical issues.

Instead, what has happened is a considerable intensification of Russia -- Russian efforts along that at Eastern Front at several points. We're hearing both from Ukrainian authorities but also from Russian state media about heavy exchanges of fires at different points along the front line.Now, what we've been hearing in the last few moments is more about what's been happening about around Bakhmut. That town that's been at the center of so much of the fighting over the course of the last few weeks, as Russian forces, not just regular troops, but also Wagner mercenaries made concerted efforts, Fredricka, to try and encircle the town as (INAUDIBLE) is important symbolically, of course. But strategically. The aim believe Ukrainians of Russian forces at this stage is ready to take the whole of the Donbas. Taking Bakhmut would be an important game for them as they attempted to do that. They have the whole of Luhansk, they have a good part of Donetsk. Ukrainians believe it is the whole of it that they're trying to take. Bakhmut would be key to their achieving that. What we've been hearing the last few moments is from Yevgeniy Prigozhin, who is the head of the Wagner Mercenary Group saying that at the village to the north (INAUDIBLE) of Bakhmut has now fallen. We'd heard from him yesterday that a town to the -- northwest of the town had fallen -- a village to the town -- when northwest of the town has fallen. And so, Russian forces, according to the head of Wagner appear to be making their way around the town in their aim of encircling it. And we've also been hearing in the last few moments from a Ukrainian military commander about the fight in Bakhmut and how just desperately they're trying to hold it and how desperate that fight is. The military commander explaining that they're running out of -- they're lacking long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, airplanes, and it is very difficult for their infantry right now along that front line. And of course, that is what is behind so much of the calls that you heard yesterday from President Zelenskyy for more weaponry and specifically for the aircraft. Those Ukrainian forces under severe pressure as that concerted push along that Eastern Front has intensified on the Russian side, Fredricka.",

What matters is whether you knowingly possessed, in that case, the narcotics or, in this case, the classified documents. And really what this is about is trying to figure out why, after there were these visits by the Justice Department and subpoenas and ultimately, as I mentioned, literally the FBI was executing a search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago residence, why were there still documents left over? We know from other reporting that the Justice Department has also been investigating boxes being moved from one room to another. I think what they're going to ultimately do -- you mentioned our reporting from Paula Reid -- is that they are questioning the aide. I think what they're going to do is work their way up the ladder until they find people who are not forthcoming or taking the Fifth. That will essentially be their answer, is if you're the person that potentially was willfully retaining documents or willfully removing documents in order to obstruct the authorities in that case.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, spring training is off and running. And we have our first look at how all the big rule changes will affect the game.The biggest change fans are going to notice right away is the giant pitch clock behind home plate. So pitchers now have 15 seconds to throw a pitch with the bases empty, 20 seconds with runners on base. If they don't beat the clock, a ball will be awarded to the hitter. Now, hitters also have to be in the box ready to go with eight seconds on the clock or they will get a strike. And that actually already happened to the Padres' Manny Machado yesterday. Certainly going to be a big adjustment. Baseball hopes this new move will shave 20 to 25 minutes off game times. The other new rules baseball has implemented, to hopefully make the game more exciting, are pitchers can now only try to pick off runners twice while they're on base. A third results in a ball. This should help stolen bases go way up this season. And the base is also much bigger now, which will help boost offense. They went from 15 inches to 18 inches. And to even further help scoring, defenses will no longer be allowed to shift the infield. That means the shortstop can't go stand in shallow right field when a left-hander is up at the plate. Got to stay to the left side of second base. This should cause batting averages to increase this season, especially for those left-handed hitters. Now, all of these are going to be big adjustments. You've got 17 spring training games today. Going to be especially fun to watch how some of these pitchers, who are used to taking their time, handle that new pitch clock. Major League Soccer, meanwhile, kicks off its regular season later today. Eleven 11 games on the schedule. But the defending champs, LAFC, actually will not be in action. Fredricka, unfortunately, El Trafico was canceled yesterday because of the bad weather in Los Angeles. They rescheduled that big game for July 4th. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
