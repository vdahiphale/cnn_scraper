He had been outside the courthouse here for quite some time, but just now got out of his motorcade and entered the courtroom.I should note his attorneys who you saw there with him had already been inside the court room, Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles. They had exited the courtroom and they went back inside, as you can see, alongside him. The district attorney here, Alvin Bragg, had already been inside their room when Trump entered. I should note, as all of this is going on, it's all about timing here, and the question of when this case is going to happen and when Donald Trump will become the first former president to actually go and face a criminal trial that was expected to start today but it was delayed in recent days after new documents, hundreds of thousands of them, were turned over to Trump's legal team, something they are claiming they need more time to sort through because they believe it could be exculpatory for the former President. We heard pushback from Alvin Bragg's office on that, agreeing to at least a 30-day delay, but, really, all of this is going to be to the judge and what the judge inside that courtroom determines. CNN's Paula Reid and Kristen Holmes are both here outside this Manhattan courthouse. And, Paula, I think it's important to remind people, because we've been talking to all the different judges here, this judge has been maybe the first that we have really seen who has very aggressive, in addition to Judge Chutkan in Washington, when it comes to timing and cutting Trump's team off when they've tried these delay tactics, which we know has been their strategy in every single case. This judge has been very strict. I wonder what that portends for what the judge will do today.",

So, they're asking you for ninety days to review this new evidence that was handed over by federal prosecutors.But the district attorney is saying, no, look, he's delayed this 30 days, until April 15th, that's enough time. We can start then. Only a small portion of this evidence is actually relevant. So, now, it's up to the judge how long you delay this case. Do you say, all right, we're going to go forward on April 15th? Do you try to split the difference? Do you like 45 days? We will be watching. But as you said, Judge Juan Merchan, he has been pretty aggressive trying to keep this case on pace. But, I mean, the Trump team has successfully delayed it. This was supposed to be the first day of trial. Instead, The Trump lawyers are going to be in there arguing for postponement or possibly even dismissal.",

But, certainly, personally, it's been one of those difficult cases for him because it's, you know, kind of revived one the most sensitive issues that we were dealing with his first year in the White House, which was, of course, paying Stormy Daniels the hush money to cover up the story of their affair, their alleged affair before the election, something that was affected his relationship with the first lady that she was angry about. And now here is still at the heart of what he is potentially going to be on trial for, for the first time, and may be the only time before the election.",

And likely that is because he is not paying that close of attention to this hearing today. He is fixated on that bond money. And as you noted, he was sitting in his car for quite some time before coming in. He was posting on Truth Social over and over again actually just seconds before he walked through those doors about that bond, saying it was ridiculous, that he would have to pay this, quote/unquote, made-up amount, talking about one of the things he's most sensitive about in that New York civil fraud trial, which is the value of Mar-a-Lago, constantly talking about the idea that it was definitely not worth $18 million, but more than that. That is at the heart of what Donald Trump is focused on right now. So, I think it's very telling, instead of seeing him come out and talk about this trial seeing him post about his trial or this hearing, and instead you're hearing him still talk about not meeting that bond and that bond money.",

And to Kristen's point, I mean, this really does seem like Trump is not very happy to be there. They say he's seated behind his defense attorneys. He's hunched over. He does not look very happy. He's sitting at the defense table in between his two attorneys, and they're waiting for this to get underway. But, yes, he definitely seems like he is feeling the gravity of this moment, potentially the first criminal prosecution that he will face here, the Manhattan district attorney and the possibility of having some of his most treasured assets seized by the New York attorney general.

Kaitlan, thank you very much.Join me now as we continue our coverage, CNN Chief Legal Analyst Laura Coates, CNN Chief Domestic Correspondent Phil Mattingly and CNN Senior Legal Analyst and former Federal Prosecutor Elie Honig. Laura, we were talking about the bond payment that's come due just a few moments ago, but this hush money trial, it was scheduled to start today, but was delayed when prosecutors turned over, what, 100,000 pages of new documents. Do we know anything about those documents? And we were saying earlier, it sounds as though we're going to get a trial date set, perhaps today in this hush money case. What does that mean?",

He leapfrogged, of course, the special counsel, and they wondered why he'd want to do that. Now, it turns out he might be the only trial to actually go before the general election after all is said and done.It's an important case, although it's very backward-looking in terms of the 2016 and the hush money payments case. The documents at issue are very important, though, because they're going to claim on the Trump side that you have violated discovery rules. I was supposed to have these a long time ago. Is there some reason you didn't give them to me before? If you know them as a trial date set, why don't I have them? But what's in them is going to be very important. Is it something that's going to be inculpatory or exculpatory, meaning it will show some innocence on the part of Trump or otherwise? They're going to argue in court today they need much more time to go through everything, although most law firms associate, I'll tell you, 100,000 documents, okay, it's over the weekend, thank you very much. Having been an associate myself, it was over the weekend, thank you very much. But at the end of the day, they're going to try to say that you withheld documents because your case is either bad or you didn't want me to see something.

Ron DeSantis would point to that day, almost a year ago, where he said, that's when everything changed for us. It's effective in the sense that nothing has actually happened yet to him. If a court date is set today, if Letitia James starts moving to cease his assets, to freeze his bank accounts, to go after his properties, things start happening. I was talking to a House Republican on Friday who said, you know, what's strange, very big Trump supporter, talks to the Trump team, says, this feels different because something is actually happening to him. We thought the delay tactics would last forever. Whether or not that has a political repercussion to it, I don't think anybody really knows. Clearly, their tactics have worked quite well up to this point in a primary with Republicans. Now, he's in a general election. What does it do to money? What does it do to polling? But also, what does it do to him? We've seen his reaction. We've seen how he operates, not just on social media, but when he speaks publicly later today, does that turn more people off? We're talking about a slice of about 150,000, 160,000 people that are likely to decide this election. Where are they when things actually start, when there are repercussions, when tangible things are happening to them, we're about to find out in the coming weeks.",

We are talking about a tangled web of assets controlled by a former president and the presumptive nominee. This is kind of a nightmare.But let's look at some of these specific New York real estate properties owned by the former president, starting with perhaps the most iconic Trump Tower. For example, this is a triplex in Midtown Manhattan. Trump claimed in 2015 that this was worth $327 million. Forbes, though, values it at just $52 million. That is quite the spread and gets at one of the problems here, which is valuation. Another property that Letitia James mentions that she sees almost every single day is 40 Wall Street down in the financial district. Now, back in 2012, a bank-ordered appraisal valued this property at $220 million. However, Trump's statements later valued it at much, much higher levels. And then another property that's getting a lot of attention right now is Seven Springs. This is an estate and golf course in Westchester County. Forbes has valued this property at $25 million. And just last week, the New York A.G.'s Office filed some paperwork that amounted to preliminary steps before they could try to seize this property. Jim?",

Look, I mean, it is a good show, I'll admit that.When you look through everything that's happening, you're going to have Letitia James trying to come up with the sum of the parts, figuring out how to get to that very high number. But the deal is she's not going to be the only person who says they have a stake in any of this. She'll have to get in line of other creditors. He might not own these real estate ventures right out on his own. It's not like the average person wants to sell their home. They say, let me ask the husband, maybe the wife, maybe a grandparent, or maybe there's a trust. There are going to be a lot of people who have a stake in each of these properties, and so getting in that line would be difficult. I don't expect her to have all of a sudden like a seizure sign that's going to be on her particular property, but it does show you that she is now going to be in line as a creditor. And that's significant because she is owed a particular amount of money under this lower court ruling, and there is a bond required. As to what happens next, it's going to be anyone's guess in the timeline of it, but it is significant because he might not want to pay this. It might be novel, but it is now owed and it's based on a judgment by a judge who said that these line up proportionally with what the ill-gotten gains are.",
