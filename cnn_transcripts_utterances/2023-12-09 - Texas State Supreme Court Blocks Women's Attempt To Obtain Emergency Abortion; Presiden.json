      "sentences": "Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We begin in Texas where a woman's fight to end her high-risk pregnancy is garnering national attention. Late last night the state's supreme court ruled to temporarily block Kate Cox's attempt to obtain an emergency abortion. And it comes just a day after she was granted permission by a lower court. Cox says her unborn baby has a fatal genetic condition that results in the baby not living more than a few days outside the womb. That's according to the lawsuit that she has filed against Texas. CNN's Camila Bernal is following this story for us. Camila, how big of a setback is this for her?",

      "sentences": "It's very significant, Fred, and that's because Kate Cox is 20 weeks pregnant at the moment. She's just 31 years old, and as you mentioned, her fetus has a fatal genetic condition, and she says that the complications of this pregnancy have essentially put her life in danger. And she says that not only is her health at risk here, but she also says that her future fertility is also at risk if she doesn't get an abortion.And so that is why she sued the state of Texas asking for her to be allowed to get a legal abortion in the state of Texas. A judge in the state granted that and agreed and allowed her to get a legal abortion in the state, which was actually very significant for the state. Specifically, when it comes to medical exemptions, because the state has such strict abortion laws, this could define those exemptions. But, of course, the attorney general there, Ken Paxton of Texas, does not agree, and asked the supreme court of the state to intervene in this case, and that's exactly what they did. The Texas Supreme Court essentially freezing the lower court's decision temporarily and saying that this case is now pending. Now, there is no specific timeline as to when they would take up this case. And again, she's 20 weeks pregnant, which is why it's so important for her to get that decision, to figure out what she's going to do next. Her attorney is saying that this is why people shouldn't beg for health care from a court of law, because she says this is a medical emergency at the moment that Kate Cox is going through. Now, the state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, saying that she has not proved that this is life-threatening, that she has not proved that this is something that puts her life at risk, while on the other hand, you have Kate Cox in the court filing saying that she's had a very difficult pregnancy, that she's had to go to the emergency room multiple times because of what she's been going through and because of her diagnosis, and also saying that her child, if born, would only live for a couple of days. So, again, she says that she's at risk and that her fertility here is at risk, which is also very important for her at the moment, Fred.",

CAROLINE KITCHENER, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": It's really hard to say. Doctors and lawyers that I've talked to in Texas, a lot of them are guessing that the most likely outcome of this is that Kate Cox leaves the state of Texas and obtains an abortion elsewhere. Because we have seen so much of this abortion litigation, and one thing I know as a reporter who covers this issue is that it takes a really long time. There's so much back and forth, waiting. And there is a ticking clock on this case in a way that there just hasn't been so far. So we're really in uncharted territory here.",

On Friday the president kicked off a campaign swing out west just hours after his son, Hunter, was indicted again. Hunter Biden is now facing new federal tax evasion charges. Prosecutors accuse him of a four-year tax evasion scheme and spending millions of dollars on things like drugs, escorts, and exotic cars. If convicted on all nine criminal counts, he could face up to 17 years in prison.CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak is in Los Angeles where the president is fundraising. Kevin, how is the White House reacting to this latest Hunter Biden indictment?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly the White House isn't responding very forcefully. They say the president remains in love with his son, that he supports his son, but they aren't weighing in beyond that. And certainly, the issue of Hunter Biden's legal issues is one of the most sensitive inside the West Wing. There are very few aides who feel comfortable raising this issue with the president. In fact, when you talk to them, there aren't that many who have sort of a firsthand knowledge of how the president is processing all of this.But it is certainly true that Hunter Biden's legal issues do weigh heavily on President Biden, and this one is no different, certainly because of all of the personal information that was included in the indictment about what Hunter Biden was spending this money on, this kind of lavish lifestyle that is in some ways embarrassing for him and for the president. And so this is a political headache for President Biden as he enters what will be a challenging reelection contest. And you've already seen some Republicans try and conflate Hunter Biden's legal issues with those that President Trump is facing. There isn't really a comparison there, of course. President Trump was president and is running to be president again. Hunter Biden has never been president and won't be president in the future. But that isn't stopping these comparisons from going forward. When you talk to President Biden's aides, they do not believe that voters in next year's election will make the Hunter Biden issue central to their decision-making. There's certainly other issues that they are focused on, including the economy. And I think the challenge for President Biden will be trying to frame this election as a choice between him and between President Trump. And you have seen him start to talk about President Trump in much more forceful terms than he has been willing to previously, including yesterday. He was in Las Vegas. He was making an announcement on passenger rail investment, and he went after his predecessor by name. Listen.

But it is clear that they have not fully taken control. There are still clashes between the two sides in northern Gaza. We did see some strikes also in central Gaza today. This is a place called Deir al-Balah which has been hit repeatedly over the past few days by Israeli air strikes. That is what residents said happened again this morning, at least two strikes, they say, at a building that was housing some 150 people, many of whom, those residents said, had actually come from the north after being told to evacuate. A local hospital in the central part of the Gaza Strip saying that there were at least eight people killed in those strikes, and dozens of people wounded. They have seen dozens of people killed in the strikes over the past few days.But so much of the focus for the Israeli military, Fred, has been on Khan Yunis over the past week or so. That is the second biggest city in all of Gaza. It's where Israeli officials believe that some of Hamas' top leadership may be. We've seen intense operations by the IDF on the ground. They say that they are trying to encircle Khan Yunis. They're going door to door, they say, tunnel to tunnel. Of course, we know about this extensive tunnel system. And tonight, Fred, the IDF issued what they called an urgent appeal to residents and civilians in the central part of Khan Yunis in five very specific areas on a map that they published, with hundreds of different little blocks. But five areas, they said, need to evacuate immediately. That is an indication, perhaps, that fighting is coming soon. They said that people need to move to the southwestern part of the strip where the IDF claims there are established shelters. We've asked the IDF what they mean by these shelters.

Jon Rahm, though, basically, I think really the criticism comes, when I think about it, it's because of his previous stance. He made it clear that he was all about legacy, history, playing in the big famous tournaments.[14:45:01] And that should continue to some degree, at least, as far as the Majors are concerned. He's the reigning Masters champ. I never saw this coming, I will say, but the rumors had been growing in recent weeks. There had been gathering momentum. Massive, massive coup for LIV golf, huge blow for the U.S. PGA tour and Europe's DP World tour. For context, for many, Jon Rahm is quite simply the best player in the world. You mentioned he's the reigning Masters champ. He's also a former U.S. Open winner. And at 29, he's likely not even yet at the peak of his playing powers. Rahm was one of the loudest voices, though -- this is what I mean -- one of the loudest voices of opposition to LIV when it first launched with an event in England. I remember it well. It was back in 2022. It was just our side of London. Rahm insisting he wasn't interested in the money being offered. His total career prize money, for context, on the PGA tour up to this point has been over $50 million. Rahm, who was born in the Basque country, will make his LIV debut as it stands in Mexico in early February. And as you said, Fred, we understand it's a three-year, $300 million deal, and he will have an ownership stake as well in a new team, again, according to ESPN citing unnamed sources. Now, here is another plot twist. Northern Irish golf superstar Rory McIlroy was also a huge critic of LIV Golf before the breakaway series brokered a proposed a deal with both the PGA and the DP world tours. And the four-time Majors winner purportedly now saying that Rahm should be allowed to play for Europe at the next Ryder Cup in 2025 in New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON RAHM, TWO-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: The reason we play a sport, we're entertainers at the end of the day. And you want to have the best product and the best chance for your team to succeed. And I believe you should give a chance to every single player, right. Right now to hear Rory say that, honestly, it makes me a little emotional. I respect the man so much. He's done a lot for the game of golf and accomplished a lot. So for him to have my back right away from day one, it's important. It's important for this process to change faster than later, right. So the earlier we can get a way back for people like me to maybe be able to qualify for that team, and the clearer, the easier it's going to be for us to compete and try to get on that team and not have to be a pick.
