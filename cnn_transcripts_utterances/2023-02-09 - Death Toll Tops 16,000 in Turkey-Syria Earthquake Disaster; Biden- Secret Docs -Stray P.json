Remarkably, two women in Turkey were found alive Wednesday after 62 hours buried under a collapsed building. And in Syria, a newborn baby was pulled from the rubble, her mother is believed to have died after giving birth. International search and rescue teams continue to arrive including some from the United States. I want to bring in CNN's Salma Abdelaziz. She's live in Istanbul for us.

And that means that window, that glimmer of hope is fading. These rescue operations are soon going to turn into recovery operations, Christine, and that is absolutely horrifying for the many, many families that have been desperately waiting for answers.The Turkish government has simply not been able to fan out across this huge area that has been affected about the size of the state of Nebraska. You have to remember there is over 20 million people affected by this. These numbers are truly difficult to fathom. Nearly 16,000 people killed. Over tens of thousands, nearly 60,000 people wounded, injured, need hospitals and clinics. President Erdogan has admitted as you said that there were shortcomings. And during his visit yesterday, there were signs that he was trying to quash silence potentially any dissent. Twitter, it was difficult to access it and other social media sites were reporting potential blocks by the Turkish government. That is because of anger and grief you are seeing on the ground. Many Turks feeling that they have been abandoned by the authorities, feeling that this is a country that knows earthquakes are coming and should have been better prepared. Yes, you mentioned the search and rescue teams coming from all over the world. It is still not enough. The scope and scale of this tragedy is just too huge. And in further south to Syria, perhaps even more dire. The white helmets, the first responders pulling people out of the rubble saying that they have already pulled hundreds of people out, they have been able to save some, but again that window is closing, and no aid yet. The only open route between Turkey and rebel-held Syria exists. That route was damaged by the earthquake. The latest we have is that it could be functioning now and we may finally see a trickle of help entering Syria.",

That was very crucial piece of evidence that the judge allowed in to this particular trial because in every criminal case especially a murder case, we're wondering what the motive may have been. And here the financial crimes, the financial aspect of this entire situation is very strong evidence according to the prosecution as to why Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife and son, and that is to distract people from his financial crimes in order to give him breathing room to maybe continue hiding what he has been doing or to come up with a better plan.",

Now there is this video three minutes before the murder of a dog that his son Paul was boarding or taking care of and the fourth person has identified Alex Murdaugh's voice on that video in the kennel.What do you make of that?",

He indicated that he was gone at the time of the murders and they pinpoint this video to being just a few minutes before the murders actually took place.And the fact that four people who have been around Alex Murdaugh a long time and positively identified his voice is pretty damning. It undermines Alex Murdaugh's alibi. And so I think that it will be hurtful to his defense.",

This is a very -- a lot of sport shooting happening in that family. What do you think the defense can do to try to poke holes in this also powerful evidence?",

The housekeeper also indicated that she thought she saw him move this into the house a week after the murders.
