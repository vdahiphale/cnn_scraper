And one U.S. official said the U.S. is preparing for the worst, telling CNN, quote, the fact that we have managed to even hold the front for this long has been a miracle. Despite the Israeli signaling that they're preparing for possible offensive, though they have been surprised by the sophistication of some of Hezbollah's recent strikes, and they continue to worry about the fact that Hezbollah has been stockpiling precision guided munitions and missiles from Iran for years as many as 150,000 of them according to IDF estimates. Now, the U.S. is scrambling at this point to try to de-escalate the tensions at the border. But Israeli officials have signaled that they are determined to create this buffer zone and push Hezbollah back so that Israelis can return to their homes in the North. The U.S. is trying to do that diplomatically. But as one senior administration officials said, quote, we're entering a very dangerous period, something could start with little warning.

It has the ability, according to predictions I've heard in the Israel Defense Forces to fire up to 5,000 rockets and missiles, some of them PGMs, precision guided munitions, that means they can actually strike the targets they're fired at up to 5,000 a day, in the first couple of weeks of this conflict that would overwhelm the missile defense systems that we have.And Israelis have gotten used over the years to being protected by Iron Dome, which has done an amazing job 98, 99 percent success rate in intercepting the projectiles being launched into their cities. They wouldn't be able to provide that same coverage, which means Israeli civilians wouldn't be hit in a way that we've never been hit before. It could be very devastating for this country. But on the other hand, this is not a normal situation, John, right? Can we imagine that Mexico would be firing tens of thousands of rockets into Texas, does anyone really think that Mexico would remain standing or Canada on the north? This is a reality that Israel is trying to contain is being hit literally by tens of thousands of rockets and missiles from Hezbollah, suicide drones, rockets, mortars, anti-tank missiles that are complete towns that have been turned into rubble in the north. That's why we've had to evacuate almost 100,000 of our people from the North. This is not a situation that we can allow to continue. Let me just add one more word. What we learned on October 7th, when Hamas came into our towns massacred and kidnapped our people, is that as even the biggest fence, the tallest fence, the most sophisticated fence will not contain an enemy that has been done your destruction. So any other deal that we think we can reach with Hezbollah, in the end, if they really want to attack us, we'll find a way. There's no doubt in my mind, that Israel will not be able to prosecute this war, if we do not have a strong relationship with Washington. And we are on the same page with them to the greatest extent possible, because we will need America's help to be able to prosecute a war in the north, whether it's with the continued supply of weapons and munitions and equipment, but also to help offset or to push away and stave off that diplomatic isolation that is growing around Israel.",

And we're here to protest and show him that if our parents can't do it, we can do it.MADOWO (voice-over): On Tuesday, dozens of demonstrators descended outside Kenya's parliament, forcing the government in Nairobi to amend the bail. Some of the suspensions include a 16 percent value added tax and bred and a 2.5 percent tax on motor vehicles. But some citizens were unhappy with the changes, calling for it to be scrapped completely. In response to the unrest, police arrested hundreds signaling outrage to human rights groups who said their right to protest has been violated.",

The diagnosis was that he had abscess in the brain, and he was operated on that day, thus saving his life, because if it had exploded, he would have died. He thanked me and the doctors for saving his life. And he also asked the security officer, who was a Muslim, when we visited him in the hospital, to tell me in Arabic and explain to me what it means for someone to save a Muslim's life. And that he owed me his life. He also told me that on the day he was released in the Gilad Shalit deal in 2011, that he owed me his life, and one day he will repay it.

He fought in those terrible moments of the morning in Kibbutz Nir Oz.Hundreds of Nukhba terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz. They murdered, raped, and slaughtered and burned 50 people from Nir Oz. 50 members of Kibbutz Nir Oz and 75 other members were kidnapped, including Tamir's grandmother, Yafa Adar, the older woman on the scooter. Tamir fought as an emergency squad member. He was seriously injured during his defense of the community. There were only five of them. They didn't really stand a chance. And he was kidnapped while he was still seriously injured, unconscious, and died after a few hours in Gaza. So, it's irrelevant what I think about what would have happened if. Unfortunately, Israel made a mistake during its military operation, and in its thinking that only military pressure would bring the release of hostages, which I said in the first month of the war. I thought a military effort was important in order to dismantle Hamas, destroy it, and to hurt its military capabilities. It's an important effort. But in order to return the hostages, it's not enough. Because Sinwar thinks only about the continuity of his rule. He is willing to sacrifice even 100,000 Palestinians in order to ensure the survival of his rule. He is willing to pay with the lives of militants, Hamas members, civilians. He doesn't care. And therefore, Israel's mistake is that it did not create an alternative to Hamas' rule and didn't replace Hamas' rule and didn't allow an improved version of the Fatah or Palestinian Authority forces to enter in order to make clear to Sinwar that he has lost everything, both his military capability but mostly, his authority in Gaza. That would have caused Sinwar to make a deal to return our hostages in exchange for prisoners. Today, he feels he is in a powerful position. He is running the negotiations while still operating from within Gaza and still controls the areas from which the IDF evacuated. He also controls the humanitarian aid, and therefore, he feels strong and won't sign an agreement to release the hostages unless the IDF withdraws from Gaza and the fighting ends. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So there's substantial financial incentives for the companies to keep racing ahead and displace a lot of labor along the way. And this will ultimately undermine a lot of our bargaining power. So the timeline -- different companies have different views of some of the people making these A.I. systems are planning in the next few years not to be hiring nearly as many people because they don't need software engineers, they can just have A.I.s do that coding instead.
