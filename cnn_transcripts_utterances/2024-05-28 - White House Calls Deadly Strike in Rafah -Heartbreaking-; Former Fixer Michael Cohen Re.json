They had previously expressed their intention todo so that official recognition has come through today's statements from all three nations. We've heard from the leaders of all three nations and officials from all three nations, saying that the hope or the intention behind this decision to recognize the state of Palestine is to work towards peace between Israelis and Palestinians and to ensure the viability of a Palestinian state in the future along those 1967 borders constituting the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Spain, clarifying that they want to see a corridor established between the two territories with East Jerusalem, as the capital of the states of Palestine. Norway and Ireland have both been clear that they haven't seen any positive engagement from the Israeli government on this front. However, as to be expected, the Israeli government has long stood against the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. And when it comes to the practical terms on the ground, what we have seen over decades now, but particularly over the last few months, is an erosion of the territorial integrity of the occupied West Bank under the authority of the Palestinian authority. We have seen the continued expansion of settlements, which are considered by many in the international community to be illegal under international law. We have over the last seven months of the war in Gaza seen an intensification of settler violence, which has pushed many Palestinian communities out of their land out of their homes. And of course, while this is a significant political step, and while calls for a ceasefire, have also of course been called for in conjunction with calls for a two state solution by many in the international community. It is hard to see how this will be realized in practical terms and the current state of affairs.",

Even though the Biden Administration has pressed forward with nearly billion dollar arms transfer that would include tank rounds, mortar rounds. So clearly, the weapons continued to flow. And then there's a question of diplomatic pressure. The Biden Administration has tried to exert some of that not only to get Israel into a deal that would see the release of hostages and a ceasefire, but also to put forward a plan to essentially paint a fuller picture of where this goes from here. And there has clearly been frustration on the part of the U.S. that some of these questions haven't been answered, like what the plan is for the day after? What does Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu see as the endgame here?

Trump's legal team is up first this morning. What else do we anticipate the defense will focus on in that closing argument? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Erica. We're expecting the defense to take about 2.5 to 3 hours for their closing arguments. Our understanding and reporting from our colleagues is that they don't want to take much longer than that, because they don't want the jurors to sort of get bored or lose of focus. They also have a strategy to that because after of course, they're done the prosecution is up. And they don't want the prosecution's closing arguments to bleed into tomorrow, which is still a possibility because everybody has as much time as they want. They don't want jurors to hear yet again from the prosecution going into tomorrow, and then going right into those deliberations. So there is a bit of a strategy there. Other than what Kara just pointed out in that piece about Michael Cohen, and the defense focusing on him and the fact that he is a liar in their words? Well, they want to also bring to the fact that they -- jurors have not heard from several people that were sort of named in other witnesses from other witnesses, like a CFO, the Former CFO, Allen Weisselberg like Keith Schiller, who of course, was Trump's former bodyguard. And to have -- you know was the person who connected Michael Cohen allegedly, according to the prosecution to Trump and talked about those hush money payments in that critical phone call that the defense tried to shut down, saying it was about a crank call so a prank call rather. So they do hope to get through the thing again, within three hours then it is the prosecution's term, and they're going to -- turn and they're going to do exactly what we heard from Kara, there is really just point to the evidence point to the witness testimony to lay out their entire story of why the former president is guilty.

And therefore, because they didn't do that, they probably -- they'll argue that they probably figured that Weisselberg would either lie, or do or say things that were untrue. So at this point, I think that yes, the state understands that's coming there is an argument that they can make. And the basic argument is you ignore the fact of who, you didn't hear you pay attention to what you did here, even if the judge instructs them, that you can find reasonable doubt from the evidence or the lack of evidence.

If Blanche takes a long time and takes them into the 1:30 or 2 o'clock hour than that may be the idea that in a four hour closing -- for four and a half hour closing. They're not -- the state is not going to be able to finish that is important, these instructions that you're hearing even more important and that was evidenced by the instructions that the defense asked for which were found to be either totally inappropriate or not in keeping with the law. And so they didn't really get what they wanted, which were instructions that they could argue to the jury. That's what we're arguing to and the judges saying the same thing we are. So they didn't get the instructions. They want it. So this is a very important thing that's happening right now. Cases are won or lost on the jury instructions.",

We've talked a lot over the lastfew weeks about the people in the courtroom. There's a high interest in this trial and -- my colleagues actually stopped people camping out already more than 24 hours ago hoping to score one of those public seats in the courtroom today. There's been talk though, about who is there to support the former president, lots of politicians, some of them perhaps vying for a spot on the 2024 ticket with him, but also members of his family who were or were not there today. He has three of his children. He's got Eric, Don Jr., Tiffany, as well as his daughter in law, Lara Trump as well as other supporters. How much does that matter to a jury to see a defendant's family in the courtroom?",

And none of them were there during the testimony -- Eric made avery brief appearance, the idea that all these politicians walked in and out, all wearing the uniform that is the blue suit with the red tie. It seemed kind of created. And I don't think the jury paid much attention to it. I think the jury didn't even know who most of those people were. All they did was make a spectacle of themselves walking in and then walking out during the testimony, which Merchan didn't do anything about. I think some judges would have said once you're here, you're here, you don't walk out. I think that there was a spectacle outside the idea of the all of them saying how terrible this was. And this is destroying the justice system. The criticism alone of the justice system destroys the faith in the -- and the justice system itself. So that was kind of unseemly to me.",

Despite its growing protests likethis Taiwan's parliament has passed a controversial reform bill that grants greater oversight powers to lawmakers opposition parties back the bill calling for tighter scrutiny of the President and his administration. Protesters say it could undermine Taiwan's democratic institutions and lead to greater influence from China. At least 36 people have died in India and Bangladesh after tropical cyclone Remal made landfall on Sunday. Torrential rain and strong winds have wreaked havoc damaging more than 150,000 homes while uprooted. Power lines have left millions without electricity. 41 people remain in hospital following the extreme turbulence and last week Singapore Airlines flight from London. That is according to hospital officials in Bangkok, where the plane was forced to land. At least five patients are still in intensive care. At least 160 people are missing and 10 others were killed. After suspected Boko Haram militants raided a remote village in North Central Nigeria. A local official told CNN that around 300 gunmen went unchallenged for hours. The state has faced recurring incidents of kidnapping for ransom by armed groups including mass abductions in recent years. All right, let's now connect you to South Africa which is just one day away from what could be a watershed election 30 years after Nelson Mandela triumphantly led it to power. The ruling ANC party's political dominance is in jeopardy this as South Africa grapples with high unemployment, power cuts and ramped corruption. Polls suggest the African National Congress might lose its majority and be forced into a coalition with its rivals. That poses a major leadership challenge for President Cyril Ramaphosa. Right we have justice Malala, who's a political commentator, and author of the plot to save South Africa. He joins us now from Johannesburg, to give us some insight. Justice, great to see you, it's been a minute and we talk at a very pivotal moment, you know, I think about OK, I've just been told we are going to be listening into Daniel Hagari who is the spokesperson for the IDF. Justice, we'll catch up with you later, but listening to Daniel Hagari.",
