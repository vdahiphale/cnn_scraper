And so this is something that not just Arizonans are dealing with. There are also multiple states doing what they're doing here, at least from a citizen standpoint, of trying to gather signatures to make it part of the state's constitution. So as of right now, as we are still Reeding through this 47-page document, again, we understand that within two weeks or two weeks out from today that the state must adhere to this law from really Civil War era, before Arizona became a state in 1912. And again, this is a ban on nearly all abortions except in the instance of saving the life of the mother carrying a possible penalty here of two to five years of prison time for those providing the abortion.",

      "sentences": "All right, Natasha Chen, with the latest there, thank you so much for that.Let's discuss this further now with defense and trial attorney, Misty Marris. Misty, obviously, this is something that activists are going to try to take to the ballot. So we will see where that will go. But in the interim, what you are going to see, it appears after two weeks here, is no more abortions, with only an exception for the life of a mother in Arizona. Talk to us a little bit about what that is going to look like, considering there has been a lot of confusion around that. It seems clear on paper, the life of the mother, it's not so clear. We know that, in other states, it is actually caused some women, who had wanted pregnancy, the possibility of being able to have future pregnancies. MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE &amp; TRIAL ATTORNEY: Absolutely. So first of all, I'm sitting here trying to figure out how a court found that an 1864 law supersedes a 2022 law regarding abortion. But I've read -- I'm reading through the decision and I've Reed the courts rationale. But to flip to what you're speaking about, you know, 14 days for complete upheaval of the medical industry of -- of any woman who is having any kind of treatment or it was seeking treatment, that's not too much time. And to your point about, what does it mean to save the life of a mother? You nailed it. It has not been clear what that means from the legal perspective, as there's been confusion between which law applies in the state of Arizona, which was the precipice for this case. The question is, what is a lifesaving measure? How far does that have to be? Is it truly that someone is at death's door or is it a condition that could impact the mother's life that qualifies under the statute? So all of that has to be hashed out. As far as what happens immediately, the governor had actually gotten ahead of this, and there is an executive order that says that the attorney general is responsible for enforcing this statute, for enforcing this decision. And the attorney general has said, and I imagine we're going to hear from that today, that they're not going to move forward with enforcement. Now that leads to a lot of other legal issues and challenges from local prosecutors. So this is a thorny road ahead with a lot more legal -- a lot more legal issues that are going to come.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Let's take it step-by-step. So here's what happened. In 2022, there was a law passed in Arizona relating to a 15-week gestational period. So we have 15-week ban.Obviously, that is a more expansive right than this 1864 law, which says abortions were essentially illegal with the exception of when the mother's life is at stake. Because that 2022 law was predicated on Roe v. Wade, the right to an abortion was predicated on Roe v. Wade, and, therefore, the 2022 loss stood. Without Roe v. Wade, there is no independent right either in the state of Arizona or in federal -- or in the federal law that would serve as the basis for what Arizona did in 2022. Therefore, it's gone. And so the 1864 law, which was always on the books, but was essentially just inactive and stayed, because Roe v. Wade provided that right constitutionally, is now in effect. And that there's nothing on the books in Arizona or the federal law that says it couldn't be in effect. There's nothing to negate it. And so since it existed, it's simply back into effect at this point. So that is the logic of the court. And that's why they say it supersedes what they did in 2022 as a state, which, to me, sounded like 2022. We'll, that would be the will of the people. But because that was contingent on Roe v. Wade, they said, nope, back to 1864.",

Now, the context here is Chicago has had problems with this kind of stop in the past, this kind of police action. Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, shot dead nearly 10 years ago and Chicago. And that brought in a whole raft of changes. The police department was accused of excessive force. There were changes, there was a new body put in place. The Citizens Office of Police Accountability. That's the body that released this video. So we're about to show you this. It is disturbing. We pick up the video as those officers are getting out of their vehicle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So we don't have the context of why they decided to pull this guy over.On the video that I've seen, I have not heard them identify themselves as police officers. I cannot say categorically that they did not, but they are immediately in a fairly aggressive posture with him. They are cursing at them. They are ordering him. And as we just heard, his own sister say, he must have been very frightened at the time. He's a single guy in a car and five people, five armed people, get out of an unmarked vehicle and surround him. So his sister says anyone would be scared in that situation. So as I say, that is one of the answers that we just do not have. And of course, the other focus of this is it's going to be why officers continued to shoot. Once, really the threat had been, some would say, neutralized once this young man was walking out of the car. So that is going to be another question. As I said, a gun was found on the passenger's seat. But you hear the officers saying, as he's lying on the ground, where's his gun, where is his gun. So they don't know that he's left that weapon in there. Now, also, COPA (ph) as I mentioned, that organization, they say, from their initial investigation, it appears to confirm that Mr. Reed fired first. So he fired on the police first, then this barrage of 96 rounds aimed at him.",
