This hour, the Michigan secretary of state will react to our exclusive reporting on the Trump team's final push to overturn 2020 election results from her state.Also tonight, Nikki Haley is doing damage control after the Republican presidential candidate is facing backlash over her failure to mention slavery when asked about the cause of the civil war. Are voters buying her explanations, plural? Also, there are desperate scenes that we are seeing out of Gaza, civilians here swarming a relief truck in search of food and water. This as we are getting new reaction to video that appears to show men and young boys detained by the Israeli military and stripped to their underwear. An IDF spokesperson will join us live. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Kaitlan Collins and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We do begin with that breaking news this hour as there are new revelations on just how far Trump operatives went in their frantic final push to try to keep their boss in the White House and overturn President Biden's legitimate 2020 election victory. CNN's Marshall Cohen is part of the team that broke this exclusive report. Marshall, what are we hearing and learning in these recordings about just how deep and clearly frantic that fake elector scheme really truly was?",

And it comes from Ken Cheseboro, who, in many ways, was the architect of the fake electors plot. CNN has obtained recordings of his recent sit-down interview with Michigan investigators. We've also obtained hundreds of emails that he turned over. They reveal the last-minute scramble on the eve of January 6th to get those fake certificates to D.C. Here's a clip of Cheseboro describing what happened when Trump campaign officials realized that the ballots from Michigan and Wisconsin were stuck in the mail.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNETH CHESEBORO, PRO-TRUMP ATTORNEY:  The general counsel of the Trump campaign is freaked out that Roman reported that the Michigan votes are still in the sorting facility in Michigan, which doesn't look like they're going to get to Pence in time. So, the general counsel campaign was alarmed and was chartering -- they didn't have to charter a jet, but they did commercial. This is like -- yes. So, this is a high level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there. And they had to enlist a, you know, a U.S. senator to try to expedite it, to get it to Pence in time.

Now, remember, Kaitlan, they needed to get those ballots to the floor of the house because they wanted Mike Pence to throw out Biden's real electors and replace them with Trump's fake electors.In the end, the campaign didn't charter a jet. Staffers booked some last-minute tickets for commercial flights and they ferried the ballots to D.C. on January 5th. Once they got to D.C., there were a series of handoffs and couriers that even included some help from Senator Ron Johnson's office. The ballots eventually did reach the Capitol in time, Kaitlan, but Pence's team said they didn't want them. They refused to go along with the plan.",

But if you read through these emails, they're really remarkable in how deeply they intertwine the lawyers at the very top of the Trump campaign with Cheseboro and others. There are numerous references to conversations they're having with people in the Republican Party about these issues. So, you have to kind of give some credit to Cheseboro's comments and you understand his frustration. This was clearly much bigger, more complicated, a lot of people putting a lot of effort into getting these fake certificates signed by the fake electors into D.C. just in time.

And I'm sure the prosecutors -- you know, it doesn't look like anybody else knew what will be charged I think on account of the revelations that have come out here, but this is certainly valuable evidence.

There's one paragraph tucked in. It's kind of vague. It doesn't have all the details that we've been discussing here today. If you look the paragraph before, that's about Donald Trump tweeting about Mike Pence. All he has to do is send it back. The paragraph after is about how Donald Trump called Mike Pence and pressured him, in Jack Smith's words, to fraudulently reject the Biden electors. So, Jack Smith already has a case against Trump.

And it is common that when before we get close to a Hamas terrorist, we ask them to lift up their shirt and make sure, pull down their pants, that there are no explosives on them. They then get dressed and they leave.But why are these children with Hamas? And this is another example where we can see how Hamas are using civilians and children and schools and mosques. They never should have been there in the first place. I don't want to see these pictures. As a matter of fact, I don't want to see any of these pictures because we didn't want to be in Gaza in the first place.

They have no problem hiding underneath the ground beneath the Gazan children and they have no problem sending a Gazan child with an explosive vest.So, unfortunately, they should never be there in the first place. But if they are, I wouldn't want to see my son go close to one of those kids and have them blow himself up. It's an unfortunate reality of the way Hamas plays the game.

Now, this is a big decision from the secretary of state of Maine. Make no mistake about that. It is in line with what Colorado appears to have done here as well with the Colorado Supreme Court looking at Donald Trump being on the primary ballot there and saying he couldn't be. But the thing about Maine is that there is going to be a lot of opportunity to appeal this. So the secretary of state is the person here making that decision instead of the court system, but what happens next is that Trump and others all have the opportunity to go to Maine's court system to appeal this and all of that can play out in a very short amount of time. We could have some sort of resolution in the courts, depending on how fast the courts move and how fast everyone goes to the court.

Can a secretary of state make this sort of decision in party primaries related to who voters can cast their ballots for? And so, whenever this goes to the Supreme Court, it's very unlikely, at the very beginning, right now, where we are still in this primary process, this first emergency application is before the U.S. Supreme Court, that the Supreme Court, the nine justices in Washington, D.C., that they are going to be making a call on whether Trump isn't insurrectionists are not. There are very likely going to be looking first at the sort of thing that Colorado GOP wants them to look at, saying you can't remove the ability for voters to vote for certain people.

As we've talked about, every state addresses this question of how they will or will not apply the 14th amendment differently under their state laws. Here in this decision that we are still reading from Maine secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, what she says is, that Donald Trump's petition to be on the ballot, where he says he's qualified, is not accurate because he's not qualified under the 14th Amendment.
