      "sentences": "Donald Trump more on the economy than they do Harris. So that's a big reason why I think you're seeing both of them out here today talk about it, but specifically Donald Trump here in North Carolina.Now, one thing I do also want to mention, John, because this has been coming up a lot in many of Donald Trump's recent speeches, is him trying to court the gender gap. So, I just walked you through some of the polling on the economy. But when it comes to female voters, Harris is definitely winning that fight. Our CNN national poll had likely voters under 35, women voters, with Harris for 52 percent compared to Donald Trump at 40 percent, and likely voters under 30 percent, Harris at 55 and Trump at 38 percent. So, again, all of these polls are clearly weighing on both of these candidates' minds. But I know that Donald Trump specifically is worried about the gender gap and courting female voters. We actually heard him address this specifically earlier this week when he was in Pennsylvania. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I always thought women liked me. I never thought I had a problem. But the fake news keeps saying women don't like me. I don't believe it. You will be protected. And I will be your protector. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

An issue that he recognizes his campaign is not doing as well on. But, look, this is definitely a key concern with Donald Trump's campaign. And my conversations with his advisers, they recognize that this growing gender gap is a problem for them. And I think you're going to hear him talk about that again today here in North Carolina in just a couple hours. John.",

Good to see you guys. Let's jump into all of it, economy, women voters, and then I want to add in a little spice of young voters. Let's start with the economy. It is - I would be surprised if it ever leaves the tier of being the most important issue. Something would really have to happen for it to - it to move. Every time I have a Democratic official on, a surrogate, a governor, I had Jared Polis on, and I asked, why isn't she gaining more ground in terms of the economy? They say, people just need to hear her message more. What - what is the exploration data on that, do you think?",

How are groceries going to be less? And I think those are the things that we're starting to see now. And I think that she needs to start laying out. She's talking about cutting costs for the middle class and tax cuts. She's also comparing her plan against Donald Trump's economy plan, which is only cutting, you know, taxes for corporations and is going to cost the middle class more money.So, I think, you know, while laying out her plans, she also needs to draw that contrast with the president, which I think you'll see her do today - with the former president, I'm sorry.",

Donald Trump has an enormous advantage with white male voters. We have seen that over and over again. Among white women, Kamala Harris is within the margin of error. Well within the margin of error in terms of - in terms of that subgroup. The context here is, Hillary Clinton, 2016, lost white women to Donald Trump by nine points. Joe Biden lost white women in 2020 do Donald Trump by 11 points. And if this - what this polling says about the gains Kamala Harris is making in terms of white women tracks, David Chalian says that could prove a problem for Joe - for Donald Trump. Does that - does that, at this stage in the game, does that concern you? Should it concern the campaign?",

We're also seeing an historic gender gap among male voters. And that's actually given Donald Trump opportunities to go out and get voters that haven't voted Republican in generations. Young African American men, young Hispanic men, young white men. He's actually now potentially on the cusp of winning young men for the first time that we've seen in probably a generation for a Republican candidate. And that's in part because this this gender gap.Now, what you are seeing is both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's campaigns recognize that there is some risks in that strategy of just maximizing the number of male votes or female votes that can get.",
