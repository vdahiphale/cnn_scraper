We're now waiting to see if the court will issue a temporary injunction on petitions that were filed after parliament passed a controversial law on Monday. It's the first step in a process that would weaken the Supreme Court and there appears to be a lull in mass street protests but internal backlash is growing. Doctors are walking off the job, military reservists are threatening to stop volunteering, and black ads covered the front pages of several major Israeli newspapers on Tuesday. The country's strategic affairs minister spoke to CNN earlier and pushed back on criticism that the new law presents a danger to democracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because, of course, Christina, one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that the Israeli government has said, some of the ministers in the government have said that what was happening yesterday in Israeli Parliament, the Reasonable Act, the Reasonableness Act, is only the beginning of a flurry of measures that the government wants to take to essentially curtail the powers of the Supreme Court, but also to make it easier for the government itself to change the makeup of the Supreme Court. And so, that's certainly something that's driving people to the streets. We have some of the images on our screens right now, where we can see some of the clashes that took place yesterday in Jerusalem, but also in Tel Aviv as well, which, of course, were big turmoil here in this country. We spoke to some of the protesters, and a lot of them were telling us that they believe that right now is the time for them to come out on the streets. They think that the measures that are being debated right now, some of the ones that have already been pushed through, some of the ones that have been that are being debated, are so fundamental to the democracy of this country that they feel that they need to go out on the streets. But it was so interesting also to hear Ron Dermer earlier this today on CNN because he was asked by our own Erica Hill is, if the Supreme Court decides to strike down that law that was enacted yesterday, the Reasonableness Act, whether or not the government would abide by that. And he really didn't answer the question. He said, look, Israel is a country of rule of law, where they abide by the rule of law, but not a rule by judges. So, certainly not a direct answer to that question, and certainly not something that is going to curtail some of the turmoil that's been going on, which is going on in Israeli society, but also in the Israeli economy, as well. We had Morgan Stanley today downgrade the economy of Israel in its rating. And then we had the government just a couple of minutes ago come out with its own statement, Benjamin Netanyahu and his finance minister, saying that, look, the Israeli economy is in great shape. They believe, once the dust settles, people are going to see that the Israeli economy is very strong and will remain very strong. We're also waiting for a report coming out from Moody's later today, as well, to see what they are going to say. But certainly, right now, is definitely a difficult time. Many believe for Israeli democracy, certainly also for the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu, as well, as they are facing that criticism. And right now, it's very difficult to see how all of this is going to end and where it is going to end, because of course one of the things that we've been hearing is on the one side the people are saying, who we've been seeing out on the streets, that they are not going to stop coming out and protesting until these measures are repealed, until they're taken back or are struck down by the Supreme Court. And of course, the government is saying that this is just the beginning and there are more measures to come. Christina.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Christina. Basically, what this report is telling us is that if we don't stop burning fossil fuels rapidly,the quote, unquote, \"heat hell\" that we are experiencing across much of the northern hemisphere right now will seem like cool summer months in the future, right? So, that really puts it into perspective. Now, scientists have for decades been able to associate and attribute weather events like climate or coastal storm surge, heavy rain events, as well as these extreme heat events. But now, this World Weather Attribution Initiative, the study that we're talking about right now, has the ability to compare the current climate, which is about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages to the past climate. And what it's showing is that climate change is absolutely just incredibly entrenched within this makeup, the DNA of our temperatures. Take the heat wave ongoing from North America with man-made climate change, it is actually two degrees Celsius above where it would be without the heat trapping gas that we emit into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. And the frequency of these extreme heat events is going up as well. We're ranging anywhere from an extreme heat event every 5 to 15 years. If we continue to burn fossil fuels, we can expect that to go 1 in every 2 to three years to see these extreme heat events. And what you and I used to think was extreme heat, let's say roughly 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit is becoming more easily achievable and it's occurring more frequently, as well. And what we thought was extreme heat, well that will now be the new normal and then we'll start to see those extremes get pushed further and further. Just take for example the global heat average. We have since July 3rd set the global average temperature record for the entire planet and that has been consecutively going for over 20 days. And in places like China, we have never recorded a temperature this hot that was late last week, 52.2 degrees in Phoenix, Arizona, in North America where we continue to have our ongoing heat wave. We have had just incredible consecutive stretch of temperatures above 43 degrees as these heat don'ts propagate across the country. Christina, without these heat waves, it will be virtually impossible without climate change to have this type of excessive heat.",

Moscow is accusing the West of trying to sabotage the summit by encouraging African leaders not to take part. Now, China's foreign minister is out. The old foreign minister is back in. And that's not even the biggest mystery of this story. In a surprise announcement just hours ago, Beijing said former foreign minister Wang Yi has returned to his old job. Wang was already the top foreign policy adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping. He replaces Qin Gang, who has not been seen for a month. He disappeared from public view about a week after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in mid-June, and there has been little word about where he was or what happened to him other than vague statements from Beijing about health problems.

So, clearly, they have the money. They're happy to spend it. The question is, will Kylian Mbappe want to go and play there? And we don't know. He hasn't said anything on the subject. But what we do know is that he has a year left on his contract with PSG. At that point, he gets to choose whatever club he wants to play for and that club doesn't have to pay anything to acquire his services. It is widely believed that he's heading to Real Madrid. He has expressed a great deal of interest in the past in playing for Real Madrid one day and he has for the last few years endured or enjoyed a rather uneasy relationship with PSG. So, it seems as though he and PSG have reached an impasse. It's hard to imagine that he's ever going to play for them again. So, the question now is, what does he do for the next 12 months? Does he just take the year off or does he go and play somewhere? And when someone is offering you $770 million for a year's work, why would you turn that down?

It's incredibly disruptive because now, the price of every player has gone up and even though there's only one market or one country paying those kinds of money, that of course just changes everything. The Premier League doesn't like it but that's interesting because the rest of Europe has been irritated with the kind of resources the Premier League has had over the last 10 -- 20 years. And now, the Premier League itself is experiencing, oh I see, this is what it's like when someone else comes in with even more money than you do.

It can lead to cardiac arrest, but that's what's actually happening in that situation. Then heart failure is something where the muscles of the heart have now become so weakened that even after the heart starts beating again, it's not beating adequately enough. It's sort of failing, not pushing enough blood through the body. Sudden cardiac arrest does happen. Again, it's rare in young athletes, a few thousand times a year, for example, in the United States. But it does happen. Out of hospital cardiac arrest across all ages is quite common, as you might guess. Hundreds of thousands of times a year that happens. So again, it happens in young athletes.

So, he cited November as a potential date. But we have to see, he has partners that are extreme. They want to see more reform and more overhaul, and Netanyahu will once again have to balance between these two powers, civil unrest and its coalition partners.",

And when it comes to diplomatic relations, it's no secret that the Biden- Netanyahu relationship is not good. President Biden has not yet invited Prime Minister, or has invited him, but without a real date. I had not -- Netanyahu has yet not yet set foot in the United States since he took office over six months ago. The President has called repeatedly on the Prime Minister to enact these reforms in the overhaul with the broad consensus and the Prime Minister ignored that request. I don't see how this is going to yet get better unless Netanyahu slams the brakes, stops it, says I achieved my one goal of this law, and now I'm looking to try to bring the country back together. The jury is still out on whether he's going to do that.",

It really seems that everything the government is trying to throw at these criminal organizations that are, by the way, battling a turf of war for territorial control over cocaine trafficking routes out of Ecuador, it seems that the government has very little action. What we're seeing over the weekend is violence spilling out of the prisons. For years, the violence only occurred inside the prison, where it often erupted in gruesome massacres between inmates. But we have seen episodes of violence outside the prisons, in the streets. We've seen a mayor of one of the Ecuador's largest cities gunned down on the streets on Sunday. And the government already declared a state of emergency yesterday concerning to that episode. And now, with the news that at least 96 prison guards are being held hostages by these inmates who are members of criminal organizations, according to Ecuadorian authorities. The government has declared yet another state of emergency nationwide inside the prisons. Frankly, yes, we've seen something like this before, but the level of intimidation, the level of control that these organizations are exerting from inside what are meant to be penitentiaries, what are meant to be correctional institutes that instead have become castles of organized crimes across the land is something that we haven't seen before. And it's also worth pointing out to the political repercussions of this crisis with the President Guillermo Lasso, who has so far changed five directors of the penitentiary service in the last two years. He, Lasso himself, is on the way out. He's presented his resignation over an investment scandal just in May and on August 20, Ecuador will hold a new election, likely that will go to a runoff set for October. And it really seems that stability is not on the cards for Ecuador right now. It's frankly, actually, to see how a nation that just a few years ago was not subject to this level of crime, this level of this type of stories, frankly. Ecuador has always been a very peaceful nation here in South America. And now, it really seems on the border, on the cusp of collapse due to the actions of organized criminal organizations and cartels. Christina.",

Now, authorities in the U.S. state of Alabama are weighing charges against a woman who now admits her story about being kidnapped was a hoax. Carlee Russell's attorney gave a statement to police apologizing. The 26- year-old disappeared while she was driving home from work nearly two weeks ago. And after an intensive search, Russell turned up at her home two days later. The local police chief says he still doesn't know where she was. CNN's Ryan Young has been following this bizarre case for us out of Atlanta. And Ryan, this is really shocking and quite disappointing to hear and I know we are getting more details from the authorities. What are they saying? RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, they really laid this out. Let's start with the disappointing part. The disappointing part is the fact that so many resources were used to find this woman. There's a lot of people who have missing family members who don't see this sort of resource. The woman called about a week ago and said that she saw a toddler on the side of the road. And when she saw that child, she called 911. She pulled over. When police arrived, all they found was her car, her wig, and her cell phone. At that point, they started doing an extensive search for this woman. About two days later, about 49 hours later, she showed back up at home. She had this fantastic story about being kidnapped by a man with orange hair. And her mom even went on TV saying that her daughter had escaped this kidnapping. And so, so many people were wondering what happened to Carly. In fact, now take a listen to the Chief and what he's figured out so far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
