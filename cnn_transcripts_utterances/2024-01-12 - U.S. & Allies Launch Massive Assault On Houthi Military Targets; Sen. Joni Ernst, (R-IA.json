Murphy is a top opinion writer for the Atlanta Journal Constitution asking that of District Attorney Fani Willis who has yet to deny that she has a romantic relationship with a special prosecutor she hired. The stunning scandal detailed and legal briefs in the Georgia case against Donald Trump. CNN was at the first hearing today since the allegations were revealed. Plus, inside the Iowa caucuses, exactly how does this very American, very bizarre process work? And why does Iowa opt for this versus the more popular and easy primary process where voters just line up and vote in the polls? And leading this hour, what could be a worsening global prices for President Biden? Iranian backed Houthi militants now warning of retaliation against the U.S. and its allies for strikes against Houthis in Yemen last night. The White House insists these were self defense strikes intended to protect U.S. troops and global commerce after a string of Houthi attacks in recent weeks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis actions have not only threaten lives, they've effectively shut down to most of the shipping companies, one of the world's main trade routes. Let's get straight to CNN's Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. Oren, why did the U.S. and its allies decide to carry out these strikes now when Houthi attacks have been going on for months?",

In fact, since the beginning of January, we have seen the U.N. Security Council resolution passed a couple of days ago condemning Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, one of the world's most critical waterways. We saw the multinational statement about a week before that trying to get the Houthis to stop attacking international shipping and yet the attacks continued.Given that, the U.S. felt that not only was it acting alone here, it had international backing. It had the U.K. support when it took its military action, and it had the backing and support of several other countries, Canada, Bahrain, the Netherlands, Australia to carry out the strike. It is now beyond the diplomatic message because there was the sense and frankly, what we were seeing happening was that the Houthis kept attacking international shipping. And the U.S. felt that got to the point where the Houthis, and frankly, Iran who backs the Houthis needed a stronger message to the U.S., the U.K. and the others felt compelled to act here hitting nearly 30 Houthi targets in Yemen. Targets that not -- were not intended to start a wider war, but that were intended to take away from unlimit the Houthis ability to target international shipping.",

And because of that the President had the authority to act.But this clearly wasn't a quick response. Given the number of countries involved here, given the level of coordination that's required, this clearly involves a tremendous amount of planning. And because of all that, because of what went into this operation, the scope of it, the size of it, those members of Congress are arguing, look, Congress needed to authorize these strikes on Yemen, not simply a presidential act. It's in that space between an act of self defense and a larger planned operation. That's their argument that this needed congressional authorization.",

They know about the Houthi attacks, and they know how to strike back and we saw that demonstrated quite well.I do worry about Iran. I will be honest about that. But I don't think these attacks on the Houthis are going to escalate into a wider conflict. I do think that if we don't see the decimation of Hamas and continue pushing back on Hezbollah, if all of those things interconnected, aren't kept under control, it is quite possible we see escalation. But I don't see it just simply with these attacks on the Houthis. TAPPER: Yes. In a CNN debate Wednesday that Dana Bash and I moderated, Governor Nikki Haley said she disagrees with calls from some of the extreme right wingers in Netanyahu's cabinet in Israel, that hundreds of 1000s of Palestinians should be forcibly removed from Gaza. Governor Ron DeSantis said that basically he would support any move by Israel, if they felt like they needed to do that to avoid a second holocaust. Where do you come down on the issue of these calls from Ben Gvir and Smotrich, an extremists in the Netanyahu cabinet to forcibly remove hundreds of 1000s of Palestinians from Gaza?",

Unfortunately, many of those Palestinians who support Hamas do want to see the Jewish state wiped off the face of the earth and we can't allow this to happen. So, what I would say is that we need to make sure that Hamas is decimated, that is Israel's intent under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, those terrorists need to be gone. But then we need to say the demilitarization and the deradicalization of those Palestinians that live in the Gaza Strip, these groups can peaceably live together, we need to find a solution.We discussed that on the recent trip to the Middle East. But large part what we focused on as our congressional delegation was the return of the American hostages that are currently held by Hamas.

And that's what has been spoken out about by the Houthis, by Hezbollah and others.What we don't want to happen -- I mean, that is not the U.S. interests? The U.S. interests, clearly laid out by President Biden, has been a two state solution, to have peace in the region and Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out. If he's not acting in the U.S. interest, we have to be more aggressive and saying something. I use this in a common way, if you're out with a friend drinking, and Israel's a friend to the United States, and they've had too much to drink and they want to drive home, it's your responsibility to say no, you've had too much to drink, you can't get behind the wheel, because they are your friend. We need to do more of that, I think right now, given the conditions.

You got Donald Trump against his expectations to see whether or not he breaks 50 as he has in the polling. And then you've got Haley and DeSantis, kind of trying to resolve, you know, who gets the chance really to go on and take on Trump one-on-one. We usually say there's three tickets out of Iowa.I'm thinking there's two this time, because this race has to get down to one-on-one race or Trump versus the field. He's going to win every time. So if there's a path for anyone, they got to do really well in Iowa, they got to go into New Hampshire with some steam. And if someone could knock him off there, and it looks like Haley has the high hand in New Hampshire, that's the only thing I can see that's going to change the dynamic of this race in any significant way.",

It's just the latest escalation in the contentious effort to curb migrant crossings in the U.S. -- at the U.S. southern border. CNN's Rosa Flores is in Houston.

And the Texas military department is doubling down on that issuing a statement saying in part quote, the current posture is to prepare for future illegal immigrant surges and to restrict access to organizations that perpetuate illegal immigrant crossings in the park and the greater Eagle Pass area.But here's the backstory of this latest feud between Texas and the Biden administration. On Wednesday, the state of Texas took custody and control of a public park in Eagle Pass, it surprised so officials there in the city of Eagle Pass. But the situation escalated when Texas military department members did not allow Border Patrol to gain access to that area. Now process this with me, because this is a state authority not giving a federal law enforcement agency, Border Patrol, access to the area where they inspect and apprehend migrants who have entered the country illegally. This is the area where Border Patrol does that and they don't have access to it anymore. Now the Biden administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene so that border patrol can regain access to this jurisdiction. And the White House also condemning this issuing a statement saying in part, quote, Governor Abbott continues his extreme political stunts that not only seek to demonize and dehumanize people, but that also make it harder and more dangerous for Border Patrol to do their jobs. And, Jake, it's important to note that the number of migrant apprehensions along the U.S. southern border has plummeted in recent weeks. You remember back in mid-December, the number of migrants crossing the border was about 10,000 per day, that has plummeted to about 3,000 per day and that seen in Eagle Pass is the same. Right now, it's about 500 migrants per day that are entering there through Eagle Pass. Jake?",
