This is a pastor is in suburbs of Des Moines, big evangelical church, and he actually hosted Ron DeSantis a couple of weeks before. He described himself as 51-49 DeSantis over Trump.But when were asking specifically about the federal indictment, it was the weekend after that, saying, how come that is not itself disqualifying for you, it's because they really see Donald Trump as a figure that has helped pushed them culturally, like a culture warrior, he has done too much for them to really give up is frankly what the pastor was saying. And that he found the kind of what he thought the indictments were doing was kind of a liberal attack on that figure. And so what he is laying out there is a way to excuse any of the kind of factual claims that come out of these indictments. It did not matter that Donald Trump -- he was kind of acknowledging there the possibility of guilt, the likelihood of guilt. That was irrelevant, frankly, because he felt that what would come after that, that what would bring the next year, with the way it changes the tone of the race, that that inherently should be a higher priority than the facts of the case. That is one that flies in the face of the rule of law, flies in the face of tradition that we have seen over the years, but for the people who are dyed in the wool kind of Trump culture warriors or even backing someone like DeSantis, who has embraced that type of message, that's where they've landed on this.",

He has commanded Russian troops in Ukraine for a period of time. And the day of Prigozhin's march toward Moscow, he's the one who posted this video to Telegram urging the Wagner leader to stand down and turn back.But according to The New York Times, U.S. officials are now trying to learn if Surovikin may have helped Prigozhin's rebellion. This all raises so many questions over how much support Prigozhin may have and had within Russia's military leadership. The Kremlin calls this speculation and rumors, that's a quote from them this morning. Joining us now, the former secretary of defense under Donald Trump, Mark Esper.
