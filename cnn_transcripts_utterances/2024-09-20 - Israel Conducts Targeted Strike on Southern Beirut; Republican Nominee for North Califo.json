I'm Eleni Giokos in Abu Dhabi.I want to get straight to our breaking news this hour amidst growing fears Israel and the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah are spiraling towards war. The Israeli military says it has launched a rare strike on the Lebanese capital. And you can see smoke over the Beirut skyline, just over an hour ago. Now extensive damage and chaos in the streets afterwards. It's the latest of hundreds of strikes between the two sides over the past 24 hours. Reports say the strike targeted a top Hezbollah official, pushing the region further on edge. Hezbollah's leader is vowing to respond after the attacks on pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to his group. What you're seeing right now is the aftermath of that IDF strike in southern Beirut. And we're bringing you an update from Beirut, as well as from Tel Aviv. We've got Ben Wedeman standing by, as well as Jeremy Diamond. Welcome to both of you. Ben, I want to start with you. We're seeing these initial images coming through of the aftermath. You can see the chaos and of course the rush. Give me a sense of what we're learning right now. What more do we know?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. I can now confirm according to sources familiar with the matter that Ibrahima Aqil,that senior Hezbollah commander that Ben was just talking about, was indeed the target of this Israeli strike in Beirut just in the last hour or so. Aqil is a senior Hezbollah military commander and if indeed he was killed, which we have not yet confirmed, he would be the senior most Hezbollah figure to be killed since Fuad Shukr was assassinated in that late July strike that was also carried out by the Israeli military and also carried out in that Beirut suburb of Dahiya. This is of course a very significant moment, not only because of the seniority of the target that Israel appears to have at least attempted to take out. We don't yet know whether or not that strike was successful, but also of course because it happened in Beirut, in the Lebanese capital. And then additionally, we are also getting these reports of casualties as a result of this strike. At least three people killed and I believe that the latest count is 17 others who appear to have been injured in this Israeli strike so far. So very significant. And then another reason I think that I would add to the significance of all this is just the pace. I mean, just think about the number of things that have happened in the last few days alone in terms of this Hezbollah-Israel conflict that has been, you know, simmering at a fairly lower temperature for much of the last year with rockets being fired by Hezbollah into northern Israel, strikes being carried out by the Israeli military, largely in southern Lebanon. But now this week we have seen a series of actions, in particular from the Israeli side that have really ratcheted up the temperature. We saw those thousands of pagers that exploded just a few days ago. We confirmed indeed that that was a joint Israeli military and Mossad operation. The following day we saw walkie-talkies exploding. And in the wake of that, Hezbollah earlier this morning carried out a fairly significant rocket barrage attack on northern Israel. Some 120 projectiles were identified crossing into northern Israel according to the Israeli military, although those did not result in any casualties. Fires, however, have been set ablaze as a result of those strikes. And last night, I should add, we also saw the Israeli military carrying out one of the most intense bombardments of southern Lebanon that we have seen in some time. Certainly maybe the last time we saw something slightly more intense was as Israel launched that preemptive strike as Hezbollah was retaliating for the killing of Fuad Shukr a few weeks ago. But now it really does seem like we are at much, much higher level of intensity and there's no question that today's strike carried out in the Lebanese capital, the suburb of Dahiya of Beirut, that this is really ratcheting things up and putting even more pressure now on Hezbollah internally certainly to retaliate because now, not only are they going to be poised to retaliate for the explosions of those pagers and walkie-talkies, but there is also now it appears this strike targeting a senior Hezbollah commander, Ibrahim Aqil, to account for as well.",

And there's a lot of concern that Hezbollah is really being pushed to a point, even though they may be disoriented because of the disruption in their communication, internal communication, they still obviously still retained the capacity to respond. And there's increasing concern that they're really being pushed into a position where they have no option but to respond in some way or the other. That response should it be a, you know, living up to the initial equation of you hit Beirut, we hit Tel Aviv if they do something like this, this will then immediately flair into a much bigger conflict than we've seen so far, and it will wreck, you know, death and destruction certainly on Lebanon, but also on Israel. The Israeli government is gambling now and they see it as an opportunity to continue pushing the envelope and pushing Hezbollah to see how far they can go. They've certainly caused a lot of damage over the past year, but I think particularly over the last three or four days.",

We've seen the skirmishes between, you know, Israel as well as Hezbollah on the southern border of Lebanon. Does Israel, does it seem to you that Israel wants to get into a full out war?

From Iran's perspective, it has no need to get into an all-out conflict and have assets. It's spent the last four decades building up completely destroyed and a conflict it really cannot win in. But if getting to the point where what we're seeing now is a war of attrition where Hezbollah's capacities are being systematically degraded, its top leadership is being taken out, it's lost upwards of 450 members between commanders and foot soldiers, along with increasing pressure within Lebanon because of the displacement, the exhaustion, et cetera, then the equation might flip. And we don't know what that flip will be. It may not necessarily mean that Iran will immediately get involved in the conflict. However, also, I mean, there's been a lot of talk about the possibility of a ground invasion by Israel. Wat Israel has shown over the past few days, it actually does not need to do a ground invasion and that, you know, it can continue with this war of attrition. If we're going to look at the conflict from a 20th century perspective, you know, it's two armies hitting each other. It's place specific. In this context, what we're looking at is, yes, there are bombings going back and forth but we're not looking at kind of the, you know, kind of combat that we've seen in Gaza, for example. We're looking at a very sophisticated, multi-hybrid kind of warfare. The kinds of which we have not seen before at least in this particular context.",

      "sentences": "More now on our top story, breaking news out of the Middle East. Sources tell CNN an Israeli strike on southern Beirut targeted a topHezbollah official. Three people were killed and 17 injured. That's according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It's only the third strike this year targeting the Lebanese capital. It came amidst an increase of volleys between Israel and Hezbollah militants and fears the region could be spiraling into war. What you're seeing right now is the aftermath of that strike. Those images just into CNN as we're getting more information on what transpired about an hour ago, I want to bring in now H.A. Hellyer, Middle East studies scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for an update. H.A., what a week it's been for Lebanon and importantly what we've seen in the impact on Hezbollah. We've seen this strike now in the last hour, the target specifically from what we understand, Ibrahim Aqil, what is your reaction to this? H.A. HELLYER, SCHOLAR, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: Eleni, thank you very much for having me on your program. I think it's been very clear throughout the last year that Washington has been urging the Israelis not to escalate, not to bring the region into a more risky situation where they would be all-out war across the area. And unfortunately, Israel seems to have crossed these red lines again and again and again. And of course, because there wasn't any accountability from Washington whenever these red lines were crossed, I think Israel feels that it's been empowered and enabled to take more steps of an escalatory fashion. And I think what we've seen over the last few days is an indication that the war in Gaza will wind down. It will not end. It will wind down in my opinion. So there will be continued violence there. The Israelis will maintain a military presence inside of Gaza, not just around it, and reduce the territory and so on, but it will wind down in terms of intensity and redirect that intensity to southern Lebanon. And I think the aim there is to forcefully push out Hezbollah from the south of Lebanon. The south of Lebanon was described by the Israelis just yesterday as a war zone and I don't think that was rhetorical. I think that's sending a very particular message which is, we don't regard this as an area that is sacrosanct. We're not interested in Lebanese sovereignty when it comes to strikes in this particular area. On the contrary, to push out Hezbollah from this area.",

There are some cases where the United States will, you know, sort of fudge the issue andsaying we had no role, or we didn't play any part in the operation without answering directly, whether or not they knew about it. But very often they don't know about it. And I think that's very telling that the Israelis feel that they can embark on these sorts of operations and missions without informing and getting the consent of their closest ally, which isn't just like closest ally, but is the main source of its military hardware, financial aid, political support at the U.N. and so on. But again, this is down to the pattern that has been shown over the past year. D.C. laid down some very clear red lines throughout the last year, whether it was about Rafah, whether it's about escalation in different areas, and the Israelis ignored those red lines. And there were no consequences for crossing those red lines. So it's not surprising if the Israelis become more and more reckless as time goes on.",

Now we're moving on to a CNN exclusive. CNN's KFile investigative unit has uncovered disturbing details about the Republican candidate running for governor of North Carolina. The state's current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. Now the investigation shows Robinson posted on a porn site starting in 2008 and made some truly shocking remarks. He described himself as a, quote, \"black Nazi,\" and wrote posts expressing support for reinstating slavery. There were also homophobic and transphobic slurs, and what appears to be a joke about rape. Robinson denies making those comments. Dianne Gallagher is following the story for us from North Carolina. Dianne, good to see you. I guess the big question is, what does this mean for the Republicans? How they're reacting to this and what this could mean for the ticket. DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So look, as of today, Mark Robinson remains the Republican nominee running for governor here in this crucial state of North Carolina. The deadline for him to withdraw as the candidate has passed at midnight and there are absentee ballots that have already been sent out now, today, to military and overseas citizens of North Carolina. So he can no longer withdraw from the race, and his state party is standing by him publicly. They released a statement late last night that said in part, the left is trying to demonize him via personal attacks. I will tell you that privately, many Republicans have expressed deep concern about what this might do to their fellow party members who are running against Democrats right now with the attacks that are already beginning trying to tie them to Robinson and to this story. Now again, Robinson categorically denies that these are his posts. This is what he told CNN KFile Andrew Kaczynski about that denial and speculating on where they may have come from.

But what does this attack, what does this strike today mean compounded with the impacts of what we've seen this entire week?",

This really represented a serious compromising of its otherwise vaunted security system and so it's more vulnerable and compromised than it has ever been before. It's really pushed into a corner. And the problem is, you know, when you push a fairly lethal organization like Hezbollah into a corner, how is it going to respond? Yes, it's suffered severe injury as a result of the pager and walkie-talkie blasts, thousands of their men have been injured, perhaps some of them permanently, and you have senior military officials also been killed. Of course, we have yet to confirm that Ibrahim Aqil has actually been killed as a result of this strike. Now, it's important to keep in mind that so far since the 8th of October when hostilities began between Israel and Hezbollah, the war has largely, largely been limited to the border area and Hezbollah has by and large been using short range missiles and other weaponry against Israeli military and some civilian targets as well. It does, however, have in its arsenal missiles and rockets.",
