      "sentences": "Yes, it was interesting insight from Avril Haines, the head of U.S. intelligence, Christine. And it does reflect, to a certain extent, what we're experiencing on the ground here.Yes, there are front lines that are active right now, both in Donetsk in the east and then down south outside of liberated Kherson where there has been active shelling over the weekend that killed at least one civilian. And as you mentioned, that town of Bakhmut where Russian tanks and artillery are trying to move west. They're trying to take that town. They've actually called it target number one and that's how the Ukrainian military is describing it out there in the eastern group of armed forces. And the reason, frankly, that the Russians are trying to do this, the Ukrainians believe, is to demonstrate some success on the battlefield. To show some victory to their very increasingly skeptical domestic audience back home in Russia if you believe the latest polls that are out. Of course, Russia's not exactly known for transparency or for leaders necessarily being fully accountable to the public. But public support inside Russia, according to a number of different new polls, is eroding with more than half of Russians in at least two separate polls that I read this morning saying that they support peace talks moving forward. And a much smaller percentage -- maybe about 25 percent in one poll -- said they want the war to continue. In terms of this slowdown, we see reduced righting, partially just because the temperatures are really starting to plummet here. It's not even winter in Ukraine but it's been snowing almost every single day. And the temperatures are really going to drop in the coming weeks ahead to well, well below zero. You're talking almost arctic cold, where if you open the window for just a few moments your room temperature is going to drop by about 20 degrees. It's really pretty intense, so imagine if you're in a trench in that kind of a condition. That said, though, Christine, there is still growing concern of a major Russian attack on the power infrastructure here -- the civilian infrastructure -- with Russia expected to lob perhaps dozens of rockets and missiles just like they did a little less than two weeks ago, with the intent of trying to plunge this nation into a blackout at a time that they really need the electricity and the power with the temperatures dropping so quickly.",

Nearly 2,000 residents forced to evacuate as thick ash blanketed roads and homes.CNN's Allison Chinchar has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, AMS METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  Ash fills the skies in Indonesia forming a thick caustic cloud over Mt. Semeru on the island of Java. Video from the country's Ministry of Environment and Forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday. A burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky -- a sign for people living in the volcano's shadow it's time to go. This man escaping on a motorbike, the ash caking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going, just somewhere out of the volcano's reach. Authorities say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano, which is located about 800 kilometers southeast of Jakarta. The roads in the area packed with vehicles rushing to outrun the volcanic ash that is still raining down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone, handing out masks, and urging them to go to shelters. INDAH AMPERAWATI MASDAR, LUMAJANG DISTRICT DEPUTY CHIEF (through translator):  \"We have readied some nearby schools and village halls. We will prepare them until the observatory post declares it's safe.\" CHINCHAR (voice-over):  The damage already done to some areas. Rooftops are singed and the ground is covered with smoldering soot. Authorities are telling people to stay at least eight kilometers away from the eruption center, but there are fears the hot ash could drift further. So far, many people are heeding the warnings, a lesson learned last year when more than 50 people were killed in a previous eruption and thousands were forced from their homes. Allison Chinchar, CNN.

It really hired and amped up its hiring during the heart of the pandemic. It may have gotten, as an industry, over its skis and now it's starting to pull back. But as you note, it's a very small fraction of the overall labor market, so it's unclear whether tech is a bellwether to a broader weakness. When you look at health care, when you look at leisure and hospitality, and consumer-facing industries, they're still hiring strongly in this market.

I mean, there are losses -- there are ugly losses and then there is what the Cowboys did to the Colts last night.Dallas had a 2-point lead in the fourth quarter before the defense absolutely put the hammer down. They were the story of the game led by Malik Hooker, former number-one pick of the Colts of all teams. He had one of the all-time revenge games against his former team. His safety had a 26-yard interception return that led to a touchdown in the first half. And in the fourth quarter of this game, he iced the game with a fumble recovery for a 38-yard touchdown. So, Indianapolis had five turnovers in the game that turned into five Dallas touchdowns. The Cowboys scored 33 unanswered points in a little more than 11 minutes in the final quarter, which ties for the second- most ever scored in the fourth quarter in NFL history as Dallas rolls to a 54-19 win to improve to 9-3 on the season. Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson receiving a mixed welcome in Houston for his first game since the 2020 season. Watson was suspended for the first 11 games of the season after more than two dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct while he was with the Texans.
