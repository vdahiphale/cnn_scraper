Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour live in Odessa, Ukraine. It is the Pearl of the Black Sea, as it's known. This major port city has borne the brunt of Russian missile attacks in the last few weeks. On Friday, Ukraine intercepted four missiles and a drone and Ukraine has also stepped up some of its own attacks during the -- during Russian targets inside Crimea. As the counteroffensive moves south, today, Kyiv's defense ministry says its forces have liberated areas along the southern front line near Robotyne. Before the Russian invasion, nearly two-thirds of the country's exports and imports moved through Odessa's ports. It's a vital economic lifeline. The most important commodity of course is grain, but there are other materials as well. Odessa was also a thriving holiday destination. There are a few, if -- there are few, if any foreign tourists, but Ukrainians flocked back to these beaches this summer. And today, I found out how important that is for people who are trying to soothe their trauma and even for soldiers battling the physical and mental scars of war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voiceover): In the waning days of a second summer at war under the blazing Black Sea sun, you find, well, people at the beach. It's actually the first time some of this Odessa coastline has been open for business since the Russian invasion.

(END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (on camera): It is an important reminder of preserving the fabric of life even amidst war. Now, as we mentioned, Odessa is key to Ukraine's grain exports and all its exports, frankly. Over the weekend, Ukraine tested a second vessel through a temporary Black Sea corridor that it established since Russia pulled out of the U.N. grain deal last month. But Odessa is also a major historical site. With rich cultural history encompassing Russians, Jews, Ottomans as well as, of course, as Ukrainians. And the world was very shocked when Russian missiles badly damaged the historic Orthodox Cathedral. It's a UNESCO world heritage site. And our next guest, Nikolai Viknyansky, is an advisor to the mayor of Odessa. Welcome to our program. And look, first of all, comment on what's happening behind us. The sun has gone down.

But more likely, we have the governor, Ron DeSantis's of the world who wants to whitewash history. Ron DeSantis isn't the first person. Right after the civil war, when Lincoln was dead and Johnson was in office, and the south was supposed to pay, all of them get pardons. And they were pardoned not for the sin of slavery, they were pardoned for taking action against the union. And all of the great enslavers were forgiven without reckoning with their great sin. So, the best route to reconstructing America for those white folks was to erase memory of racial fracture in history. And unfortunately, that has continued to this day. We've denied the systemic basis of inequality. The banks are still messed up when it comes to giving black people loans. The housing crisis underscores the degree to which there are still rampant segregation there. When we look at education, two-tiered, three-tiered system that assigns people relatively inferior statuses. So, when you look across the board, African-American people continue to struggle as a result of systemic inequities that are deeply entrenched in American political life.",
