He fought to save American automakers, and the auto unions in 2008, 2009. And as President, he's presided over the strongest growth, in manufacturing, in decades. So, he's got a strong record.

Yesterday, in New Hampshire, 35 percent of all the Republicans said they would never vote for Trump, and that he only lost about 7 percent or 8 percent of Republicans against Biden. He can't lose 35 and win. So, it's not -- it's not a rational thing. So, I'm trying to think, as a strategist, what he's doing. And I think he's just scared. I'm not sure why. But he's -- something about strong women, Kaitlan, it scares him. I think we saw that when you did that Town Hall with him. COLLINS: Yes, but no comment on that. But what did you -- I mean, is that a legit argument, in your sense, that Haley clearly has a pool with moderates and with independents?

He'll be the first inmate, if this goes forward, ever put to death, by nitrogen hypoxia, essentially, the inhaling of pure nitrogen gas to the point of suffocation. His lawyers have objected, arguing that the state could botch the procedure, the way that it did with its failed attempt to execute Smith, by lethal injection, two years ago. He has spent more than two decades, on death row, for the 1988 killing of Elizabeth Sennett. Her husband, a pastor, hired Smith, and two other people, to kill his wife, for a $1,000 each. CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Alabama, covering this story. And Isabel, obviously, we've seen his attorneys pushing back. It's a method that's never been used before.
