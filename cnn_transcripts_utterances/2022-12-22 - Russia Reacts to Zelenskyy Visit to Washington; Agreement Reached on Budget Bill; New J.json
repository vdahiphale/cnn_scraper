You might want to reconsider. This is what it looks like trying to drive in Cheyenne, Wyoming, right now, where it was minus 42-degrees Fahrenheit this morning, zero visibility. Oh, and, by the way, parts of that state saw temps drop 70 degrees in just 18 hours. And take a look at this in Cambridge, Minnesota, just north of Minneapolis, as millions tried to hit the road for some of the busiest travel days of the year, officials warn that driving in parts of the Midwest, in particular, will become difficult to near impossible. And flying is an increasing wild card as well. Airlines have canceled at least 1,800 flights so far. Our CNN team is covering all the bases, but let's start with Derek Van Dam, who is tracking the latest from the Weather Center. Derek, we can't overstate the danger this storm is posing, can we?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we knew that this arctic blast was coming on, Ana. But when you start breaking all-time record low temperatures, like inCasper, Wyoming, negative-41 degrees, that was the outside air temperature overnight. That is a record that has stood for over 30 years. Your ears start to perk up, you really start to listen, and you know that this storm means business. I want to show you this important graph behind me. We tried to simplify it as much as possible. If you get windchill -- that's what it feels like on your exposed skin as you step outside -- negative-35, negative-45, it only takes roughly 10 minutes or five minutes or so to receive frostbite as you step outside into those conditions. Now I'm going to advance to the next graphic to show you how cold it got last night across Montana, South Dakota and other various places over the Western and Central U.S. You can do the math. That is exceeding that threshold for dangerous frostbite on exposed skin. Here's a current live picture. This is Jackson, Wyoming. Yes, there's blue skies, and many locations where it's coldest now have blue skies overhead. But it is deceiving. That sunshine is not going to warm you up. It is the windchill that is so dangerous with this system with windchill alerts stretching from Canada all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. And this isn't really talked about that frequently, but with these warnings extending all the way to places like Houston, Jackson, Birmingham, Dallas, you name it, these areas don't typically get this cold. So you have to put your house and your family into consideration to keep things like your pipe, safe, for instance, because temperatures are actually going to be below freezing for over three days in Jackson, Mississippi, over two days in Birmingham and Houston. You want to bundle up, but you also want to keep your pets safe and you want to keep your pipes from freezing as well. Look at this. You can see right where the cold front is located. I will draw it on this map. That is the dividing line between the milder air to the southeast and the cold, arctic air that's frankly dangerous. Oklahoma City, it is only three degrees right now, when you factor in the wind, negative-21, snowfall starting to pick up in intensity across the Great Lakes, blizzard conditions, deteriorating road conditions as well -- Ana.",

In fact, the FAA just imposed a ground delay program for flights leaving O'Hare here. The average delay now for flights on the ground, two-and-a-half-hours, according to the FAA. Look at the latest numbers from FlightAware. I just checked. We are up to 1,841 flights canceled nationwide so far today. The number keeps going up every time we refresh the page. Chicago O'Hare here is number one for cancellations. Denver is number two. Chicago Midway is number three. This is going to have a nationwide ripple effect, because Chicago O'Hare here is one of the biggest hubs for American Airlines, one of the biggest connecting airports for other airlines, the biggest hub for United Airlines. A quarter of all flights here have been canceled so far today. Now, I talked yesterday to United Airlines at its network operation center about how it's just trying to unravel this and make it so that these trips don't fall apart for fliers connecting here at Chicago O'Hare, rerouting them, scrambling to reroute them through some of the different hubs in United's network. The airline was frantically e-mailing passengers earlier this week, telling them they should simply rebook their flights and find earlier flights.
