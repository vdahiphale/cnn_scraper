But those are all the markets. It is a strong session. We'll put in some analysis as to why and the events of the day help us understand it. Europe is skirting a recession, barely making growth in Q4. In Paris, protests over pension reform bring the French capital to a standstill. And a fond farewell to the Queen of the Skies. Boeing has delivered its last 747 at the same time airlines are having, that's not it, by the way, that is the first one -- airlines are having second thoughts about the value of large jumbo jets. Live from New York, Tuesday, January 31st. Last day of January, gosh, where did it go? I am Richard Quest, and as we head towards February, I mean business. Good evening. Europe has narrowly avoided a recession. The Eurozone economy grew one- tenth of one percent, the smallest amount possible to avoid negative growth -- I suppose you can get zero -- in Q4 last year. There were expectations of negative growth. You can say mild weather and government support, cheaper fuel helped offset the effects of Russia's war in Ukraine. The conflict has led to fears of energy shortages and record inflation, and uncertain is best for how we can describe 2023, particularly as the ECB continues to raise rates. Anna Stewart is with me. Anna, I have always said there is very little -- I mean, people don't agree with me -- but there's very little difference between plus 0.1 point one and minus 0.1, other than the fact one is technically negative into a recession. It still feels horrible.",

Plus 0.1 percent for the last quarter, but good news it is and I suppose you can look to the ECB raising rates faster than many expected. You can look to that milder winter, energy prices coming down. There is a lot playing into it, I suppose. But interestingly, and there's a great JPMorgan note on this. One of the key factors for this growth is in fact Ireland's whose GDP last year according to some stats that came out yesterday, grew 12.2 percent in 2022. Why? Apparently, its manufacturing industry went gangbusters, which plays a very outsized role in the economy, utterly extraordinary. I'm sure people in Ireland who are feeling the cost of living crisis, like much of Europe probably aren't feeling that there -- Richard.",

It does look like inflation may have peaked last year in the third quarter.

Listen, big cost of living crisis, as you know, interest rates going higher, inflation over 10 percent, but also, I think with the UK, energy is a bigger issue here, in many ways less reliant, maybe on Russian gas than Europe, but more reliant on gas as an overall part of that energy mix. Brexit also exacerbated all of the supply chain issues, the labor shortages, the problems that the rest of Europe felt, and strikes and that is a product of the cost of living crisis and we got lots more tomorrow, Richard, so lots of days where there is less output in the UK.",

That is a slowdown from last year, and many downside risks areeasing, which is why there is a better position. China's reopening is one good point, it will lead to faster than expected recovery. And as Anna was outlining, in Europe, it's the mild winter, that's eased the fears of an energy crisis that has taken the heat -- pardon the pun -- out of fuel prices. In the US, inflation is falling as the labor market remains resilient and that in itself is a conundrum worthy of explanation. And so I spoke to the Chief Economist of the IMF, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, and he told me, serious risks remain, and yet they're not as bad as they were. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: This year, 2023 and next year, we're going to have relatively low growth numbers to start with.

So there has been this massive tightening. Now why has it been so resilient? Well one point is, well, I've already mentioned the labor market. We're coming out of the pandemic and the crisis of the last two years, and there is an enormous demand for labor. And that some of that demand is not yet met in the US, so we still have very elevated levels of vacancies. And then on top of that households have accumulated a lot of savings through this last two years, thanks to policy and also thanks to the precautionary behavior, and they're looking to spend some of that, so that is supporting the economy.",

Sogrowth is expected to bottom out, inflation is coming down. This year, it could be the year of the turning point and we are sort of holding our breath for this. Now, is it enough? Headline inflation is coming down, in large part because energy prices have been coming down in the last few months. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices has been more sticky. It has been coming down in the US, but certainly not in other parts of the world, and it is still very elevated. We're far from levels that would be consistent with Central Bank targets. So here, there is a need to sort of stay the course for Central Banks. It is not yet time to declare a victory and go home. There is a need to sort of maintain tight monetary policy conditions to make sure we get on a path towards a sustained reduction in inflation rate throughout the year and into next year.",

Boeing tried to breathe new life into the plane with the 747-8 Intercontinental. But only a few airlines bought it. The plane's days were numbered as more fuel efficient twinjets, 777's, A350s took over. Boeing announced the end of production and airlines like Singapore and United, with great ceremony, remove the jumbos from their fleet. My first 747 flight was Peoples Express in 1983 from Gatwick to New York. I now know that my last is in December 2019. British Airways, Heathrow to JFK. I've always loved that 747. I still take pictures of them when I see them at airports. It is been a three-decade love affair with the Queen of the Skies. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But as you say, to a lot of us aviation geeks, the real 747 was the -400. We haven't seen those in a while. The ones that are flying now, about 10 years old, the 747-800 or -8, as they say, we will see them for a while longer but its not as exciting to get on them anyways.",

We have to park these airplanes. And I think they got a little bit ahead of themselves as some airlines said, we will never fly them again. The economics weren't great, even before 2020. But now fast forward three years, everyone wants to fly. It is going to be a huge summer in Europe and the United States. And as you say, airlines need the lift. So the economics aren't great on the airplanes but if you fill them and if you use them in big airports, like London Heathrow and Frankfurt, they work. They work for an airline.

There are fewer maintenance people in areas of the world that can work on them. So you send a 747-400 maybe to Johannesburg and it breaks, and there's nobody around to fix it or there's no parts available. We saw this with the MD-80 in the United States. Sometimes it is just time for all these airplanes to get retired. The A380 is a different story; it is only 10-15 year old technology.",

Youknow, Richard, when you go to London, you don't want to wait for the big 500-seat airplane. You want the option to fly every single hour. The best way to do that is with smaller, more efficient airplanes. Then when I fly, if I don't want frequency, I want to fly nonstop. I don't want to switch planes, fly from L.A. to Tokyo and switch planes and go to Singapore, I want to fly from L.A. to Singapore, what they call a more thin route. That requires a smaller airplane. So big airplanes have fallen out of favor. But as you know, Richard, there are cycles in the industry. Things fall out of favor and then, one day, people wake up and they say, we need big again.",
