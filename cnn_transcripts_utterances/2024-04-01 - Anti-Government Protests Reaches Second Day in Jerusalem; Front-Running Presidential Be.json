The backlash against Barack Obama actually passing the ACA in a very polarized legislative debate helped Republicans win more seats in 2010 in the House than any party out of the White House since 1938. But when Republicans and Donald Trump tried to repeal the ACA in 2017, the politics flipped. Democrats shifted the focus from the parts of the law that are focused on expanding coverage for those without insurance to the parts of the law that protect people with pre- existing conditions who do have insurance. And since then, the law has been more popular than not. More Americans have said they want to they want to keep it in place, they want to repeal it. And you have the Republicans continuing to push down the road of repeal, as well as House Republicans talking about idea like converting Medicaid into a block grant and Medicare into a voucher.

You're looking at 4,000 tons of steel and concrete that are sitting on top of that bow. That is going to be the most complicated part of this operation, moving all of that debris and taking it off the ship so that they can begin this cleanup process. And then there's everything that's laying below the surface, the part that we can't see. There is more metal, more concrete, more debris in the water. And that's going to be critical because they have to be able to make that safe for the divers, whose mission is to get back into the water and continue searching to attempt to recover the bodies of those who were lost. But as we're sitting here, you know, now finally being able to really see it and get up close to it, you really just get a sense of the enormity of the job at hand. But all the officials here have told us that they are confident that they're going to be able to get it done. They're working together, have all of the technology necessary, and they're going step by step, taking a meticulous approach to make sure that they get it right and that eventually they can reopen the port, they can start rebuilding and that this important symbol for the city of Baltimore and the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland can get cleaned up and the people here can start getting back to normal.

We are taking these live pictures right now.And this is the bridge that collapsed when a cargo vessel crashed into it about a week ago. And the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it could take weeks for the port of Baltimore to reopen as crews clear the massive wreckage, leaving commuters and workers in limbo and supply chains in disarray. And we will have more on this coming up in the next hour of \"CNN Newsroom\". In U.S. college basketball's March Madness, the men's final four is set.

City going close in the first half of this game when their Dutch defender, Nathan Ackie, had getting on the end of a Kevin De Bruyne corner and he can't get a proper connection on it from close range there. After the break, it'll be former City player Gabriel Jesus who had the home fans concerned as he just failed to connect with the Bacayo soccer cross. And a strange one very near the end as City's Erling Haaland looks like he's in a great position to score, but somehow totally failing to make any sort of meaningful contact. Kind of summed up the game really. Both Spanish head coaches left to ponder a goalless draw at the full- time whistle. City had scored in 47 consecutive home league fixtures before this Sunday, but no breaking down the Gunners here.",
