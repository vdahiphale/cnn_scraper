A stage that will likely involve Ukrainian counter offensive they're saying even though temperatures are plunging and the ground is starting to freeze over that will actually help because they can get heavy equipment moving around much faster once the ground is completely frozen over.There was a new package of defense a just approved by the United States. In fact, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the U.S. President Joe Biden had a phone call where they talked about this package some $275 million, which is really a drop in the bucket when you look at the tens of billions in military aid. The United States has given Ukraine on the list including ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket systems. There's artillery rounds, unmanned aerial defense systems, counter air defense capability, ambulances, medical equipment, generators, field equipment, but not on that list patriots. Also not on the list these controversial cluster munitions warheads that the Ukrainians have been asking for. Max, raising a lot of questions about whether that's the right weapon in the year almost 2023 given the high chance for civilian casualties when you use those cluster bombs.

The allegation against him by Iran's authorities is that he stabbed to death two members of the Security Forces and wounded four others on November 17. Now I'm pointing out the date Max, because I want you to do the math with me here. On November 17, according to Iranian authorities, this incident takes place less than a month later. He is hung publicly facing an execution and that's exactly what rights groups are going to point to. They're going to say these are speedy sham trials with very little due process. They are unfair, they are unjust, and they are simply just another tactic by Iran's government to silence dissent. In fact, many demonstrators many protesters today already heralding this man as a hero as a sign of the bravery of those who've been taking out to the streets for almost three months now. Amnesty International in particular has been tracking these executions. They say Iran is pursuing the death penalty and 17 other cases 17 other individuals.

And it was the discovery of that fragment in that clothing that kind of led back to these Libyan intelligence agents. And interestingly, with this current suspect who's now in U.S. custody, the first suspect in this to be in U.S. custody Abu Agila Mohammad Masoud Kheir Al-Marimi. He goes by the court documents now by the name of Masoud. He was a Libyan Intelligence Agent for almost 40 years was responsible for bomb making, was detained in 2012, and questioned by Libyan law enforcement.

So it does appear that this has progressed forward and we don't know the details of it, but it does appear that it's progressed forward with the assistance of the Libyan government, because if this key witness, the law enforcement officer who took the testimony is to appear and make the case.

We're going to learn and of course, that's what's important for the family.
