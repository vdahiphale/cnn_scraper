And the markets closing moments ago, you hear the bell right there, after President Biden tried to reassure the American public that their money is safe. The president's remarks coming after two banks went under within a matter of day. Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on Friday. That's the biggest failure of a U.S. bank since 2008, and the government of the state of New York shut down Signature Bank last night, claiming that Signature was on the verge of collapse. The federal government has since taken over that bank. President Biden rushed out to the cameras this morning before the markets could open to try to calm the American people. He insisted there's no need for the public to worry, that their money is safe and that the economy will not suffer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The big banks for sure are well-capitalized.But take a look at some of the regional banks, sort of small to medium-sized banks. And, Jake, you can see a real sort of jitteriness among investors. I mean, First Republic closing down about 62 percent. Zions, we just lost it there. But PacWest, 21 percent. You know, these are not movements that we tend to see in stocks. These are really dramatic falls. And so, the concern with some of these regional banks is they could be facing some of the same risk factors that ultimately brought down SVB in terms of sitting on customer deposits that aren't fully insured by the FDIC, and also the interest rate risks that we know was at the heart of SVB's failure. Now, at the same time, Jake, I want to point your attention to the broader markets. The Nasdaq closed up. The S&amp;P was up about five minutes before we closed and closed lower fractionally. The reason why is because all of this, all of this news that we're getting about the fragility perhaps of the banking market making some investors feel like maybe this will help the Fed cool it on the rate hikes when we hear from the Fed next week.

And, frankly, Jake, that's exactly what I'm worried about here. I heard this today, that people are pulling their money out because they're worried their deposits won't be there when they need to go get them, when they need to make payroll, when they need to pay their bills. And you can't have a system that we go back to 2008, 2009, pre-Dodd- Frank where you have a few banks with the all the concentrated dollars in the country, and the regional and small and medium sized banks dying.

They were all actually merging and selling to the larger banks and you had no community banks left in this country. You need good community healthy banks for local businesses, and for families and for farms. You need that. It's really important.What happened in the Silicon Bank situation was their investments weren't smart, right? So they had put a ton of their money -- they had plenty of -- their balance sheet was strong, the ratios from their holdings were strong. The issue is they put so much of their money that had been deposited into longer term treasuries, and as interest rates went up, of course, the value of those treasuries went down. And then when everybody -- this is a classic run on the bank and everybody wanted their money out in a few hours, there wasn't enough money to give because they wanted it to so fast. So, the FDIC and OCC and other regulators in my opinion should have caught that. They should have said, wait a second, the asset mix here doesn't make sense. It's at risk. They're concentrated in a few industries like tech which has faced headwinds. So, to me, this was a matter of we should have had regulators on top of that. It brings the larger point now of making sure systematically, we don't have everyone running to banks -- I've heard a lot of people are lining up at other smaller banks in the country that have nothing to do with this saying, wait a minute, give me my money back, I'm going to put my money in bigger banks.
