I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And this breaking news this hour, as NASA is expected to give an update on the Boeing Starliner astronauts. Their 10-day mission, now in its 11th week after issues with the spacecraft kept them aboard the International Space Station longer than expected. CNN Space and Defense Correspondent Kristin Fisher is joining me right now. Kristin, so what are officials considering for this return?",

      "sentences": "So two big options, Fred. One, do they allow these two veteran NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to return on the vehicle that got them into space and to the International Space Station, Boeing Starliner spacecraft, the first time that this spacecraft has ever flown people. But it ran into some issues.So now they're considering the backup option. And the backup option is for those two astronauts to hitch a ride on Boeing's prime competitor SpaceX. SpaceX is Crew Dragon Capsule, but the catch there is Butch and Suni wouldn't be able to return to Earth until February of 2025. They'd be staying up at the International Space Station from what was supposed to be about an eight-day mission. That would be extended to about eight months. So, what these NASA officials are deciding right now with this flight readiness review has a huge impact on the astronauts themselves but also on the entire commercial crew program at NASA. The whole goal of this program was to have two different spacecrafts to allow NASA astronauts to get to and from the International Space Station in case something like this happened. So that's why you hear NASA saying that they don't like hearing the words stranded or stuck up in space, these two astronauts. They say that's because they do have this backup option, the SpaceX Crew Dragon, which is why the Commercial Crew Program was started to begin with. But you have to think that if this does not go the way that Boeing would like, it's going to be a huge black eye on this company and its reputation as one of NASA's prime partners here, Fred.",

So right now you have all of NASA's top leadership gathering to meet and make this decision. It's called a Flight Readiness Review. And you know, Fred, one of the things that's really been weighing on these NASA officials, and I know the NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, in particular, is some of the previous NASA tragedies that Senator Nelson was there for. Remember, he was an astronaut. He flew on the space shuttle. He was friends with the Challenger crew and the Columbia crew. He has always said that he is going to put the safety of these astronauts, Butch and Suni, front and center because he knows firsthand what happens when NASA leadership makes the wrong decisions and endangers these astronauts lives. So that is something that he has said that he's thinking about as he goes into this flight readiness review today.",

So clearly he is -- his case that he had a chance at the White House had been evaporating and this was an opportunity for him to extract some concessions from one of the two major party candidates.In this case, he has gotten himself some sort of role in a Trump administration overseeing a portfolio of health issues, which has been a priority of his. He talked a little bit as well about what finally allowed him to believe that an alliance with Donald Trump made sense. Take a listen to how he described his conversations with the former president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (I), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In a series of long, intense discussions, I was surprised to discover that we are aligned on many key issues. In those meetings, he suggested that we join forces as a unity party. We talked about Abraham Lincoln's team of rivals. That arrangement would allow us to disagree publicly and privately and furiously if need be on issues over which we differ while working together on the existential issues upon which we are in concordance.

This admission came just a few weeks ago. So he has a history that is going to be problematic and something that Trump is going to have to explain why he wants to align himself with.

So while they certainly probably didn't think they were going to be up at the International Space Station this long, in the back of your mind, they always knew that this was a possibility.And, you know, as the days and weeks have progressed, Fred, it did look increasingly likely like, these astronauts were going to go home on a different spacecraft, on SpaceX's Crew Dragon. So, not totally surprising, the decision here today, but still pretty shocking for this to happen on a first crewed test flight, have NASA decide that your spacecraft is no longer safe enough to bring these astronauts home. It really calls into question what is going to happen to Boeing and really this entire Starliner program. If you listen to what NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said, he said NASA has made mistakes in the past. We've lost two space shuttles, Columbia and Challenger, as a result of there not being a culture where people felt confident that they could raise their hands and say, hey, there's a problem here. We think this is not safe. So NASA really saying, look, we've learned from the lessons of the past Challenger and Columbia and we don't care what the chance was that these astronauts could get back safe, there is a risk, and it's just not a risk that they're willing to take. Fred, in the end, they said that it all came down to the thrusters. Those are these really tiny rocket motor engines that just kind of move the spacecraft from side to side, help it with docking, but help with this really critical maneuver. When the spacecraft is going to head back to Earth and reenter the Earth's atmosphere, those thrusters are what's used to orient the spacecraft in the right direction so that it is reentering the Earth's atmosphere with the heat shield facing forward. If those thrusters can't do that and get that spacecraft in the right position, those astronauts could burn up on reentry inside the Starliner spacecraft. That's what's at stake here. Something very similar is what happened in the Columbia accident when they lost that crew. So NASA Administrator Bill Nelson saying, hey, we took the safest, most cautious approach here today.
