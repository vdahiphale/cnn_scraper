This as we're learning new details about the Georgia investigation and what charge could be coming Trump's way.Plus, a Russian hardliner and former FSB officer under arrest after calling Putin a low life and a cowardly bum as Ukraine braces for a fifth night of missile strikes, pounding the same city over and over again. And 2024 Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie is OUTFRONT, not holding back about Trump's legal problems, Tim Scott being liked by more Republicans than he is and RFK Jr.'s conspiracy theories. All that ahead. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening, I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump's many days in court. The judge overseeing the former president's classified documents case now setting a date finally a date for that highly anticipated trial, and that date is May 20th, 2024. That, of course, is not what Trump had wanted. His lawyers wanted to postpone that criminal trial indefinitely or at least until after the election. Now, of course, it is possible the trial does get pushed back further. Trump could get his wish, but, for now, here we are with a May 20th date. Now add that into the packed court schedule that the former president faces. It's just pretty incredible. October 2nd, $250 million civil fraud case begins in New York. January 15, his second E. Jean Carroll civil defamation trial starts. March 25th is the date for his Manhattan hush money trial. And May 20th is the start for the classified documents trial in Florida. And, of course, you note that I did not even include a January 6th trial or a trial of the Georgia case, both of which, if charged, would be in that window likely as well. We already know Trump without that will be spending a lot of time in courtrooms during the primaries and Trump would win the nomination before the Mar-a-Lago case even gets to trial if he wins. I mean, keep in mind, back in 2016, he had secured enough delegates to officially become the party's nominee by the end of May. And now, they switched it, right? So, there's even more winner-take-all situations. Trump today is saying it would be very dangerous if he's sent to jail for mishandling top secret documents anyway. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

So, she's with me, along with Ryan Goodman, former special counsel at the Defense Department, and Margaret Hoover, the host of \"Firing Line\". I appreciate both of you, all of you taking the time, sorry, all three of you taking the time. Leslie, let me start with you. When you look at this, jack smith obviously the Mar-a-Lago case is his. He's got a big decision to make on January 6th. How do you think he perceives this date today coming in at May 20th? He also wanted to be much sooner than that, right, in December. How do you think he sees this in his chessboard here? LESLIE CALDWELL, FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL:  So I obviously don't know how he sees it, but how I would see it in his shoes is not a surprise. I think the government asked for the December day to signal that they were ready and this case could be tried. The preparation could be done and the case could be tried in that timeframe. I don't think they would be surprised that it slipped into 2024.",

They've got to leave it to may and he wants it later than the. Even to get May 20th to get the point. By May 20th, you've all had the voting of the primaries. How big of a setback is this for DOJ?",

I don't think a lot of bells are going off inside the DOJ, that there will be a reasonable pushback. But I do think they might still be very concerned that may 20th doesn't stick.There are ways in which this could be moved back in. Like you say, this is about classified information, there's a whole set of procedures. The judge announced a schedule. One would look at the schedule and there's even a narrow window in which the very last issues they will litigate will come up before the trial, 18 days before the trial. That could be appealed. That would shift the date back and back again. I think that is one concern that might be kind of watching for right now.",

There is actually a big break in March, forget about a Super Tuesday in March. That's going to happen in February and then other states later in April.So, you're right, Erin. This could be wrapped up in terms of the GOP nomination. Trump could have it all wrapped up, given how he leads in the polls, by the time the trial were to start, if it even did start in May. And that's the main point. If this gets pushed from May to June to July, however far it pushes, we could be in the throes of a nomination. You know, the nominating convention for the party, while the candidate is on -- is in court, and potentially even also the presidential election. Actually, the September and October time frame given what happens in the next indictment. So, in some ways, this may prevent the Republican Party from making another choice. I mean, there are two chances for the electorate to defeat Donald Trump. First for Republicans to defeat him in the primary. Second, for the general electorate to choose another candidate. And that really bears out in stark contrast, if you have a candidate, up for the race and that is on trial at the time. That is a very graphic visual for all of us to think about.",

The situation with a special military operation and the country in general is deplorable, to put it mildly, he said. This is a result of actions of the incumbent power.

Girkin was found guilty of mass murder in absentia by a Dutch court for involvement in the incident, which he has never acknowledged.
