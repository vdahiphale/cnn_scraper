He's being shown that trench that was dug out next to the train tracks there where the material was burned off. Also being shown how the water is being pumped out of the site. All of this happening as we are awaiting that preliminary report from the NTSB. That is due out sometime this morning. Already Ohio's lieutenant governor has spoken out about that report, saying, quote, once we get the report from the safety board, that information could be the basis for a criminal referral. I would encourage our Ohio team to take a look at that as soon as we get a chance. Also, the lieutenant governor saying that the rail company, Norfolk Southern, needs to do more from the residents here in East Palestine. And if that means temporarily relocating some of the residents here, so be it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. JON HUSTED (R-OH): Look, Norfolk Southern should temporarily relocate people if they feel unsafe living in their homes. I think that the railroad should consider buying property of people who may not feel safe or would want to relocate as a result of the spill. This is the railroad's responsibility. And it's up to the government officials at the federal, state and local levels to hold them accountable and do right by the citizens of East Palestine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That was right in the middle of the afternoon. So, over 100 and, what, 7 degrees difference. And today is going to be, again, a warm one in McAllen, cold in Minot, cold behind the snow. Record highs. Almost every little dot you see here would likely break a record high for today. Some of the records are extremely hard to break and others are not. The high today, 81 in Charlotte. That old record, 79, doesn't have a chance. Here's your snow across parts of the upper Midwest. The snow is moving away from Adrian, also moving away from Boston. Boston's problem is that when the sun sets tonight, the roads are going to be icy. Everything is going to refreezes tonight as temperatures go back down into the 20s, even though right now it's 33. The next storm system coming on shore in the Pacific. There will be a blizzard in LA County. Los Angeles County. Now, not really where all the people live up in the high elevations, it does get very high up there, Mount Baldy gets up well above 6,000 feet, I think. So this is the upper elevation snows.

Now, divided opinions from analysts on whether Moscow has the capabilities to do that, that is the fear and that is what Ukrainians are preparing for in regions around Kherson, in regions in the north around Kharkiv, civilians being told to stay home from work from today through to Saturday if they're concerned. Preparations being made about an possible increased attacks on those areas that have been so successfully taken back over the course of the last few months by Ukrainian forces in their counteroffensive.What we're hearing though this afternoon from Ukrainian officials is that - is that it is around that crucial city of Bakhmut that the situation remains the most tense with Russia having really increased the intensity of its offensive there, increasing the manpower, increasing the firepower, as they try to take a city that's become not really just as symbolic but as symbolic, rather, as it is important militarily as they try and push through to what Ukraine believes their objective is, which would be to take the whole of the Donbas region over the coming weeks. Ukraine determined not to do that, managing to hold Bakhmut for the time being and saying that they believe that Russia has also been leading more attacks across the northern border to try and keep as many Ukrainian troops as they can tied up to prevent them trying to make any progress anywhere along that front. That is the situation this afternoon. But it is really ahead to tomorrow's date that everyone looks slightly fearful about what might happen. But, again, a great deal of doubt about whether or not Moscow can achieve that objective of carrying out any symbolic strike at all. More western support as well. Today we've had the visit from the Spanish prime minister following hot off the heels of Joe Biden, of course, on Monday. And it is, therefore, more support, a tangible effort to show that unity behind Kyiv as we head into this anniversary, Jim and Kristin. And also that watchful vigilance really that we're seeing on the part of the Ukrainians. Also very much present in the mind of the western allies as we look ahead to what may happen tomorrow and in the coming days.",

He wants to, you know, put his mark on history by incorporating Ukraine into an enlarged Russian empire.But it is also about going further. I mean that has been what he has done over his 20 plus years in power. That's what he said he wants to do. I mean just on Tuesday, in his address to the Russian people, he talked - he talked about historically Russian lands, which is code not just for Ukraine but for further west. We need to believe him when he says things like this. And I think from an American perspective it is far better for us to help Ukraine as much as we can, as fast as we can, so that they are victorious in pushing Russia back from Ukrainian lands and that Russia understands that this is not the way to go in the international system so that we don't have to confront Russia at some later point at a time and a place that may not be to our advantage.",
