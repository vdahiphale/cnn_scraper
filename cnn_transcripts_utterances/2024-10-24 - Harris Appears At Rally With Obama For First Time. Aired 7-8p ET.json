Plus, Trump slammed Taylor Swift for endorsing Kamala Harris and warned Swift's popularity would take a hit. Is he right? Some staggering new numbers. And inside one of the ugliest Senate races in America where a Democrat is hanging onto her seat by a thread or opponents ads against her targeting her for being gay. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Kamala Harris and Barack Obama about to take the stage together for the first time this campaign. The vice president and the former president will be at a rally in Georgia. Crucial state where new polling today shows the race tied at 49 percent, already at that rally, Bruce Springsteen calling for glory days ahead, taking the stage moments ago. Springsteen, not the only major musical star hitting the trail for Harris, although of course, moving for anyone to hear him play like that. Earlier today, Harris said this about Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have a choice of a Donald Trump who will sit in the Oval Office, stewing, plotting revenge, retribution, writing out his enemies list. Or what I will be doing, which is responding to folks like the folks last night with a to-do list, understanding the need to work on, lifting up the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You'll get voters from the beds, from the couches, from their workplace. You're trying to get them to the voting booth. And so when you have star power tonight on, you can't even asleep on Raphael Warnock, but Bruce Springsteen, when you have Barack Obama, when you have this litany of celebrities who are coming out urging you to go out to vote, that energy is palpable.And we know, and we've seen it before that you can win Georgia, the person who's won Georgia in recent history the most has been somebody like Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and even Joe Biden. And so this energy in this particular place, in Atlanta, in Clarkston, right outside of Atlanta is huge. I mean, look, look at this. Let's juxtapose Barack Obama, Bruce Springsteen, Raphael Warnock, and Kamala Harris next to the fact that over the past two decades, three decades, there has been no one who's run for president or vice president who has endorsed Donald Trump save for Sarah Palin.

So does it make a difference? LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think and I have said that Michelle Obama actually, I think does bring some real star power she inspires and motivates specifically women and especially the women of color. They have a real affinity with her. I mean, we did see, for example, Oprah Winfrey really move numbers when she endorsed Barack Obama back in the day. And I think she brings that kind of sort of emotional connection. But this lineup, I actually do agree with David here. I think it's a lovely concert.

In Georgia, they're doing activation events at Morehouse and Spelman this weekend for homecoming, where 30,000 people will be in. So look, I get it. We've seen the Bloomberg poll where she's popped on the economy. We've seen \"The Wall Street Journal\" poll about favorability, this, that, or the third. That's not where the campaign is.

That's not including the 10 to 12 percent of Republicans she's probably going to win in that state. And so, when you're banking those votes, you're actually talking about metrics that matter.

He likes to use these repetitive words. So, those words get into peoples psyche. On the Harris side, you're seeing a different message, also negative. This man cannot be trusted. He is a -- he is a threat to democracy. He is fascist. He is dangerous. So the closing messages from both campaigns are actually very similar.

So, Lulu, right, the context here, Kristen talking about it now, when Trump is on the stage talking about garbage can of the world when he's referencing the number of migrants who have come into the United States over the past years, do -- does rhetoric like that at this point? Does it motivate anybody? Does it -- I mean for or against? I mean, does it move the needle? GARCIA-NAVARRO:  I mean, I think Donald Trumps pitch is that this country is in a terrible state and, you know, the darker, the better because that benefits him. But I mean, moving aside from just the rhetoric, what I'm interested in are the policies. I mean, there was a very important article today in \"The New York Times\", where they interviewed Stephen Miller. You might remember him from the first Trump administration, who was the architect of many of former President Trump's harshest immigration policies. And he basically detailed what they're planning for a next Trump administration and some people have called this sort of a xenophobic fever dream. It is mass camps, huge which deportations of millions of people here illegally in this country who might have strong ties, who are not necessarily criminals, definitely deporting people like the Dreamers, DACA recipients who were brought into this country legally as children and have been vetted and have been given permission to stay and work. Some of them in the military. I mean, these are very, very dramatic and draconian ideas about what is going to happen in a second, Trump administration. And I think those are the things that are you know, reporting and should be getting scrutiny because if Trump indeed becomes president again what we saw in the first Trump administration isn't necessarily what's going to happen the second Trump administration, they've had time to plan, they have real very strong ideas about what should happen next. And it is indeed a very, very draconian.",

This is this isn't something that's easily done because it is happening but over a series of administrations in years, it could take a series of administrations to get it started and get this country turned around.I say what Donald Trump's talking about, what Stephen Miller talking about, what Americans want to see, they want to see a secure border. They want to see legal immigration. They want to see people who break the law. GARCIA-NAVARRO:  But, David, I mean, Stephen Miller who is going to have a central role in this administration was talking very openly. In fact, I urge everyone to go read the article just about, you know, kind of redoing birthright citizenship. The idea that people could, because they-re born in this country, they have the right to be citizens bringing back the Muslim ban. All these things that really are what were tried in the first administration. They were overturned by the courts, and now they've had years to think about how to do it properly and they're going to try it again. And so, you may like that and embrace it, but don't pretend that it's not going to happen. Stephen Miller basically promised that it would -- that it was. I mean, you might think it's a good idea and there are many might embrace it, but understand that it is something that they are planning.",
