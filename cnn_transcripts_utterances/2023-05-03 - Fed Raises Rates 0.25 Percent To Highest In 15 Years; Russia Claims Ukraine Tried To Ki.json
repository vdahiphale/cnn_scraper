It has of course been Fed Day today and that has given the market -- you could see. I mean, talk about up down. They can't really decide where it wants to go. And we'll get into the reasons why the market is betwixt and between as we went on the way through our program tonight. Those are the markets, the things that we'll be talking about tonight. The Fed signals perhaps a pause in rate rises, future decisions will be made meeting by meeting. There is no general trend ahead. President Zelenskyy denies an assassination attempt on Russia's President Putin. Meanwhile, Russia claims the drone strike on the Kremlin overnight. You see the pictures, we will talk about it. And here in Hungary, the Parliament has passed judicial reforms. Will it be enough to unlock EU funds? I will put that to the foreign minister along with a host of other questions as we went our way through the program. We are live in Budapest tonight. It is Wednesday. It is May 3rd. I'm Richard Quest, and of course, in the Hungarian capital, I mean business. Good evening from Budapest. It is delightful to be here this evening. The weather has been beautiful over the last few days. And I'm hopeful, fingers crossed that it's going to not rain before the end of the hour. We are in Hungary because this country stands at the crossroads of so many issues in Europe and the world today. In the crossroads of Ukraine, Russia, and Western Europe, and it is caught up in many of the region's most bitter dispute, and seemingly, it does not seem to pull back from wanting to get involved and arguably throw petrol on the flames. Tonight, the foreign minister of Hungary is with me. We'll be talking face- to-face, nicely, that is down the line. The chief executive of the country and one of Europe's largest airlines, Wizz, is with me. And the former Central Bank governor, Peter Akos Bod is with me to talk about the issue of inflation. You'll hear why in a moment. In Washington, the Fed has raised interest rates by a quarter of a percent. That's where we must start tonight. It is the highest level in 15 years. You've got to go back to before the great financial crisis before you can find these rates. It is the tenth straight hike. And from the Fed statement, it could be the last for a while. The Fed Chair is speaking now after the decision and Jerome Powell has told reporters that the last meeting, the anticipated firming. Now, there's been a change in the statement, as he made clear.

As you and I have talked about, Richard in the past, that is essentially the equivalent of a rate hike. The pullback and tightening that we're likely going to see from some of these banks, the small, medium-sized banks, perhaps even some of the larger banks. And so I think the reality is, is we still don't know what the impact of that will truly be on the economy.

Russia claims that Ukraine tried to assassinate President Putin by using drones to attack the Kremlin. Now, the video has been shared by Russian state media. It appears to show two separate drone attacks within minutes. The first exploded over the Senate Palace and starting a fire on the roof. The second drone appeared to explode in the air. Moscow claimed Ukraine unsuccessfully made an attempt on the President's life, which would have been somewhat of an achievement since he wasn't even in the building. It hasn't given any evidence to support the accusations. On a state visit to Finland, President Zelenskyy denied that Ukraine had anything to do with it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that the state media, certain commentators in state media -- really hard, tough. commentators on state media, who have already over the months, been calling for President Putin to ratchet up his war in Ukraine and finish off the Ukrainians. It is embarrassing to say the least for the Kremlin that these drones should get so close to the heart of government. It's so close to a place that's going to be the focus of the country for the Victory Day Parade in just a couple of days, which commemorate the huge losses, tens of millions of Russians lost in the Second World War. So a humiliation and their response is, this was an attack on the president. So will there be a reaction and what will that reaction be?

Now in Atlanta, in Georgia, in the United States, there is a gunman that is on the loose. The police have identified a 24-year-old person, Deion Patterson, considered armed and dangerous who opened fire at a medical building. A person has been killed and four people have been injured. The police are actively searching and are warning the public, do not approach and call the emergency services. And another dreadful shooting, this time in Belgrade, in Serbia at an elementary school, if you will. Eight children and a security guard were murdered. I mean, it couldn't get worse. The 13-year-old suspect is now in custody. Yes, you heard me right, 13-year-old suspect. His parents also are under arrest. CNN's Scott McLean reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Handcuffed with a jacket over his head, a teenager is whisked away by police. He is the suspect in a mass shooting that's brought Serbia to a standstill. The 13-year-old was accused of using his father's handguns to kill at least eight children and a school security guard at a renowned elementary school in an upscale part of Belgrade. Serbia's interior minister says the boy had the code to the safe where his father locked the weapons. In the immediate aftermath, worried parents rushed to the school anxiously waiting for news their kids were okay. The ones who do emerge are shellshocked or overwhelmed. Some parents were called their children seeing the attack right in front of their eyes. ASTRID MERLINI, MOTHER OF BELGRADE ATTACK SURVIVOR (through translator): \tShe heard shots before that, but thought those were firecrackers. When she saw the security guard fall, she immediately rushed back to class. She was scared. She told her teacher there is a shooting upstairs. MCLEAN (voice over): Police and ambulances quickly rushed to the scene to treat victims. Six students and a teacher were taken to the hospital, some in stable condition, others fighting for their lives. DR. SINIAA DUCIC, CARETAKER DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY CHILDREN'S CLINIC TIRSOVA (through translator): It is very difficult surgery because of the severe brain injuries. The child is out of operation room and is vitally endangered and it is in an intensive care units. Always, station procedures are performed. MCLEAN (voice over): Belgrade Police said the teenager waited to be arrested in the school yard after calling police himself to confess what he had done. VESELIN MILIC, BELGRADE POLICE CHIEF (through translator): Upon arriving at school, he immediately pulled the pistol out of his bag and shot DB (ph), the security guard. He then went past the on-duty staff member and sat down at his desk like he did nothing wrong. MCLEAN (voice over): Despite one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, mass shootings in Serbia are rare. Police said the attack had been carefully plotted for more than a month. While the precise motive is unclear, the education minister and this high school student blamed violent video games and media. LUKA, STUDENT AT NEARBY HIGH SCHOOL (through translator): This demonization and popularization of violence and crime through public and media, through art, through everything that can popularize it and this example of violence is a consequence of that. MCLEAN (voice over): Police have cordoned off the scene and continue to investigate. And while answers may bring clarity for families, they won't bring back the young lives taken far too soon.

And the U.S. is even considering sanctions over corruption. There's a whole raft of issues. The government, of course, is dominated by one man, the prime minister. He's been in power, this time, since 2010, Viktor Orban. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) QUEST (voice-over):  Europe's longest serving leader is now one of the biggest thorns in its side. Since he reclaimed power in 2010, Viktor Orban has ruffled feathers in Brussels. His stance on issues, like the separation of powers, has made him both powerful and lonely in Europe. The former European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, once humorously said to his face what many of the leaders were thinking behind his back. JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  The dictator is coming. Dictator. QUEST (voice-over):  But the whole issue has got a great deal more serious since Russia invaded Ukraine. The divides have gotten deeper. Viktor Orban has become the closest thing Russia has to an ally in NATO and the E.U. He's refusing to let Western weapons pass through Hungary on the way to Ukraine or indeed, allowing overflight of weapons. And even though Hungary has ultimately agreed to all the E.U. sanctions packages against Russia, he's done so often begrudgingly. He dropped his opposition to an oil embargo only after securing exemptions for Hungary. It is a far cry from the early days of Orban's career, when he stood in Heroes' Square in Budapest and called for the Soviet army to leave Hungary. Now he's seeking to export his brand of conservatism abroad. He spoke at the American Conservative Political Action Committee, CPAC, in Texas, last August.",
