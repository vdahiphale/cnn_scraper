      "sentences": "Deterrence without escalation. That's the goal. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.On Friday, the U.S. conducted major retaliatory airstrikes on Iraq and Syria, the start of what the U.S. military says will likely be a series of larger scale strikes on Iranian backed militias who have carried out attacks on U.S. troops in the Middle East. Airstrikes hit more than 85 targets according to U.S. Central Command including command and control operations centers, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles and unmanned aerial vehicle storage. The move came in response to a drone strike by Iran backed militants on a U.S. military outpost in Jordan on Sunday that killed three U.S. Service Members and wounded more than 40 others. The strikes began only about an hour after President Biden attended the dignified transfer of their remains at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Officials said the timing was coincidental but symbolic of the gravity of his decision. Iraqi officials say at least 16 people were killed in those strikes and condemned the attacks as quote, \"A flagrant violation of Iraqi sovereignty.\" Iraq has summoned the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Baghdad quote, \"To deliver an official protest note regarding the American aggression.\" The Syrian military says the attacks caused, quote, \"Significant damage to public and private property, killing civilians as well as military personnel.\" CNN cannot independently verify those claims. A senior Administration official confirmed to CNN that the U.S. will not strike inside Iran itself, which would constitute a huge escalation. But President Biden says such response will continue for the attacks that have been rampant in the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict on October 7. Lieutenant General David Deptula joins me now. He was the Air Force's first chief of intelligence surveillance, and reconnaissance. He was the principal attack planner for Operation Desert Storm's air campaign, and commander of no fly operations over Iraq in the 1990s. He's now the dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace studies. General Deptula, nice to have you back. The attack against the U.S. was Sunday, the response didn't come until Friday. Did it take too long? LT. GEN. DAVID DEPTULA, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Well, Michael, it's good question. There are a variety of different reasons that go into the timing of an attack, we understand that weather it was one of them. But the bottom line in the fact of the matter is that any kind of additional time that you give an adversary after a significant event like this allows them to prepare. But what I would say is that --",

However, remember, part of the rationale for the attacks, in addition to be retaliation for killing U.S. personnel is to reduce the Iranian backed militia capabilities in capacity. And that certainly was achieved. So, what I tell you is, the airstrikes yesterday were an appropriate response regardless of their timing, and it's good to hear the other part of this is they're simply the first part of a series of operations that are going to continue to degrade Iranian militias attacking U.S. forces.

You've heard the administration say that, you know, they don't want a wider war. Well, the fact of the matter is, to deter a wider war you don't do that by saying that you don't want one or that you won't strike inside Iran. But by making sure that Iran who is behind the majority of the aggression in the region understands that if they in their proxies continue attacks on U.S. personnel, that they can then expect disastrous consequences. Deterrence, Michael, is achieved by instilling in the minds of the Iranian leadership or other adversaries sufficient uncertainty of achieving their objectives, such that they decide not to continue their attacks due to the potential consequences. So attacks on U.S. forces in the region won't stop until Iran understands that their critical interests are at stake.",

That's the way things are starting to look.On Friday, Judge Tanya Chutkan indefinitely delayed the trial date of Jack Smith's federal January 6 related prosecution until the appeals about Trump's immunity are decided. The federal Mar-a-Lago case theoretically set for May 20, but consensus is that date will not hold. Meanwhile, Alvin Bragg's prosecution of Trump for covering up the sex scandal is still on the calendar for March 25. And then there's the question of D.A. Fani Willis' election interference case in Georgia, which Willis had asked to start on August 5, and that was before the defendants demanded that she stepped down from the case. On Friday, Willis filed a 176 page response to the challenge. Willis' critics allege she's in a romantic relationship with the lead special prosecutor that she appointed, Nathan Wade, who they say was under qualified and has billed the state for more than $650,000 in fees since 2021. And that Wade took Willis on vacations using the money that he was paid. The other two special prosecutors hired by Willis were paid approximately $73,000 and $91,000, they were not in the lead position and as such would not work as many billable hours. The judge had scheduled a February 15 hearing on the matter. Willis, Wade and some of their colleagues could be forced to testify. But in the court filing on Friday, Willis while admitting to a personal relationship that she says started after Wade had been hired, she called the claims against her meritless and salacious in pursuit of media attention, and argues that the hearing isn't necessary and ought to be canceled. Quote, \"The motions attempt to cobble together entirely unremarkable circumstances of a Special Prosecutor Wade's appointment with completely irrelevant allegations about his personal family life into a manufactured conflict of interest on the part of the district attorney. The effort must fail. Is she right? Joining me now is Clark Cunningham, Professor of Law at Georgia State University where he's the chair of law and ethics. Professor, thank you for being here. She acknowledged the relationship. Said it began after his hiring. To those who say, hey, it's the behavior of consenting adults. It's not our business, you would say what?",

There is no claim in that affidavit or motion that she reimbursed him for 50 percent of that trip. Rather, they -- he seems to be making, the base seem to be making this rather strange claim that they sort of take turns paying for trips.Well, that's very strange. So, you're a public official, a private contractor takes you out a luxury trip to Aruba and you don't reimburse your share of it. You say, I'll pay for the next trip to the Caribbean.

So she wants him to make money. And that, you could just stop right there. That's a problem.But that she directly benefits from his wealth, because he takes her on lavish vacations.

So, we used regional variation in the popularity of Oprah's magazine and her book club to identify where she was particularly popular and then use that to estimate her effect on the vote there. It is important to note it's a little bit different here that this is the general election, not a primary. You know, President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton were very similar candidates in terms of their policies. Here they're very different, President Biden and former President Trump. And so, this is more about getting people enthusiastic to come out to the poll. So, your points on data, if she did do events, Oprah did a bunch of events for Obama.

Very little happened until 2012, and then depression and anxiety and loneliness go through the roof.So that explanation around independence, it is true that teens now, compared to previous generations, are less likely to get their driver's license by the end of high school, they're less likely to date, they're less likely to have a paid job, they go out without their parents a lot less than previous generations did when they were in high school.
