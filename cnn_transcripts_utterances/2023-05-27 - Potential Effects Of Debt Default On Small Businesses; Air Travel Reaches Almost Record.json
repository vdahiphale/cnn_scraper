The new date to avoid the first ever debt default in the United States if Congress and the White House cannot agree on a deal to raise the national debt limit which now stands at $31.4 trillion. The default could have drastic economic ramifications in the United States and around the world, and it starts with getting a deal between Speaker McCarthy, his top allies, and the White House.And at the moment, there is no deal yet. They are very close to one, though. They've been negotiating furiously for days, late into the night, as they've horse traded on a whole wide range of issues. And as Republicans have pushed for spending cuts to be attached to any piece of legislation to raise the national debt limit. There are indications the White House is moving closer to the Republicans' position on that. And there are also some indications that the Republicans are giving a little bit more to the White House on how long to extend the national debt limit for. The White House wants it done through the 2024 elections. Republicans initially proposed to do it just for one year so they can get back and have this fight again next year. The White House does not want to have this fight again. It appears that Republicans are -- would allow for a two-year debt limit increase. There are other major sticking points as well, including over the issue of work requirements. That means actual -- for social safety net programs. What Republicans want to impose on programs like food stamps, new work requirements for those beneficiaries. Democrats believe those -- that push will hurt needy families and it could be detrimental to a lot of people who rely on that for their nutrition and for their daily lives. But all the negotiation as part of the discussion now going forward and as Garret Graves, one of the top negotiators told me earlier in the day, that he will insist on work requirements to be part of any deal. REP. GARRET GRAVES (R-LOUISIANA): Democrats right now are willing to default on a debt so they can continue making welfare payments for people that area refusing to work. And I'm talking about people that are without dependents, people that are able-bodied between 18 and 55. And that's crazy to me that we're even having this debate today.",

Well, I think we've also -- already seen some damage done. I mean, global leadership is always fragile, it's always tentative, and it's built on interest and perception. Is it in the interest, for example, of another country to follow our lead? And do they believe -- do they have faith that we have the capacity to actually lead and to execute? It's not automatic. It has to be earned, and has to be earned every day. And a global superpower has to demonstrate that.

      "sentences": "The Vatican said early Friday afternoon that Pope Francis had a fever and therefore didn't have any meetings in the morning on Friday. A few hours later, the cardinal secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, told journalists at the sidelines of a conference that the pope was tired, that he had a particularly intense day on Thursday.And that speaks to one of the issues here which is that Pope Francis keeps up a very grueling schedule at the Vatican. Meeting groups from about 9:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the afternoon, nearly every day. Often giving speeches to those groups and trying to meet each of those people individually. Francis is 86 years old. He was hospitalized in March for bronchitis. So, obviously a fever is concerning. The pope also has a mobility issue, which we have seen, that compounds his health issues. He has a problem with his knee, which has made him use a wheelchair for some time now. His knee has gotten a bit better, he's able to stand and walk a bit, but still obviously not getting that, kind of, brisk exercise which would be important to keep his health up. Now, the pope does have a busy schedule as well this coming weekend. On Saturday, he has meetings as well as a big mass on Sunday for Pentecost. And on Monday he's due to meet the Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Vatican. So, we will be monitoring the situation, of course, and bring you updates as we get them.

I'm Paula Newton. And you are watching CNN NEWSROOM. More now on our top story, the White House and Republican negotiators are closing in on a deal to avert a financial catastrophe. We're told an agreement to raise the debt ceiling could be reached as soon as today, any deal would then need to be passed by both houses of Congress before June 5th. That's the date the U.S. is expected to run out of money to pay its bills. Florida governor and newly minted Republican presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis, is taking the gloves off when he speaks about his rival, Former President Donald Trump. DeSantis' campaign raised just over $8 million in its first 24 hours despite the glitch-filled announcement on Twitter on Wednesday. Since then, DeSantis has been swinging hard at Trump in a series of interviews. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He understands I've got a good chance to beat him, because he doesn't criticize anybody else now. It's only me. They know I'm more likely to win the election. I mean, for him to say that we're not winning in Florida, no one has taken a state from being a swing state four and a half years ago to now being a red state in such a dramatic fashion.

And thanks for being here with us again. As we continue to watch spring, and now, going into summer very soon, it's all unfolding in Ukraine, the weather's good, the ground is hard. And this conflict is hitting a new more menacing stride, I would call it. We looked at that attack on that medical facility. I mean, do you fear that we will start to see more of this, certainly a more ferocious battle, and, again, more of those civilian targets? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: We will see quite a bit of these attacks. I think it's, you know, part of the Russian playbook. I think the Russians are going to be intensifying their attacks on the civilian infrastructure, and I think it's going to be something that will probably go in waves. You'll see, you know, facilities like the medical facility of Dnipro, you will see, perhaps, it moving to, once again, the power supply and perhaps other installations. So, there are going to be some waves that the Russians will mount. They're going to go in and try to disrupt any preparations that the Ukrainians have for a counteroffensive.",

Of course, you know, you look at it from the standpoint of the Ukrainians and the capabilities that they have, and, you know, that's probably, at least in their minds, the only thing that they can do. But if they can overcome that and if they can actually have an area where they can move forward quickly with lightning speed, that would definitely be to their advantage, and it's something that, you know, as far as the RUSI report is concerned, I think there's some very interesting elements to that, in particular what struck me were the intelligence aspects of this, such as the ability of the Russians to intercept Ukrainian tactical communications, and not only to intercept them but to decrypt them.That could be a game changer, potentially, if they can use the intelligence that they gained from that to their advantage.

On the other hand, you have a lot of members of Congress saying that they absolutely want to continue aid to Ukraine for as long as it takes. Basically, adopting the Biden administration.So, with these factors, you know, have to play into Zelenskyy's calculations. And I think Zelenskyy is looking at this, you know, he definitely realizes that he has a clock that he has to beat in this case. And the more territory that he can gain, the better off he's going to be, and that is, I think, what the real goal is here.
