I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 6 pm. Some breaking news in the last hour, Slovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, has been shot at after a government meeting. And we will be monitoring the story and bring you more in just a few moments. First up, the other headlines this hour. Russia's new offensive in Kharkiv gathers pace as more and more Ukrainian villages fall amid heavy fighting. That is, as U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken says weapons and ammunition are being rushed to the front lines. War also intensifying here in the Middle East. The IDF has hit a refugee camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip, saying it killed 10 Hamas militants in the process after targeting a, quote, \"war room\" inside a U.N.-operated school, they say. And a manhunt is underway in France for the gunman who ambushed a prison convoy, freeing an inmate and killing two guards in the process. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

We can identify the location because we've seen some of these images from different angles before. But this is a new image. And what you can see in this image is someone who appears to be the prime minister, being sort of lift-carried, raced and run several yards into his waiting vehicle by security services. Those men you can see the center of the picture there. We have video from -- taken, I would say, from the left of the image, you're looking at there, that would show some of those security officials picking up a man and moving him. You can see his legs sort of working underneath him. But he is clearly not moving under his own motion. He is clearly being held by the security services. And then we understand he was taken to the hospital in this town. And you're seeing images of the hospital there. And we've now been hearing -- and this is being reported by Reuters, quoting the hospital spokesperson at the hospital, the prime minister was initially taken to. And they say that he arrived there conscious, that they have stabilized his wounds -- and they say wounds, gunshot wounds. And they say that he has now been traveled to a -- transferred to a higher level facility. And we understand he is being taken to that higher level facility by an air ambulance. A helicopter has been dispatched by the main medical services in Slovakia. And he is being taken. Now we don't know where he is being taken but to a higher level medical service. So conscious when he arrived at the hospital; injuries stabilized and then transferred on for higher level care. We can't read too much into that but, again, I think it would be likely if he were at a hospital and he was in a desperate condition. They probably would have tried to provide longer-term service. But the fact that this has happened very quickly and moved out to higher level care, again, we don't know what this means. I mean, stabilize can mean many, many different things.

Well, in what could shape up to be a pivotal battle in Ukraine, Russian forces appear to be pushing further south into the Kharkiv region. The U.S. is rushing weapons to the front lines, according to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who also announced new military funding. That help is desperately needed. Ukraine is repositioning forces in Kharkiv as Russia tries to build on its momentum from last week's offensive. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy meantime is putting foreign travel on a hold to deal with the crisis. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen has reported extensively, of course, on the ground in Ukraine these past couple of years and, indeed, before that. He joins us from Berlin. And Fred, this is a critical point in the war. Clearly Ukraine needs all the help it can get. And Antony Blinken there to at least reassure them that help is on the way. What are they looking for and how might this reassurance help at this point? When can they expect to see the sort of weapons they need to get on the front foot at this point?",

The IDF says it targeted what it calls a war room operating inside a U.N.-operated school, killing more than 10 militants. Gaza health officials say, 3 dozen Palestinian civilians were killed in strikes in the area. Half of them they say, were children. Well, this increased activity is happening as the United Nations says 450,000 displaced Palestinians, nearly 0.5 million, that Israel ordered to leave Rafah are now located in areas that lack shelter, water and proper plumbing. Well, in Washington, the Biden administration has started what could be a lengthy process to get congressional approval for a new $1 billion arms deal for Israel after President Biden, of course, paused a shipment of large bombs due to their use in densely populated areas of Gaza. And his concern about them being used on population centers in Rafah. Will still to come, a key economic report out this morning provides a hint of hope for American consumers.

He's someone who has an affinity for Vladimir Putin, has always sort of sounded very sort of against the arming of Ukraine, is -- has had tough lines to say about immigration and also about Muslims in general. This is a figure who's not without controversy, either, broadly politically in the European Union. You have prime ministers like Mark Rutte; you have Ursula van der Leyen, immediately, very quickly coming out to wish him well and saying that this was a terrible and shocking attack. So he is not without friends in the European political spectrum. But he is something of an outlier because he has courted the populist vote. He has been closer to Putin than he has to some of his European allies and has been against sending weapons to Ukraine. But when he won the elections in September last year, it was not -- was not a -- it was not by a small margin, not massive, it's 150-seat parliament. He won by 79 votes. He cobbled together a coalition, involving -- and I think this was sort of talked about a lot at the time -- that it involved some sort of quite right wing elements at the time, as well as sort of more centrist politicians as well. But he's, as I say, something of a political outlier in the European spectrum. But this is something that is not usual. I mean, this goes without saying, it's not usual within Slovak that politics for politicians, never mind the prime minister, to be shot as he -- as he leaves a meeting. But for the nation, this is a very shocking situation. We've heard from the president, we've heard from the vice president as well, both talking about the shock, about wishing the prime minister well. And it seems to be at the moment, until we get a further medical update and a better analysis of a situation, this is potentially a life and death situation, these minutes we're living in right now for the Slovak prime minister. It's a life-threatening condition. Hit multiple times. It appears to have been a single assailant. We don't know if he was shot with a handgun, with an automatic weapon, what type of automatic weapon, how close, how many bullets. But the video you see the prime minister being sort of manhandled, bundled into his waiting black limousine there, is -- you can sort of see the -- his feet moving at the bottom of the picture. But it's very clear that the heavy lifting is being done by a security detail, literally bundling him and then to that -- to that waiting car to be rushed away to hospital.",

Rather than transfer him to Bratislava, which was just decided it was too far away, even by helicopter, they transferred him to Banska Bystrica, which is about probably 30 kilometers away. So a pretty fast journey in a helicopter. The fact that the medical services have on passed him to this high a level facility and didn't try and on pass him to a facility in the capital, does seem to indicate just how dire his condition may be; life-threatening is what we're being told. But this does -- this seems to be a pretty dark picture of what is happening here, emerging, Becky, I mean, he came out of the meeting about 2:30 in the afternoon local time there in Handlova in Slovakia. He appears to have been shot right outside that building. And you see the assailant tackled to the ground. And as the assailant is lying there on the floor and the prime minister, we've seen another video, being sort of hand -- manhandled into that black vehicle there by security services, to get him away, I mean, all this transpired in a very small space. And we're told it was multiple gunshots. So it really creates an impression, particularly if there's only one person hurt, injured and there are multiple gunshots. It does seem to imply that the gunman was able to get very close to the prime minister, to pull the trigger. And perhaps that gives us part of the understanding of why he is still right now in this life-threatening condition but rushed away in that black limousine, initially transferred to an ambulance somewhere. Where, we don't know. Then taken to the local hospital in Handlova. They say that he was conscious. They say that he was conscious when he arrived at that first hospital, that they stabilized his injuries and then transferred him to the higher level facility, which is about 30 kilometers away by helicopter, which is where we understand he is now.

And his governing where the coalition that involves more centrist parties but also involves some pretty right-wing elements. And that, at the time of his election and his positions on Russia gave a lot of European politicians and analysts cause for concern. But he did seem to sort of moderate some of his more pro-Putin, anti- Ukraine rhetoric once elected.

With horror, I received the information that prime minister Robert Fico became the target of an assassination attempt after a government meeting in Handlova. \"And during a meeting with people, he suffered gunshot wounds following the attack.

And for many of them, they'll have been learning about it over the past hour or so as we have. The details have gone from bad to worse to absolutely dire. So this is a situation I think where you're going to find, over the coming hours, a country in a state of shock. And, of course, everyone will be hoping that this state of shock doesn't turn to a state of grief, that the prime minister pulls through. And this is what we're, what we're waiting to hear about. But for the president to say this very clearly, he is concerned. He's concerned about what this augurs or could augur if it's not stamped out immediately. Again, we wait to get details. Look, the police have the attacker. They will know, by now, his name. They will probably have an idea and a sense of his motivation. There are a few other things they may know about him because, we know in these situations, they'll go to his house. They'll look at his social media feeds. They'll see what has been saying publicly. They'll say what it -- try to find out what he has been saying privately. And they will try to find out as much as they can about him.

Shortly after he stepped outside of that meeting in Handlova -- and you can see those black salute (ph) vehicles there that were waiting outside to pick him up. But before he could reach the vehicles, it appears as if a single assailant approached him and was able to get close to him, close enough to fire multiple gunshots before the assailant was wrestled to the ground. And as the assailant -- you see in some of the images here, top-left or that one there, the assailant has been wrestled to the ground. What you can see that secure -- those security people getting into that black vehicle there, where they've just bundled the prime minister into that vehicle. And video we've seen, you can see the prime minister's legs are barely moving. So from there, he goes immediately to the nearby hospital. There they say that he was conscious, the prime minister was conscious when he arrived, that he had multiple wounds, that they gave him life stabilizing treatment. Rushed him away in an ambulance to a waiting helicopter, flew him, we estimate, about 15 minutes or so to a higher-level medical facility there. The details on his medical conditions sort of dry up from medical personnel. But we get information now from government channels, who are calling it an assassination attempt, who are saying this was multiple gunshots and that he is in a life-threatening condition. We've been talking a deal here, Becky, about Robert Fico, too, and I think we shouldn't underestimate how divisive a  politician he is. He is a populist and he has as much hated, if you will, as he is loved. He's been pro-Putin, bit softer on that. But he is anti-immigrant, has been anti-Muslim. So this is a politician who's not shy of controversy. And even between stepping down as prime minister in 2018 and his current incarnation as prime minister picking up again in late September, when he won the election last year, there was an interregnum, where there were charges filed against him for corruption. There were questions about the murder of a journalist -- not the implication that he was involved.
