That's how one Democrat described the feeling inside a closed door meeting on Joe Biden's next step. Also ahead, it has never, ever, ever -- think about it -- been this hot. We'll break down the rising temperatures felt right across the globe. And later, it's a role Alec Baldwin never wanted -- defendant. Jury selection in the case against him is officially underway. (END VIDEO CLIP) Live from New York, I'm Paula Newton. A very warm welcome. Zain and Bianna are off today. This is \"ONE WORLD\". His political career has spanned more than half a century, most of it in Washington. But Joe Biden is facing a high stakes week that could not only determine his fate, but his presidential legacy, as well. And it begins today with three critical tests. Democratic House lawmakers wrapped up a closed door meeting earlier to discuss what comes next. That was after Biden's disastrous debate performance. One source said there was a sense of sadness. And while there was no consensus about how to move forward, factions of the party planned to meet throughout the day. But it does appear there remain deep divisions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL): There's been this narrative that since the debate, he has not been out. He's been out. The videos I've seen of people out campaigning has been Joe Biden. On the other hand, I've seen Donald Trump on his (BEEP) riding around a golf cart, disrespecting people. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): Joe Biden is the nominee. REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS 2ND DISTRICT): He's a good man. He has good policies. There's no reason to change. REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL 5TH DISTRICT): He just has to step down because he can't win. And my colleagues need to recognize that a dismissive letter is not going to change any mind.",

Now, as M.J. was just saying,topping the agenda at that NATO summit is how to help Ukraine. The U.S. National Security Council's John Kirby spoke to my colleague Kate Baldwin earlier about Russia's latest deadly attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: NATO is in Ukraine's future, and there's going to be a path, what we call a bridge to NATO that the allies will talk about this coming week to include the signing of bilateral security agreements, which has already happened, to make sure that they have long term defense needs met for whenever and however this war ends. (END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON (voice-over): So, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the meantime, prepares to speak during his visit to Washington, he sent out these photos of some of Ukraine's children, the most vulnerable victims of war. Those pictures there are coming on social media. Now, the death toll from Monday's wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine has now risen to 39. Search and rescue teams are still combing through rubble looking for survivors. World leaders and others, meantime, are expressing outrage over these attacks. A one place that came under bombardment, a children's hospital in Kyiv. Russia is denying it was responsible, saying the hospital was hit by a stray Ukrainian air defense missile. One Ukrainian mother says she was stunned by the destruction in front of her. UNKNOWN (through translator): We didn't expect it. We didn't think that the attack could be exactly on the hospital. It's somehow unexpected. It's good that we were in the corridor. I thought that the child would go deaf because the door near us flew open from one side and from the other. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I really appreciate your reporting.Ivo Daalder is a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and the current CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. And he joins us now from Washington, as this NATO summit gets underway. I want to go first to the issue on the ground in Ukraine and then go more to what is facing this NATO summit. In terms of Ukraine itself, we have seen President Zelenskyy try and move the needle so many times over the last few months. Do you think, this is where he is going to put down his red line, really juxtapose the hospital and the destruction that we just saw and say, look, to his allies, you must not shackle Ukraine, either with the kinds of weaponry that you can give to us or with how we use that weaponry? IVO DAALDER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: No doubt. I mean, this is a macabre message that Vladimir Putin is sending not to -- not just to Ukraine, but to the world, and in particular to the 32 NATO leaders who are here in Washington. The killings of-- the bombing of a hospital, let alone a children's hospital, just shows the brutality of this man and this regime. And I think President Zelenskyy who has been an incredibly effective advocate for his country, will come and demand exactly what you are saying. One, we need the air defense systems, the Patriot systems. And I actually think there will be good news at the summit, an announcement of more systems coming to Ukraine in the next few weeks and months. But secondly, we can't fight this horror of Russia, this terrible regime with a hand tied behind our backs. We need to be able to target Russian systems that are attacking Ukraine directly. We need the intelligence to allow us to do that. And frankly, we need the weapons that we have to go after those forces. And I think the argument is going to be strong. And I very much hope that the President of the United States and others will agree to do that.",

I want to deal first with the issue of U.S. leadership. Now, we have in front of us a diminished president, arguably. He himself admits that he doesn't want to put that much on his schedule. On top of that, the president already had apologized to President Zelenskyy that the military aid was held up for so long in Congress before it actually came through. In the face of that diminished leadership from the U.S. for now, how should allies be reacting here, especially when you still have countries like Hungary and Turkey at the table who may not be thrilled about the focus on Russia and NATO being a deterrent effect first and foremost for its aggression?",

Alliances are first and foremost based on trust, on the idea that an attack against one is an attack against all and that therefore everyone will come to your defense if you are attacked. I think Donald Trump has made serious doubts about whether he would do so, and it's those doubts that matter. They matter to the allies and frankly they matter to Russia and to the threats that we face who might want to probe and see how far they can get away with this lack of respect for the tradition of our alliances. And so, I think Europe will start to do more and it is doing more and it has been doing more in order to be less dependent on the United States. Now, that is a good thing no matter who is the President of the United States. We should encourage the Europeans to do that but we should do it through persuasion and diplomacy, not through threats to not fulfill our treaty commitments because those threats are counterproductive. And I think, as we look at the record and compare the record of President Biden to President Trump when it comes to NATO unity, NATO strength, NATO defense spending, all of which have significantly improved over the last three years even compared to the four years of the Trump presidency. And that's what the Europeans want. They will want an America that they can trust and if they can't trust it, they will have to figure out a way to use their considerable economic potential to do more themselves and defend themselves. But that is a world that makes all of us less secure.",

Beryl unleashed flooding rains and winds that transformed roads into rivers in downtown Houston. Yes, downtown Houston. You see it there. The storm ripped through power lines and tossed trees like they were twigs, leaving more than two million people without power at this hour. The outages could last days, even weeks in some communities. And to make matters worse, yes, a scorching heat wave is hitting Texas. Texas is just one of many U.S. states where people are suffering amid a punishing heat wave. Right now, more than 50 million people across the western U.S. are under heat alerts. These are pictures, in fact, from Death Valley, California, where temperatures have hovered about 125 degrees Fahrenheit.  That's every day since July 4th. We saw record high temperatures for a third day in a row in Las Vegas on Monday, with no immediate relief in sight. Forecasters say many more Americans will feel the unprecedented heat, with temperature records set to be equaled or broken right across the country this week. For more on the heat wave, CNN's Stephanie Elam joins us now from Los Angeles. I mean, Stephanie, I don't even know where to begin with this, because it's not just a one-day record in some of these cities. When I look out to the forecast, it's on.

If there's any relief, Paula, it's that overnight temperatures have been coming down. Last summer we saw some of those overnight temperatures staying above a hundred degrees, which is just insane. But I'm trying to figure out a way to explain what it feels like, because I've been in the heat in and out of it since we've gotten to summer here. And in Sacramento last week, it almost feels like there's just a whole bunch of blow dryers blasting at you when you go outside. It's just hard to actually imagine what this feels like all over your body. It is deadly, and we are seeing these records fall all across the region. You were talking about Las Vegas. I can tell you that this 110 degrees or higher since July 3rd, that will probably stay that way going into Monday. You're talking about Death Valley being above 125 degrees or more Fahrenheit. That's probably going to continue through Thursday, and that's been deadly. We already know that a motorcyclist died in Death Valley last week, and they couldn't even get the helicopter in there to airlift him out because it was too hot to fly the helicopter. This is how dire these situations are. Sacramento, as well, the capital of California, they have been at 100 degrees or higher, and that's going to continue through Saturday, as well. So, we're seeing these records drop as the country here, this part of the world, the West, is dealing with this human-induced climate change, and we're starting to see these hotter and hotter temperatures, which almost sound improbable that they can continue at this rate for so long. But as we've heard the National Weather Service call it, they're saying that this is a lethal heat wave that we are in. It's just not something to play with.

So, there's just been a lot of mistakes made by this prosecuting team.
