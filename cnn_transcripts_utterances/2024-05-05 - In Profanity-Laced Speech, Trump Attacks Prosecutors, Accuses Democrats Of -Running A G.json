I'm Manu Raju.Behind closed doors last night at his Mar-a-Lago club, Donald Trump took out his anger over his litany of criminal charges, delivering a fiery and profanity-laced speech in front of big donors and GOP officials. The former president compare President Biden's administration to Nazi Germany, accusing Democrats of, quote, running a Gestapo administration, according to several attendees. He cursed while criticizing special counsel Jack Smith and other prosecutors who have charged them with committing crimes. And in yet another sign of how Trump has come to embrace the January 6 Capitol attack he walked up to a song performed by men imprisoned for the role in the insurrection. Now it came as Trump audition half a dozen potential VP picks in front of those big Republican donors at the ritzy retreat, all just hours after that blockbuster testimony from his longtime aide, Hope Hicks, in his criminal hush money trial in New York. Now for a behind-the-scenes look into this week's gathering, we're joined by CNN's Alayna Treene, who is live with us in Palm Beach with some new reporting. Alayna, what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Manu, you're exactly right about Donald Trump's speech yesterday. He was speaking at a luncheon fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago Club, and as you said, it was a 90-minute profanity laden speech where he cursed repeatedly I'm told and he did compare the Biden administration to the Gestapo while baselessly claiming that Democrats are the ones behind the series of criminal indictments that he is facing.Now, I do also just want so bring you some reporting we have about the setting of this weekend. So, a lot of Republicans, wealthy donors, gathered here in Palm Beach to help raise money for the former president as part of the RNC's annual retreat. And as you mentioned, there are a lot of special guests who were included on that list that are on Donald Trump's shortlist to become his running mate, people like Doug Burgum and Tim Scott, both former Republican presidential primary opponents against him, as well as Senator Marco Rubio and Senator JD Vance, as well as House Republican conference chair, Elise Stefanik, among others. And Donald Trump lavish praise on them during that speech in Mar-a- Lago called them up to the stage and as you said, its kind of an audition of sorts for these potential vice presidential contenders. Now when I talked to the Trump campaign, they say that Donald Trump is still a weeks, if not months away from deciding who he wants to pick as his running mate, that decision will come closer to the Republican national convention in July. But it was a good opportunity for these people to brush shoulders with him and stand onstage at this big event. Now, some new reporting we also have is that at one of the events during the RNC retreat, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, both Donald Trump's campaign managers, as well as Tony Fabrizio, had a walk through some fundraising figures, including that they had raised $76.2 million last month. And really the fundraising here was the entirety of this weekend. They really are trying to aggressively catch up to Joe Biden's campaign who has an ever-growing war chest that really has been out of reach for the Trump campaign -- Manu.",

That is become a reality for them and several of his advisers have briefed the former president on that. So they're coming up with campaign strategies now looking ahead to November as to how to do more with less. Now, one of the things that they have sat in these are his topadvisers is that they feel like they have one advantage, which is that Donald Trump doesn't need to win over his base. They feel like right now, President Biden is still trying to win over his base, given a series of issues that voters have with the president so what they're trying to do is look ahead to November as how to siphon off voters. But as you said, like Donald Trump is very focused in the now. We've all heard about that 90 minute profane late and speech. He's talking about those trials. He's not talking about the campaign. He's talking about how he's angry that he has to sit in court all day and to some extent, he is irate.",

There were behind closed doors. They came up on stage, several of them up upon your screen there, six of them potential GOP -- we'll see -- maybe there's some others on the list, too.But, you know, these -- one of the things is that these vice presidential pick -- VP picks are going to have to defend Trump against all these criminal charges. That's going to be one of the big things about one of these candidates. If they want the job which I'm sure any of them will, they're going to have to defend Trump against these criminal charges. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  That's right because Trump really values loyalty most above everything else. He wants someone who is going to be just protecting him at all costs, someone who is not going to say or distance themselves from him in any way, shape, or form. And we've seen that out of those that we had there on the screen, a lot of them appeared willing to do that. They appear willing whether it's in terms of the trials or also the rhetoric that he uses on the campaign trail. And oftentimes, you know, very well, Manu, that Republicans will say that they didn't see a comment that he made. They say that they didn't see a Truth Social post.",

There was a lot of ice around some of the text messages she sent that essentially insulted the president and his orbit was very angry.

That's in line with younger voters to clearly -- that puts -- President Biden recognizes that the shift happening within his party. BARRON-LOPEZ:  He does recognize it. It's why you've seen the president take more aggressive stances toward Israel, despite the fact that he says, we still support them, we support their right to, you know, wage this war in defense of themselves. But that he has had much more contentious conversations with Netanyahu, that he has publicly been calling for a ceasefire, when he didn't months ago, that he is saying he's working, you know, tirelessly to try to negotiate this. But I was just in Michigan talking to young voters and the voters there kind of matched what Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez was saying, which was that there were those that were very upset about Gaza. Some that had voted for Biden in 2020, said that they weren't going to this time around.

House Republicans, they began this Congress with an ambitious agenda, but those dreams have faded away. Since then, they have thrown out one House speaker, trying to dump another, and their agenda is stalled amid bickering and name-calling. Now they are actively trying to defeat each other in their primaries. Today, my new reporting with Melanie Zanona looks at how the fury within the conference is spreading to their home districts as even more Republicans bank (ph) primary challenges to their sitting colleagues, something that has long been seen as a major breach of protocol. Now, everyone from the hardliners who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy to one member voted to impeach Donald Trump has a target on their back from fellow Republicans. The latest battle involves Nebraska's Don Bacon, a swing-district Republican, who is fed up with the hardliners tactics. Now the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, Bob Good, just endorsed, Bacon's primary challenger. And Bacon told me he plans to respond in kind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DON. BACON (R-NE): You know, it's all about norms have been undermined by these guys. But we never vacated a speaker. They did it right. Now, they're going to get to people in their districts. So my view of it is I was never going to go against an incumbent you just -- you support. You let the voters in that district take care of that. But I am supporting Bob Good's opponent now.",

That's according to one attendee at the GOP retreat in Florida. The acknowledgment comes after several major developments this past week. In Arizona, the governor signed a repeal of a near-total abortion ban from 1864. While in Florida, a law banning almost all abortions after six weeks took effect Wednesday. Borders there will decide its fate in November. That means nearly every state across the south has some form of abortion ban in place. But a new CNN poll this week shows just over half of adults and states with complete bans, find the policy too restrictive. Now, Trump has been dancing around this issue even though he named the three Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. He said in a time magazine interview that came out this week of whether he was comfortable if states decide to punish women who access abortion after the prisoners is bad. He said the states are going to make that decision. And then he was asked, do you think states should monitor women's pregnancies. They can know if they've gotten an abortion after the ban, he went on to say, I think they may do that. They might do that. Now, the Biden team of course, jumped all over that and Trump put out, his truth social post at 3:29 a.m. This morning and he said that I never said that some states may choose to monitor women's pregnancies to possibly prosecute for violating any abortion ban.

But at the other time (ph), he knows that it is not a political winner for Republicans. He is watching all of this.
