Plus, the literally earth-shaking developments in Iceland in the shadow of a volcano that could be getting ready to blow. Good evening everyone, John Berman here, in for Anderson. We begin with Israel's war on Hamas, the many pieces of it now in play and the one question that six weeks of fighting has yet to answer, namely, how a sometimes-divided democracy should fight a ruthless enemy, which hides among Palestinian non-combatants and holds hundreds of Israeli non-combatants captive. Today, an Israeli military spokesman said troops reached the heart of Gaza City, quote, \"much earlier than Hamas expected\" and are engaging Hamas gunmen elsewhere in northern Gaza. In Washington, National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby said negotiators are, quote, \"getting close to the end,\" unquote, in talks on freeing a number of hostages. He did not specify, though, what that number might be, nor would he comment on this CCTV video, which is rereleased, reportedly showing hostages being moved through Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital on October 7th. Separately, the World Health Organization today gave an update on the neonatal babies from Al-Shifa who have been evacuated to Egypt by way of the Rafah crossing in southern Gentleman. According to the WHO, 28 are now in Egypt. Three others were reunited with families and remain inside Gaza, and two others died in Gaza over the weekend. Also, today in Israel, hostage families did what some have been wanting to do for weeks now, namely, ask top members of their government tough questions with the lives of their loved ones at stake. Let's get more on that now from CNN's Oren Liebermann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Gili Roman waited 45 days for this moment. His sister, Yarden, has been a hostage in Gaza since October 7th. And this is the first chance for the families of the hostages to meet with the war cabinet.",

DANNY ELGARAT, BROTHER OF HOSTAGE ITZIK ELGARAT (through translator): In Gaza, there is enough room for the 240 who were kidnapped. And in the defense ministry, there isn't room for 130 families? LIEBERMANN (voice over): For weeks, some families have slept outside the defense ministry to remind the war cabinet inside that they will not leave and they will not let up. From Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, they marched to Jerusalem, picking up thousands of supporters along the five-day march to the prime minister's office, a public pressure campaign to force a meeting with Israel's leadership.

They were looking for new information and they simply didn't get it.One of the more disappointing and aggravating things they heard, according to this member, was that they wanted to press the government on whether bringing the hostages back was their number one priority. And they simply didn't hear that. They wanted to hear that, above all else, the government was focused on making an exchange, a deal, an arrangement to bring back Israeli hostages. And instead, they heard that, although it's important, it is not more important necessarily than defeating Hamas.

Of course, the big caveat here is that we have been covering these negotiations for weeks now, and we have heard at various other points that a deal may be close to being announced.But the recording from myself and our colleague, Alex Marquardt, is that according to a draft of a potential agreement, what would happen is that Hamas would release 50 hostages in exchange for Israel pausing the fighting for four to five days. Now, the gaps between the parties, we are told, are beginning to close, though there have been deliberations, ongoing deliberations, about how exactly such a deal might be implemented and some questions about the humanitarian aid that Hamas has been demanding from the beginning by the hundreds of truckloads. This is something that is continuing to be deliberated, we are told. Now, we have seen, and the White House has said, that they are really working around the clock to try to get to an agreement. We've seen, for example, Brett McGurk, who is the White House Middle East Coordinator, really hopscotching the region in the last couple of days. CIA Director Bill Burns has also been closely engaged.

The difference here is this. Donald Trump has a tendency. He's very good at saying things in a way that, like, when people hear it, they know he kind of means something else, but he can get away with not saying it. Like, oh, I'm not saying to go attack them, right, you know? And so this is kind of the danger in it.   And I can tell you from being in Congress and having my conversations with people, through all the years of Donald Trump, kind of peel back the curtain here a little bit. When he says something, so if he goes after Jack Smith or says something personal, whatever it is, that gives license to every other member of Congress, every other political leader to then turn around and do the same thing. So it's not just Donald Trump putting something on his fake Twitter, it's -- it now gives credit and permission to every other Republican to say the same thing. And when -- as you saw with Dr. Anthony Fauci, for instance, right, people disagreed with his COVID policies. Fine, you can disagree with them, but he's gotten a lot of death threats.

So let me just bring up those numbers as we go through and you'll see the Michigan map here from 2020.Here's that new national poll you talked about. One key distinction I want to make. NBC polled voters ages 18 to 34. In the exit polls, it's 18 to 29. We do know as voters start to get older, they're more likely. They're not rushing to the Republicans, but they're more likely. So, but still, if you look at this, and then if you go back and look nationally at 2016 versus 2020, President Trump got 36 percent of 18 to 29. He got 36 percent again in 2020. Both in 2016 and 20, President getting 36. So if he's above 40, that's a big gain for President Trump. So what is the issue? Look at President Biden. He got 60 percent in 2020 to 55 percent for Hillary Clinton. It was a key piece of the Biden coalition. And John, when you ask voters on campus, number one, the age. They see the president, they don't see him enough. And so they think, wow, he's doesn't understand us. He doesn't get us. Those college Democrat presidents, they were trying to deal with that issue, saying, you're not just voting for the president, you're voting for who we puts on the Supreme Court. You're voting for abortion rights. You're voting to protect democracy. They were just trying to start that conversation on campus. And then October 7th happened. And you see this divide on campus where the Jewish students say they feel afraid, and the progressive students saying the President should call for a ceasefire. They say if he doesn't, they might not vote at all, or they might go third party. And if you look how close Michigan is, that would be a problem.",

On Sunday, Musk did not directly address what he posted, rather he wrote that there were hundreds of bogus media stories claiming he is antisemitic and that quote, \"Nothing could be further from the truth\".
