So if you're doing the math, it seems like we are on pace to surpass what we saw last year.In 2021, a late March date as well and from 2018 to 2020. There weren't 100 mass shootings until May. The Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter. Ed Davis and Juliette Kayyem are back with us now. And the numbers don't lie, Juliette, right? There are more mass shootings. They are becoming more frequent. In the last few moments, we heard from State Senator Heidi Campbell, who talked about a sick gun culture in this country. How much do you think these rising numbers are associated with the culture that is so attached and attracted to guns in our society?",

      "sentences": "Very much so. And I mean, you just - because we can compare ourselves to other countries. Other countries have mental health disorders, other countries have schools, and they don't have the kind of mass shootings we do.I often say in response to the slogan, we just have to give good people guns, right, and then we'll solve this problem. If we - if guns were going to make us safer, we would be the safest country on earth. We are an overly armed country with weaponry that is just not suitable for civilian society. So we can put aside the handgun debate. Most of us who are for responsible gun legislation understand - and most people should be able to understand - the difference between a handgun and the kind of weaponry that we're likely to learn about in this case, rifles and the A.R. series. The thing I want to make clear is, in the politics of this, it's very important that the White House - and I commend them - begin talking about this immediately. Because what happens is we tend to focus on the shooter. And I think in this case, we will learn a lot about the shooter because it is a unique shooter. It's a 20 something female. We just don't see that in the demographics and that's going to tell us something. But we also need to look at the totality of circumstances. And so it's not one thing. So it's it is the mental health issues in our country and the failure of people to get the support. They want strong Red Flag Laws. It is, of course, its issues around supporting our schools supporting our teachers, making them stronger. So I like playing defense as well. But the third piece, of course, is a kind of weaponry. You can't - you can't have the first two conversations and not have the third. I think those gun advocates will always want to focus on the first two, and I think as a mature society, we need to have all three. I'm not dismissing the need for better defensive measures. That's what Ed and I do, often, not just missing the need for a much better mental health system that captures people that might turn to violence. But you cannot take guns, access to guns, access to these kinds of guns off the table to be able to solve this problem, even though it's not a perfect solution.",

The private schools look at security as a cost center and they don't have a lot of discretionary funding at those schools. So you seem - you seem to see sort of a hesitance. And I think it's probably built on a perception that, wait a minute, we're a religious school or private school, this this stuff doesn't happen here. The truth of the matter is it can happen anywhere. I hate to say that, but, you know, I think that incidents like this cause a review. We have to we have to put as many safeguards in place as we can but knowing that the real solution lies with the legislative branch.",

And I would say for Boris and myself as journalists asking the questions. It's just a change in in the victims in the names in the location, but a lot of the circumstances leading up to it are the same. What's not the same is how this impacts all of these families' lives right now. How do these parents talk to their children about what they're seeing? What happened to their classmates and what they're seeing, quite frankly, around their schools right now, which looks like a war zone?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And of course, and it's not just the kids at that school. It impacts all of Nashville and then, of course, reverberate. So we have some idea, because we now have a generation that we callLockdown Generation. These are the post Columbine pre-K'ers, the kids who were quite young, if not even born before Columbine, who are now of age. They have experienced lockdowns as a part of their - of their education in a way that you and I did. Isn't uh, when we were in school. And they - and they actually focus politically on guns and greater protections, much more so than their parents. And I think it will be interesting in terms of the long term consequences of what we have done to children in terms of their experience, how they live with gun, how they think about guns there, how they think about whether they would be killed by guns, starting to have political momentum. And that's going to be the longer term trajectory at this moment in the community. Of course, the number-one factor is family unification. It appears that the fatality rate is now known and that there are no - no one in the hospital once again. This is - we're used to this. These guns kill or they don't, right? That's all they do. They have a killer. They don't, because that's what they're intended for. And so you have fatalities at the - at the school and apparently no surge of injuries at the hospital. This is - you know, this is the fate of what we're putting our kids to. And so obviously, family unification matters. There's going to be mental health and other resources once the school districts reopen. And then long-term help for not just the students who were there. Their siblings that will be obviously impacted by this. And then, of course, parents. The parents, though, as we know, as any parent knows that we'll never recover. This is not something you manage. This is - you know, this is now there's a before and after in their lives. And we do this to parents now, as we've seen in the numbers every single day.",

(LAUGHTER) BIDEN: Before I began to speak, the reason I spend a lot of time in the kids, I just want to speak very briefly about the school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee. You know? Ben and I have been doing this our whole careers it seems and it's just it's sick. You know, we're still gathering the facts of what happened and why. And we do know that, as of now, there are a number of people who are not going to - did not make it, including children. It's heartbreaking. Family's worst nightmare. And I want to commend the police, who responded incredibly swiftly within minutes in the danger. We're monitoring the situation really closely, Ben, as you know. And we have to do more to stop gun violence. It's ripping our communities apart, ripping a soulless nation, at the very soul of the nation. And we have to do more to protect our schools so they aren't turned into prisons. You know the shooter in this situation reportedly had to assault weapons and a pistol to make a 47. So I call on Congress again to pass my assault weapons ban. It's about time that we began to make some more progress. But there's more to learn. But I just wanted to send my condolences out to so many parents out there. I've been to so many of these sites, as known by virtually everyone. And one of the things you folks should - I know you do know what you should focus on. You know, just like when in the military. My son was in Iraq and other places. So many members of the military coming back with Post Traumatic Stress after witnessing violence and participating. For these children, these teachers, you should be - should be focusing on their mental health as well. And so I'm grateful anyway. Sorry to start off that way, but I couldn't begin without acknowledging what happened. And now I'm grateful to all of you are joining us here today.

He said of the school shootings that they are, quote, \"ripping at the soul of this nation.\" Senator Ben Cardin was also there and he referenced him at the beginning of his remarks, saying that he and the Senator had seemingly been working on this their entire careers. Obviously, last year, there was legislation passed to limit access to weapons after what we saw unfold in Uvalde, Texas, but it just doesn't appear that right now there is much momentum on Capitol Hill for more laws that would restrict access to guns.",

So the incident where the officers engaged the suspect. We are assisting the metro investigation. And the reason we've got metro doing the primary investigation is because it was a fluid scene. So there wasn't a single stop in the action. And so as they investigate the homicides, then we felt it was most appropriate for them to continue that investigation. But we will assist, as - in our role as an independent oversight on the officer involved situation. And so that will be the role of TBI. We, too, want to thank all of our partners. It is special.
