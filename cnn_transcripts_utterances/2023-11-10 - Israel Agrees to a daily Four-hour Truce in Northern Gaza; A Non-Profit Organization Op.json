But for civilians in Gaza, those breaks in the bombardment are a chance to seek safer surroundings if they can in an enclave that is filled with dangers. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz reports on the exodus. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If you are among those still in northern Gaza, this is what life looks like now, the heart of a battle zone. May God protect us, this man says. Those who do not have the means to leave, we will have to stay where we are. It's as if they've sentenced us to death. The Israeli military continues to call on all residents of northern Gaza to move south. It is the forced exodus of an entire population, Palestinians say. But some are unable or unwilling to heed the warning. Thousands of them are taking shelter at Gaza City hospitals. Among them, patients that can't be moved, families too afraid to travel through bombs and bullets, and medical staff loyal to a duty of care. Dr. Mohammed Abu Namuz says he has sent his family away, but he will stay behind. What can be done? There's no other way out of this. There is no safety, he says. That's why it's best if I get my family out, so I can focus on treating patients. On Wednesday alone, as many as 50,000 people made the perilous journey south via the time-limited corridors set up by the Israeli military. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): They're moving because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north and that the south is safer, a safer area where they receive medicine, water and food. They understand it's an improvement. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): But the south is not safe and hardly an improvement. Israeli airstrikes level homes here too. And the conditions for the estimated 1.5 million now cramped in this corner of the enclave are described as inhumane. Thousands of the displaced are living on the street. There is no aid, no water, the toilets are closed, she says, and no bakeries. We get a single loaf of bread every three or four days after waiting in long lines for half a day. And U.N. shelters are overcrowded. At one site, at least six people must share a single toilet, the U.N. says. And as for humanitarian assistance, it is so far a drop in the ocean of need. VOLKER TURK, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: This is the gateway to a hellish nightmare. And then I see in front of me the lifeline that would bring relief and humanitarian assistance, which until now has not been enough. Woefully inadequate. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): The conditions are so dire that this family says they decided to leave a UN shelter and move back into the ruins of their bombed out home. We're still afraid of course for our children, but it's the lesser of two evils, this father says. At least it's better than being surrounded by disease, hunger and fear. At least here, our children are at home. With three out of every four Gazans internally displaced, the UN estimates. Home is what so many dream of here, but many fear that sense of normalcy will never return. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

U.S. troops and their allies are taking more fire in the Middle East as the war between Israel and Hamas grinds on. A U.S. official says those forces came under at least four new missile and drone attacks in Iraq and Syria since Wednesday, three U.S. service members suffering minor injuries. The attacks coming after U.S. fighter jets hit weapons storage facility in eastern Syria on Wednesday, you see the strike there on your screen. The U.S. says it belonged to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and its allies, whom Washington blamed for a series of earlier strikes on its troops in the region. There have been at least 46 such strikes since mid-October, according to U.S. officials. At least 56 U.S. troops have been injured in those attacks. And the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum says it is deeply concerned by eyewitness reports of ethnic targeting in West Darfur. [02:25:03] The statement came after CNN geolocated disturbing videos, which were about to play for you, showing members of African ethnic groups who had appeared to have been rounded up by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The embassy said, quote, \"these horrifying actions once again highlight the RSF's pattern of abuses in the country with their military offensive.\" Now new images, also geo-located by CNN, show several bodies in the same general area as that previous video you were watching. The RSF denies any incidents of ethnic cleansing, saying it doesn't target civilians and is working with the people of Sudan to restore the country to civilian-led democratic rule. With the brutal reality of October 7 still fresh in their minds, survivors of the Hamas attacks are sharing their memories of the ordeal, so others will never forget. We'll have details on that after the break. Also, a closer look at the growing international concern that Israel's war with Hamas could expand across the region.
