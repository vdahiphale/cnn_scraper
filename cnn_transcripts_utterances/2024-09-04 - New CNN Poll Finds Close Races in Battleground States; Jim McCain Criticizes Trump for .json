A live look at New York City. Look at that beautiful sunrise on this Wednesday morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. There are just 62 days until election day and six days until Kamala Harris and Donald Trump meet on the debate stage in Philadelphia. And there are just two days -- yes, two -- until the first mail-in ballots will be sent out. Voters are going to be voting. New CNN polling released just this morning shows a race that is truly neck-and-neck among likely voters in key battleground states. Harris holds a lead over Trump in Wisconsin and Michigan. In Arizona, Trump holds the lead. In nearby Nevada, there's no clear leader. And in what are arguably the two most critical states, well, it's a tie. There is no clear leader in Georgia, and it is dead even in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Around 15 percent of likely voters in these swing states say they are open to changing their mind about which candidate they will support. On average, about two-thirds of likely voters in these states say they're extremely motivated to vote in November. And here is where you see evidence that Harris's momentum is from getting the Democratic base voters excited. In Michigan, 72 percent of Democratic-aligned registered voters say they're extremely motivated to vote. That is up from 58 percent back in March. This new CNN polling shows that the race to 270, the path to the White House runs straight through Georgia and Pennsylvania. If Trump holds North Carolina and wins both of those states, then he can lose Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nevada. It wouldn't matter. If Kamala Harris wins Pennsylvania and she holds Wisconsin and Michigan, she only needs one more electoral vote to get over the top. She's looking at you, Omaha. And the post-Labor Day sprint kicks into high gear. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are sounding two very different tones. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And look, I think Nevada is back in play, Arizona. What was surprising to me obviously abortion. There's a referendum on the ballot. So, it tells me that there's not an automatic pro-abortion and pro-Harris linking together on that. And then the last point is, look, it's 62 days away, I believe. That's July 4 to today.

Plus, a former aide to the New York governor charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government.

But it was what Trump did afterward that ignited controversy. He visited soldiers' grave sites in the cemetery's Section 60 at the invitation of some of their family members. And while he was there, Trump and his aides filmed a TikTok video, apparently in violation of a federal law that prohibits partisan political activity throughout the cemetery. A cemetery employee attempted to prevent a member of Trump's group from filming. It led to a confrontation so significant that Arlington reported it to the military police. The employee declined to press charges, reportedly fearing retaliation. And in a statement following the incident, the Trump campaign claimed the employee was, quote, \"clearly suffering from a mental health episode.\" Trump spoke about that controversy again yesterday to FOX's Sean Hannity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP (via phone): There was no conflict. There was no fight. There was no anything. And I get home that night, and I get, like, a call that from one of the people that is press -- \"Sir, there's a story that your people got into a tremendous fight with people representing the cemetery.\" Did you notice that the person representing now doesn't want to talk?

I also think it's going to have a lot of outsized influence. I'm not going to pretend it has a lot of outsized influence or really affect any vote other than maybe his or someone in his family's.

And this notion of not comprehending what service is. And it fits into this larger frame that Harris and Democrats want to paint around Trump, that he's in this for himself and that she is in it for you. And so, I just think, for all those reasons, it's -- this incident alone, I don't think would -- but it's a compounding thing that fits into this larger narrative that Democrats are building around Trump.
