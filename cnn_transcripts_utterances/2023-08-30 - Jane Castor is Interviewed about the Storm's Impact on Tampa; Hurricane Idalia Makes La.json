The strong storm, a category three storm, sustained winds of more than 120 miles an hour. We are watching that storm come onshore there in Florida.I want to go now to our affiliate reporter who -- from WKMG, who was in Perry, which is about 20 minutes from where the storm made landfall. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We are in the middle of it right now. You can hear that roar. I mean, it is the sound of a category three- ish storm. And this is the power. So, when we talk about it moving through, you know, the concern is that all of this stuff flying through the air, and it is really, I mean, you know, shooting across the ground and through the air, any of this stuff, if you're outside -- so the fence just wept down, that construction fence went down -- if you're outside, you are in the line of fire.

That's why you were hearing that roar of wind and seeing all of that rain.I will tell you, we are outside of the most dangerous part of this storm. We are just getting basically tropical force winds here where I am standing in Crystal River. But the storm surge, definitely, look at this, it is coming up even further. Now, when we first started, you go to basically where that boat slip is, the dock is. The water was there. It was far back from where we are. Now it is all the way up. It has definitely come up about three feet now. It was about one when we started this morning. And it was dry just before that. All right, I want to go to the mayor of Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor, who is standing by live for us. We appreciate, ma'am, your time in the midst of this really dangerous storm. I know that Tampa has seen some serious flooding. Can you tell us what the situation is in Tampa right now that people need to know about?",

We have about 126 miles of waterfront land hear in Tampa. And that is only going to rise. We're at low tide. The tide is coming in. We expect that king high tide around noon to 1",

We have our push crews that are throughout our community. They are the ones that are going out to clear the roadways once the winds stop. So, we're hearing from them. We're hearing from our first responders. We have three bridges that connect Hillsborough County with Pinellas. Currently, two of those are closed and probably will be closed until 5:00 or 6:00 this afternoon. We have our islands, both Harbor and Davis Islands, and Davis Islands are inaccessible right now, unless you've got a boat. So, those are the issues that we're dealing with. And communicating to residents to let them know that that water is going to continue to come in. So, we appreciate your efforts to inform our residents.",

But I love the people of this state and the beauty of this state. And there's a reason why people live in places like Tampa and St. Pete because it is beautiful.But, unfortunately, during hurricane season, it is also extremely dangerous and people need to be listening to you and the folks from the emergency management not to go out, even though it is quite beautiful seeing this storm come through. It is still extremely dangerous. It can be very perilous. And that storm surge, you can't stop that. You can't stop that. You can't - your body can't take that kind of pressure when the water is being swept in. So, people need to be really cognizant. And, again, let's just mention again how important it is. The two -- two of the bridges there that connect Pinellas County with Hillsborough County have been closed. You just heard that from the mayor of Tampa.

And no real precedent for a storm of this size to actually land in that region over the course of the last really more than a century.And I want to go right now to CNN's Bill Weir.

Even in the wake of landfall, people in the region being told to stay indoors, hunker down. In the words of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, don't do anything dumb if you're in that region right now. Very real risks even as the storm passes over. And I want to get back to Sara Sidner, who has been on the ground, watching this and reporting on this throughout the course of the morning. Sara.",

We are only getting tropical storm force winds and yet the storm surge is supposed to be enormous.We are seeing just a little of it. This is basically a low tide and we're seeing at least four feet of water sort of coming up. Now, we were right on the water, so that's why you're seeing it and it's not flooding the rest of the city of Crystal River. However, there is going to be -- about 4:30, that's going to be the height of this event for this particular park. We are about 50 miles from where the storm made landfall. And 80 miles from me that is where we find Derek Van Dam. And you can see up and down the west coast, here we're getting another band of wind -- up and down the west coast there are differing variations of what this storm is doing to the population there, to the buildings, to the water, but everyone is going to feel this in some way, some worse than others. It is by no means over yet just because this storm has made landfall. Let me toss it over to Derek. He is in the thick of the storm surge there in Tampa.",

And I think this is notable, so I'm going to mention it. I've seen several bystanders, so this is people from the community, who have come out to take pictures of this particular flooded thoroughfare. This is a main artery for Tampa, which is directly over my right shoulder. And why that's significant is because we know that Bay Shore Boulevard floods in a rainstorm, for instance. But this is storm surge. And, unfortunately, we're in low tide at the moment. And according to the mayor, which we had on the show just a few moments ago, the worst is still yet to come.
