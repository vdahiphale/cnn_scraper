Only one person seems to remain unmovable. As a new presidential election looms, Nicolas Maduro seems all but assured to cement his position even further. On Wednesday, the U.S. announced the reimposition of economic sanctions against the Venezuelan oil industry after last minute negotiations collapsed. The sanctions were lifted in October when representatives of the government and the opposition signed an agreement that paved the way to free and fair elections. But since then, that deal was broken several times. The opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, has been barred from running. Her replacement, Corina Yoris, was also blocked by electoral authorities. Political activists have been detained including members of Machado`s team. Notably the U.S. maintained a special license for U.S. major Chevron, who has been operating since 2022. And U.S. officials told CNN they will keep engaging with Maduro despite the reaction. NICOLAS MADURO, VENZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translation): If you want to hurt us, you`ll get hurt. We will grow with or without a license. We are not a Yankee colony, nobody will stop us.",

It`s not Cinco de Mayo, which celebrates Mexico`s victory over French invaders in 1862. Mexico actually declared its independence on September 16th, 1810 after activist and priest Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla urged the Mexican people to take up arms and fight for independence from Spain. Today in central Mexico, a popular tourist destination, Lake Patzcuaro, is under threat. Environmental factors and water theft had led to the lake losing half of its volume since officials first noticed and began measuring its decreasing water levels. The local government says it formed a commission to preserve the lake, and so far, that group has stopped the theft of nearly 160,000 gallons of water each day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
