Counselor, thank you for being with us. These two Supreme Court cases on regulations, pretty big deals over the last few years.

Generally speaking, it was hard for courts to strike down those regulations. However, this past summer, in 2024, while everyone was paying attention to the presidential immunity case, a few days within that we got a different decision that reversed Chevron Deference. And what that case involved was a regulation passed by the National Marine Fisheries Service that said that when herring fishermen go out on their boats and fish for herring, they have to have a monitor, a human being on their boats making sure they're complying with regulations. And those herring fishermen have to pay the monitor. So, this was costing fishermen hundreds of dollars per day, thousands of dollars per week. The Supreme Court struck down that regulation and said, the courts no longer have to defer to the agencies that made it much easier for the courts to strike down federal regulations.",

But this decision involving the EPA involved a law that Congress passed, a very narrow law, that regulated coal emissions by coal plants. Carbon emissions. And what the EPA did was they took a very narrow statute and they issued a very broad regulation that would have cost the industry hundreds of billions of dollars. And the Supreme Court, as the name suggests, major question, said, if there is a major question of financial import or of political import, there has to be a specific, broad law from Congress. And so, you can't do what the EPA did there.So, again, this is one of two big decisions that the Supreme Court has recently issued that makes it much easier to strike down regulations.",

And by the way, there are tens of thousands of regulations on the books. This has really expanded since the 1980s for some private outside interests to come in and say, this regulation is putting a burden on us, a financial burden, some sort of other administrative burden, and therefore you, courts, should strike it down.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR: I remember very distinctly when Donald Trump was first elected you did one of - you were the only one to actually welcome his election conditionally. In other words, based on the respect and the adherence to mutual values, democracy, freedom, diversity, rule of law, human rights, et cetera. And I just, you know, wonder whether you thought he did act in that way, and especially because you said, \"he was clearly fascinated by the Russian president. In the years that followed, I received the distinct impression that he was captivated by politicians with autocratic and dictatorial traits.\" How did that manifest itself to you? ANGELA MERKEL, FORMER GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): Well, in the way that he spoke about Putin, the way that he spoke about the North Korean president, obviously apart from critical remarks he made, there was always a kind of fascination at the sheer power of what these people could do. So, my impression always was that he dreamt of actually overriding maybe all those parliamentary bodies that he felt were, in a way, an encumbrance upon him, and that he wanted to decide matters on his own and in a democracy. Well, you cannot reconcile that with democratic values. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And she reminded everybody that, you know, in the first Trump term it was China, but then all of a sudden the EU was hit with steel tariffs and others. And she said, look, it's going to hurt America and the world as well. So, let's see how that comes into focus.But yes, the world leaders, just like, you know, you saw Prime Minister Trudeau go down to Mar-a-Lago, President Macron has invited Trump to see the opening of the Notre Dame, and they're all trying to get the measure of the man.",
