Earlier on Tuesday, federal prosecutors charged Linda Sun and her husband, Chris Hu. Linda is a former aide to Governor Kathy Hochul, and she also worked for former governor Andrew Cuomo, as well as other state agencies. Now, federal officials say that Linda and her husband enrichedthemselves and received a series of payoffs in exchange for actions that ultimately benefited the Chinese government and the Communist Party, specifically they say that they laundered money, received tickets to special events, helped to promote their friends' businesses. And at one point even received a special delivery of specialty duck, which had been prepared by a Chinese official's personal chef. Now, we have gotten a response from Governor Hochul's office which said that they are cooperating with the investigation. They said that they terminated Linda Sun's employment in March of 2023 after discovering evidence of misconduct and immediately reported her actions to law enforcement and have assisted law enforcement throughout this process. One of the more shocking allegations that the government has made in this case is that Linda Sun at one point used her influence to get former governor Andrew Cuomo to publicly thank Chinese officials for donating medical equipment. This was at the height of the pandemic, and as New York was trying to respond, Linda Sun was allegedly using her position to make sure that Chinese officials were being publicly recognized. Then Governor Cuomo went on to thank them publicly during a briefing and he even wrote out a tweet naming some of the officials and thanking them for their donation. Now, as part of her role, part of what the government alleges Linda Sun did, she specifically worked to block Taiwanese officials from having access to New York state government officials, even blocked sort of trivial things like the Taiwanese community being able to get a recognition for Taiwanese cultural week. All of this she did at the behest of the Communist Party and the Chinese government, according federal prosecutors. Now, Linda Sun and her husband did appear in court with their lawyers. They have pleaded not guilty and their lawyer said that the allegations are all the result of an overly aggressive investigation by the federal officials. If it's all true, it will be that the state government here in New York was brazenly manipulated for nearly a decade at the highest levels and certainly raises questions just about how the government here in New York hires its staffers and whether or not there may be other Chinese government officials and agents working on behalf of the Communist Party and the government here in New York.

Special Counsel Jack Smith updated his indictment last month to take into account a very controversial ruling by the Supreme Court which granted Trump immunity for some conduct which fell within his presidential powers. Hearing is scheduled for Thursday to decide how to proceed with this case in federal court.Meantime, Trump's request to have his hush money trial move to a federal court has been denied. A jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts back in May. The federal judge says there's nothing in the Supreme Court's immunity ruling that would change his view on the fact that payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels were private and official acts. Trump's attorneys have also asked to postpone his September 18th sentencing.
