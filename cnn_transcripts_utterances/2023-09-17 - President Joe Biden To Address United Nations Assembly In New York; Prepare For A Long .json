He is about to leave for New York to meet with leaders at the United Nations General Assembly this week. He will also sit down with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as Ukraine seeks more support from its allies in the midst of a challenging counteroffensive against Russia.However, Biden's focus on the international stage comes as he's facing a looming government shutdown, potentially an impeachment inquiry from House Republicans and scrutiny over his son's indictment on felony gun charges. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us right now as President Biden heads off for his trip to New York. We'll be keeping an eye on the president's movements over the next couple of hours. But Arlette, what more do we know about this meeting with President Zelenskyy and other world leaders this week? This is a big week not just for the president of the United States, but for the president of Ukraine.",

General Assembly, an opportunity for the president to stress the alliances that he has tried to build during his time in office.Officials here say that the marquee moment will be his speech before the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, when he'll talk about his vision for America's leadership on the world stage and also stress the need for countries to work together to solve some of the problems of the world's biggest problems. Now, he will have a series of meetings with various world leaders while he is in New York City. And that includes a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Wednesday. There had been a lot of questions about whether a meeting between the two leaders would, in fact, happen as the administration had expressed some disapproval for his efforts to overhaul the judicial system in Israel. But the two will be meeting at Anga, not here at the White House. But then, really, at the end of the week, as the president returns back here to Washington on Thursday, he's set to meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy here at the White House. They will talk about that counteroffensive that's being waged against Russia in Ukraine, but it also comes at a delicate moment, as the president has been trying to ask Congress to provide additional aid to Ukraine, but Republicans up in the House have expressed opposition to that. They want to have a stand-alone vote on that, instead of including it in his supplemental funding request. But this is all shaping up to be a very big week for the president on the world stage, also, as he is trying to make his case for re-election, one of the things that he consistently tries to tout is this alliance building that he has cultivated during his time in office. So, he will be in New York City from starting this evening all the way through Wednesday for those series of meetings with the world leaders.",

So, ATACAMS will certainly help. If we look at the landscape that you're showing now, it is apocalyptic. It looks like a World War I scenario.That's because artillery -- heavy artillery is used. Thousands of rounds are being fired. Every living thing in the landscape is destroyed. And it's a grinding war of attrition. The Ukrainians have an advantage. They're frankly making progress.

What happens if Donald Trump gets back into the White House? What if Republicans take control of both houses of Congress and you don't see as much aid going to Ukraine? Does the President and members of Congress who want to see more aid to Ukraine, do they need to head that off at the pass essentially and start taking that into account?",

If we've seen nothing in the last few weeks, we've seen Ukrainians use their own systems, some developed over the course of the last year and change, as far as drones, others missiles that they've had in development for some time, taking out a Russian sub in dry dock, a Russian large landing ship, a billion-dollar air defense system, actually two have been destroyed in the last couple of months.And so, the Ukrainians are not going to give up the fight. We are helping them enormously. We're saving from even more horrific casualties, although I think along both sides, the casualties are probably close to a million now. That's including wounded POWs and killed in 18 months of war, but the Ukrainians are not going to give up this fight. And so, making them self-sufficient, providing them what is necessary will prevent more casualties and benefit us frankly in the long run. When I think about helping the Ukrainians, I think about what kind of world do I want to live in? What kind of world do I want my children to live in? Is it a world where the might makes right? Or is it a world where people and countries follow a rules-based international order? So, this is very much in our interest. We're interconnected in this world, just like climate change affects us.

He sounded like he was admitting he was the driving force behind the effort to overturn the election results. What did you think of that?MOLLY JONG-FAST, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, VANITY FAIR: You know, the thing about Donald Trump and Trumpism as a whole is that since he has tried to overturn the 2020 election, he does this thing now where he says, well, I'm the one who likes democracy and Joe Biden is the one who doesn't believe in democracy, right? This is the idea is that everything you have sort of accused him of, which clearly has happened on Earth One, is no longer true in Trump world. And this is effective with his base, and that is why there's a large percentage of this Republican base that believes the 2020 election was unfair, despite the fact that there's mountains and mountains of evidence to prove that Donald Trump is wrong. And I think that, you know, all of his answers, Donald Trump's answers, can be taken as either lies or projection. And so even what, you know, I mean, I'm not surprised by anything he says.

We're 414 days till this election. If you look back in 1995, you had Dole, right, crushing Clinton. I mean, national polls are meaningless. Democrats love to (inaudible). The guy is old, but he's two and a half years older than Trump. The whole narrative has been Biden is too old. People are being asked in polls, do you find Biden old? Trump is a man who was during his presidency bragging about passing a cognitive test. Man, woman, person, camera, television. I mean, this is wild stuff. Biden just got back from a five-day European trip. The guy has been doing a great job. Every time he speaks, he's fine. Remember, in 2015, Trump world told us that Hillary Clinton was too sick to serve, that she had passed out, that she had pneumonia. Like, this is what they do. This is their playbook. And again, a matchup is a rematch of the same candidates is not much fun. But I think it's really important that the mainstream media does not cover Donald Trump like a normal candidate, because we know from his twice impeachment, multiple civil and criminal charges, and you know, and his various other, you know, and leading an armed insurrection, that this guy is not a normal democratic candidate -- a normal candidate who believes in democracy.",

I will give you an impeachment investigation in the complete absence of evidence, if that will placate you. But, you know, it did placate them. It's never enough. He offered them a censure of me earlier. That wasn't enough. He's offering an impeachment of Joe Biden. That won't be enough. Basically, this is a conference that is completely out of control. You know, we will, of course, respond to whatever they do and to, in particular, the false claims made by the former president and others.

There's no strong ideological framework. There's no sense of purpose or mission. The only mission is for him to stay speaker. And that's not much of a unifying theme for the Republicans. And so, I'm not surprised he's having the difficulty.
