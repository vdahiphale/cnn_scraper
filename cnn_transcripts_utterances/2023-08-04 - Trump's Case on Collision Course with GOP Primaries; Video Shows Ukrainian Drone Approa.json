The former U.S. president and Republican front runner in the 2024 presidential race pleaded not guilty on Thursday to four felony charges. He is acquitted, sorry accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Well, source says Ukraine was behind a successful sea drone attack on a Russian Navy ship.

Junta warning any foreign military intervention will be met with an immediate response. Niger's junta also announced it has dismissed the country's ambassadors to France, the U.S. Nigeria and Togo. And coming up this hour, six months on since a devastating earthquake is struck near the Turkish Syrian border. I speak to actress Ashley Judd about her work as a UN Goodwill Ambassador. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is facing most serious charges against him yet. In court, he denied that he broke the law to try to stay in office after the 2020 election. We're told Trump was feeling sour and dejected after Thursday's arraignment. On camera, he was typically defined. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: This is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him. We can't let this happen in America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All of these indictments in a short term help Donald Trump politically, typically, if a candidate is indicted, or is in any real legal trouble, their opponents attack them on it, and their campaigns may end. For Donald Trump bizarrely, it reinforces his core argument that the system is rigged. It's rigged against you, it's rigged against me. And it sets Donald Trump up in the short term, not necessarily long term, to be that martyr for the Republican base that that he holds so closely.

      "sentences": "All these criminal cases involving former President Trump can be dizzying. So we want to update you on the cases andwhat lies ahead. There are a total of four criminal cases that the former president has been investigated in, three of them where he has been formally charged and pleaded not guilty. The January 6 case that he was just arraigned in on Thursday, where he's charged with four counts, including obstructing federal proceedings and conspiracy to defraud the government. Then there's the Mar-a-Lago documents case where he faces 40 counts related to the allegedly illegal retention of documents at his Florida State. There is the New York hush money case brought by the Manhattan DA, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and to Karen McDougal. Those are the cases where Donald Trump has already been indicted. Then there's the Georgia case where an indictment could come soon. That case focuses on Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state of Georgia. Now, let's look at what happens next on the calendar. In just about a week, August 10, he'll be arraigned on three additional charges brought in the Mar-a-Lago case, although he's not expected to attend that hearing. Also likely in August could be a decision on an indictment in the Georgia case. Now as far as when the actual trials in these cases will begin and how they square with the election calendar for next year. While two of the cases he's been indicted in are scheduled to start in the middle of the primary season. Super Tuesday is on March 5, 2024. And there are several other primaries during that month of March. And the first case to begin the first criminal case to begin the Manhattan DA's hush money trial is scheduled to start about three weeks after Super Tuesday on March 25. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case, a pretrial hearing is scheduled for May 14. The trial itself could begin as early as May 20. On the election calendar, there are several primaries in the month of May. And the Republican Party's nomination deadline is 11 days after the Mar-a-Lago trial is slated to begin, that deadline for the nomination is on May 31. But that Mar-a-Lago trial we need to point out could easily slide until later in the year. And as for the case, he has just been indicted in the January 6 case; the start date could be set during the next hearing in that case, which is on August 28. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.",

But crucially, these cases have two things in common.First, it's two U.S. Navy sailors according to prosecutors in the Southern District of California, at the center of leaking and giving out this sensitive information. And second, that information in both cases prosecutors say was passed to Chinese intelligence officers. This of course, is coming at a very tense time between the U.S. and China between Beijing and Washington. So let's look at both of these cases. In the first one of these cases unveiled just yesterday, U.S. Navy sailor Jinchao Wei was arrested at Naval Base San Diego. According to prosecutors, he was a naval engineer who passed on schematics, information manuals and plans not only about U.S. vessels, vessels such as the U.S.'s Essex and amphibious assault ship, but also other U.S. Navy ships. That sort of sensitive information, something Beijing would very much like to look at. Prosecutors say that he received thousands of dollars in return for that information. And the second one of these cases against when Jinchao was arrested at Naval Base Ventura County. Prosecutors say that he had information and past, for example, operational plans for an exercise onto once again, a Chinese intelligence officer giving away sensitive information, again, to what the U.S. has identified as the pacing threat or the pacing challenge for which the U.S. is very much looking at when it comes to future military plans and a future challenge. Not the first time of course, this year that the U.S. had, the U.S. military specifically has had sensitive information leaked. This all comes after Massachusetts Air National Guardsmen who was accused of leaking a trove of classified information online. And it's certainly Becky raises questions about whether there are enough steps to stop this sort of thing and these sorts of leaks.

Now, according to a navy official familiar with the plans, the U.S. is considering putting small teams of sailors or Marines about 20 each on commercial vessels as again deterrence to Iran to keep Iran from attempting to seize the vessels. Now, this hasn't happened yet because this isn't purely a U.S. Navy decision. You have to have the agreement, of course, of the commercial vessel, perhaps also of the country where it's flagged, and also the shipping company itself. But the official familiar with these plans says the shipping industry has expressed interest in measures like this, at least since May, where we saw Iran season oil tanker. Now Becky, it wouldn't be every ship that could get this security detail from the U.S. military on board, it would have to be what are considered high risks ships. So the military would look at, for example, oil tankers, and then it would consider the origin and destination of the vessel where it's flagged what it's carrying all of that into whether a ship would be eligible. And then of course, Becky, the ship and the owner would have to agree to this. But this is something we're very much watching to see if this happens.

Our family's business is the only workshop in Lebanon that deals with Glassblowing. And we inherited his craft over generations in the -- Sarafand, south of Lebanon. This is a very difficult craft because it is all hand-made with equipment such as tweezers, blowpipes and scissors. Our furnace operates on diesel oxygen and gasoline. And when the furnace is turned on, it needs to be running for a minimum of 24 hours non-stop. The furnace needs three days to heat up, the brick needs two days and an additional day for the glass to melt. Only then can we start working on the craft, when -- glass melts into sticky glue-like texture. There are people who prefer purchasing products from stores that are machine-made. And there are people who appreciate the beauty of hand-made products that are filled with hard work and soul. That is their difference. Not many know we recycle glass. And the largest amount we received was after the Beirut explosion. We are still using the glass to this day, more than two years after the incident. We also had many clients who exported the crafted glass abroad. And many purchased the products. The support and demand were high after they knew it was from the explosion. This is our past, present and future. If God wills, we will continue this path for our future generations. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
