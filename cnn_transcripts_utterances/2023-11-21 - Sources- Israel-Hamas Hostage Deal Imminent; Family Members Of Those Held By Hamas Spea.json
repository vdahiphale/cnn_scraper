      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga, in for Jake Tapper.We start with the breaking news. At any moment, a deal could be reached to release some hostages taken from Israel by Hamas on October 7th. Now, right now, the full Israeli cabinet is meeting to give what is believed to be a final approval of the deal. Just moments ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the cabinet to support the deal, but reminded cabinet members and the world, quote, we are at war and we will continue the war. As of now, here is what we know about the deal framework. Out of roughly 240 people kidnapped by Hamas, 50 would be released. Hostages who remain in Gaza under negotiations will be visited by the Red Cross. Three Palestinian prisoners in Israel would be freed for every civilian hostage released. And it also calls for a 4 to 5-day pause in fighting. CNN is learning that the majority of hostages who would be released in this deal are children. One of the children's three year old Abigail Idan. The youngest American held hostage whose parents were killed by Hamas. Abigail's great aunt spoke to CNN today, and was understandably emotional at the prospect of seeing her niece come home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ HIRSH NAFTALI, GREAT AUNT OF 3-YEAR-OLD HOSTAGE AVIGAIL IDAN: When I think about that on Friday, it is Abigail's fourth birthday. And she should be home with her family, and with her sister and brother. And she isn't right now. It's just -- it's just like you get your emotions, you have to keep them in check. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOLODRYGA: THE LEAD has this covered across the globe. CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Washington. Becky Anderson is in Doha. But let's start with CNN's Oren Liebermann who is in Tel Aviv. Oren, so a deal is said to be imminent, one more do we know about the potential framework?",

      "sentences": "As you pointed out, Bianna, the main points here are the exchange of hostages for prisoners, 50 Israeli hostages, women and children. Mostly children, in exchange at a 3 to 1 ratio over 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, once again, women and children.Now, the release of hostages wouldn't be all at once. It would be about ten a day playing out over the 4 to 5-day pause in the fighting. It's unclear for Palestinian prisoners, if they would be released, or if that would happen all at once. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is right now leading a cabinet meeting to try to get this over the line. There is a long legal and political process that they have to go to, first, the war cabinet, which is a very small group around Netanyahu, that's done already. Then the security cabinet which is slightly larger, that, too, is done. But now, it's the full cabinet where some of Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners have already come out and said that they oppose this deal. Still, Netanyahu made the argument that even with the pause in the fighting, it is the right decision here to bring home that first group of hostages. He promises that the fighting will continue. According to his office, which released a statement a short time ago, part of this agreement is that the Red Cross would be able to visit and provide medicine to the hostages who remain in Gaza. That was a big demand of the families of the hostages who have repeatedly said, look, international law requires a Red Cross visit and any negotiation make sure this happens. So Netanyahu's office is saying that they have delivered on this. Bianna, there is one other part here. There's a 24-hour window in which you could file appeals to the Supreme Court to try to stop this deal. But right now, Netanyahu is pushing us forward quickly.",

      "sentences": "Well, that is understanding. I have a statement from the mediation chain just a little earlier today, just about an hour or so ago. Let me just read out what it said, because I think that this will speak very much to your question.The proposal for a humanitarian pause, and the release of hostages was delivered to the Israeli side in the early hours of this morning. It is now midnight. This came after weeks of continuous negotiations, the state of Qatar is awaiting the result of the Israeli governments vote on the proposal. I was told, by a diplomatic source very close to the talks, that it is with the Israeli side that Hamas has signed off on this, and that once they get this greenlight by the Israelis, they can announce this deal. So the understanding is that this point they need to have the green light from the Israeli side, Hamas has signed off on this, and then they will -- assuming there is no detailed change, one assumes, this is the -- what the Israelis agree -- will be discussing at present, and they hope that there will be an agreement on it, is a proposal. If that has changed, of course, then all bets are off, I guess. No deal is done until it is done. But this proposal now sits with the Israelis. Once that announcement comes, that will trigger the process which, as Oren described it, is this period of pause, this four-day period of pause which 50 hostages, mostly children, we are told, there are 40 children, according to the IDF being held in Gaza by Hamas. Mostly children will be announced -- released, and as we have heard from the prime minister's office, the Red Cross will be able to get ground to those hostages currently being held by Hamas, as we understand it. That's the 50 that we are talking about, who are being released in batches, as a tour. Then, as Hamas gathers more, so the Red Cross will be able to get to see those hostages as well. But at this point, it is only 50 to be released in this first four-day window. Those are the details as we understand them today.",

Obviously, there's a lot to be filled in here, but according to the White House's John Kirby, once the agreement is in place and these hostages are on their way out of Gaza, they will get safe passage into Israel. So they could cross into Israel through Egypt, through the Rafah Crossing, or through one of those crossings that go directly into Israel.Now, we don't expect Hamas and Israel to come face to face to do this exchange, there will probably be at least one middle man, that could be the Red Cross, which we saw being used in previous hostage releases. It could also be Egypt, so these prisoners could go into Egypt, before going into Israel. Once they are in Israel, we understand that they would immediately get medical attention. Remember, these hostages have been held for about six and a half weeks on what the White House called abhorrent conditions. So they will get immediate medical conditions. Some could get long term medical needs. And then, because many of them, we understand our dual nationals, the question then becomes how to get them home if they want to get other countries, and the White House is saying that the State Department would help.

BARAK RAVID, POLITICAL &amp; FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER, AXIOS: Well, I don't know if we are going to learn them but definitely the Israeli government is going to know them ahead of time, at least ahead of every day of pause. It's going to work like that. In the evening, before they are released, the Israeli government will receive a list of something like 12 hostages that are going to be released on the next day, and this will happen again and again and again until all of the 50 hostages will be released.

You don't anticipate that that's going to happen. And you also have 18 and 19 year old soldiers on the ground that have to make split-second decisions., and they have the right of self defense. So they're going to continue to conduct patrols, they're going to continue to protect themselves, and suddenly you are in a circumstance, you know what is going on, something comes rushing by you, and all of a sudden, you have an engagement. That has the real potential of escalating, and it has been indicated, it could scuttle the deal.

And during that cease-fire, Hamas just decided to violated and attack Israeli forces in Rafah and kidnap a soldier.So I think that this lesson from 2014 is not only in the head of IDF commanders, it's also in the head of Benjamin Netanyahu who is in the prime minister also.

Now, it is our interpretation that that means that the first tranche, these 50 hostages, this is something Israel has been pushing for four weeks to get that Red Cross to come in and check on these hostages.Does that at least give you some solids that hopefully weather now or later this allows for the opportunity for Sagui to have a visit from the Red Cross as well? DEKEL-CHEN: Well, you know, that's been -- if we are able to demand anything, the 240 hostage families would be a demand to the degree that we can from the Red Cross that they do absolutely everything in their power to visit with all of the hostages. Not just this first tranche, but all of them, to at least in some measure give us signs of life, signs of health, because we have had the majority of us have had absolutely no implication of what condition they are in. And I think that this is a clear sign of who we are dealing with. A terrorist organization that will not even allow the Red Cross to perform its most basic functions. And so, what we've been asking for, for now, over seven weeks is for that to happen and for all of the hostages.",

And this was a very significant escalation by these Iranian proxy groups which to date have launched roughly 64 attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, because they used a ballistic missile.Now, ballistic missiles -- they can travel a far greater length than the rockets and drones that these Iraq, Iran-backed groups have been using in the past. They can carry much larger warheads. It is a generally a pretty significant escalation that the use this ballistic missile to launch this attack and U.S. military actually responded to this attack and they launched their own strike when a vehicle inside Iraq that they say was being used to carry some of those militants responsible for carrying out this strike on this airbase. Now importantly, the U.S. military says that there were no significant injuries to U.S. forces from this attack and no significant damage. But, look, I mean, this is really, you know, over 60 times now, this is happened where this Iran-backed militias have attacked U.S. forces and it has resulted in scores of injuries among U.S. members, including more than two dozen service members who have suffered traumatic brain injuries. So, the question now is whether these retaliatory strikes by the U.S. are actually working -- Bianna.",

So, the Pentagon did reveal to us recently that they have communicated directly with the Iranians telling them that they expect the Iranians to rein in these proxy groups because the U.S. is prepared to continue responding in force if these attacks do not stop. However, these strikes that these Iran-backed proxy groups have been launching, they have not stopped. They only continue. And more than 50 so far U.S. service members have suffered injuries ranging from traumatic brain injury to more serious brain injuries. So, it's clearly a big concern for the Pentagon, Brianna.",

Investigators say Clark took off in a white pick up truck. The person injured is a woman and she is expected to survive.
