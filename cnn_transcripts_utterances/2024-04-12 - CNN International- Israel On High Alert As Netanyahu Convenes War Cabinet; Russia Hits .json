Amid tensions between Israel and Iran, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu convening his war cabinet. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson needs a critical win on Capitol Hill, and it looks like he may get it, over a controversial surveillance bill, the vote and his upcoming meeting with Donald Trump, a little later this hour. And speaking of the former President, important updates to bring you on the Trump classified documents case and his upcoming hush money trial in New York. We'll have what you need to know. We want to begin this hour with Israel on high alert as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convenes his war cabinet to discuss the threat of a possible attack by Iran. Tensions in the region are running high after Iran vowed to retaliate for a deadly attack on its consulate in Damascus last week. The U.S. has sent the top military commander to Israel, warning that Iran or its proxies could carry out an imminent attack on U.S. or Israeli assets in the region. And even as it prepares for possible new front, Israel is keeping up the war on Gaza, killing dozens of people in new airstrikes as the humanitarian crisis there deepens. The top U.S. humanitarian official now saying that it is quote \"credible to assess that famine is already happening in some parts of Gaza.\" Let's bring in our -- CNN's Ben Wedeman. He is following the developments from Beirut. Ben, from the U.S. to the Kremlin, everyone seems to be on the same page here that a wider war in that region would be destabilizing. What's the latest one on the ground there about these threats from Iran and the reaction from Israel?",

Now, in Israel, that war cabinet convened by Prime Minister Netanyahu is still ongoing. So, we don't know what's going to come out of that. But, we've heard from the White House, John Kirby, the Spokesman for the National Security Council, saying that the White House is watching the situation, in his words, very, very closely. He describes that the Iranian threats are indeed very critical, credible that is, and he also said that the United States is in constant communication with the Israelis.Now, it's worth noting that when the Israelis bombed the Iranian consulate in Damascus on the first of April, they weren't in very close contact with the Americans. U.S. officials said they were not consulted by Israel before that strike took place. Now, the head of U.S. CENTCOM, the central command, is in Israel today. He met with Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, at an airbase in Israel. The Israeli Defense Minister saying that we are prepared to defend ourselves on the ground and in the air. We will know how to respond. Now, the Iranians have said that they are going to respond. However, we did hear from Iranian officials today, saying that if the United Nations Security Council had condemned the attack on the Israeli -- the Iranian consulate in Damascus, perhaps Iran would not feel compelled to respond. But then again, we do not know where, when, how the Iranians are actually going to respond. Obviously, nerves are on edge. But, we're hearing loads of speculation about it could be any day now. But, we are, what, well over 10 days since that attack took place. Rahel.",

Ben thanks so much.Well, Ukraine's critical infrastructure is coming under increased Russian attack. The largest power generating plant in the Kyiv region was destroyed by a missile attack on Thursday. The plant is the largest supplier of electricity to three Ukrainian regions. Ukraine's Air Force says that it was able to shoot down 18 Russian missiles and 39 drones. The Centrenergo energy company says that it has now lost 100 percent of its power generation across its three plants, which have all been destroyed or occupied by Russia. And officials in Ukraine are worried about these constant attacks on power infrastructure, as CNN's Fred Pleitgen explains, crews cannot make the repairs quickly enough and new military options may be needed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Kyiv's largest power plant destroyed, the energy company, Centrenergo, declaring Thursday, quote \"a black day\". The dark smoke on the skyline marking the end of the company's energy supply, all three of its power plants across the country either destroyed or occupied. Russian strikes systematically targeting power facilities have been a constant in Ukraine since late 2022, but have ramped up in recent weeks. DTEK, Ukraine's largest power company, saying two of their plants were also targeted overnight. They say their facilities have suffered their worst attacks this month since the war began, with 80 percent of their infrastructure already destroyed. Employees trying to repair and to rebuild, the burnt-out skeleton of their facilities needing to be back up and running as soon as possible, echoing each other's calls for the world to ramp up its weapons support. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): We need more air defenses. If we don't have air defenses, there won't be anything left. A lot of missiles and drones get through, and we get a lot of hits. PLEITGEN (voice-over): It's a call heard many times over, with the Ukrainian President currently in Lithuania to meet European leaders and to ensure those calls do not become white noise in this very long war. Warnings by generals also becoming more desperate, with the country's parliament voting on Thursday to overhaul mobilization rules, potentially allowing the military to call up more men. GEN. YURIY SODOL, COMMANDER, JOINT FORCES OF UKRAINE (Interpreted): The enemy outnumbers us by seven to 10 times. We lack manpower. We are holding the defenses on the last breath. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The bill still needing to be signed into law by Zelenskyy, is a sign of an exhausted frontline.

But, at this hearing, it's his co-defendants, Carlos De Oliveira and Walt Nauta, two people who work for Trump, who are alleged to have moved boxes and are charged as part of that obstruction conspiracy where the Justice Department couldn't get the national security records Donald Trump had in his possession and had to give back to the federal government. They couldn't get them back and didn't.So, at 2 p.m., the hearing begins before Judge Aileen Cannon. It's going to be legal arguments that will boil down to Carlos De Oliveira's lawyers and Walt Nauta's lawyers, arguing to the judge that they didn't know enough when they were moving boxes to face these charges alongside Donald Trump. That's what it boils down to. Some of their arguments include that the case should be dismissed because they weren't aware of the benefit to Donald Trump, and in this investigation of moving those boxes that they do acknowledge they moved out of the storage room, around the property. They also are saying that they didn't have a full understanding of the investigation that they are allegedly to have obstructed at that time, and they also didn't know what was in them. So, this is a hearing about these two co-defendants, but it is going to put a spotlight on an important part of the case, the obstruction charges against them and Donald Trump, that make this case so significant.",

He became a witness in the Mar-a-Lago documents case and then continued on working for Trump on the January 6 case. But now, Kaitlan Collins has reported he has formally left the team. Why it's so important is he too is a cornerstone of this obstruction part of the Mar-a-Lago documents case.The federal government, the Justice Department compelled him to turn over any information he had to speak to the grand jury, and he did, and what he provided to the investigators that became part of the indictment is what he knew of Donald Trump signaling to him. He didn't want to turn over all of the federal records, when he had to, and ultimately, Evan Corcoran did his part to provide records back to the government that he could find in the storage room at Mar-a-Lago. But, he somehow didn't find them all at that time. Those are the boxes that had been moved out of there. So now, Evan Corcoran leaving the team is the solidification of this split, where he has become a main witness. He is Trump attorney one. And we're about to see in the coming months, in this case, Rahel, how a fight over whether the Justice Department is going to be able to put him on the stand at the trial before the jury to testify against his former boss.",

Now, in my conversations with Trump's advisors, they say that this event is being held to highlight and draw attention to what they are arguing are state proposals and lawsuits to have non-citizens voting in the election, excuse me.And so, I think one thing that just to keep in mind, and I think is very important to point out, is that there is already a federal ban on non-citizens from voting in elections. But, this has really become a somewhat of a rallying cry for Republicans ahead of November. And Donald Trump himself has gone so far as to claim that Democrats want undocumented immigrants traveling into the country in order to vote in the election. Of course, there is no evidence of that actually happening. Now, there is some nuance to this as well, Rahel, and that is that in some cities across the country, they do allow some non-citizens to vote in certain elections, but it is not a widespread problem, and some of those elections include school board elections, local elections, things like that. But again, something that they're really trying to emphasize and link to immigration, which has become such a huge issue for many voters in the country. Now, according to our colleagues Melanie Zanona and Kristen Holmes, another focal point of this event today is going to be re-litigating the 2020 election. And remember, both Donald Trump and Mike Johnson very much peddled false claims of fraud in the 2020 election in their attempts to overturn the results. And so, that's really going to be playing a big role in their messaging today. And one thing I also just want to point out is that they are billing this as a press conference. However, it's still unclear if they're actually going to take questions. When I talked to Trump's team, they say that they do expect them to take questions. But, of course, they sometimes say that and it doesn't always happen. So, we'll see what happens later today, Rahel.",

There had been some talk of doing some sort of statement or policy rollout regarding what they are calling election integrity and laying out what I explained before about non-citizens voting in elections. But, instead, Johnson wanted to make this a joint event and appear alongside Donald Trump. And it all comes down to really these threats that he is facing. Mike Johnson has only been Speaker for a few months, but he has already seen a series of his votes fail on the House floor, something other speakers like Nancy Pelosi have never had happened while they were Speaker. And so, this is really a perilous time for him. And so, that's part of this push.The other thing that we're hearing is that he is going to Mar-a-Lago with something else at the top of his mind, and that is Ukraine funding. It's been a huge issue that Republicans have squabbled over for months now. And I think part of what Johnson wants to do today is figure out where does Donald Trump stand on this, and would he defend him if they bring some type of Ukraine aid to the floor? And so, that'll be another thing we're keeping track of and how that goes today. And there are behind-the-scenes conversations around that meeting.",

The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumer Sentiment shows that at 77.9. That's slightly down from last month, although still well above record lows from summer of 2022, but below pre-pandemic levels. The new data comes on the heels of two disappointing inflation reports, pushing stocks lower this week. Let me bring in Matt Egan now.

Consumer spending is the biggest driver of the economy. There is also obviously political implications. And so, the latest numbers, as you mentioned, they dipped, not a major drop, but a dip within the margin of error. And the trend is what we look at. And so, the trend is really showing that consumer sentiment has kind of stalled out. Right? On the right side of the screen, you can see the last few months sort of going sideways. The good news is sentiment has rebounded, no doubt, from two years ago when inflation was really, really hot.I think the bad news is that consumer sentiment remains well below pre-COVID levels, on the left side of that screen. And I think this reflects ongoing concerns about the cost of living. Right? I mean, housing, car insurance. The price to get your car repaired. Energy, obviously, is a huge one. We know gas prices are ticking up. As we're speaking, oil prices are up another two percent, signaling higher gas prices to come. The other important element of this report, Rahel, is what people think is going to happen on the inflation front. And I think there is some negative news in this report for the Federal Reserve, because it showed that consumers are anticipating inflation to heat up, that prices will be going up at a faster rate in one year from now and also in three years from now. So, that's another thing that we should keep in mind because that really goes to how people are feeling.",

But, one thing that companies have had to sort of deal with, because it's been such a strong labor market, is trying to retain talent.

We know that a lot of companies, they're desperate right now to attract talent, but also hold on to the workers they have and make sure they don't burn out. And so, this new survey from KPMG found that 30 percent of CEOs of large companies in the United States, they are exploring changes to the work schedule, including a four-day or a four and a half day workweek, which is, I was struck by how high that number is. Now, they would not have to sell workers on it. Right? Workers love this idea. There is a Gallup poll that shows 77 percent of U.S. workers, they support a four-day workweek. It's pretty hard to get 77 percent of Americans to agree on anything, but they're on board with this idea.Now, I did talk to Paul Knopp, the CEO of KPMG U.S., and he said, listen, yes, companies are going to explore what this idea. But, no, he doesn't think it's imminent just yet. And he said, listen, it's going to work for some industries and some companies and some workers. It wouldn't work for everyone. But, there is some research out there showing that in the U.S. and in Europe, when companies have tried this, they've liked it. They have found that there were improvements for worker well-being, improvements for worker productivity. So, I don't know. Rahel, what do you think?

Simpson, warping (ph) the nation's attention for a final time on Thursday. His death leaving behind a complicated legacy, the trial of the century for the killing of Simpson's ex-wife and her friend, the United American, while also exposing its divisions. 30 years later, another high-profile case takes the spotlight. The hush money trial against former President Donald Trump begins on Monday.I want to bring in Michael Smerconish, who joins us now with his thoughts on this tumultuous week. Michael, if I could just start with this news that Evan Corcoran, Trump's lawyer, is formally departing the team, possibly a key witness in the Mar-a-Lago case. That can't be good for any client who is sort of watching their lawyer now leave, and also potentially a prosecutor's witness. I mean, what are your thoughts here? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\", &amp; CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I've always thought that the Mar-a-Lago case was the most straightforward and posed the most legal peril for former President Trump, if it should ever get to trial. Among the four indictments that he is currently facing, it just seemed to me, Rahel, to be the most clear-cut because they have the videotaped evidence. They also have apparently a number of text communications that are damning of the former President. The issue that you're raising is a reminder to me of the extraordinary nature of this case because they were able to pierce the attorney-client privilege. And so, I'm not surprised that Corcoran would leave. I don't know how, frankly, he could stay. But, I've always thought that that issue is probably the appellate issue for Trump, but that he ought to be concerned if that case ever gets to trial.",

It's been really fascinating to watch some of the reactions. Obviously, O.J. was an extremely controversial figure, and even in his death, sparking a lot of conversation. What do you think his legacy and his life revealed about the U.S.?",

I was so angry that I really couldn't understand, and I don't know that I really wanted to understand what enabled if it were jury nullification for that verdict to come in, and I get it now, in retrospect, having done a lot of reading on this, watched a number of documentaries that it just became so much larger than O.J. for people of color in Los Angeles at that time, and the way in which they perceived the LAPD having treated their community and of course, the Rodney King situation. He became a symbol of all that, and it was an opportunity for -- this is probably a bad word choice, but a leveling of the playing surface. And to the detriment of the Goldman and Brown families.So, the other legacy, I think, Rahel, is this. I'm a big believer that there ought to be cameras anywhere the public's business is being done. And one of the setbacks for the movement of having cameras in courtrooms was the O.J. case because the perception has been, well, that's what it gets you. No. This was the aberrant case. The judges, pardon me, the judge in this case, Judge Ito, lost control of the courtroom, but this is not what every televised trial would be like, and I wish the Trump trial would be televised.",

And Rahel, he said to me today, do you know that at the time of the O.J. trial, there were not legal analysts on the payroll of the cable affiliates? And like, look now, we know the personalities who show up on CNN and on the different affiliates because it's become so much an accepted, a necessary part of our culture.
