A source telling CNN, police were tracking 28-year-old Bryan Kohlberger as he drove cross country from Idaho to his parents' home in Pennsylvania around Christmas time. The rest comes seven weeks after those four University of Idaho students were stabbed multiple times as they slept. A source telling CNN, DNA found at the scene was entered into a genealogy database. And that helped crack the case. The suspect identified as a graduate student in criminology who made a chilling social media post trying to solicit information from criminals to \"understand how emotional and psychological traits influence decision making when committing a crime.\" Now CNN's Jean Casarez is following the latest developments for us.

[13:05:09] At the same time the questions were very probing. We didn't plan for this when you left your house. What were you thinking as you carried out the crime? How did you feel afterwards? It says if he wants to be an expert on the criminal mind, and I have no idea if he even got any responses to that survey. It's -- for some people who are psychologically disturbed, they cross over and believe the only way they can be an expert is to actually experience something firsthand.

But after the crimes, they said he was far more animated.He was trying really hard to talk to people. And this would be consistent. What I've seen firsthand interviewing murderers who talk about a high -- after their crime, from the thrill of accomplishing something that they fantasize. Again, Mr. Kohlberger is innocent until proven guilty, but that long drive -- distant with a normal timeline. In other words, he's acting normal, finishes up his semester, drives home for Christmas. But it also gave him 38 hours of driving in which he may have disposed of a murder weapon. So, very difficult if we plan to get that knife, I don't think he has it any longer. And I don't think we'll ever find it. But -- far would have raised some eyebrows. So, it was the car that brought him down.

To -- they do it because they are experimenting and -- but feel normal emotions in their everyday lives who are detached, they wonder to what heights they have to go to feel something.

DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, AUTHOR &amp; PROFESSOR, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE OF LAW: A number of former IRS auditors have been in touch to me and they all come to the same conclusion I do. A lot of these numbers do not appear to be consistent and appear to be just made up. That would be entirely consistent with Donald's behavior where he would tell someone he was worth X dollars and, hours later, on the same day, he would tell somebody else twice that much. Donald has a long history of manufacturing numbers. REID: He always argued that he uses the tax system in a way that advantages him, and that makes him, quote, \"smart.\" What you're suggesting is he made things up, which could potentially legally be tax fraud. Is that what you're seeing, it wasn't just coloring a little outside the lines but potentially criminal behavior?",

Where his -- his using a tax form in which he said he had a business with no revenue, but $600,000 of expenses, that -- and no records of expenses that that was civil tax fraud.
