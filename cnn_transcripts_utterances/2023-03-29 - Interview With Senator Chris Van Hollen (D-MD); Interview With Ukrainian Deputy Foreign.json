But the people of the United States, according to a recent Gallup poll shows support for Israel's somewhat being recalibrated, if not declining. The decline is most pronounced amongst Democrats, who now are evenly divided in their support for Israelis and Palestinians. And apparently, according to this poll, there's been a sort of a decadelong decline in the kind of blind support, if you like.

And we are concerned that it's not the United States, but actually President Xi that is attempting to change the status quo on China. With respect to the visit of President Tsai, this is, I believe, going to be her sixth visit to the United States in seven years. She'll be transiting the United States. And as to who decides to meet with her and whether the speaker meets with her, these are decisions by American elected officials. And, you know, China does not get to dictate who and when American officials meet with Taiwanese officials.

I do want to point out, Christiane, that as part of a side deal, apparently, to postpone consideration of the judicial law, Prime Minister Netanyahu allowed Ben-Gvir has given him the green light to go ahead with forming this kind of national guard under the jurisdiction of Ben-Gvir. And there are very legitimate concerns that this could be used as a Ben-Gvir militia. Because Ben-Gvir has a history of inciting violence against Israeli Arabs. So, it's important to follow all the twists and turns. Yes, they postponed it. But in this case, Ben-Gvir was apparently given the green light to go ahead with forming the so-called national guard. So, there's a lot to follow and I do think, you know, while there are connections and between what's happening with respect to the attack on the Israeli court system, we also have to remember there's also the ongoing issue of, you know, protecting, preserving the prospects of a future two-state solution, protecting the human rights of Palestinians. And of course, we're in a very combustible moment during the Holy days of three major religions in the Holyland. And the Biden administration has been trying to broker different agreements to lower the temperature. What I expressed the other day and the committee hearing was the fact that Prime Minister Netanyahu had within 24 hours of reaching these agreements undermine them, violated them by beginning to talk about expansion of settlements again. So, a lot going on. A lot of different moving parts. And I'm glad that you and I are here talking about what's happening there and around the world.",

We have the first shipment of German and British tanks that has arrived, that -- they have arrived in Ukraine, but more should be more should be performed.

First, every way is not only physical aspect, not only the conventional war that we see atthe battlefield, but it's mostly about the spirit. And, of course, any defeat of Russian army impacts and has its affect. So, of course, an -- likewise, the victories -- tactical victories of Ukrainian army is a huge step towards raising this spirit because every army needs it. I mean, Ukrainian army critically needs this. So, I think that Bakhmut is a critical point to hold this spirit up to keep on counter offensive, because you know that we've been preparing for a serious counter offensive, which might take place soon. So, for that reason, any success is important. When it comes to the, let's say, peace broking and peace initiatives of China, I mean, we have been repeatedly saying that any peace negotiation or any peace formula or any peace initiative is OK on the parity basis. President Zelensky many times vocal that he is ready to talk to any leader, especially to the Chinese leader when it comes to the resolution of peace, and if China is really serious about it will consider parity basis, it will consider that the involvement of all parties to the war, because after the visit to Moscow, obviously, there should be a direct dialogue between President Zelenskyy and Xi Jinping. So, I think it's critical for -- if any country is really serious about the initiative about the resolution of the war. And then to, conclude myself, our president initiated the peace formula, which is 10 simple steps that should be a basis of any negotiation. And territorial integrity and sovereignty is the very fundamental things. So, the rest, any initiatives that does not include this simple formula are not negotiable for Ukraine.",

In the peace formula of President Zelensky, nuclear security is the very fundamental issue. So, I think what we see as the message -- and by the way, Lukashenko has not commented yet these messages, to my knowledge. If I'm not mistaken. I didn't have a chance to follow it. But I think that this is something that is usual for Russia, to blackmail, to always raise the stake of the messages that come from Russia. And the reason for that is actually to hold in fear the whole International Community. And unfortunately, sometimes it's a case. But Ukraine -- let me be very clear that, I mean, we are, of course, sometimes scared, but we are not panic because if -- that brings us to numbness, it means that Russia has accomplished its goals.

It seems like every week there's another mass shooting, and those are the ones people hear about. There are so many shootings across the country. It was 100 people a day due to gun violence. The largest mass shooting is actually not one event, but the multiple instances of gun violence that happened in black and brown communities across the country. The devastating amount of white middle age rural Americans who will take their life with a gun in a day as well. And so, there's just a lot of work that needs to be done on this issue.",

The situation right now is the Republicans have a slim majority and they are focused on not bills that are going to help people but bills that will help set themselves up. So, you know, keep the House and run for president in two years -- less than two years. And I'm not making this up. Jim Jordan, one of them, you know, most senior members of that party said it himself that the next two years are going to be about setting themselves up in terms of messaging and et cetera for the election, and we see that in the bills coming up. I mean, look at the bills I've had an oversight. I had one that was called the Biden investigation, then a colon, the Department of Treasury, like it's some sort of movie title. I had another one that was the hunter Biden laptop Twitter files, part one. You know, when's part two? You know, it's like it's all theatrics, and it's all messaging and not about affordable housing, not about helping foreign working-class families not about helping to end gun violence in our communities, supporting small businesses, none of that.

On space, science and technology, which is the other committee I sit on, that's more of a bipartisan committee. We are hoping that we can work together among the environmental subcommittee, work together in terms of resiliency against the impacts of the climate crisis but also, preventative measures. And we're not going to get the green new deal this year or next year, but what we can get are, you know, smaller, incremental steps to hopefully, you know, appropriate money in the right way where we can actually prevent the climate crisis and put money in the hands of community groups that are doing great work in terms of resiliency, but also in terms of preventative measures in reducing emissions. And so, those are just one of the examples on gun violence. I just filed my first bill last week. It's the Creative Federal Office of Gun Violence Prevention. It's a bicameral piece of legislation, which means that it also was introduced in the Senate. I worked with Senator Chris Murphy on it. We introduced it at the same day with advocates and survivors surrounding us. That is a bill that has enough. It's not gun policy, it's just a department to research data and provide good recommendations on any gun violence. And I hope that because it's not, you know, \"gun policy\" and it's more about creating an office that we can get some Republican support on it, is it going to end gun violence, the creation of the office immediately? No. But it's providing a daily solution to a daily problem.",

And that mission right now is a messaging for the next election cycle. The next two years are one big campaign. And I think, you know, as you look at these committee hearings and you look up the pieces of legislation we're voting on, like this parental bill of rights last week that we voted on that talks, you know, apparently, it gives parents rights. It doesn't do that at all, actually. And it doesn't even talk about the rights of students to not get shot in their classroom. If Republicans in Congress actually cared about what's going on at schools, why don't they do something on these school shootings? Why don't they do something to ensure that children actually have nutrition in schools? Why don't they do something to ensure that teachers have equitable pay and that they have the materials that they need so students can learn? No. It's a cycle, right, defund public education, blame public education on all the problems and then, try to privatize the system. And then, you know, we have this shooting just less than a week after we voted on this parental bill of rights. So, it's a very horrible irony. But, you know, there is just a lot of work to do.",

You know, there's ahuge vacuum in impacted folks being able to actually talk about what's going on in Florida because there's this culture of fear right now in the state. When I speak with teachers, superintendents, et cetera, they're scared to speak out because they will literally get fired. You know, for instance, we had a high school, Boone High School, that they have -- they've had this event for a long time, years and years. It's called Dragon Donuts. And there's a drag queen in Central Florida that comes in and it's not a drag show, not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's a conversation with the drag queen about the work that they do in the community as far as feeding people and small business and et cetera. And so, this -- you know, the state essentially told the school board and told the district that they need to shut this down across. They're also going to fire anyone associated with it, teachers, administrators, et cetera. So, we essentially have this like fascist Florida government right now that is using, abusing its powers to scare people into submission to doing what they want. And so, that includes -- you know, it's difficult for legislators to speak out. We saw happens to State Attorney Andrew Warren in Hillsborough County where because he was vocal, he was suspended from office by Ron DeSantis, which was unconstitutional. But there's one -- there's a group of people he can't touch and its members of Congress, it's students. So -- and so, that's why we're seeing a lot of students step up and be the voice for what's going on in the State of Florida. I'll be there alongside with them. We're also encouraging -- I think President Biden and the administration need to do a lot more. The DOJ needs to do a lot more. We need the attorney general involved with what's going on in Florida. We need the Department of Education to launch an investigation on what's going on in terms of don't say gay. So, we need leadership from that point. So, you know, my two things are, number one, ensuring people know about it, being vocal about it, being vocal in the communities, hosting events and rallies so that way people understand what's going on. And then, also, pushing the levers of power that we do have. Because, you know, you're right. I'm a representative. I hold no executive powers. I don't have any departments that I run. All I have is my influence and my ability to, you know, bring the subject to bear at the national level. And so, we'll do that in in big ways.",
