      "sentences": "Well, it's simply put, it's just a rapidly intensifying storm. For a storm to be characterized as a bomb cyclone, it has to drop 24 millibars in 24 hours. And millibars are basically a unit of measurement to define atmospheric pressure.So, this one is going to bomb out as we say over the Great Lakes. That's where it's going to be its strongest. We see this a lot of times with nor'easters off offshore. We'll see them turn into bomb cyclones. This one is well inland as we know and it is going to intensify rapidly as we know that it's going to be a bomb cyclone eventually. So, over the Midwest, this is going to be the hardest hit area, we could see a foot of snow. We'll see blizzard conditions across portions of western Minnesota. Those blizzard-like conditions could extend into Chicago. Even though they're not going to get that much snow, the conditions there will be blizzard-like. We're also going to see 12 to 18 inches of snow across portions of Michigan. So, this is going to be a big one. It's going to disrupt travel, especially. Tomorrow is going to be the worst day through Chicago. We'll see a ripple effect across the eastern seaboard across the big cities on the I 95 Corridor, heavy rain and then there's the disruption from the Midwest flight cancellations will also impact the East Coast. Wind chill forecasts 50 below zero in Casper, Des Moines 30 below zero. This is going to be a trend extending all the way to the south where we could see more than 80 hours below freezing. So, if you are -- you are missing out on the snow, you're definitely not going to miss out on the cold. This is going to be a historic, historic event, Kate.",

And, of course, we're receiving some of those ripples as well.And all of this is before the most significant winter weather is expected to hit here which again is forecast to come a little bit later tomorrow afternoon. That said, people are already changing their plans to try and get out ahead of those conditions. They don't want to risk it at all.

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely, Kate. This is a huge blow to women's rights in Afghanistan. And may not have come as a total surprise, considering the rollbacks we've seen in the rights and freedoms of women over the last few months, but certainly a huge blow and a moment of devastation, really, for the women and girls hoping to pursue higher education in Afghanistan. It's been just a few months since we saw women taking their entrance exams for those University places, and certainly a major shock for them.But of course, we have seen those rights being rolled back just in March of this year. We saw girls being told that they wouldn't be able to return to secondary education and in universities. We've seen classes being segregated. Women being told that they shouldn't be taught by young male professors. And so clearly, the Taliban is taking a harsher approach and tougher restrictions when it comes to education and in general, when it comes to his fundamental rights and freedoms in Afghanistan. And this has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community, not least from the U.S. government. We heard yesterday from the State Department showing their condemnation of this latest edict. We heard yesterday as well from the State Department spokesperson, Ned Price. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: The Taliban have permanently sentenced Afghan women to a darker and more barren future without opportunity. No country can thrive when half of its population is arbitrarily held back. Education is an internationally recognized human right. And it is essential to Afghanistan's economic growth and its stability. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. You know, we got a positive surprise this morning. We learned that consumer confidence unexpectedly popped in December to an eight-month high. This news went over very well here on Wall Street where we saw the stock market move up sharply higher on these numbers.And when you dig into the report, there's a lot to like here. I mean consumers, they marked up their expectations of the current economy. They also mark down their expectations of inflation. More people are planning to book a vacation. No surprise that this rebound in consumer confidence is happening at a time when gas prices have plunged to 17-month lows. That, of course, is a huge confidence booster. One thing to watch out for, though, is that the outlook for consumers going ahead for the next few months in the economy, that has improved but it does remain near recession territory. Now, one part of the economy that is still really hurting right now is the housing market. And that, of course, is because of the spike in mortgage rates. And we learned today that existing home sales dropped sharply in November to the weakest pace since the spring of 2020. Which is pretty incredible because that's when the real estate market was basically brought to a standstill by COVID. But, Kate, if there is a silver lining here for home buyers, it's that home prices continue to cool off. It does increasingly feel like this housing market has shifted from a buyer's market -- from a seller's market to a buyers' market. And that, of course, is a welcome shift for homebuyers.",
