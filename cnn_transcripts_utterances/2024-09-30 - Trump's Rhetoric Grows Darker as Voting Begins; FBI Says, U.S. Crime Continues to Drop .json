(END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera):  Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. Donald Trump taps into American carnage as voting gets underway across the country. And is he getting policy ideas from a B-list Hollywood movie? Well, that's because what he is saying sounds like it was ripped from the pages of The Purge. It's a movie franchise, but here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A guy named Cesar Sayoc sent pipe bombs to this building, or to the other building that CNN used to be in, and tried to kill people. Donald Trump says things that can get people hurt.

This is what they are describing as a limited ground operation. They are calling this limited, localized and targeted ground raids.But make no mistake, this is a major inflection point in this nearly year-long conflict now between Israel and Hezbollah. And it seems quite clear that between the increased air strikes over the course of the last couple of weeks, the killing of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and now the entry of ground forces into southern Lebanon, that this is a war between Israel and Hezbollah. And Israel is now trying to take advantage of this moment of disarray within Hezbollah's leadership, the effect that they have had on Hezbollah's operational capabilities over the course of the last week by taking this next step of sending ground forces into Lebanon. But Israeli officials tonight are taking pains to try and tell me that this is a limited operation. One senior Israeli official telling me that there is no plan for any kind of long-term occupation of southern Lebanon but they are not saying how deep Israeli forces will ultimately go into Lebanon or how long this operation will actually last. But I can tell you from our position here, just a couple of miles away from the border, we have -- hearing the steady percussive boom of artillery from here being fired into southern Lebanon. We have seen explosions on the Lebanese side, flares lighting the night sky as those ground forces move into southern Lebanon to attack Hezbollah positions. Abby?",

His forces drove all the way to where I am, into Beirut and encircled the western part of the city. So, there is a fear that there isn't any sort of countervailing diplomatic force to restrain Israel. We did hear these rather weak comments coming out of the White House from President Biden about not being happy with a ground incursion but it's going ahead anyway. And we've seen, for instance, the French foreign minister came to Beirut today to try to speak to Lebanese officials and work out the possibility, the framework, the groundwork for some sort of de- escalation of the situation. But on the ground, that doesn't seem to be the case. And there is a fear that history is repeating itself and that perhaps, Israeli ground forces will drive well deep into Lebanon.
