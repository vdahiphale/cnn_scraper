      "sentences": "Good morning. Thanks for getting up early with us. I'm Kasie Hunt. Just a handful of seconds before 5And this morning, the Israeli military has expanded ground combat to all of Gaza after talks between Israel and Hamas collapsed last week. Israel is now warning civilians to evacuate large areas of Gaza, including parts of southern Gaza. The IDF says it's destroyed about 500 tunnels and located more than 800 tunnel shafts, claiming that many were located in civilian areas. Meanwhile Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, over the weekend, said that he has been pushing Israel to work harder at avoiding civilian casualties. He said, quote, \"If you drive Palestinians into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.\" Here is Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN's \"STATE OF THE UNION.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  He's so naive. I mean, I just lost all confidence in this guy. Strategic defeat would be inflaming the Palestinians. They're already inflamed. They're taught from the time they're born to hate the Jews and to kill them. It's like this is a tranquil population only inflamed after Israel goes in to defend itself is really naive. This is a radicalized population. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Colonel, it's always good to have you.What's your reaction to what Lindsey Graham said there about Sec. Austin? He called him naive. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST, AIR FORCE COLONEL (RET.), (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, that's wrong, Kasie. Good morning to you. Yeah, Sec. Austin is anything but naive. And what he was -- what Sec. Austin was referring to was the fact that when you look at polling data for Palestinians in Gaza it was very clear that there was really lukewarm or zero support for Hamas before the 7 October response from Israel. In fact, what's happening now, of course, is because the civilian population is being attacked. They are actually literally being driven into the arms of Hamas just as a way to defend themselves -- or at least in their perception. So for Sen. Graham to say what he said is just factually incorrect. Now, Sen. Graham is correct to say that textbooks and other means of education in the Gaza Strip and very much depicted Israel as the enemy. That is certainly true. But there are ways around that. You've got the example of Nazi Germany being de-Nazified after World War II, and other places going into a similar situation where the ideology of the state has been removed. So be it Russia, for example, is another example. And it's possible to remove that ideology if the population is given concrete examples of better behavior on the part of perceived enemies.",

It's known as the Bab al-Mandab Strait that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. That area is full of all the traffic that comes out of the Suez Canal. So there is a lot of commercial traffic that goes between Asia and the Middle East, and Europe coming through this area.And the fact that it is being put at risk by the Houthis, which is the group that controls a large portion of Yemen and is oh, by the way, supported by Iran, that makes it very difficult for commercial ships to go through this area. The USS Carney, the destroyer that you mentioned, was actively engaged. They had a very busy day over the weekend where they were able to intercept several drones and destroy them. They also aided at least three commercial vessels in fending off attacks and luckily, no one was hurt in this situation. But the problem remains that these shipping lanes are now being put at risk and it could very well impact the economies of the Middle East, Europe, and potentially, even the U.S. Because this is a global area of transport and that will make a potential difference in the way we trade our goods from one area to the other.",

Threats to the actual process, kind of the way that the former president challenged things in the courts.Do you think that effort is going to make any difference here?

But it puts the impeachment inquiry on shaky legal ground. Johnson now wants to push through something that is formalized to put more solid underpinnings underneath it. Ron DeSantis, who is a former member of the House of Representatives himself, now governor of Florida, and, of course, presidential candidate actually dismissed this idea over the weekend. Take a look at what DeSantis had to say and then I'll ask you about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think they run the risk of doing an inquiry that doesn't necessarily lead anywhere while they've been ignoring a lot of the problems that our voters are talking about.

And there is a little bit of revenge here and you can feel it on the Hill. There are folks who want to get back at Democrats for doing what they thought was so unfair to Trump. Now, we can argue the merits of the 2019 Trump impeachment versus a potential 2023 Biden impeachment and the evidence therein. But I think there is a lot of anger and in a sense, Republicans are acting from anger. But as Rep. Chip Roy says, they want to feel as if Republicans are doing something. And in some ways, this feels as if Republicans are doing something. They're setting up an impeachment inquiry. They're following through the promise to voters.

CATHERINE LUCEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. Trump saying this is a newer idea since it's not a new idea. Republicans have tried running on this before and it hasn't been successful, right? And a lot of them have dropped this in more recent elections. The law is popular with most Americans and (INAUDIBLE) Republicans, but it's popular with most Americans. And it's not really clear from Trump or DeSantis what they're suggesting they would replace it with. I think another thing to think about here is just we're still coming out of pandemic that really exposed how much people need health insurance.
