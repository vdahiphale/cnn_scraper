Thank you for that.Iran wants the U.S. booted from the World Cup after U.S. Soccer posted a graphic showing the Iranian flag without its Islamic emblem -- only its green, white, and red colors. The since-deleted post was a show of support for protesters in Iran. This is what Iran's actual flag looks like. The incident coming just ahead of the U.S.-Iran match on Tuesday. Let's go to CNN's Amanda Davies live in Doha, Qatar for us this morning. Hi, Amanda. Are there any consequences for messing with another country's national flag?",

But what Iran are pointing to is section 13 of the FIFA statutes, which talks about any person who offends the dignity or integrity of a country, a person, or a group of people. FIFA as yet hasn't commented.But this match was always going to be played against the political backdrop given the relationship between the two countries, wasn't it? But what we have here is the U.S. Men's National Team very much putting the politics to the fore with this decision to post what they did on social media. They have said it was a one-time move for 24 hours only. That the original flag is still in place on other websites and other platforms. But Iran, for their part, is calling for the USA to be thrown out of the World Cup -- to be handed a 10-match suspension. As yet, U.S. Soccer haven't revealed who took this decision and how many people knew about this move that was going to be made. But as if so often the case, it's the players who are left publicly to front these issues. And this is what Tim Ream had to say yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIM REAM, DEFENDER, U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM:  Like we said, we support the women's rights. We always have and we always will. That message will remain consistent. And what we're doing as a team is supporting that while also trying to prepare for the biggest game that this squad has had to date. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Ukrainian allies in the West have struggled to agree on a number that would hurt Russia's ability to fund the war without causing an oil supply shock. CNN's Clare Sebastian live in London.

Of course, the context -- the problem that this is trying to solve, as you alluded to, is that throughout this war, Russia has been making more, not less money from its oil exports because of the disruption that it has caused through this war to the oil market.So the G7 looking, according to reports coming out of diplomats' meetings from the EU last week, is around the $65.00 to $70.00 a barrel mark -- much higher than what President Zelenskyy is looking for and controversial as well. Because that is really around the level that Russian oil is trading at the moment. It's pretty much at the level that they have budgeted for over the next year. So it wouldn't really hurt Russian revenue. It's probably more to do with bringing down inflation elsewhere. But what President Zelenskyy is pushing for, and other countries like Poland as well, is also controversial. Because if you put it too low and it does hurt Russian revenue, they could retaliate and cut back on production. And ultimately, what the world does not really want, Christine, is for a lot of Russian oil to come off the market because that will push up prices --",

It's the National Retail Federation's highest prediction since it began tracking this data in 2017. More on the mighty American consumer in a moment.But looking at markets around the world, Asian markets fell. The Hang Seng Index in Shanghai stocks sliding as protests spread across China -- protests against its zero-tolerance COVID policy. The fear there in markets is those protests will provoke even stronger responses from President Xi. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now also leaning lower. It was gains, though, for markets during the holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 finishing up more than one percent on the week. The Nasdaq also up slightly last week. A busy week is in store from the economic calendar. On Wednesday, we'll see new employment data -- the number of job openings in October -- leading up to Friday's critical jobs report. Gas prices fell slightly overnight, now sitting at $3.55 per gallon. And did you know that in eight states now -- in a growing number of states, the average price for gas is lower today than it was a year ago? All right, today is Cyber Monday, which used to be the day shoppers went online to get what they couldn't find in the stores on Black Friday. This year, plenty of people skipped that first step. Black Friday saw an estimated $9.1 billion from online shoppers this year. That's according to Abode Analytics. That would be a record. Let's bring in Claire Tassin. She is a retail and e-commerce analyst at Morning Consult. Nice to see you. You know, I feel like it has been a Black Friday for weeks already. I mean, this is kind of a critical test of the American consumers, but consumers are still spending. CLAIRE TASSIN, RETAIL AND E-COMMERCE ANALYST, MORNING CONSULT (via Webex by Cisco):  Absolutely, and I agree with you. It's been Black Friday I think since before Halloween at this point, so it continues to stretch earlier and earlier every year. But what we're seeing in the reflection of at least the early numbers that are out is that ongoing resilience of the American consumer despite inflation that we've been reporting on all year it feels like at this point.",

You can't control the price of the sweaters, which have gone up. We're also seeing that plans to give apparel and food -- so, sort of specialty food, but two categories that have really been hit hard by inflation this year -- are up.

According to a police statement obtained by CNN affiliate WVSN, flight attendants said that Beckham appeared to be coming in and out of consciousness, and while they tried to wake him to fasten his seatbelt, they couldn't do it. Beckham's attorney released a statement calling the incident completely unnecessary, saying that \"The overzealous flight attendant refused to simply allow Mr. Beckham to fasten his seatbelt and proceed with the flight and instead immediately removed everyone from the plane. At no time was Mr. Beckham disruptive or combative.\" Later, OBJ took to social media to offer his take on the situation. He tweeted, \"Never in my life have I experienced what just happened to me. I've seen it all,\" he said. On the field, the Packers with their seventh loss in the last eight games. Aaron Rodgers left in the third quarter against the Eagles with what he called a rib injury from a pair of hits that he took in the game. He's set to have another scan today to check for fractures.
