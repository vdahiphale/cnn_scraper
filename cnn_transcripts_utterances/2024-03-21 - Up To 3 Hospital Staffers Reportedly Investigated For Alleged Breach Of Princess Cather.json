He received two new high commissioners from Singapore and Tanzania. Meanwhile, I think it should be said that Queen Camilla has really stepped up. She's done a number of engagements. She was in the Isle of Man yesterday, Belfast today. She went to the castle, visited some ministers, visited local businesses. She visited the rifle's regimens. And as you see, her schedule is full on, as you would imagine, as you have to pick up some of the slack from other working members of the royal family being off sick. But worth noting, yes, Queen Camilla, very busy, aged 76 -- Erica?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Boris. The explanation of how things all went down changed so quickly, it really stands out.Shohei Ohtani's spokesman originally telling an investigative reporter at ESPN that Ohtani was covering the gambling debts of his longtime interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara, to the tune of $4.5 million. But then Ohtani's lawyers contradicted that on Wednesday saying Ohtani was the victim of massive theft. This all came to light because federal investigators are looking into an illegal California gambling operation, as first reported by \"The L.A. Times.\" According to ESPN, Ohtani sent millions of dollars in wire transfers from his bank account to an alleged bookmaking operation, with Mizuhara originally telling ESPN on Tuesday that the transfers were to cover his losses, but that Ohtani had, quote, \"zero involvement in the betting.\" And Mizuhara also said he didn't know that gambling was illegal in California. ESPN says he also said that Ohtani wasn't happy about his debts but decided to pay it off for him. Well, as ESPN was getting ready to publish their store on Wednesday, Ohtanis lawyers sent out this statement saying, \"In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive debt theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities.\" On Wednesday, Mizuhara walked back much of what he originally told ESPN, saying that he had lied and that Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling activities, his debts, or any efforts to repay them. CNN is attempting to contact Mizuhara. We've reached out to local authorities. Major League Baseball will not comment at the moment. Now, Mizuhara was in the dugout for Wednesday's MLB season opener against the Padres. He was seen smiling, talking to Ohtani. But Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers after that story came out.",

And now he's on the la, L.A. Dodgers after signing the richest deal in American sports, for 10 years, $700 million. And now he's going to have to move forward without Mizuhara, who has been with him ever since he stepped foot in America. Mizuhara was so much more than his interpreter. He was with him wherever he went. We're talking workouts, promotional events. Mizuhara was even a catcher for him when he competed in the 2021 Home Run Derby. Losing the person that has been your one constant since moving to the U.S. is, certainly, Boris, not going to be an easy adjustment for Ohtani moving forward as he starts to season.",

It was a four-hour long surgery. We're told he's doing well. He's recovering from that surgery. And the science behind this is really fascinating. What we know about the pig kidney itself is that it was actually edited with 69 genomic edits to make it more compatible with the human body. We know that, as part of this procedure, the doctors relied on monoclonal antibodies to make sure that Rick's immune system did not reject this organ. And this idea of using animal organs, like a pig kidney in humans, has been a part of ongoing research. And actually, Boris and Erica, at CNN, we were able to exclusively tour a facility that raised and genetically modified pigs for this kind of science. The facility is owned by the company eGenesis. And they've done a lot of work in this area. And one of their pigs was the donor of this pig kidney for Rick's Slayman's procedure. Now, like I said, Rick is still recovering. But he did say, in a written statement, that when he was told he could use a pig kidney as an organ transplant procedure, he said, quote, \"I saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for thousands of people who need a transplant to survive.\" And as part of that statement, he went on to thank his medical team. But this idea of using animal organs to help many, many patients out there in need of an organ is a remarkable, remarkable area to watch. And this is just one successful step in that goal potentially in the future.",

And we know that it's estimated about 17 people die each day while waiting for an organ.And kidneys are actually the most commonly organs that we see in need. So that's an area where we see the most patients who need that specific organ. But I will say this is the first successful kidney transplant from a pig to a human. So we really have to see how Rick recovers, how he does over time. The medical team says that they hope the kidney will last at least two years. But again, this is an unknown area, so we have to wait to see what happens next. But again, it is an exciting moment right now in science and medicine.",
