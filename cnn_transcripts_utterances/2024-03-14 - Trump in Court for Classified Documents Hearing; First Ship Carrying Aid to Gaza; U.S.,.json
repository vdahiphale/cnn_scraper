A courtroom, the former U.S. president's motorcade arriving at the courthouse in Florida a few minutes ago. Trump will watch as his lawyers argue the classified documents case against him should be thrown out. They contend he has virtually unlimited authority to claim any documents from his presidency as personal and that the Justice Department should never have prosecuted the case to begin with. Well, judge Aileen Cannon, who, as we have repeatedly noted, is a Trump appointee, has set aside the entire day for arguments. If the case continues, she may, just may announce a trial date. Joining me now is Bradley Moss. He is an attorney who specializes in national security matters and security clearance law. Sir, it's going to be a long day likely. What can we expect and why does it matter?",

This is the most straightforward case if it makes it to trial, unlike the January 6th election interference case. This one is pretty clear. He had classified documents in his possession. He didn't return them. He obstructed efforts to recover them. That should, even in Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a very conservative area of Florida, even there, that should in theory result in a conviction at trial. But this is all being tied up in these pretrial motions that he, that Trump has filed. And we're waiting to see where Judge Cannon goes with this. Does she find any credence to this? Even if she rules against Donald Trump, does she take a while, does she take a long time to issue a ruling? Everything is about timing right now.",

Then he's -- that case will go into some time in mid-May. There's only a few months after that before the election in November. There's three cases that still have yet to go to trial. This case in Florida, the D.C. case, which is waiting on the Supreme Court to rule on immunity, and the case in Georgia, which is waiting on a ruling on potential disqualification of the prosecutor. You can't have three cases going on at once. It is likely only one, if maybe at most two of those cases will be able to start and get to trial and get to a result before Election Day, if the judges even let them go on during the fall campaign. There's no precedent for this. We have no guideposts, no understanding of how to handle a presidential campaign in the midst of the -- one of the nominees being on trial.

If he does, he might make some remarks, do his usual shtick about how this was a politicized case, never should've been brought. He has total immunity, total discretion, et cetera, et cetera.

If the Justice Department is believed by judge Aileen Cannon and that she goes with their arguments, they are making the case that these records Donald Trump had after the presidency were so crucial to national defense that they should not have been in his hands. And he did not have the right to take them with him. They are not just presidential records, they're national defense secrets, things about defense and weapons capabilities, U.S. nuclear programs, the U.S.' vulnerabilities in a foreign attack and how the United States would respond if we were under attack. So that is what the Justice Department is going to be arguing, Donald Trump should not have been able to take these documents. And then, on the other hand, Trump's team will be arguing he was president. He wanted them, he wanted to call them personal and thus, he should have been able to. So we're going to have to see exactly how this goes because, at 10:00 am, just a few minutes ago, that's when the judge was set to take the bench. We don't have any ability to communicate with what's happening inside the courthouse. And so we're waiting to see exactly when the hearing will start. We're hoping that our producers will be able to make it across this four-lane highway to get us word about how things are going in there.

He is a criminal defendant. And so it's often expected that a criminal defendant will take a case against them quite seriously and will show up but in court. But the judge has said that Donald Trump doesn't need to come to these hearings before his trial, hearings like this today. But this is at least the third time now that Donald Trump has shown up to one of these hearings voluntarily before judge Aileen Cannon. You don't get to see him. The public doesn't get to see him coming in and out of the courthouse. He -- no one gets to see him inside unless you're in that courtroom or watching in an overflow room on closed circuit cameras. And so he is there today because it fits into his legal strategy, to carry the import of his role as the former president. That's part of this strategy. Although, I will note, while there are judges in these criminal cases that have referred in the courtroom to him as Mr. President or the president or the former president, judge Aileen Cannon did not at the last hearing, where we were here watching. She referred to him as, I believe, the defendant. She didn't call him by the name that he has wanted his attorneys to call him in court.",

There are more than 500,000 meals of food aboard this ship that the World Central Kitchen in coordination with volunteers and other contractors on the ground will begin to distribute. Much needed aid, of course, particularly in northern Gaza. And even as they are preparing to receive that ship, the World Central Kitchen is also starting to load pallets onto a second ship in Cyprus that would carry another 300 tons of aid for Gaza as well. A World Central Kitchen spokesperson actually confirmed to CNN that they're expecting to have the pallets screened and loaded onto the ship by the end of today. But we are learning more as well about that strike, that the Israeli military carried out yesterday on a U.N. building that was serving as a food distribution point. Yesterday, we learned that five people were killed, according to Palestinian health authorities. But today, the Israeli military says that that strike actually took out a Hamas commander, Mohammed Abu Hasna, who the Israeli military says was involved in coordinating combat activities of various Hamas units. The Israeli military saying that the targeting will, quote, \"significantly damage the operational capabilities of various Hamas units in Rafah.\" And, of course, the fact that this strike happened in Rafah, this is where we are looking for the potential next Israeli military offensive. That hasn't happened yet. There's no sense that it is imminent. But in the meantime, we are seeing the Israeli military carrying out these types of what they call persistent precision strikes.",

And so we know that the Israeli military, Israeli officials have said that they will evacuate the civilian population. But we haven't heard many details about what exactly that will entail. But yesterday, Daniel Hagari, the spokesman for the Israeli military, telling us that they are preparing a plan to move Palestinians from Rafah to what he's calling humanitarian enclaves that will be created in coordination with the international community. These enclaves will have food, they will have water, housing, as well as field hospitals. But he's making clear, Hagari is making clear that, even as they prepare for that, that that -- that they will go into Rafah, saying that it is, quote, \"something we need to do.\" As you mentioned, U.S. officials have expressed serious concerns about this and also concerns about the viability of actually moving so many people and ensuring that these enclaves, where the Israeli military says it will move people, actually can accommodate hundreds of thousands of people.

Sothat's what we have seen before when it comes to U.S. officials and Iranian officials engaging, they're not meeting together. They're basically meeting in the same place in this situation, it was in Oman in January at the same time. And they had Omani officials going back and forth bringing the messages from one side to the other. The question of how productive this meeting was remains a bit of an open question, particularly given that this -- these indirect talks took place in January. And since then, of course, we have seen a number of U.S. strikes on Iranian-backed proxies in the region in Iraq and Syria in Yemen. And of course, the beginning of those strikes actually began in January against the Houthis after those attacks on ships in the Red Sea. And so the question as to how productive these engagements actually were -- the U.S. felt like they needed to go ahead with these number of strikes -- remains open. It's significant, however, that they even were able to resume dialogue, because there had not been this type of dialogue between the U.S. and Iran since that prisoner swap back in September. And the State Department is not commenting on specific channels of communication, with Iran saying that they have multiple options for channels of communication and also pointing out a spokesperson saying that, since October 7th, the dialogue, in their word, has, quote, \"been focused on raising being a full range of threats emanating from Iran and the need for Iran to cease its across-the-board escalation.\"",

It is just half past 10 on the EastCoast of the States, where we return to, with Donald Trump back in court today to hear debates over his most cited legal argument in the classified documents case, whether, as president, he could keep any document that he wanted. Well, this is footage from earlier today of Trump arriving in court in Florida. His legal team is arguing that the charges against him should be dismissed. Trump-appointed judge Aileen Cannon, who may later announce a trial date, has set aside the entire day for arguments. Joining me now, live again from outside the courtroom in Fort Pierce is CNN senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz. And for those who may just be joining us and just learning this news, I think it's important to set this in context. What can we expect and why does today matter, Katelyn?",

He's making a lot of different bids with different arguments to do so.Today, the arguments are focusing on what he says was his ability to claim records as personal records, take them out of the White House and keep them at Mar-a-Lago after the presidency. The Justice Department says that is not how the law works. It is so clear that these were national defense records, things about defense weapons, defense capabilities, the responsibilities of the United States, if there were a foreign attack, that those should never have been able to be personal records. They're government records and national security records at that. But, Becky, we're still waiting for any inkling of news to come out of this fortress of a federal courthouse behind me. There are no cameras inside. There are no electronics allowed inside. The hearing would have started about a half an hour ago with the judge on the bench. And so at some point we will be able to get a little bit more flavor of how those arguments are going today. But there's a lot to cover, not just in these arguments but in this case moving forward.",

      "sentences": "It's absolutely a sign that the White House is deeply concerned about the aftermath of what ishappening on the ground in Haiti and that there very well could be an exodus of Haitians leaving the country and making their way to the shores of south Florida. This is something that the administration has seen before, back in 2022, there were a number of Haitians who were arriving to south Florida in big numbers on these makeshift vessels, with more than 100 people on board for a days-long journey. So that is what could happen in a situation like right now. And that is what the White House and the administration is preparing for. And so they are discussing expanding capacity at this little-known facility in Guantanamo Bay. It's a migrant center, one that has been used to hold and process migrants before they are repatriated to their origin country. So in a case like this, if migrants were apprehended or interdicted at sea, they could be taken to this facility, processed, then either repatriated to Haiti or a third country. Now I asked the White House about this and this is what they told me. They said, quote, \"We are clear-eyed that economic, political and security instability are key drivers for migrants around the world. We are closely monitoring the situation and the routes frequently used by migrants to reach our borders. \"And at this time, irregular migration flows through the Caribbean remain low.\" And I spoke to a Customs and Border Protection official down in Florida, who also told me that they are monitoring this. They have preparations underway in the event that they do see more of these vessels arriving to their shores. This often takes days or weeks before we see it. Again, the journey itself takes days. It is perilous. It is dangerous and we're in a unique position right now where the administration is fighting for more funding, for money for the Department of Homeland Security, which would be at front and center at an operation like this. They're already strapped because of what's happening at the U.S. southern border. So there are a lot of logistics that need to be sorted out in the early phases of this before they were to move forward, if they do move forward in expanding this facility. But clearly, Becky, just a lot of concern about what is happening in Haiti and where Haitians then go should they decide to leave the country.",

It's interesting to consider, if was for sale -- and let me make clear, it is not. Who would buy it? Because the obvious buyers would be the Big Tech companies like Meta, like Google. But of course, they would face antitrust issues. So it's going to take an investor with a lot of pow to be able to do this.

CHRIS GRALLERT, PRESIDENT, GREEN CITY GROWERS (voice-over):  As these crops continue to come out, we'll plant in fall greens, we'll plant in lettuces. WIRE (voice-over):  This is Fenway Farms, a 5,000 square-foot garden area on a section of rooftop at the oldest active Major League Baseball Park in America. GRALLERT (voice-over):  You know agriculture happens everywhere, we're just bringing it up off the ground and putting it up on a roof. WIRE (voice-over):  Chris Grallert is a farmer and the president of Green City Growers, which operates this farm in some 200 other locations, including at 40 Boston public schools. But none are as visible and perhaps surprising as Fenway Farms. GRALLERT (voice-over):  There's a desire for people to have more locally grown, fresh produce and interact with the people who are growing and distributing that fresh produce. And I think, when you have such high visibility like you do at a garden like this, people start to see that it's possible. And it can really be the seed to start the new revolution toward food system transformation. WIRE (voice-over):  The garden first opened in 2015; recycled milk crates formed the raised planters. GRALLERT (voice-over):  These are fingerling type potatoes. WIRE (voice-over):  Irrigated by a special system that delivers the precise amount needed to each plant. (MUSIC PLAYING) WIRE (voice-over):  The produce doesn't have to travel far, just a short walk to Chef Ron Abel and his team, operating the restaurants and concessions at Fenway. GRALLERT (voice-over):  Produce delivery. RON ABEL, SENIOR EXECUTIVE CHEF, FENWAY PARK (voice-over):  How you doing, buddy? GRALLERT (voice-over):  Good to see you as always. ABEL (voice-over):  What do you have? GRALLERT (voice-over):  Beautiful onions, right off -- look at the size of those. ABEL (voice-over):  I have the best chef job in the city. Well, actually, maybe the country, where I've got a rooftop garden, that the food travels 100 feet, gets washed and gets served to everybody. And then this dish that Sean's putting together is simple. Potatoes we harvested this morning, we've got purple potatoes, we've got fingerling potatoes, heirloom carrots of different colors. And he just steamed them lightly and they get seasoned lightly. WIRE (voice-over):  Green City Growers estimates Fenway Farms reduces the need for produce to purchase at the venue by 20 percent. ABEL (voice-over):  Mostly we look at quantities and what we can go through and we also look at perishability. So there are challenges here. We can't predict what Mother Nature is going to give us. WIRE (voice-over):  Anything left over, along with what's harvested from a smaller designated area next to the main farm, is donated to a local food rescue and distribution organization, called Lovin' Spoonfuls. GRALLERT (voice-over):  We can produce anywhere from 4,000 to 6,000 pounds of fresh produce a year, depending on what we're growing. And so the range of vegetables, asparagus to zucchini. WIRE (voice-over):  Produce from A to Z, making the iconic green of Fenway Park even greener. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Let's listen to what he had to say just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  Now as a result of those inflamed tensions in both Israeli and Palestinian communities, people on all sides of this war are turning away from a two-state solution. Including Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who, in recent weeks has said out loud repeatedly what many have long suspected by outright rejecting the idea of Palestinian statehood and sovereignty. As the highest ranking Jewish elected official in our government and as a staunch defender of Israel. I rise today to say unequivocally, this is a grave mistake for Israel, for Palestinians, for the region and for the world. The only real and sustainable solution to this decades-old conflict is a negotiated two-state solution, a demilitarized Palestinian state, living side-by-side with Israel in equal measures of peace, security, prosperity, dignity and mutual recognition. Both Jews and Palestinians have long, historic claims to this land, contrary to the unfounded, absurd and offensive claims by some that the Jewish people are colonizers in their ancestral homeland. Jewish people have lived in the homeland continuously for more than three millennia, 3,000 years. For centuries, Jews have made Aliyah and gone to the land of Israel to live and settle. For centuries at Passover, Jews at every corner of the globe have prayed, \"Next year in Jerusalem.\" A Jewish homeland in Israel is no 20th century contrivance. Israel's our historic home, a home for people oppressed for centuries. Now the Palestinians, too, have lived in and on the land for generations. And in past centuries, they have formed their own distinct culture, identity, cuisine, literature. The idea espoused by some, quote, \"There is no such thing as Palestinians,\" unquote, is inaccurate, offensive, unhelpful. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
