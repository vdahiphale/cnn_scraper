And he admits the relationship was toxic and unhealthy. That's the word he used, unhealthy, but says he was shocked by the verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN MAJORS, ACTOR: I was, uh, I was absolutely shocked and, um, afraid. When the verdict comes down, I say, how, how, how is, how is that possible? Based off the evidence, based off the prosecution's evidence, let alone our evidence, how is that possible? I shouldn't have been in the car. I shouldn't have stepped out of the relationship. I shouldn't have been in the relationship. If I'm not in the car, none of this is happening. If I leave the relationship, none of this is happening. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These allegations that Ziegler sexually assaulted a woman, that he'd had a previous consensual sexual encounter, along with his wife, Bridget Ziegler, the former co-founder of the Moms for Liberty group. It is important to note here that Christian Ziegler has not been charged criminally. He was not in attendance at today's meeting, and so far, he has not commented on his ouster. Now, we're told from party officials that really, they are just trying to get past this sex scandal. They said that we are now in a presidential year. There is also the start of the Florida legislative session, which gets underway tomorrow. And so, they really want to put all of this sex scandal behind them. Here now is the new chairman of the Florida Republican Party, as well as other top Republicans here in Florida, talking about today's move. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He served as vice chair under Christian Ziegler. In fact, he ran against him the last time around and he lost. And he was also one of the first folks to call for Christian to step down because of all of these allegations. Again, Brianna, the officials that we talked to out here for the better part of the day, as well as the weeks before we got to this, all told me they really believe that there was nothing Christian Ziegler could say at this point. They really did not want to hear anything more from him. They simply wanted him to step aside. When he chose not to, they said they really had no choice but to remove him.

He was kidnapped back on October 7th. Dozens of people from that kibbutz were killed and kidnapped. His father was killed on October 7th. His mother was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. She has since been released. And in the video, I want to read part of what Katzir said. He said: I want to tell them, the government of Israel, to get me back, as well as all other hostages and end this damn war. With each day of the war, more soldiers and more hostages are being killed. Stop the war and bring us hostages home in peace. He talked about fearing for his life and how dangerous it is for the hostages in Gaza. And Boris, I was in Israel just a couple of weeks ago, spoke with hostages who had been released and their families. And they have repeatedly said and told the government that the Israeli military and their campaign are endangering the lives of hostages. There are so many people in Israel who do not believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government are doing enough to bring those hostages home. And Boris, I can tell you from a lot of reporting, talking with different sources, those hostage talks, they're progressing, but they're not getting anywhere fast.
