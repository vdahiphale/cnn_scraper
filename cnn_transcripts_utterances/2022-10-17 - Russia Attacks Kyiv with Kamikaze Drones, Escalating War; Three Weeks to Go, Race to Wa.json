And, actually, we were quickly moved on from there because there were continuing alerts about possible oncoming missiles.Essentially, it was a residential building. We saw one elderly lady who was rescued during our time on the ground there, one body of a resident of that building. But authorities, as you mentioned, saying three people killed in it. Two of those killed were a couple, a young couple. The woman apparently, according to Ukrainian authorities, was six months pregnant. So, this is now the new normal where residents of Kyiv find themselves in, Brianna, where they are waking up in the morning to the sound, to the very distinctive sound, as you could see in that social media video, of these Shahed drones, these kamikaze drones that have been wreaking havoc across the country for almost a month now, but still a relatively new phenomenon here in the capital. We were able to speak on the scene to the mayor of Kyiv, Vitaly Klitschko. He said that, you know, while Russians don't care at all about killing civilians and while they appear to be actively trying to kill civilians, it also appears that the intended target is critical civilian infrastructure. And, actually, what was interesting walking around that area is that you could see how much damage was wrought there from the attacks last Monday when that barrage of missiles slammed into the capital. So, Russians appear to be very focused on this specific area in downtown Kyiv because there are several buildings, there are several installations that are very much crucial for that civilian infrastructure. We're talking power, we're talking heat, and these are all very important things as we head into the winter months and Russia's military is facing such humiliating defeats in the south and the east, and is desperately trying to turn this thing around. But the mayor saying to us, listen, forget about it. The intention may be to cow people but all it actually does is make people angrier and make them want to fight more.",

Life here really had returned to normal, businesses were open, restaurants, cafes. And I think there's definitely an element of this, which is like trying to hit at the psyche by terrifying people, by crippling the capital and trying to distract from other fronts where perhaps the Russians are struggling more in their efforts.And this is why the Ukrainian authorities are saying, listen, guys, to the international community, we need better air defense systems and we need them now. Because the thing is with these kamikaze drones is that a huge amount of firepower is being expended trying to stop them from hitting their targets. And a lot of people, as you saw again in some of the social media video, just extraordinary police officers with AK- 47s, literally just trying to shoot these drones out of the sky to stop them from reaching their intended target.",

Georgia is unique among those six races that I'm watching in so far as a candidate needs 50 percent of the vote plus one to win in the November election. Otherwise, there's a runoff.And here is the thing. Right now, Raphael Warnock, the incumbent, he is just 48 percent in the polls, in the average, right? Herschel Walker is a little bit behind at 44 percent. Why? Normally, I don't have a libertarian candidate here, but Chase Oliver is pulling 3 percent. It's quite plausible that even the candidate who has the most votes in the November election does not get to that majority threshold and it could come down to a runoff again in Georgia post-November for control of the United States Senate.",

She has not said she is going to support those results.But look at how tight the race is here, right? I have four polls on the screen right now, and you can see, these polls disagree of who the leader is because this race is well within the margin of error. A three-point lead for Hobbs, a one-point lead for Hobbs, a tie here, we have Lake plus one. So, the fact of the matter is Arizona, a state that was so close last time, determined by well less than a point, could be another long race, especially with that mail-in voting, it could take days, if not, a week to determine who, in fact, wins this race.",
