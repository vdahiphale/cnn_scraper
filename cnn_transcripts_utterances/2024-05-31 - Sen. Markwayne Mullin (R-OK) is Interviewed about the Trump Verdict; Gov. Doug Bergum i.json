I'm optimistic because I think this - the trial is, you know, part of an eight-year long attempt to people that are - you know, been trying to take down Donald Trump since he won in November '16. And I think the reason why the - people have a hard time understanding why this may not change the outcome in November, or why people are donating in record dollars to Donald Trump yesterday is because the verdict doesn't affect the average American. If yesterday you were struggling to pay your grocery bill, and yesterday you were struggling to pay if your electric bill or you couldn't buy a house because interest rates are too high.

And it's counter-intuitive but the idea is basically that this is something that may galvanize his people behind him. And when you're running as an incumbent, it's a referendum on you. That enthusiasm potentially has a pretty sharp challenge. And we've seen, from this trial, I mean the level of oxygen for the president, the sitting president, has been much lower, and they've been frustrated by it.",

We've - that's demonstrably true. We've seen that throughout the primary process. That's true. I don't think it is appealing. I don't think it's an appealingargument to these swing voters that the Biden campaign is trying to - to win. And I think what - I think the way that they have to thread the needle here, and I think that they will. I mean he sort of saw this in the statement they put out yesterday. But the way I think they have to thread the needle is, you know, they have to use this to illustrate the larger argument that Donald Trump is only about Donald Trump. It isn't about - it's not going to be about the specifics of this case. And I think that is something that the Democrats have to absorb and accept and bake into their campaign strategy moving forward. The ins and outs of how - whether, you know, he was found guilty on these particular counts and what the specifics were, it is not going to matter to most swing voters. What will matter, I think, is this larger notion that he's a convicted felon who lies and cheats and makes everything about him and will do anything to win and they can draw the large - they can paint to a larger picture of what he did to try to incite the January 6th riot, which we've seen is problematic for people. Voters feel uncomfortable about that. They feel like it - you know, it's fundamentally un- American. So, you know, I don't think, at the end of the day - I don't think, at the end of the day, this is going to help Donald Trump win a general election. But I do think the Biden campaign has to be smart about how they use it in order to ensure that outcome.",
