He'll be speaking from the site of a turning point for Allied forces during World War II.And former President Donald Trump is back out there on the campaign trail and once again leaving the door open to prosecuting his political opponents if he's elected to a second term. Also happening right now, the prosecution is wrapping up its case in Hunter Biden's gun trial. We're live reporting live from outside the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. Stay with us. You're in the CNN Newsroom. At any moment, President Biden will stand on hallowed ground and plant the flag for democracy. President Biden is at Pointe du Hoc in France. It's where U.S. Army Rangers scaled the steep cliffs on D-Day to take out German machine guns. The Allied invasion of Normandy was certainly a turning point against Nazi Germany. This hour, the president will use that backdrop to confront rising global threats to U.S. leadership and to democracy itself. He delivered a preview yesterday in his D-Day anniversary speech. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than any point since the end of World War II, since these beaches were stormed in 1944. Now, we have to ask ourselves, When we stand against tyranny, against evil, against crushing brutality of the iron fist, when we stand for freedom, when we defend democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He will set this as the crucial battleground and frontline for defending democracy and freedom on the continent of Europe, but not just for Europe, but also for the United States itself.At Point du Hoc, he will clearly, you know, be taking on a speech that many people say no other president has ever been able to deliver or match, and that was Ronald Reagan, 1984, on the 40th anniversary at D- Day, celebrating, as he said, the boys of Pointe du Hoc. He said, these are the men who scaled these cliffs, the champions who helped free a continent, the heroes who helped end a war. I'm slightly paraphrasing, but that is exactly what Biden will try to say too, that even though American forces are not on the ground in Europe, they are helping Ukraine in its terrible, terrible war that Russia imposed with this invasion back nearly, you know, nigh on three years ago in March in February of 2022. So, that will most definitely be the setting and the context. We've had President Biden meeting with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, who's been there amongst World leaders are celebrating and commemorating what happened on D-Day. Macron is meeting with him, the president of France will meet Zelensky and offer him a whole load of French fighter jets. This is very important for the struggle against Russia. And they will simply put it in stark terms that Russia today poses a threat similar to what the Soviet Union posed to Europe and America back 40 years ago and throughout the Cold War. Wolf?",

He was talking about the Soviet Union. He talked about how the Soviet Union, yes, helped during World War II and even liberating that part of the European continent, but stayed in Europe, as he said, unwanted, uninvited and unyielding. The thing with Reagan that is so consequential is that he then went on and found a partner in peace, having signaled there that he was looking for a partner in peace in the Soviet Union, he found one, Mikhail Gorbachev, and then took the whole process over the line. And then you had with these two partners, American and Soviet Union, the two superpowers, were able to end communism and finally the end of the Soviet Union. Of course, Putin now has come back and is in the midst of what people call revanchism, wanting to bring back the so called glory of the Soviet time, even imperial times, where Russia had a sphere of influence. And Putin is absolutely determined that he deserves, and that Russia today deserves, a sphere of influence, thinking that Ukraine is part of what rightly belongs to Russia's sphere of influence. Those days are over. The Cold War ended and there aren't so-called spheres of influence anymore. Nonetheless, the absolute risk and catastrophe that is unleashed on Europe, the first major ground war since World War II is still playing out. And, and therefore everything is at stake. Not just with this speech, but pointing out to the Republicans in the United States that isolation, isolationism, America first, hunkering down, appeasing in this case, the Russian enemies, is not going to work for peace and security.",

She reminisced about its importance in The Wall Street Journal, especially when it came to rallying allies.Let me read a quote from that article. That's why he spoke at such length of all the Allied armies at D-Day, not only the Americans. It's why he paid tribute to those armies valor, to remind current leaders what their ancestors had done. It's why he talked about the unity of the allies. They rebuilt a new Europe together, end quote. Very powerful words indeed.

He plans to say that the world is summoning us. They're asking us what we will do. They're not asking us to We're going to talk a little these cliffs. They're asking us to stay true to what America stands for.Just a few minutes ago, President Biden in Marine one flew by these cliffs that army Rangers scaled 80 years ago to take out those German artillery positions, essentially enabling the Allied forces who landed here on D-Day to succeed, and President Biden is going to talk about that effort specifically through the lens of one of those Army Rangers who is still living. His name is John Waddell. He's here in the audience today, 99 years old. Of course, there are more than a few parallels, as you were just mentioning, to the speech that a conservative forebear to President Biden, Ronald Reagan, made here 40 years ago. He had 62 of those army Rangers on hand. Of course, it was a different time, but there were a lot of similarities, not just in the situation that was happening around the world, as you've been discussing, but also the situation that both leaders faced at home, waning support for U.S. intervention overseas for Reagan. It was in the post Vietnam era. For President Biden, it is because of his pledge to end forever wars and the current fights that are ongoing in Ukraine and in Gaza. They also were just months away from re-election and talked about the power of democracy and the need to defeat isolationism. I want you to take a listen to then and now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We expect more of that today.Peggy Noonan, who, you know, is Reagan's speechwriter back in 1984, she wrote this in her memoir about the purpose and the goal of Reagan's speech back then. She said, I wanted American teenagers to stop chewing their Rice Krispies for a minute and hear about the greatness of those tough kids who are now their grandfathers and to come away with the thinking that history is real. Reagan's speech took place when kids were sitting around the breakfast table at 8:00 A.M. before they went to school. Biden's speech is, of course, happening a little bit later in the day now. But I think it's safe to say that showing that history is real and it's currently repeating itself is one of the raison d'etre of Biden being here today, Wolf.",
