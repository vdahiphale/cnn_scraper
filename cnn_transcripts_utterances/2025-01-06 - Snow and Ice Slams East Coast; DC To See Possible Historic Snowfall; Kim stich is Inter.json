Just at 7Here's a live look at the National Mall. There's the Lincoln Memorial in the background. Lots of snow still blanketing the nation's capital. This is a dynamic and large storm system that has a severe component to the south, an ice component right smack dab in the middle, and then snow from the mid-Atlantic stretching westward towards the Ohio River Valley. This is, all in all, about an 800-mile stretch of winter weather alerts. And this is all part of the same storm. But check out this 18-wheeler jackknifing directly in front of this driver. Just scary moments. But it really shows you the icy conditions that was left in its wake as the system garnered some strength over the Midwest and moved eastward, now setting up shop across the mid- Atlantic. So, temperatures supportive of snow in the nation's capital. To the south you can see it's flirting with the freezing mark, so that's why we're seeing that changeover to ice and a mixture of precipitation as well. But additional snowfall to come. I think another one to three inches for D.C. Will we set these historic 16-inch records comparing to snowzilla back in 2016? Not likely. But, hey, it's still fun. It's still beautiful. But, of course, a nightmare on the roads. Behind this, though, a lot of wind.

This is just simply the counting of the votes that were already cast back in November by America's voters.We expect that the president of the Senate, who will be Vice President Kamala Harris, will begin opening state by state, each of these certifications. Then she will hand them to four tellers. These are the top Republicans and top Democrats on the House and Senate Administration Committees. Once they receive each of the envelopes, they will count, record, and tally each of the votes. Once that process is completed, which we expect will take just over 40 minutes, then we expect that this process will end. Lawmakers will go home for the day.

President-elect Donald Trump is going to be watching it, I'm told, from here at Mar-a-Lago. He, of course, is building his new government. He's doing a radio interview this morning with Hugh Hewitt, as we speak, talking about his plans for his first 100 days and beyond. So, in two weeks' time he will be sworn into office. But today, as the electoral counts or votes are certified and counted, it is a point to also look back to how Donald Trump was able to turn what seemed four years ago as a deep, dramatic political liability into an asset to win the Republican primary campaign, to win the general election campaign over Vice President Kamala Harris, who, as you said, she will be standing in her role, presiding over the Senate. She said he will be doing so out of love of the country and loyalty to the Constitution. So today, John, is one of those markers of just the extraordinary comeback, yes, for the 45th and 47th president of the United States that will be marked likely without much fanfare at all.
