Pure unadulterated evil is how President Biden described Hamas' actions after Saturday's unprecedented attacks in Israel and we are learning new details about Saturday's assault on the music festival and the kibbutzim near the Gaza border. US defense officials say Hamas brutally butchered women, children, and elderly in southern Israel, describing the killings as a massacre. President Biden, referring to those atrocities and slaughter spoke extremely forcefully in defense of Israel and its response, he warned others not to make a dangerous situation worse.

He is clear, a finger point there is towards Tehran, by way of South Lebanon and the Hezbollah organization that Iran has also been backing along with Hamas for many years.

The Anglo-Saxon world tends to encourage the families of the hostages to stay quiet and stay out of the news, and that is manifestly in my experience never worked. And clearly, the Israelis and their friends are trying to manifest these people into the minds of the international community, into the minds of leaders in Israel and the United States who could bring pressure to bear. But perhaps more importantly, into the minds of Qatar and Egypt, who do have lines of communication into Hamas to remind Hamas that any more atrocities are going to substantially undermine their cause, and indeed, potentially the wider Palestinian cause at a time when Palestinian citizens who did not elect Hamas to control Gaza, other than back in 2006 are suffering the consequences of these atrocities as well, more than 800 killed there, as the IDF or Israeli Air Force goes on the offensive.

He's increased security, especially in the areas that we know that there is some Hamas or at least radical people over there, and so far, so good. There were some scuffles. There were some hooligans taking advantage of the situation, but we soon quelled it, and for the moment, there is a tense calm I would say.",

It's not clear how many of them are still alive, what condition therein, where they are being held. Nor is it clear what the prospects for their release are. And so, I think that you have this tension between an obvious desire from many people to try to deal with the problem of Hamas once and for all, to the extent that is even possible or will be possible through means of some kind of a ground incursion or invasion, and then on the other hand, and understanding of the very real risks that might carry for these hostages who are still being held in those areas. And I should add as well, what impact has this, you know, relentless bombardment of Gaza that we have been seeing, it's a little bit quieter now, but both for the past 48 hours or so, Gaza has been smashed day in and day out, that death toll now soaring.

It seemed like the U.S. was giving into indications that it will not be a full retaking of Gaza. And that came with other comments, to your point, Richard, from Jake Sullivan saying that the president and Netanyahu have spoken about the importance of distinguishing between Hamas targets, terrorist targets, and civilians there, given the breadth and presumed length of this coming campaign. Now those may be connected, right, in that the U.S. is giving full support, you heard President Biden repeat that, we stand with Israel, we stand with Israel, offering military support but also continuing to communicate about the importance of avoiding civilian casualties, and the rule of law. That is a complicated answer, Richard, but that was my reading of hearing what may seem like daylight on the issue of a siege between them, but is -- might give us some indication as to what Israel is communicating about with next steps here.",
