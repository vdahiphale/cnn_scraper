But at home, the President leaves behind tense negotiations with Republicans in Congress who are refusing to raise the government's debt ceiling. If those talks fail, they're going to be consequences would be felt around the world. They have about two weeks left to reach an agreement. After that the government runs out of money. Before leaving Washington, President Biden told reporters he is confident the U.S. will avoid default. The White House though is cut short this overseas trip because of the crisis over the debt limit canceling visits to Australia and Papua New Guinea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: What I have done in anticipation that we won't get at all until I get back is I've cut my trip short in order to be for the final negotiations and sign the deal with the majority leader. I made clear that and I'll say it again, America is not a deadbeat nation. We pay our bills. A nation has never defaulted on its debt and it never will. And we're going to continue these discussions with congressional leaders in the coming days until we reach an agreement. And I have more to say about that on Sunday. And I want to have a press conference on this issue. As it stands now, intention is to go to the G7. Back here on Sunday. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Certainly this issue of the debt ceiling would affect their countries as well. And as the President arrives here in Japan later today, this threat of an American default really does, or you know, way as the biggest issue facing global stability at this current moment. There are a number of other issues as well. But this clearly is the most pressing.Now, as the President's aides were deciding whether he should go on this trip or whether he should stay home, they really were weighing the various tradeoffs of different options. Ultimately, they decided that they could postpone their diplomacy. But what they couldn't postpone was this drop dead date of June 1st of when the United States could potentially run out of cash to pay its bills. So, the certainly -- President certainly is leaving some leaders here disappointed that he won't be able to fulfill his engagements in Papua New Guinea, and Australia. And certainly it is sending the message, at least implicitly that he does have more important things to do back home. It also doesn't do much to rebut the notion, felt met among many leaders, particularly European leaders, that the American democracy is just not really very functional at the moment. So the President will attend the G7. And over the course of their discussions, the President's aides I really did make clear that this would be a summit that he really did want to want to attend, skipping this summit would be a last minute option. And of course, there are a number of issues that he wants to get these leaders talking about face to face around the table. This the G7 has really emerged as the most important global block when it comes to dealing with Ukraine when it comes to dealing with China. The President's aides describe it as quote, the steering committee of the free world and so it was important for the President to meet these leaders face to face. And now on Ukraine they are expected to announce new sanctions. They're also expected to discuss China's economic practices. [01:05:03] So when the President lands later today his first port of call will be a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister but certainly a very packed agenda for the President as he continues this trip in Asia.

He was repeatedly admonished and reprimanded within his own unit for inappropriately accessing classified information. And yet, as we've learned from prosecutors and from the court filings, he retained access to that classified information for months.In three separate Air Force memos from within his unit, we get a look inside those admonishments, those reprimands against his behavior. First in September. On September 15, 2022, he was observed taking notes on classified intelligence information, according to this record, and even putting that note into his pocket. For that he was reprimanded. Yet, one month later on October 25, 2022 after the cease and desist order that came from the previous instance, he was seen doing a deep dive on intelligence information, which he didn't need to be doing. Another reprimand there. But at that point, according to these records, he was even offered the chance to change jobs and train into a different position, still -- which would have still given him access to sensitive and classified information. And yet once again, on January 30th of this year, one of his superiors observed him on a classified information system known as Joe Wicks, viewing content that wasn't related to his primary duty. That superior told other superiors, and yet at least according to these records, there was no action taken against him. And at least at the time, he retained his access to classified information. Prosecutors say he used that access repeatedly to do deep dives on classified and sensitive information, and then use that access to spread it online to a group of friends and others on a Discord server. It is for those reasons that prosecutors in this case, say to share it needs to remain in custody, in detention as this process plays out. His attorneys have argued that he is not the threat that the prosecutors portray him as and that she should let him be out. That detention hearing coming up later on this week, on Friday. It is worth noting that last month, we learned that not only were two of his superiors, including the commanding officer of his unit, suspended because of this ongoing investigation into how he had so much access to classified information that kept on leaking, but also the unit itself, their mission was suspended pending this investigation, the mission given to other units to perform that handling sensitive information. We have reached out to both the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau for a statement or an explanation as to how to share was reprimanded and admonished for accessing this classified information inappropriately.

Officials say parts of the Emilia- Romagna received about half of their annual rainfall in 36 hours. That led to rivers overflowing their banks and inundating thousands of acres of farmland. Emergency officials say at least 13,000 people have been evacuated and several remain missing according to a local CNN affiliate.The flooding has led to the cancellation of Sunday's Formula One Grand Prix which was said to be held in the region.

There are already victims and rescuers are searching for the missing. Hundreds of people were rescued from flooded homes, many brought to safety and rubber dinghies on flooded streets.More than 5,000 people are under evacuation according to the Civil Protection. Among them a four-month-old baby and an elderly handicapped man. The region had been undergoing severe drought. In 2022, low rainfall and extreme heat depleted the river, Po, a crucial waterway for transport and irrigation. A winter with very little snow did little to help. And as bad as these floods are, they're only a drop in the bucket for what is needed to reverse the drought. Earlier this month, a downpour swelled the Po by five feet. This deluge of water will raise it even more but it is still well below average. Extreme weather events are threatening other Italian regions from Venice where the MOSE flood gates have been raised to protect the city from high water, to Sicily were heavy storms down trees and flooded homes.

Officials say a river in Southern Croatia has reached unprecedented levels. And across the border, floodwaters have inundated homes and cut off roads in the western parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Rains are expected to ease though come Thursday.Our warming planet is set to get a lot hotter in the next five years with the stuff new warning from climate scientists that global temperatures will almost certainly reach new record highs. The World Meteorological Organization says it's also more likely than not that the global temperature will temporarily exceed 1.5 degrees above pre- industrial levels for at least one of the next five years. 1.5 is the holy grail of the Paris Climate Agreement. And even at that point, sea levels are expected to rise by 10 to 30 inches, putting 10 million more people at risk from coastal storms as well as flooding. Heat waves will continue to get worse, exposing 14% of the world's population to extreme heat at least once every five years. As meteorologist Jennifer gray reports, the impact becomes progressively worse in tandem with every increase the planet warms above 1.5 degrees.",

So whatever the temperature is going to be, wherever it's going to settle in the next few years, the job remains the same. It's to quickly get us off fossil fuel. And that's the reason that governments have so much trouble keeping those Paris promises. The fossil fuel industry is hamstringing them in one place after another. So that's why we build movements. That's why we fight.There's no longer, and this is the good news, a big technological or financial obstacle. They've brought the price of renewable energy down so far that we now live on a planet where the cheapest way to produce power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun.
