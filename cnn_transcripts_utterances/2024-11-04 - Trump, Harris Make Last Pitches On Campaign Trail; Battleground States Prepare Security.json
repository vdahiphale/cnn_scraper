And in the coming hours, they'll both travel to Pennsylvania for rallies. On Sunday, Harris and Trump fanned out, hitting other key states like Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina. The vice president looking to draw a sharp contrast between herself and Trump as he continues to turn to ever darker messaging on the campaign trail. The latest CNN poll of polls shows exactly why both candidates are laser focused on the battleground states from Arizona to Pennsylvania. The averages of recent polling in each state show there is still no clear leader. And thanks to early voting in many states, more than 75 million people have already cast their ballots for president. Donald Trump plans another multistate swing on Monday as he tries one last time to reach undecided voters in the election battlegrounds. But his rhetoric in the lead up to Election Day has increasingly grown darker. CNN's Alayna Treene has more from North Carolina. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, during his remarks, he railed against a slate of recent polls that show him losing ground to Kamala Harris. He continued to make unfounded claims about election fraud in this current election. Of course, the election again is not for another two days.And then also at one point while talking about some of the accomplishments he felt he had in his -- in the White House when he was president, started saying that he shouldn't have left the White House at all. Now, one moment as well that I do want to bring your attention to is some pretty inflammatory remarks he said about journalists. Now during his first rally of the day when he was in Pennsylvania, he was talking about and remarking on the bulletproof glass surrounding his podium. And then he argued that when, you know, if someone wanted to shoot him, they would have to go through the media first to get to him. And then he said, I actually wouldn't mind that. Take a listen to how he put it in his own words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I have a piece of glass over here, and I don't have a piece of glass there, and I have this piece of glass here.

That's what they want him to be talking about. But instead, he spent a lot of time veering off script. And of course, some of those more inflammatory remarks and comments are what a lot of the media and other people are going to be focusing on, which is not what the Trump campaign wants their message to be.

CNN's John King is at the magic wall to break down how those states could factor into either a Harris or a Trump victory.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The data tell us it is the closest race in the 10. This is my 10th presidential election, and there's never been one this close according to the numbers. But they do sometimes break late. So you should prepare yourself for any possibility of outcomes, a split back and forth between the states. Or you could prepare yourself that one candidate does have late momentum and runs up most of the battleground states. Either one of those scenarios, a sort of a split decision, a boxing match, or somebody sweeping most of them, is possible. So let's go through some of the numbers and why do I say that? Let's start in the blue wall states. Right. Look at these. Forgive me for turning my back. Just want to stretch this out a little bit so people can see it more clearly at home. This is the CNN Poll of Polls. You're right. There was some New York Times data out today. There are some hints of maybe a little bit of Harris momentum in there. The Sunday before the election, I always lapse back into caution mode. Right. Let's be careful, let's let people vote, let's be respectful of the process and let's look at the average of the polls. That's the safest way to do it. 49, 46 in Wisconsin. So you could say Harris is a lead. That's so close. It's, you know, that's a statistical tie. But 48, 46 in Michigan, 48, 48 actual -- an actual tie in, of course, battleground Pennsylvania. So let me just shrink this down and take it off to the side a little bit and put it down here and then we'll do this one. So that's the blue wall states. What about the Sunbelt states? Right. So forgive me again, I just want to stretch it out. North Carolina, Trump with a one point edge. That's the statistical tie. No clear leader. Georgia, same thing. Trump 49, Harris 47. So the Trump campaign say we're ahead a little bit. I would say then that means who turns out. It's going to affect that in Arizona again, Trump consistently has had a tiny lead in Arizona, small lead in Arizona, 49, 47 again, certainly advantage Trump by the numbers, but within reach for the Vice President. It's that close. So let's take this literally, as in let's assume it played out exactly like our averages say on the Sunday before. Right. So you have Harris gets Wisconsin, Harris gets Michigan. Pennsylvania is an actual tie. Right. Donald Trump would get North Carolina in that scenario. There we go. Make it red. Donald Trump will get Georgia in that scenario. Make it red. Donald Trump gets Arizona in that scenario. Make it red. Where does that leave you? Look at this. We don't have any recent polls. We don't have enough to have a poll of polls in Nevada. So we're leaving that one as a toss-up. But under that scenario, just giving them, as we have them in our battleground poll of polls right now, 262 for Trump, 251 for Harris. Doesn't matter really who would win Nevada in that case, it would get Harris to 257. It would get Trump to 268. So let's, for the sake of this argument, leave it yellow as a toss-up. Because the point is it all comes down to battleground Pennsylvania in this scenario. If everything plays out exactly the way it averages out right now, whoever wins Pennsylvania, wins 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and gets to be President. United States. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Trump's going all out. On Monday four different rallies in three battleground states. Two of them in the critical state of Pennsylvania. That's also where Harris will spend her last day campaigning. Her final pitch will come at a star-studded rally in Philadelphia. The contest still so incredibly tight. There is no clear leader. The latest CNN poll of polls shows Harris leading Trump by just one point. Joining me now from Los Angeles is Michael Genovese, a political analyst, president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University and author of \"The Modern Presidency: Six Debates that Defined the Institution\". Always good to see you, sir. So what do you make of the closing messages in the last few days? What do you think is resonating? What is a turn off for whomever hasn't yet decided or voted already?",

That pause happened when Trump was negotiating with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un over Kim's nuclear program. But under the Biden-Harris administration those military exercises between South Korea and the United States have begun once again.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of people. And of course, the idea behind this is not simply to go after Hamas. Some Israeli reporters are saying that there's not much fighting going on at all, actually. What this is about is to cleanse the land, that's their -- Israeli language, and find a way to essentially bring back some settlements, outposts, settlers.

And what Israel would see is essentially Western support for that. We hear Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, European leaders, Arab leaders talking about their concern about Palestinians while at the same time still arming and funding and backing Israel where it matters.
