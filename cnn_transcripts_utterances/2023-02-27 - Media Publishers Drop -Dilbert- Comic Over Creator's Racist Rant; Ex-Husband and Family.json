But I me, I've watched a lot of this Scott Adams live stream over the past 48 hours or so. And he really was effectively encouraging and is effectively encouraging some form of segregation. I mean, his comments there are calling Black people a hate group, obviously, are bad enough, but he's continued basically to promote the idea of segregation on these different -- on these different shows that he's been appearing on, his live streams on YouTube.The other thing I think that's interesting is, as you said, that Elon Musk is effectively rushing to his defense. It's one thing for Scott Adams, this cartoonist to make these comments. But you have Elon Musk now weighing in, accusing the news media of being racist. And the news media has a lot of business partnerships with Elon Musk. So it will be interesting, for instance, for now like \"The Washington Post\" which said they were severing ties over Scott Adams' remarks if they will also move to sever business ties with someone like Elon Musk, given that musk is now defending effectively those comments from Adams.",

And to have someone like Elon Musk supporting him, who's also now supporting segregation, a person who leads one of the largest communications platforms the world has ever seen, you start to get a real sense for this hostile climate that we are in around race. And the ways in which people with power will do whatever they can to sort of exert their privilege.You know, Dilbert is not just kind of a comic, right. It's this piece of art and this piece of commentary that is used in workplaces. And it's commentary on workplace. So to have the founder of it sort of talk about segregation, when we understand the history of workplace discrimination, the history of exclusion in the workplace, you know, I think it only further what it illustrates. That we also know that he's been signaling this in his comics, in his commentary for years now. And so, as these newspapers step away, I also think there's an opportunity for these newspapers, for these media outlets to have a deeper look about sort of the lines in which they will sort of -- you know, the line. And where is the line, between, you know, acceptable range of debate and inciting sort of white nationalist, white supremacist rhetoric. And I think that it'll be really important for these newspapers not to just cut Dilbert off and move on, but to recognize that some of these strips have been turned down over the last couple of years where he's tried to put other aspects of his commentary forward that has been abusive and offensive. And at the end of the day, you know, no one is arresting him. No one is putting him behind bars. He can go out and say whatever he wants. Freedom of speech though is not freedom from consequences of speech. And just because he can't make money off of what he's saying right now, doesn't mean that anyone is holding him accountable in a way that's illegal or in violation of the First Amendment.",

But the financial -- I mean, his comic has been basically cancelled across the world. And so, no newspaper is going to be carrying it. His syndicator has severed ties with him. And so, from a financial standpoint, I can't imagine, you know it will be great. Unless he has some sort of other business that he wants to promote. But he's certainly getting a lot of attention. And given who he is, it seems that's something that he's enjoying quite a bit.",

And this is a person, right, who has a deep history with running his company in racist ways. With even his own wealth, and the wealth of his family from apartheid South Africa. And so, I don't think any of us can rest comfortably with the idea that Elon Musk is now an arbiter on what's racist or not. And I think it's a deep recognition of the fact that self-regulated companies or unregulated companies is as long as big tech and social media platforms can continue to operate without rules, we will have folks like Elon Musk who will defend, literally defend segregation, get to now on -- determine how the most powerful platform -- one of the most powerful communications platforms is run. A place where people are supposed to come, engage and talk about it. When I spoke to Elon Musk, he talked about Twitter as a public square. And I pushed back and let him know that public squares can't be owned by a single person. But also this country, in his country, South Africa, has a history of black folks being killed, beat and sold in public squares. And so, if you are going to operate something like that, you have to have deeper principles and we're seeing more and more that he doesn't have that.",

Who just weeks ago appeared on the digital cover of a luxury magazine. She was reported missing on Wednesday. On Friday, police say pieces of her body were found in a refrigerator in the northern Tai Po district of Hong Kong. They also found a meat slicer and an electric saw. And later, police discovered a head, ribs and hair in a soup pot. SUPT. ALAN CHUNG, HONG KONG POLICE: It was a skull, with hair.
