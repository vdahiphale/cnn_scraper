What Hollywood might be thinking, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, let's begin with Steve Bannon, one of the architects of Donald Trump's political success, today failing at his own bid to stay out of jail. That is unless this man can save him. That's Attorney David Schoen, who I will speak to live in just a moment. Look, it has been, what, two years now since Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the January 6 Committee. Remember that? His excuse back then? His lawyer at the time, Robert Costello, remember him from the hush money trial? One of the witnesses called him to defense. Well, at that time, he said he didn't have to comply because he thought Trump would assert executive privilege. Uh, he didn't, and Bannon was apparently on notice of that fact as well. Well, he has been appealing his conviction ever since that time. And up until now, the judge in this case had been kind of holding off on the sentence. But today, the judge said, enough, there was no legal reason left to delay that sentence, and he told Bannon he has to report to prison on July 1st to serve a four-month sentence. Outside the courthouse, Steve Bannon was, well, Steve Bannon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, those are members of Congress.Bannon is part of a long now and growing list of Trump allies who have been sentenced to prison, people who stretched back to the Trump Organization days and the 2016 election and the 2020 campaign, and that includes Peter Navarro, who is currently in a Miami prison right now for the same reason, contempt of Congress. Joining me now, Steve Bannon's attorney, Dave Schoen. He also represented former President Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial. David, thank you so much for being here this evening. We're all trying to unpack all that happened in the courthouse today, and I want to ask you about what has been described as a pretty heated moment between you and Judge Carl Nichols. After he ordered Bannon to report to prison next month, you objected. Obviously, you are his counsel. And \"The New York Times\" was reporting that Judge Nichols responded in a way that let him -- you know, he wasn't too thrilled with your response, saying, one thing I need you to learn as a lawyer is that when a judge has decided, you do not get up and yell at them. Look, I know you're an advocate for your client. Explain your reaction. Were you surprised by his decision to order him to go to jail? DAVID SCHOEN, STEVE BANNON'S LAWYER: Shocked by it. It goes against everything that he has said in this case. Judge Nichols found substantial questions for the appeal, said twice that Bannon should not be serving his time while the appeals process runs. The appeal process has not run. There's nothing about the panel decision that changed that. Judge Nichols said that the definition of willfully used in this case cannot be reconciled with the modern or traditional definition of willfully. Laura, you know, I'm a big fan of yours, but I have to correct something you said in the monologue. Former President Trump absolutely did invoke executive privilege. Nobody disputes that. Not only that, he wrote a letter before the trial started reaffirming it in case anyone had a question about it, and that's all in the record. That's different from the Navarro case. And Judge Nichols even said today, well, you know, the Court of Appeals opinion could have mentioned that, but they didn't, and so on. The Court of Appeals opinion is an abomination. They misstate the facts, they omit the facts, they leave out the primary argument. The primary argument here is that in the 60 years since this Licavoli case which says, willfully, solely in the context of this statute, means did you get a subpoena and comply or not comply with, no reason matters. Sixty years since then, the court has -- the definition of willfully has evolved. So, 2019 --",

Remember, Costello got the subpoena, not Bannon. Costello, as an experienced lawyer, told Bannon, executive privilege has been invoked, you may not comply, period. It would be against the law, it's not your privilege. But, he told the committee, if you take him before a court and the court says privilege doesn't apply or it's not this broad, he will comply fully. They decided not to do that.

The jury should have been told that. That's number one.Number two, if you want to apply willfully this way, then you've created a separation of powers problem. Congress isn't the final arbiter when a president or former president invokes executive privilege, period. It's presumptively valid, and Congress can't decide that. Go to a court. A court could decide it, and that's what Bannon asked them to do. They refused to do it. There's a constitutional mandate to accommodate, try to work in accommodation. D.C. Circuit has said that.

So, nothing changed.

In this case, what he did, though, is pull the rug out from under him because he has to file now. He's going to send a person to prison who he himself has said didn't comply, who he himself has said was convicted under a definition of willfully that simply is not consistent with the law.

And apparently, we're being told that he gets slapped repeatedly in this new movie and what reviews are citing as some sort of a homage to the incident. I don't know if that's the right phrasing for it. But Will Smith is posting to his Instagram this behind-the-scenes footage of him operating the camera while acting, showing everyone, hey, I still got it. So, are people ready to embrace the \"Bad Boys\" yet again or will \"Bad Boys 4\" take a hit? Here with me now to crunch some numbers, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten.

Twenty-five million ain't going to cut it. Forty plus million is the benchmark we're looking at. That is under what the third film made.
