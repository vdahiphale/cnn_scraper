Kennedy Jr. will remain on the ballot in Michigan and Wisconsin. Kennedy recently filed an emergency appeal to remove his name, but election officials believe it was too late because early voting has begun. R.F.K. Jr., he dropped out of the presidential race in August, and he has endorsed Donald Trump. And the polls are now open across Botswana for the general election to choose the next parliament, which will then elect a president. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party has held power there since the southern African country got its independence from Britain in 1966. And the Chinese spacecraft blasted off earlier today with three astronauts on board. The crew is heading to China's permanently inhabited space station to conduct dozens of scientific experiments.

So what we were able to show is that these political technologists areresponsible for designing and delivering country plans, basically, which is doing research, researching different countries to identify the wedge issues that you could exploit by putting particular narratives through social media. And we've been able to show that they both operate domestically within Russia, but they've also been quite influential in terms of Russia's approach to Ukraine. We've identified them operating in terms of drawing up country plans for a number of European countries, in Latin America, and in Africa as well.",

So you see them doing some quite creative kind of things. So one of the examples that we cite in our recent report is we show that in 2023, they built a monument on the gaming system Minecraft to a particularly influential Russian leader. And over 12,000 people visited that monument in one day on Minecraft.

But you can shape the issues they think about so you can define the agenda on which the election is being fought.
