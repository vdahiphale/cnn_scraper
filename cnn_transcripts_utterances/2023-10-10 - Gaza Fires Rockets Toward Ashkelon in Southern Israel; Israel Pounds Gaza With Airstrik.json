We also heard the Iron Dome intercepting some of them. You can actually smell the smell of the explosives coming from some of the balconies out there. So, unclear at the moment how many of these rockets may have made impact or what the damage may be, what the casualty rate may be, but certainly a lot of rockets were fired. The hotel was a relatively secure location. Okay, we're hearing more sirens coming again. So, I'm just going to move away from the window. And -- okay. The shelter is over there. Do we want to go towards the shelter or -- well, let's just see. Sorry. So, the bunker is this way? We're just moving into this bunker here. This is actually where we were when the last barrage came in as well. Every floor of the hotel has a bunker like this. You can hear some activity out there. It's not anything like it was on that previous round. I don't know if you're picking up on that. That sounds like maybe interceptions. It's difficult to know, but that's what it sounds like. But it's a bit quieter now. We're trying also to send in some video that we captured from inside the bunker when the first round of rockets went off.

Hamas spokesman issued a warning to the residents of Ashkelon to leave the city but before 5:00 P.M., which is, what time it is, it's 5:11 P .M. where you are in Ashkelon right now.

Then things were quiet for a few minutes. And then as we were talking again, there was another round of warnings and, again, we were moved to the shelter. And that time it, was a significantly -- well, it was not as sustained or intense a barrage. It appears to be quieter again now, and we are just trying to get more clarity on what damage has been done. But it was like clockwork. They had sent a notice just after 3:00 that people needed to leave by five, and at 5:00 on the dot, those rockets started slamming in.",

That's a good indication or a bad indication, rather, that a rocket has made it through the Iron Dome intercepts.We were watching as Clarissa was going through that, as she was hearing the rockets going out. We could literally see them taking off from their firing positions in the distance there and intercepting with a bright flash in the sky. And just all that you can see now, those intercepts, are those small puffs of smoke in the sky there. But, again, that huge percussion that Clarissa is hearing, the huge explosions that she's hearing, we're witnessing it at a distance. We're seeing the rockets fired out.

That big folly of attacks that it put in on Saturday morning, 22That volley on Saturday morning hasn't been matched since. It sort of died off a bit Sunday. Maybe 150 missiles were fired in a salvo towards Tel Aviv. I think that was on Sunday. I must say the days blur into each other. But what was significantly noticeable was that on Monday morning, though there had been a drop-off in the number of Hamas rocket attacks on Sunday, on Monday morning, it noticeably picked up again, because it was Monday. They know it's a news cycle. They wanted that attention. They wanted a show that despite the Israeli Defense Force attacks on their positions, that they still have the ability to fire out. We're looking at the Iron Dome intercepts again over where Clarissa is. I'm imagining that she is hearing right now the siren going off, because those intercepts are right above her now. So, I think what we're witnessing this evening and the fact that Hamas gave this warning, it's drawing attention to themselves. It's saying, watch this space now. Watch us launch more rockets. We haven't been forced out of action. So, I think as well, we're also hearing the howitzers firing on the Hamas positions, Israeli guns firing on Hamas positions.",

So, make no mistake about it, this is a Hamas attack on Ashkelon, one they said was going to happen. And, Clarissa, again, as you are looking at it now, that appears to be closer to the port.

It's difficult to see from behind the buildings.But we do know that there have been rockets pretty much every day in Ashkelon, certainly since we've been here. I haven't heard anything, and correct me if you guys think I'm wrong, but I haven't heard anything quite that sustained barrage that we've just heard over the last 20 minutes or so. There have been some direct impacts, one, a couple of days ago near the hotel in a building, another one at a bus stop. But the question now, of course, is, where did these rockets hit, the ones that weren't intercepted, has anyone been hurt? I will say that the system is incredibly effective. You don't have a huge amount of time from when you hear that siren. You need to move very, very quickly. But it does at least give you just a few moments to try to get to cover a safer space. And as I mentioned before, all of these hotels and buildings have -- or most of them have shelters on every floor, all the bus stops have shelters attached to them because this has become part of life for people here and this is something they've become accustomed to but certainly not on anything like this level.",

One, you got there a few days ago, and to give some comparison, because we saw you in another barrage of fire coming from Gaza yesterday or the day before. And how many people -- do you have some sense of how many people are still there? Are you seeing civilians still there in Ashkelon trying to live their lives and stay safe at the same time as this is happening?

One is Ashkelon, which is on the water. One is Sderot, which is much closer to the Gaza Strip. But you all are just about 16 miles or 27 kilometers away from each other. So, you are both seeing the results of all of these rocket attacks. What are you experiencing there, Nic Robertson, in Sderot? ROBERTSONSo, you know, we have a very good view of what's happening where Clarissa is, a distant outside view. The hell that she is under gets rained on on different parts of Israel, but that Ashkelon and Ashdod area, where along the coast, really gets it bad. This town here, Sderot, also gets it bad at times, but not at the moment, perhaps because Hamas knows the civilian population has mostly left here and that there are still a lot of civilians among whom they want to cause terror in Ashkelon. And that seems to be part of the pattern, the pattern as well, we saw those rockets fired out from Gaza that were going towards Tel Aviv. Then our colleague Becky Anderson had a siren go off there where she was. So, Hamas, I think this evening is trying to send this clear signal partly by saying, you know, watch this space at 5:00, partly by firing missiles that they would use not to be able to do all the way to Tel Aviv, partly by then coming out and saying we've fired over a hundred missiles this evening. They are very clearly on a sort of an information offensive as well as a military offensive and saying, we're not defeated, we've got firepower left, we've got rockets left. And very clearly from what we've seen today traveling around that the Israeli Defense Force firepower that's amassing around them and being brought to bear on their leaders and their fire positions are clearly going to tip that balance out of Hamas' favor so they can't fire rockets. But this is them saying, you haven't done it yet.",

So, that is what's happening in Gaza as there is outgoing from Gaza as well. You just saw an explosion there of some sort in the water. That would be incoming air strikes on Gaza port there.Nic, Clarissa, we are going to bring you both back in because you are sort of on opposite sides -- not opposite sides of this conflict, but, Nic, you can see the outgoing, Clarissa, you are experiencing the incoming in Ashkelon, and we will let you two sort of describe to each other what is happening.",
