I'm Bianca Nobilo in for Max Foster in London.Just ahead, Northern Ireland prepares to welcome U.S. President Joe Biden, as tensions in some parts of the country boil over. Then Israeli forces and Palestinians clash in the occupied West Bank leaving hundreds injured. And the Biden administration admits it doesn't know how classified documents revealing U.S. intelligence secrets were leaked online. In the coming hours, U.S. President Joe Biden will head to Northern Ireland mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Accords. But not everyone is ready to praise the peace agreement. This was the scene in Derry Monday, masked men throwing petrol bombs at police and their vehicles. It happened during a march organized by a dissident pro-Irish Republican group. Phil Mattingly joins us now live from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Phil, what can we expect from the President's visit? And how far do you think that his personal connections are informing his approach to the island of Ireland?",

      "sentences": "You know, I think the personal connections deeply inform how the President operates and like anybody who's dealt with covered or been aligned with the President over the course of his first two plus years in office have kind of circled Ireland and Northern Ireland as a trip that everybody really wanted to go on.It's such a personal issue for the President seems to be referenced either through Irish poets or deep family connections just about every speech the President gives. However, the first stop on that trip arriving here later this evening is one that underscores there's some complexity here. And when it comes to the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, while there certainly has been peace and stability that is followed in the decades since that agreement is reached, everything that you're talking about showed in the introduction, underscores the fact that there is still significant work to do. And I think that will be the primary focus of the President when he arrives here later this evening. And tomorrow, when he gives a speech at Ulster University, a recognition that there is significant work still to be done, a recognition that a power sharing agreement that has only led to sporadic operation of the government here over the course of the last several decades is certainly something that needs work. And the reality that with Brexit and the efforts to try and reach some type of trade agreement, the Windsor agreement that was reached in February, that there's still more work to be done there as well. You will see when the President arrives here, when he speaks tomorrow, a significant focus on economic development. His special envoy, Joseph Kennedy, will be with the President, while he's here talking about the realities here that while there may be relative peace and stability, while the durability of the Good Friday Agreement certainly holds true to this moment, there's still so much more that can be done on the economic side, for an area of the world for a community that certainly hasn't seen the benefits that perhaps Ireland has seen over the course of the last couple of decades. That will certainly be a focus as to whether threats or what we've seen over the course of the last couple of days, has raised some concern inside the White House. The President himself addressed this just a couple of days ago saying there's no way they can keep me out. This trip was happening no matter what. And we'll certainly see those deep familial connections over the course of the President's travels through Ireland. But the focus here in Northern Ireland without any question, will be the elevation of the U.S. role in reaching that Good Friday agreement, but also the willingness of the U.S. to help on the economic side of things one, which officials acknowledged despite what they view as the clear success, at least in the near term. From the peace perspective, the Good Friday Agreement is underscored by the fact so much work is needed in the years to come, Bianca.",

Thanks.More than 200 people were injured during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, that's according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. On Monday, thousands of Israeli settlers marched through an evacuated Jewish outpost near the town of Beita. They were joined by Israel's Minister of National Security Itamar Ben- Gvir. And in Tel Aviv, anti-government protesters blocked a highway after a televised address by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Some of them blamed him for the recent escalation of tensions. CNN's Hadas Gold joins me now live from Jerusalem. Hadas, I believe the funeral of Lucy Dee still ongoing.

But the Pentagon says it has taken steps to tighten the flow of information as the Biden administration scrambles to minimize the fallout. Meanwhile, some of America's allies are reacting. Australia says it's concerned, while South Korea claims a considerable amount of information in the documents is fabricated. And Ukraine may have the most direct response of all.

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, there are two major investigations that are underway right now. One is being led by the Pentagon and that is a government wide investigation of the impact of these classified documents leak on U.S. national security, specifically whether any sources and methods have been burned as a result of this massive leak.The second is the Justice Department criminal investigation, which is looking into the source of the leak, basically trying to figure out who did it and whether it was a criminal act because, of course, these are highly, highly classified documents that the U.S. never wanted in the public realm. So that is how the administration is dealing with this internally. But with regards to how it's dealing with allies, we are told that the Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has been tapped to deal with the diplomatic fallout from the leak of these documents, because so many of them actually detail really sensitive U.S. intelligence about allies, including South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine, including conversations that senior allied officials have had with each other about matters that are important to U.S. national security. And the South Korean Defense Minister actually spoke to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin just last night. And according to the South Koreans, they believe that a lot of the information in these documents have been fabricated. Now, we have not been able to confirm that. We are told that much of the documents are authentic. But as we did report earlier, at least one of the documents does appear to have been altered. And that is a document that lists Russian and Ukrainian casualties as a result of the war in Ukraine, listing those Russian casualties as a lot lower than what the Pentagon has actually assessed. So at least one of those documents has been altered. But by and large, according to the Pentagon, these do appear to be legitimate slides from a daily briefing that is given to senior Pentagon officials every day and is accessed and accessible by thousands of people across the government. So it's going to be a really tough task to figure out who leaked these and why, Bianca.",

But now, you have the circumstance where in many states where abortion actually is allowed, it might be much more difficult to have these medication abortion.Now, so a lot of people think that this is going to end up at the Supreme Court because that federal appeals court I mentioned is one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country. It is stocked with a nominees that were put on that bench by President Trump.

One of the cities that has been consistently hit the hardest is, of course, Bakhmut. CNN's Ben Wedeman met with a group of evacuees now taking shelter in the nearby town of shattered Chasiv Yar. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the safest way out of Bakhmut, but not really safe at all. Video obtained by CNN of the view from a Ukrainian armored vehicle shows the wasteland the city has become. And it was in a vehicle like this that Marina and Yevhenia escaped from Bakhmut. They're building was hidden in bombardment last Thursday, killing three. Among them, Yevhenia's 33-year-old grandson. I had to help him, she recalls. But I couldn't do anything. [08:25:05] They waited in their ruined homes with the dead for three days before the army could rescue them. Marina's daughter was married to Yevhenia's grandson. What will I tell my daughter, cries Marina. She and my grandchildren are in Poland. This shelter in nearby Chasiv Yar provides them some comfort and warmth, but they're still not out of danger. This town is well within range of Russian guns, and since the battle for Bakhmut began seven months ago, it has regularly come under shelling. On this day, the Russians were firing incendiary munitions over the city designed to cause fires. One resident showed us has spent capsule from the rocket. (on-camera): Officials say there are perhaps 1,000 civilians left in Chasiv Yar. Evacuations are possible, but they don't seem to be many takers. (voice-over): Alexander drags firewood home. There's no electricity or running water here. He fled to Chasiv Yar from Siversk, an hour from here, where his home was destroyed. Is he leaving? No, he replies. My wife died here. My parents are buried here. Serhei Chaus (ph) heads the town's military administration. Since last April, we've been trying to convince people to leave, talking with them, reasoning with them, he tells me, but we can't make them. Yet again, the old and infirm refused to leave despite the danger. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Chasiv Yar, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
