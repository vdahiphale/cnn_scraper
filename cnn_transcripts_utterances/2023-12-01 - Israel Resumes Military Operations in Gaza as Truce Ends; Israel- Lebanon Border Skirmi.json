The breakdown of a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas as leaders from around the world are gathered at the U.N. Climate Conference right here where I am in Dubai. The Israeli President is here and has already met with the Emir of Qatar. Qatar had and has a pivotal role in facilitating or mediating the hostage negotiations. Well, America's Top Diplomat Antony Blinken has also arrived in Dubai from Israel after a fresh round of shuttle diplomacy. And we start with the resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas. Israeli warplanes bombed Gaza just after the seven day truce ended. Israel accuses Hamas of violating the truce by firing a rocket towards Israel. Hamas says Israel refused all offers to extend the pause. The Hamas controlled Health Ministry in Gaza report 32 people, 32 people killed since fighting resumed. Well, some of the heaviest Israeli bombing is reported in Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza. Israel's military dropped leaflets which you see here warning people in the city it is a fighting zone. Well, during the week long pause Israel says 110 hostages were freed from captivity. Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners. Well, the pause also allowed desperately needed aid to enter Gaza. But no aid trucks have gone in since that fighting resumed. Well, before the truce ended Hamas released eight more hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross helped facilitate those releases. Israel says 137 hostages remain captive. And even with the resumption of fighting, negotiations over freeing hostages do continue. Well, the Director General of the Red Cross Robert Mardini joins me here in Dubai. Robert, let's just start with what you understand to be going on with regard these negotiations at present. ROBERT MARDINI, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS: Well for now, we hope that the negotiations will continue and will generate more releases of hostages and the Palestinian detainees reunited with their families. But so far, we understand that there is a pause in this operation unfortunately.",

So Sudan and South Sudan both conflict ridden. Yemen and Afghanistan you know the stories there, you've covered them. And in these places what you're seeing is that the conflict is exacerbating poverty. And then the climate crisis exacerbates poverty as well. And I use the word climate crisis, not climate change because in the countries that we're working in it's a crisis. Remember this too Becky, those 16 countries, how much of global emissions are they responsible for? Answer 2 percent. What percentage of climate disasters are they suffer from, 40 percent. What percentage of humanitarian need is in just those 16 countries, 60 percent? So you can see that the climate crisis and the conflict that is local that is civil wars sometimes exacerbated by outside players make life an utter misery for people on the sharp end. Just 10 percent of the world's population are in those countries but they are 50, 60 percent of humanitarian need. They depend on organizations like ours.",

Secondly, innovation we need seed strengthening of the type that we're doing in Northeast Syria, and in Pakistan. We need to help local communities be they rural or urban adapt so that they can insulate themselves from some of the worst effects of climate change.

I think the UK is an interesting case. We've done pretty well, if you measure it since 1990. The argument is, is this a time to slow down? Or is this a time to speed up? And I think what's changed is there's now an economic argument for speeding up. I was central state for the environment 15 years ago seems like history.

The Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza saying today's bombardments have already killed more than 100 people. The U.N.

Witnesses, eye witnesses is also telling CNN that the steady stream of aid entering Gaza from Egypt since the start of the humanitarian pause is now at a standstill with no trucks entering Gaza today.

And the results of those strikes according to the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health, more than 100 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the truce ended and the fighting resumed at seven o'clock this morning, local time. Israel has said that it would carry out a stronger campaign and was ready for the resumption of fighting. Hamas indicating it was ready as well, even as international mediators and teams tried to continue the pause and fighting for as long as possible to get out as many hostages and to get in as much humanitarian aid. But as we saw there in the video, an eyewitness on the ground there says even though some of the trucks have been inspected by the IDF a necessary step before they go in, they have not as of today, as of our last update entered Gaza to this point and that is horrible news for the horrific humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Still, the ongoing efforts to negotiate are continuing Israel and Hamas indirectly talking through Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S. trying to come to some sort of agreement that would allow the truce to resume and then continue. Israel blames Hamas for not providing a list of 10 women and children for another 24 hour pause in the fighting for the terms of the original agreement. Hamas says they were ready to expand that deal to include elderly men, as well as men and women who served in the IDF. They say Israel rejected all offers. So that is where the negotiations stand. Interestingly, as bleak as it looks right now for the immediate future here, our Senior State Department Official said the talks are ongoing and there's the possibility of a truce resuming perhaps even today. It's hard to see that from where we stand right now, given what we're seeing unfold in Gaza. You can see those images on your screen there.
