Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Russians versus Russians. A new and violent challenge to Putin's Russia tonight, a group of Russians now fighting on behalf of Ukraine are claiming that they have liberated several Russian villages along the border with Ukraine. The anti-Kremlin group posting videos of the men driving through Russian checkpoints at the way that the show this, there are no Russian guards that appear in any of the videos, so there guard-less checkpoints. Some of the vehicles these men are actually American made tactical vehicles. And we're trying to understand more about this. Our Matthew Chance actually spoke to one of these anti-Russian Putin fighters, who wanted to remain anonymous and asked him why he has turned on Putin now?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a bald cross border rate, exposing the weakness of Russian defenses. And highlighting the increasingly brazen armed groups who say they're Russians fighting against the Kremlin. Moscow dismisses them as Ukrainian saboteurs, who have not been defeated, a barrage of ferocious Russian strikes carried out on its own soil. Defense officials say, at least, 70 at the fighters, some in U.S. made Humvee armored vehicles have not been killed. But for the Kremlin, attacks inside Russia, like a series of damaging train derailments over the past year, or attacks on crucial fuel storage facilities, have become an embarrassing feature of its war. Even the Kremlin itself was targeted with drone strikes, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. But Russian groups, who say that they're fighting against the Kremlin, are increasingly emerging from the shadows. CNN made contact with a fighter said to be front that National Republican Army, and anti-Putin group operating inside Russia. His voice and features have been disguised. ANTI-RUSSIAN FIGHTER (through translator): A fire at the military facility, the death that the agent at the regime, or a day of activity on the railway that surprised the Russian army.

He also served as adviser to the commanding general of U.S. Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan. He has just returned from seeing Ukrainian troops training and speaking with a number of officials, Ukrainian officials, as well in Europe. So, Seth, let me start with you, this report Matthew is reporting, speaking to these Russian fighters to some of them. They're staging attacks inside Russia. They're supporting Ukraine. They say their goal is the complete liberation of Russia. Let's be honest here, the truth is that we don't know a lot about these groups. Some of the fighters may be quite extreme. We are not -- we just simply don't know a lot about them at this point. We also don't know if Ukraine is working with them directly. But what are you learning from Ukrainian officials, Seth? SETH JONES, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, Erin, I am learning a couple of things from Ukrainian officials. One is that what they're trying not to do is to conduct a tax targeting Russian civilians. They saw the mistakes that the Chechens made with the Beslan attack against the school, with the subway attacks in Moscow, so they're trying to stay away from those kinds of activities. The primary focus is that there is a little bit of sabotage going on, as we've seen tonight, but most of the activity we're seeing is targeting weapons depots, rail heads, fuel depots, that really are going to impact Russia's ability to fight a war. That's where most the Ukrainian attacks and sabotage operations are directed.",

So, being very firm on that. I mean, this was a quick hearing, just 15 minutes. As you noted, Trump appeared by video, next to us attorney. He acknowledged that he had received this protective order, which bans the former president from posting on social media and it materials he receives from the prosecutors that could include what's statements, grand jury testimony. They don't want that getting into the public demand because what prosecutors said were Trump's inflammatory statements on social media that he made against the judge and the case and the district attorney Alvin Bragg.

Nearly every teenager in America uses social media. Many of them, spending an average of three and a half hours every single day on social media apps and sites.But Dr. Vivek Murthy, surgeon general, says in his new report, there is no guarantee that social media is safe for kids, of any age. And in fact, nearly all of the research points to negative impacts. Things like depression, anxiety, worse sleep, body and image issues, eating disorders, low self-esteem, online bullying, and it just goes on and on. And this is not even talking about still unknown damage to the actual brain itself. A developing brain. OUTFRONT now, Dr. Vivek Murthy, he is the U.S. surgeon general. And, Dr. Murthy, I really appreciate the time. So, in this report here, it's really fascinating, I hope people will go and download it. You paint a frightening picture of the reality of the detrimental effect social media can have on young people. What surprised you the most about what you learned in this? DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Well, Erin, I am really concerned. You know, I'm concerned as surgeon general. I'm concerned as a doctor and as a father about the potential impact of these platforms on our kids. The whole reason, Erin, that I embarked on this effort to create this advisory for the American public is because parents all over the country have been asking me about social media. It's the single most, you know, common topic that they ask about and they want to know, is this safe for kids? So, when we look at the data, what we found are two critical things. One is that there is not enough evidence to say that social media is, in fact, sufficiently safe for our kids, but we also found that there is a growing body of evidence showing that social media use is associated with harms. You mentioned earlier a key finding in our report that on average, teams are spending three and a half hours a day on social media. That's on average. I mean, it means many kids are spending much longer than that. The key point is that the data also shows when kids are spending more than three hours on average, that they face nearly double the risk, increased risk, of depression and anxiety symptoms. That is really profound. And, you know, they're more concerning facets here, but what we have to understand from all of this is that it is urgent that we take action to protect our kids and to make sure that their experience on social media is safe. We have done that for other projects that kids use, for medications, four cars. And we have not asked parents to go inspect the car themselves and make sure it's safe. We have set safety standards and we required manufacturers to implement and abide by those standards. We got to do the same thing here.",

But I was amazed, 40 percent of 8 to 12 year olds use social media. Frankly, I was shocked by that.So, when you say we need to do something about this, it has to be collective, it has to be parents agreeing. You know, that this is the whole point of it, right? Because we excluded from the social media the child feels isolated and left out, right? Then you are on it and it causes depression and anxiety, and it's online bullying.

Where we have this technology that previous generations never had to contend with, that fundamentally transforms how our kids see themselves, interact with other people, perceive the world, and it's rapidly evolving. And what we've asked parents to do is to somehow figure out how to manage this with their kids and keep them safe. That, in my mind, is not unreasonable.That's why while there are steps parents can take, and I will mention what these are, we absolutely need policymakers to step up and establish safety standards and actually enforce them. We need them to ensure that the identity of kids is protected. We need them to also ensure that they're requiring companies to share their data on the health impacts of these platforms, because independent researchers tell us all the time, they've requested the full access to this data, but they're not able to get it from the technology companies. So, we need policy makers to take action. Tech companies certainly need to design their platforms with health and safety in mind. You know, Erin, many of these platforms are designed to maximize the amount of time people spent on them.",

But there are steps here that parents can take now. And I want to mention he's because otherwise, you know, parents can feel like just waiting for others to take action. It feels disempowering.But today, parents can start conversations with their kids about their social media use. So, you understand more about what platforms your kids are using how they're using them. But also how they're making your kids feel. And kids also need to understand the red flags. What to look out for that you should worry about, that you should report to an adult, bullying, harassment. What worries me, Erin, six out of ten adolescent girls say that they have been contacted by a stranger on social media in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. But parents can also do one other thing. They can make sure that they are creating tech free zones in their children's lives, where we are protecting them and particularly protecting their sleep, physical activity, and their time in person with others. This could mean saying that dinnertime, when you're with family, is going to be a time that is tech free. It could mean saying that the time before you go to bed, an hour beforehand, and throughout the night, is a time where we don't allow our kids to use social media. I say all of this knowing that all of these changes can be challenging. It is hard to take these phones and these devices, and social media, away from our kids. But this is why I think it's also important for us, as parents, to help one another, to partner with each other, and do this together because there's strength in numbers here. We've got to be there for each other.",
