      "sentences": "That's right. So, this is breaking news, what we've heard from President-elect Donald Trump, who is now urging the Supreme Court to put a pause on this controversial ban on TikTok that is set to take effect next month. He's arguing in this legal brief that such a pause would allow his incoming administration to try to find some sort of negotiated resolution with TikTok.Now, all of this relates to a new law that Congress approved earlier this year. Biden signed it into law that would effectively put a ban on TikTok come January 19th if TikTok does not divest from its Chinese owner, if they do not sell the company to a non-Chinese owner. And this has caused, of course, a lot of controversy, and now it's before the Supreme Court. Now, what the Supreme Court has before it, the decision that they are weighing, is essentially whether or not this ban would violate First Amendment rights. Now, Donald Trump, in his legal brief today, did not go into whether or not, you know, this I don't know if this violates First Amendment rights or what his opinion on that is, but this is what he did say in this brief. He said, quote, he suggested that the court should pause this to allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns. Now, to be clear, Wolf, Donald Trump has kind of given mixed messaging on his view of all of this regarding TikTok in the past. We know that when he was first in office during his first administration, he had supported a ban on TikTok. He was very concerned about China's influence on young people in this country and its influence through the app. However, throughout the last several months on the campaign trail, Donald Trump kind of started to say that he wasn't so sure if a ban was the right move. And then we also heard him in a press conference earlier this month, essentially say that he was warming to TikTok because many young people voted for him who used the app. I want you to take a listen to how he phrased that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT ELECT: We'll take a look at TikTok. You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points. And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we know as well, that exact same day, TikTok had also filed this lawsuit with the Supreme Court asking them to put a pause on the ban, all to say it's very unclear what is going to happen from here. But Donald Trump is officially weighing in now asking for this ban to be paused so that his administration can take a deeper look at it.",

If you kind of look back in history, Wolf, his campaign first joined TikTok in June after his son, Don Jr., joined, and it was basically them arguing that they would not be willing to cede any ground to the then-Biden campaign on any of these platforms that reach more voters, which is potentially these young voters. And then his followership exploded on that app after he entered it.And so I think him weighing in on this point is significant. I think it's the trajectory of what has happened is significant. And he says, he's warms up to it and then he meets with the TikTok CEO, and then he continued to kind of speak favorably of it, kind of winking and nodding that he may weigh in before he actually enters office. So, it could be something that they consider particularly because this is a right-leaning court. But, again, we will just have to see, I think even if they move to ban it come January 19th, I think that we could also still see some -- a push from the then-Trump administration to change some of the rules because they do find it incredibly powerful to get out the message because of all the people that are on there and because of the following that the president-elect has.",

Well, I think it's really interesting, Wolf, because to win the election in November, Donald Trump had to go beyond his base, folks who want to be more conservative on immigration, folks like Steve Bannon and others that have been with him since 2016 and before, and expanded to folks like the tech bros to be able to win both the Electoral College and the popular vote. And so it's not surprising that they're having these types of discussions within the party because the tech community thrives off of foreign workers, and it's something that kind of goes against the base of what at least folks in 2016 wanted the then president-elect to do and now president-elect again.I think what's most notable is that we haven't heard from Trump, and we haven't heard from anyone that's directly on his staff, Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy, and I think that that is really the consummate question is when is Donald Trump going to weigh in and what does he believe? We obviously know that earlier this year, he sounded more favorable to at least letting some folks in who had gone to college. But, of course, it's a larger conversation going on. And I would just say my last thing here, Wolf, is that it's not just going to be limited to immigration, but there are going to be conversations like this on criminal justice and other issues.",

You know, it's also one of those things that I think Trump's voters have to get adjusted to.It's a classic Trump bait and switch. He said he was going to prioritize American workers. And now he's got senior advisers that are basically calling them mediocre. He's saying that they're not up to the task. So, this is going to be a part of. It's a problem that we're going to see going forward and it should be a concern for all of them.

When you look at all the preliminary evidence here, I don't think there's any question, but that the Russians used some kind of air defense system that brought down that airliner. Look at the area where this took place. The Russians had been going after drones in that area. The night before, they brought down something like 59 drones. So, they clearly were using systems in that area.Secondly, the people on the plane heard the explosion outside the plane before shrapnel started going through the body of that plane, which is very typical of air defense missiles and how they're used. And lastly, the evidence on that fuselage is pretty damning because those holes were caused by shrapnel or by munitions of some kind. They certainly weren't caused by a bird strike.

Now, the TSA tells us that this passenger did not have any prohibited items and we're told again that this person was arrested on a criminal trespassing charge.

Donell, thanks very much for joining us. Do these stowaways expose major weaknesses in airport security? DONELL HARVIN, FORMER D.C. CHIEF OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE: They do, but I think this is also a good opportunity to talk about the good work that TSA does. In 2023, they screened 850 million people in one year. That's about 2.4 million people in a day. It is a zero failure mission, unfortunately. And back in 2015, an undercover investigation found that they had failed 95 percent of what we call penetration testing to find and detect prohibited items. That means that only 5 percent of the time they actually found items that were going through. That number increased a little bit better in 2017, went down to 70 percent. There's still a lot of work to be done. And, unfortunately, TSA does not publish their failure rate. So, this is a concern.",

But the good thing is that the last line of security, which are those flight attendants who were actually just doing a head count, detected this. Now, it shouldn't get to that point, right? But, certainly, there was some diligence on the flight crew and they turned around this plane.

I'm probably one of those, you know, when people talk about tariffs, I don't think you want across the board tariffs. But I think tariffs are a tool in a toolbox. And we've got to work together on trade. I did with Donald Trump on NAFTA, which was a poorly written bill that needed to be rewritten. It was bad trade policy and took Democrats too long to acknowledge it or work on it. But if he's going to do things that are going to hurt the people of my district and the people of my state, another place that's very complicated is the auto industry. And how do we protect the domestic auto industry? How do we compete in a global marketplace? We all have to work together on these issues and recognize some of them are very complex.
