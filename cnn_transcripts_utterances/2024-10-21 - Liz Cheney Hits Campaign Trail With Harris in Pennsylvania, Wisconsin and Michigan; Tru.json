I want to talk about what Harris is doing today before we get to Donald Trump's visit to North Carolina. Harris obviously campaigning with former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Do you think that her message is going to resonate with these disaffected Republicans or more moderate voters if so much of her focus is a warning about what Trump could do in a second term versus pitching her own policies? GEOFF DUNCAN, (R) ENDORSED HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT: Well, I was at an event last week with Kamala Harris, Republicans for Harris event in Bucks County. And it was a two part message. One, it was speaking directly to Republicans at, you know, what a bum Donald Trump is and what a horrible president he has been and will be. But it really also built a strong bridge to Republicans talking about how inclusive she would be in her administration. I got to speak with her privately and was reinforced with wanting to have somebody in the cabinet, wanting to get those voices of conservatism around the conversations in the White House.

Have I lost my complete mind? I want you to keep that question in mind because we have so many folks who are talking about the early vote, and it means this and that for the different candidates. I have no idea what it means for this campaign besides the fact that folks are voting. Because I want you to keep in mind, there was a pandemic last time around, all right? There was a pandemic back in 2020. So there were a slew of people who either voted early in person or voted by mail. In fact, it was 69%.This time around, we're expecting a significantly lower portion of the electorate to vote early or by mail, just 53% in a recent average of polls. So we see the shrinkage that's going on here. And then you see people going, oh, this is good for the Democrats, good for the Republicans. I have no idea who it's good for. And it's not just that fewer people are voting earlier by mail. What it really is, is the complexion of the early vote in person and by mail is changing. So in fact, it wouldn't surprise me at all. In fact, if we look at the polling that there are going to be more people who are voting early in person this time around compared to 2020, just a little bit up. But I'm expecting far fewer folks to vote by mail this time around. We're talking about 24% on average in the polling data. Compare that to 43% who did so back in 2020. So it's the nonelection day experience that is changing.

ENTENessentially take a look at what we're expecting, right, the polling argument (ph). Look, Kamala Harris is almost certainly going to win that vote by mail. She leads in an average of the recent polls. Get this, by 43 points, that early in-person voting, that's going to be pretty split down the middle. Look, you got Trump by two here. That's well within any margin of error. I don't know. Maybe Harris wins it by two and you tally it all up. But the bottom line is very close. But then, we're expecting that Election Day vote to be very good for Donald Trump. In the average polling, we see him up by 17. But here's the key nugget to keep in mind. All of these votes count the same at the end of the day. Yes, you'd like to bank some early votes so then you can put your get out the vote efforts into some other camps. But the bottom line is, even if Harris leads in that early count because of this mail vote, Donald Trump is very likely going to close the gap pretty quickly on Election Day.

And there was no joint meeting on the day of the rally between U.S. Secret Service and all state and local law enforcement agencies assisting Secret Service.

Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court to a proposal like this.We've obviously seen over the last few years, the Biden administration, as well as Democrats across the country, take a flurry of actions to try to preserve and codify various access to reproductive rights. And, of course, we have to talk about the fact that politics is very much at play here. We know that Democrats see reproductive rights and healthcare issues as being incredibly politically salient to, one that has the ability to drive out voters and mobilize voters. And it is one that Democrats are keen on talking about, particularly as they are trying to draw as stark a contrast as possible between Democrats and Republicans, and particularly now between Vice President Kamala Harris and her vision, and what a Donald Trump second presidency would look like. And the Vice President, for her part, had been playing a leading role on this issue for the Biden and White House, even before she became the democratic nominee. And she put out this statement today with this new proposal being put out by the White House. She said, \"while we fight to protect and expand healthcare, extremist so-called leaders are attacking reproductive freedom at every turn. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly blocked legislation to protect the right to contraception across the country. [14:25:02] They have also consistently refused to protect access to IVF and continue to propose national abortion bans.\" This rule does need to go through a public comment period before it is finalized.
