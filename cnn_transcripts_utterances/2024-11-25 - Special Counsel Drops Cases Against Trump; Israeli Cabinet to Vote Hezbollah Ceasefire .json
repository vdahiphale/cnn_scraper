Special Counsel Jack Smith dropping two major criminal cases against the president-elect. Philippines fire. Thousands are left homeless as a blaze engulfs a shantytown in Manila. Macy's millions. The retailer says an employee hid up to $150 million worth of expenses. And a wave across the ocean. The British start-up using embodied A.I. to bring self-driving cars to the states. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, two major legion victories for Donald Trump. Special Counsel Jack Smith dropping the federal election subversion case against him and the classified documents case. Smith added that the outcome was not based on the merits or strength of the cases and kept the door open for charges to be brought once again in the future. The president-elect said, quote, \"It was a political hijacking and a low point in the history of our nation and our country or country that such a thing could have happened, and yet I persevered against all odds and won.\" Vice President-Elect J. D. Vance, adding, quote, \"If Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison. These prosecutions were always political. Now, it's time to ensure what happened to President Trump never happens in this country again.\" For more, we're joined by James Sample. He's professor of law at Hofstra University.

And you can view it as a success electorally. You can view it as a success in terms of the support of the rank-and-file voters, and that's certainly true. It's also a win in terms of avoiding accountability, which means it's a loss for the rule of law that it took so long to bring these cases to trial that they never, in fact, got to trial before the election.",

It seems farfetched. It would be four years from now at a minimum. But because he is encouraging the judge to dismiss these cases without prejudice, that means that there is still the opportunity to refile. With respect to the classified documents case, you're absolutely right. There are two co-defendants. The most prominent of those is Walt Nauta, and those who have been around Trump know that those two are basically always attached at the hip pretty much wherever they go. My expectation is that one of the very first actions that Donald Trump is going to take when he takes office on January 20th is to pardon those individuals. Now, that's not a guarantee. You don't need to wait for a conviction for Mr. Trump to pardon them, but I highly, highly doubt that those two will ever stand trial in the classified documents case.",

What is the mechanics of that? Do they call somebody up? Is it the U.N.? Is it the U.S.? Who adjudicates that? Is there an adjudicator? So, that was sort of one of the pieces of detail that we don't understand. But what we do understand are the broad basics of this, and that is a 60- day ceasefire. Hezbollah moves north away from the border with Israel. It moves 30 miles, 45 kilometers north of a river called the Litani River. This is just like the 2006 as a U.N. Security Council Resolution for it. And at the same time, Israel pulls back south of its border. And then in that sort of military vacuum, that's where the U.N. security force is supposed to go in and expanded force is what we understand, but we don't know the contours of that. And also, the Lebanese army is supposed to go in there, and their role would be to make sure that everyone plays right, particularly that Hezbollah doesn't move back to the border again. And historically, the U.N. hasn't been able to do that. The Lebanese army is weak compared to Hezbollah, and they haven't been able to do that. So, that's where you get the sense of there's all these questions, and perhaps the detail of the deal, when we find out about it, will answer some of those questions. But that's what's supposed to unfold, and the trigger, as far as we understand, will be that decision by Netanyahu's cabinet less than 24 hours from now.",

San Francisco has had problems at the airport all day because of this. Some of that rain and storm moving onshore. As we go towards tomorrow, all of this moves east.

We will find though that this first storm will exit as we go into Tuesday. So, getting out of our hair, but this storm will continue to develop and create a pretty wide windshield here and rain as well. By Thursday, we're looking at snow developing across the lake -- the Great Lakes interior New England, from Upstate New York into Maine. And then, look at all of this rain, stretching from D.C. down to Charlotte, Atlanta, and the Florida panhandle. So, while the rain won't -- doesn't look like a lot, maybe an inch or two, again, will make things soggy and then a several inches of snow possible for parts of interior New England and the Rockies as well. So, as far as travel headaches, it's actually not terrible Tuesday and Wednesday, unless you're flying in and out of places like Denver and the Rockies. That's where the problems will be. By Thursday, it's up and down the East Coast. It starts to hit some of those bigger cities like New York, D.C., Atlanta, Boston. Some of these areas could have some problems because of all of that rain. So, pretty soggy turkeys on Thanksgiving along the East Coast. Some cooler air coming in behind it. So, it gets pretty cold for the Northern Plains, the Great Lakes, some snow showers up in the Northern Plains and some wind on the West Coast.

First of all, during the week, she won a million dollars for winning the Risk Reward Challenge and then by winning the last event of the season she won another $4 million. That was the biggest prize in women's golf. She absolutely deserved it. Coming from behind over the last few weeks, this was an absolutely brilliant approach to really put the pressure on her rival for the title. Her rival buckled, Jeeno made the putt. And so, just like that, in the space of a few days, $5 million. To put it into context, that much money is more than any of the men's major champions won for winning those majors in 2024, and it really does represent just how big women's sport and women's golf is becoming when you've got that kind of money to play for. As you say, a short time ago, I did speak to Jeeno. We had an absolutely brilliant conversation on World Sport. And one of the things I asked her about was how she chose golf because legend has it that her dad sat her down at the age of six and said, you can play tennis or golf, you choose. So, she went away, watched some YouTube videos and chose golf, and this is why. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEENO THITIKUL, WON SEASON-ENDING LPGA EVENT:  I believe it was Tiger Woods. And some Thai players that are on the LPGA, maybe like Ariel, Moria, and Nideko (ph) at that time, I guess. That's pretty much -- like, summed up me to, like, playing this sport more. Because I wouldn't -- heard of a golf at all and I have no idea where like they have a club and hitting the ball. That's so interesting on my side. That's why I want to try.
