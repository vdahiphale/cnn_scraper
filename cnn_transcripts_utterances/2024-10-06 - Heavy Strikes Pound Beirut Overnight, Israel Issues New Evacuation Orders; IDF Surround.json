Perhaps this has been the most intense night of strikes since the night that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike. Perhaps as many as 25 individual strikes, taking place.We don't have any word on casualties from these strikes, but we know that the hospitals here apparently are struggling at this point with the number of casualties that they're getting. Now there's continued speculation about the whereabouts of Hashem Safieddine, who was believed to be a possible successor to Hassan Nasrallah. The other night, there was a massive Israeli strike. The Israeli said the target was Safieddine. But CNN has -- we haven't -- for one thing, we haven't heard anything from Hezbollah itself. However, a Lebanese security source tells CNN that Hezbollah has lost contact with this individual. Meanwhile, the minister of education here came out and declared that government schools will not open until the 4th of November.

Still, so many more than 90 alive and dead hostages in Gaza.We're hearing this from French President Emmanuel Macron, that countries should stop sending arms to Israel to use in Gaza. And he added this. This is a reporting from the \"Washington Post.\" If we call for a ceasefire, consistency is not to provide weapons of war.

And then they would, you know, a year later be a move on to sort of a longer-term solution, whether it was a two-state solution or the deal that President Biden was trying to put together with Saudi Arabia and so forth.Instead, we are in what you heard the prime minister called a seven front war Gaza, now Lebanon. I suspect that within days we're going to see pretty significant military action against Iran by Israel. And we don't know what form that's going to take. And the U.S. efforts first to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. And then just 10 days ago, a ceasefire in Lebanon basically kept completely falling apart.

Since that time, we've seen the prime minister routinely dismiss the president's advice.But in the case of Iran, it takes on a different nature. Because there are elements of the attacks, especially the attacks on the nuclear sites, that it seems as if Israel cannot do without American help. And, of course, if Iran responds the Israelis have to calculate the degree to which the United States is going to, you know, come in and help Israel out. Now, the president said he will always defend Israel's right to exist and defend itself. But he is urging them not to get into a war with Iran at the very moment that they are wrapped up, obviously, in Lebanon with Hezbollah and back in Gaza with Hamas.

Obviously, the families, in their anguish, are talking about them all the time. I think that you could see Lebanon look increasingly like Gaza. But I suspect it will not reach that level of intensity. I certainly hope not. The pictures we're seeing are scary enough as it is, and the misery of the people. And of course, many Lebanese are not in support of Hezbollah. But Hezbollah is stronger than the state. And so, separating the two out is a really hard thing to do.

Many people in the crowd had actually been at that first rally. Some of them had not, they told me, but they weren't too worried about security, particularly because -- and we know this as well, that Secret Service and local law enforcement had really ramped up the protocol in place for Saturday. But I want to focus on what Donald Trump came to Butler to do. And that was, in large part, to honor some of the victims and -- specifically Corey Comperatore. He is the man who was killed on July 13 by that spray of bullets. Corey Comperatore's family was in the audience. And Donald Trump spoke about him at length, talking about the type of man that he was and how he had shielded his family members, and that is how he died. He died dying a hero. Donald Trump also thanked some of the other victims who were injured that day, as well as Secret Service, and Butler law enforcement, and Pennsylvania law enforcement overall. Now, I will say he spent probably the first 30 minutes or so of his speech doing what his campaign had said he would do, which is make this a remembrance. However, after that his speech became very political and it reminded me of his speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee just days after his first Butler appearance, where he had promised a speech about unity. And he did give one until he quickly turned the speech into an attack on some of his allies. It was very similar on Saturday. I want you to take a listen to what he and both his running mate, J.D. Vance, had said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: First, they tried to silence him. When that didn't work, they tried to bankrupt him. When that didn't work, they tried to jail him. And with all the hatred they have spewed at President Trump, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance have tried to argue in the past that perhaps Democrats -- Democrats' rhetoric about Donald Trump, particularly arguing that he may be a threat to democracy, may have been what had led to that first assassination attempt, or even the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life. Of course, there is no evidence to support that but that was the case that they were making.I also want to just note that we saw someone at this rally on Saturday that we hadn't seen at Donald Trump's rallies before, and that is Elon Musk. Of course -- remember, Musk actually endorsed Donald Trump just moments after the gunman had opened fire in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. It was almost a full circle moment. Musk came on stage and said that he believes that the 2024 election is the most important election of our lifetimes. He praised Donald Trump. And really, Musk has become a top surrogate for the Trump campaign. I think it was very clear that they were making that even more official on Saturday, Victor, Amara.",

It's something that the former president really articulates himself saying, they're not coming after me, they're coming after you. I'm just in the way. I'm just standing in between those two things.The former president is trying to show to Americans and trying to make the case to his voters that they have stake in this election. And it's a way to try to galvanize them to head to the polls. Now, hearing that messaging from such a large messenger like Elon Musk is significant. Also, noting that he has become such a controversial figure in the political atmosphere. But will Elon Musk flip any votes? I'm not exactly sure. As you mentioned, this is not a new endorsement.

Well, last night, they're on the other end of it. The top-ranked Crimson Tide going down on the road at unranked Vandy, 40-35. (INAUDIBLE) was favored by 22.5 points in this one. The Commodores end a 40-year drought against the Crimson Tide. Fans were rushing the field. First-ever win over a top-five team in Vanderbilt's history, let alone the number one. Quarterback Diego Pavia completed 16 of 20 passes for 252 yards. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm super thankful, super thankful for guys like Eli Stowers. Man, that kid's incredible. The rest of our team. Look at this. Look at this. Vandy we're (INAUDIBLE) turnt (ph).(END VIDEO CLIP) WIRE (on-camera): Oh my. Absolutely (INAUDIBLE). In Nashville afterwards, look at this. Students toward out on a goalpost and a (INAUDIBLE) goalpost for a ride. They paraded them down Broadway and they eventually ended up in the Cumberland River. Nashville Fire Department had to go in and fish him out later. Oh, my goodness. They didn't sleep all night. You know that. All right. MLB playoffs. Now divisional series underway. New stage, same old Shohei. After seven years in the major, Shohei Ohtani making his postseason debut, says he dreamed of this as a kid. Well, dreams come true. Second inning, a three-run homer. So, his first career postseason hit is a home run tie in the game at three. And he wasn't done. Fourth inning, L.A. was trailing again. Broken bat. Ohtani gets this knock here. It's a single, but he's on base now. And three batters later, Teoscar Hernandez brings him home on what would end up being the game- winning hit. Dodgers beat the Padres 7-5 in game one. Over in the American League, the Yankees getting all they could handle from the Royals. The pinstripes trailing on three separate occasions. Each time they took the lead, Kansas City would answer right back. But then in the seventh, Alex Verdugo put the Yanks up for good. The single to left. Watch Jazz Chisholm running right up out of his helmet. Beating the throw. New York wins game one of the best of five series, 6-5. Now today we have NFL Sunday kicking off in London for the 16th time in 17 years. And it's the undefeated Vikings. They're 4-0 facing the future Hall of Famer Aaron Rodgers and the Jets. They're 2-2. Morning kickoff here. It's at 9:30 Eastern. So, get your popcorn ready early. We also have game four. So, the WNBA playoffs semi-finals. The Liberty can book their spot in the finals with a win over the Aces. And the Lynx can clinch as well if they can take down the Sun.",

In the Bible, there is a phrase, bakesh shalom verodfehu. It means that you ask for peace and you have to run after the peace in order that it will happen. This is our mission. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
