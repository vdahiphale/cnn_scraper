Emergency workers continue rescue efforts for those who are still trapped. Valencia is the hardest hit region, seeing its heaviest rainfall in 28 years. An Israeli military source tells CNN the country is at a high level of readiness for possible retaliation from Iran. But the source says they are still determining if and when an attack would take place. This follows Israel's own retaliatory strike against Iran last week. The final stretch of the U.S. presidential election will run through the swing state of Wisconsin later today. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are set to rally there. The two made multiple campaign stops on Thursday with singer Jennifer Lopez joining Harris for a rally in Las Vegas a few hours ago. Some of Trump's supporters are already pushing false claims of voter fraud and promoting lies about a rigged election.
