The death toll has climbed to at least 46 following the head on crash of those two trains. It happened late on Tuesday night.I want you to look at this new video into CNN. It shows the moment of impact between the freight train and the passenger train apparently traveling on the same track with nearly 350 passengers onboard. Train employee facing charges and the country's transportation secretary has resigned now. So, we get more details from Nada Bashir, live for us at the scene of the crash in Tempi, Greece, this morning. Good morning to you, Nada. Where does this investigation stand right now?",

But now, of course, we've learned from the authorities and from the prime minister himself that this is believed to be likely related to what he described as a tragic human error. And There has been now the arrest of one individual, a manager at a nearby train station in the city of Larisa (ph) who has been arrested and now charged on allegations of negligence and causing mass death through negligence, as well as grievous bodily harm through negligence. That is now the key focus of this investigation. But, of course, the recovery effort is still ongoing. And if you just take a look behind me at the destruction here at the scene, you can see the train carriages overturned. The first two carriages, in fact, completely engulfed by flames. That one overturned is actually the third carriage, and there are believed to have been no survivors in any of these carriages. We've been speaking to some of the rescue workers here today. They say they are not anticipating any further survivors. This is strictly a recovery effort. And for the dozens of people now in hospital, there are real concerns for their safety, for their condition. Many still in intensive care. But, of course, while the main focus of this investigation so far appears to be on human error, there is the question of the safety measure in place across the rail network. The country's transport minister, just yesterday, announcing his resignation, saying that rail network simply isn't up to the standard one would expect in the 21st century. Don.",

They say that they have concerns about Sweden harboring terrorists in their country. Sweden has taken some steps to try and make Turkey happy essentially here, making it more easy to detain and prosecute terrorists in the country. But so far that hasn't done enough for Turkey. Turkey is still the major holdup here. They're saying that they would say yes to Finland. They're saying that they would say no to Sweden at this moment. So, the State Department's still saying that they want both of these countries to join, but they're sort of side stepping the concept that could actually become a reality where Finland actually has the support and Sweden doesn't yet. They're saying that they want to see both of these countries join, but they're not definitively saying that they would totally be opposed to one joining before the other.",

There wasn't a scheduled meeting. But the fact that the secretary of state was able to in person deliver messages to the Russian foreign minister is significant.Now, what we're learning -- what we're looking to learn more about is exactly what he said, right?
