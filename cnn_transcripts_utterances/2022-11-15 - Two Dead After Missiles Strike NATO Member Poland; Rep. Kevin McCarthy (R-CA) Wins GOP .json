CNN is on the scene of the strike. We'll bring you a live report in just a moment.Here in Washington, the balance of power is still very much up in the air with Republicans on the verge of a very, very slim House majority. This as Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy fends off a right-wing revolt and locks down the GOP nomination for speaker of the House. And we're awaiting a so-called special announcement from the former president, Donald Trump, who is widely expected to launch his 2024 White House campaign tonight. We're getting new reaction from top Republicans, including former Vice President Mike Pence. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to the breaking news right now. We have our correspondents standing by around the world. Let's begin with CNN Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance. He is on the scene of the deadly missile strike in Poland. Matthew, what are you learning there? What are you seeing?",

Firstly, the Polish authorities have confirmed that two local farmers have been killed in that rocket strike, which is very tragic, of course, for the local community here. We're also hearing from the Polish authorities that they are considering invoking Article 4 of the NATO treaty. Article 4 is the article that refers to consultations between the allies to decide on what action to take as a result of this instance. What's not known at the moment, Wolf, and this is crucial, is that whether this is a Russian missile strike. Remember the context of this strike is that there were dozens, perhaps nearly a 100 Russian missiles striking Ukraine across the border at the time that this strike took place inside Polish territory. It could have been. The Russians, I have to say, categorically deny striking any area of Poland at all. But, of course, they often deny any malign activity that they're accused of. And it could have been a Ukrainian anti- aircraft missile. That is certainly something that's been floated out there from various parties. Although the Ukrainian officials I've spoken to on background tonight say that they're very confident indeed that this was, in fact, a Russian attack on Polish territory, Wolf.",

He'd warned in the past that the Baltic States could be vulnerable to this sort of attack, and, indeed, he has warned in the past that Poland could be too.Poland has been very fulsome in its support of Ukraine throughout this conflict, and a huge amount of the U.S. weapons, for example, but many other weapons from around the world that have contributed to the Ukrainian effort come in through Poland. But this is also come on a day, Wolf, when President Zelenskyy said that 10 million Ukrainians had suffered power outages because there had been another mass wave or series of waves of missile attacks against the critical national infrastructure, notably the electrical circuits around the country, but also in Kyiv, where two people were killed when residential blocks were hit, Wolf.",

President Biden then holding a call with Polish President Andrzej Duda, going through the details of what has happened and what they know up to this point. President Duda briefing President Biden on the preliminary results of the investigation, what Polish investigators have found to this point, and the White House saying that President Biden said that the U.S. is willing to support and provide any assistance necessary for the further investigation but also to the Polish people generally. He also reiterated the ironclad U.S. commitment to NATO. Now, all of this is happening as NATO has scheduled an emergency meeting between NATO ambassadors later today. President Biden also spoke by phone with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, all of this activity at a meeting, at a summit of which the backdrop is all about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Any number of different areas of the world leaders that are here trying to deal with this, trying to grapple with this, trying to unify the western response to this, that has been so solid over the course of the last eight or nine months. And what happened on the ground in Poland is certainly rattling an already tenuous equation. What we know up to this point is White House officials are not confirming any specific incident that happened, just saying that the investigation is under way, will not lay out next steps until they know definitively what happened.

But the context is also very important, because what's happening is that, first and foremost, Russia has not attacked any square inch or attempted to of any country, even the very close neighboring ones, the Baltics and Poland up until this explosion today, it has not done so in the nearly nine months of this -- it is on the back foot militarily inside Ukraine. And it's presumed, it's assumed by those who are watching that the huge salvo of cruise missiles and other projectiles that went into the civilian energy infrastructure and other targets in Ukraine today are a direct response for its humiliating loss in Kherson, for President Zelenskyy's visit there and for President Zelenskyy's address to the G20, where he also laid out his idea of a way to end a ten-point peace plan, which involve basically, bottom line, Russian troops first having to exit Ukrainian territory.",

MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, you're going to see some bomb damage assessment, Wolf. That's where they look at the craters that these missiles created inside this very small farming community. And I'm probably going get the name wrong, Przewodow, it is about 15 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. What I'd point out, there are a couple of factual issues. Number one, Russia has not been very accurate, even with their precision munitions. Number two, very close to that Polish border, in fact, about 25 kilometers away, are the towns of Yavoriv and Lviv. Russia has hit both of the towns because those are military towns inside of Ukraine. I've been to both of those towns multiple times. Yavoriv, which is about 15 kilometers away from this Polish village right across the border, is a major Ukrainian logistics and training base. So, it could have been a Russian missile going towards Lviv or Yavoriv that got off course. I would suggest the commentary this being a Ukrainian air defense missile is not very well advised because most of the Ukrainian air defense is on the eastern border. We're talking about a site that is 800 miles away from where the fight is occurring in the Donbas.",

CHALIAN:  Well, we're going find that out in the course of this campaign. I mean, that's where we're going get our answer. He has clearly taken on some water, even with his standing with Republicans. The question is how much. And I also think that the structure of the race is going to matter. Is Donald Trump running in a very crowded field, where there are a lot of non-Trump alternatives that split up the vote, like they did in 2015 and 2016, and does he still have a die-hard 25 or 30 percent where he can win primary contest after primary contest in a crowded field and amass delegates. We'll see. So, I think so much needs to take place for us to understand the real answer to your question, Wolf, but we know his election denialism, which has been his calling card for two years now, was pretty roundly rejected by the American people throughout this campaign. Not so in a Republican primary context, right? Lots of Republican nominees were election deniers. But the American people rejected it and that is now the context in which Donald Trump enters his third presidential campaign, that his whole rationale for being over the last two years was rejected soundly by the American people.",

He is trying to take credit for some of the things the conservatives accomplished or that they believe that they see as accomplishments, whether it's taxes or putting conservatives on the Supreme Court, et cetera, while still being able to say, I don't approve of what happened there. I mean, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact this midterm was the first national election we had in the wake of the January 6th Capitol attacks. So, I think that's kind of what's going on there.

That's why the primaries broke the way they did, why in many cases the Republican Party nominated election-denying candidates the way that they did, but it also became abundantly clear this time that winning a general election on that messaging is very unlikely.

We've seen before what have happened to speakers who have been in similar sort of precarious positions with a raucous caucus and a slim majority. John Boehner was in that situation. He was essentially run out of town by that caucus. So, I think this is a dream job for Kevin McCarthy once again, and I think it might end up in some ways being a nightmare for him to actually be speaker of the House.",

I know you had an important hearing today as well on another subject. I'll get to that shortly. But how alarmed are you by this deadly incident in Poland today, a NATO ally, and considering the risk of escalation, how critical is it for the U.S. and the NATO allies to establish the facts before deciding next on steps? SEN. JON OSSOFF (D-GA):  Wolf, thank you for having me. And as we speak, the National Security Council at the White House and the U.S. Intelligence Community are working to establish those facts. I expect to review briefing materials on this subject in the hours to come, and the U.S. commitment to NATO remains iron-clad.",

This is an appalling lapse by the Department of Homeland Security, violating constitutional and human rights of these detainees. There is little worse, and I've led a lot of investigations as chair subcommittee the past couple of years, there is nothing worse than nonsensical gynecological surgery performed on incarcerated women.
