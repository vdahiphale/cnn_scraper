If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.The state of Texas has executed death row inmate Ivan Cantu, despite the lack of discovery of new -- despite the discovery of new evidence. Cantu denied murdering his cousin and his cousin's fiancee more than 20 years ago. His supporters believe that he did not receive a fair trial. Federal and state courts rejected appeals and the governor declined to intervene. Illinois is now the third U.S. state to remove Donald Trump from its primary ballot. The judge is citing the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause that bans insurrectionists from running for office. Colorado and Maine also removed Trump on those same grounds. Their decisions were paused while the Supreme Court rules on Trump's appeal. And France is a step closer to enshrining abortion rights in its constitution. Yesterday, the French Senate overwhelmingly approved the amendment. The measure now moves to a joint session of both Houses of Parliament on Monday, where it needs to receive three-fifths of the vote to become law.",

He said, interestingly, given the support we've seen recently for Alexei Navalny, given the burst of anti-war sentiment we saw around an anti-war candidate who's now been running in the elections, he said that from the start, it was supported by the absolute majority of the Russian population.He spent a while sort of talking up the unity of Russians around this, how the entire economy has been mobilized around this, how it's shown flexibility and reliability, also talking up the strength of the economy. He did predictably attack the West. So far, he's saying the so-called West, as he put it, trying to hold back Russia's development, trying to weaken Russia from the inside. He went on to say how, you know, Russia is willing to engage in dialogue on what he called strategic stability. This concerns the nuclear issue. But the U.S. is looking for Russia's strategic defeat. And he's again accused the West of provoking not only a conflict in Ukraine, but a conflict in the Middle East. So, so far, nothing particularly newsworthy, but similar lines that we've heard from Putin so far.",

The actions of the U.S. and its allies basically dismantled the system of the European security, and it's very risky. Of course, we have to work on the formation of new lines of the equal and unchallenged security in Eurasia. We are ready to talk to any countries who are interested in it. And I want to emphasize, and I think that today it's very important for everyone, without sovereign, strong Russia, there won't be any strong peace in the world. It's impossible. We're trying to combine the efforts of global majority. And we're talking about the transformation of the world's economy, finances, markets, when all monopolies are being ruined and stereotypes combined to those monopolies. Back in 2028, the BRICS countries with new members of this group of countries will be achieving more than 30 percent of global GDP, whereas G7 will be dropping below 28 percent. But those figures are very impressive, because even 10, 15 years, the situation was totally different. But I was talking about this, the world tendencies, we cannot hide from them. They have an objective nature. Look at the world's GDP for the countries of G7 was 45.7 percent. BRICS without even expansion -- well, I mean, I'm talking about there wasn't it wasn't existing. But the countries of BRICS had 16 and a half percent back in 92. But in 2022, G7 had 30.3 percent GDP and BRICS 31.5 percent GDP. Well, GDP. And closer to 2028, the situation will change even better towards BRICS. We will have 36.6 percent ...",

Now, in 2023, he returned with the message that Russia and the West cannot live anymore together as it was before.Well, basically, a mixture of geopolitical considerations he wants to share with the general public in interviews and everywhere, and what he has to say under Russian law, under the Constitution, something about the social and economic situation.

This, you know, when you are under pressure of the state, especially authoritarian state, it's not easy.And they are on the front line. They were not thinking they will keep fighting for so long time. There is a movement of the wives of mobilized people, which bothered Vladimir Putin very much because he doesn't know what to do with the wives of his own soldiers. So they are hoping that he somehow will deliver a message about how he aims to end this war. But my impression is that the message will be about how he will continue this war. Because the war in these two years reshaped Russia very much. It became a core of Russian political life, political system. It's a dictatorship waging a war.

It does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has recently said almost three quarters of casualties are women and children. The Biden administration has become increasingly critical of how Israel is conducting the war. President Biden is saying it's been over the top. FOSTER: Communications blackouts and restrictions on journalists make it difficult to get a true picture of what's actually happening in Gaza. Jomana Karadsheh and a team of CNN journalists documented an attack that killed more than half the members of just one family and found a mystery that took weeks to unravel. We have to warn you that parts of our report do contain disturbing graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Every patient here has a harrowing account of survival. But it is the story of this one young woman that, as you'll see, would become key to uncovering an atrocity that until today had been hidden in the dark. They're all gone. I have no one left, 18-year-old Dhruba Abu-Jabba (ph) told us. She offered few clues as to what had happened to her and her family. But a week later, a cameraman working for CNN in Gaza was out filming, as he's done every day for months. He was one of the first to arrive in this area just after Israeli forces had withdrawn. It was on that day, January 14, when he stumbled upon the scene of a horrific incident. At first, we had no idea this was connected to Dhruba, until they start pulling documents from the rubble. It's Gaza's grim routine of trying to identify the dead. Then, the startling discovery. Later that day, CNN producer Abeer Salman screens the footage and sees Dhruba's I.D. This is where she was critically injured, and the bodies are the remains of her family. The images tell of the brutal force that was unleashed here, and people speak of a massacre of civilians. With the stench of death in the air, they pull body after body, tiny corpses carried on blankets. And in the corner, a woman sits, covered in flies. In her decomposing arms a young man. But we still didn't really know what had happened here.",
