      "sentences": "A big development and a big development that Donald Trump has wanted for a long time. That case against him in Georgia, the criminal case, where it's accusing him and several others of a racketeering conspiracy related to the 2020 election, it's already been paused. Now, it's not even backburner. This is a case that will be dead in the water because the Georgia court of appeals is now saying that Fani Willis, the leader of the prosecution against Donald Trump, the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, she should be disqualified from being able to bring that case.The Georgia Court of Appeals is saying that it's a significant appearance of impropriety caused by the conduct of a public prosecutor. That is Willis, how she behaved, how she was speaking about the case, about Trump publicly, about how she was having a relationship with the top prosecutor that was concealed in this, a man named Nathan Wade, all of that. Previously, the trial level judge had looked at and said, Fani Willis can stay on this case. We're not dismissing the indictment, but the court of appeals is now taking another look and saying, no, the trial judge was wrong. Fani Willis should be disqualified from continuing to lead this case. It would be a long process, or it will be a long process to replace her, which is why I say this case is dead in the water now without Fani Willis, the person who was leading this case against Donald Trump in Fulton County. And just to keep tabs on how many cases there are against Donald Trump criminally, the other two in federal court, January 6th and classified documents, those are dismissed. And then the additional case in New York City, where he was set to be sentenced, that sentencing is now not happening. So, as Donald Trump enters the presidency, each of these courts that is handling a criminal case is essentially removing that issue from him to have to deal with in any period of time in the near future.",

Elie, what can you tell us about this case down in Georgia, the Fulton County case, alleging election subversion against Donald Trump and a whole cadre of other co-defendants Katelyn Polantz was saying that potentially this case is just completely dead now?

Number two, obviously, I mean, she has acknowledged it was a mistake to have an affair with the lead prosecutor on the case, have a relationship with the lead prosecutor on this case.And separately, and I'm looking to see if this is in the opinion, I believe it is, because I know it's one of the issues that was briefed to the Georgia Court of Appeals, the D.A. made statements outside of court that the trial judge found were, quote, legally improper. For example, she went in front of a church while this case was pending, and she said, essentially, the reason these defendants have brought these motions, standard legal motions, is because they're playing the race card. And the defendants, Donald Trump and other defense lawyers, argued that that violated the responsibilities and ethics of a prosecutor. And the trial judge, oddly, said those statements that Fani Willis made out of court were, quote, legally improper, and then he did nothing about it. He said essentially too bad, there's no remedy. So, still going through this court of appeals opinion, I'm interested to see if they also opine on that as well.",

But for all intents and purposes, he is not going to be -- he's not going to have his day in court to defend himself against these charges that were coming out of Fulton County, which, I mean, to refresh our memories, but Elie, these were very serious charges when they first came out.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, these charges came out, Jim, in the summer, August of 2023 and it was actually the fourth of the four indictments to drop. And what this case charges is that Donald Trump and I believe 18 others, I think there was 19 total defendants, including people like Jeffrey Clark, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows and others, were part of what's called the racketeering enterprise. It was a state level, Georgia state level racketeering charge, which essentially charged that Donald Trump was at the head of this organization that existed in order to try to overturn and steal the 2020 election.The allegations that the D.A. made largely overlap with the allegations that Jack Smith made in his federal case in Washington, D.C. That's already been dismissed on a different basis. Let's remember, just to try to keep this all straight, the two Jack Smith federal cases have both been dismissed voluntarily by Jack Smith, because now that Donald Trump's been reelected, Jack Smith acknowledges he cannot proceed with the prosecution. There was a bit of a separate question about the two state cases. They're still arguing over whether the Manhattan hush money case can proceed to sentencing. That's ongoing. And then this is the fourth case. This is the Georgia state level case. And for now, it's not even going to matter what Trump's status is as president-elect. For now, the court of appeals has basically taken this whole case off the track. Separately, by the way, they're not going to be able to proceed once Donald Trump gets sworn in on January 20th. So, this case was going down the tubes either way, but I guess this expedites it.",

Elie, I think you're going to stay with us because we have more breaking news.Just minutes ago in a Pennsylvania courtroom, murder suspect Luigi Mangione waived extradition. He is now expected to be taken back to New York to face charges in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. This week, a Manhattan grand jury indicted Mangione on 11 charges, including first-degree murder and murder as an act of terrorism. And sources tell CNN that he will also face federal charges. Let's get right to that story. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is outside a New York courthouse where Mangione could appear in a little while from now, and Danny Freeman is outside the Pennsylvania courthouse. He just left that hearing. Danny, what can you tell us? What did you see?",

      "sentences": "Sure thing, Jim. I just stepped out of court just a few moments ago. This hearing pretty much went as we expected. It was a little less than an hour-and-a-half. And that headline that you noted there, Jim, at the top is that Luigi Mangione has officially and formally waived extradition. The expectation is that he will be heading back to New York.And I'll just note one of the things to come out specifically in open court on the record is that he will not be and he will be returning to the state correctional institution that he has been for the past two weeks since he was apprehended not too far from here at that McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Jim, I'll give you just a little bit of color from what we saw inside. We saw Luigi Mangione. You, I believe, saw the footage of him being taken into the courthouse in an orange jumpsuit. He was clean shaven today. There was no outburst as he was walking in, like we saw last week. And when he was in the courtroom, he did speak only a little bit, but it was really just yeses and nos, making sure that he understood what the judge was saying when essentially he was waiving this extradition process. One of the things I'll note, Jim, is, again, I was in court with him the first time in the same building over a week ago, and that first time, this is before the outburst, he seemed pretty frazzled. He seemed very, very uncomfortable where he was when he was here. Today was a very different appearance and look from Luigi Mangione. He seemed calm during much of this hearing. A lot of the proceedings that we saw was actually a lot of waiting. There was basically a lot of the defense attorney here in Pennsylvania and the D.A.'s office working out paperwork for a good hour or so. And Luigi Mangione was sitting at the desk by himself at the defendant's table just waiting. He was smiling at times. He was chatting at times with some of the sheriff's deputies as well, but mostly and his head down, reading and writing on some of the papers that he had in front of him. But, again, the word that came to my mind when watching him again in contrast to that outburst, and the first night I saw him in court, was he seemed calm today. And then the other thing I'll note, Jim, is that the judge was very clear. He said to Luigi Mangione and his defense attorney, Tom Dickey, who we've seen on our air over the course of the past two weeks, he said, do you understand this right that you're waiving this? And you understand that you're waiving this extradition? And his attorney turned to Luigi Mangione and said, is that what you want to do? Luigi Mangione said very clearly, yes. So, that is the process right now. All the paperwork has been signed. And I'll tell you from inside the courtroom, it was a small courtroom, the majority of people who were in that courtroom were media. But in the first row of the courtroom, Jim, there was a line of NYPD officers clearly ready to take Luigi Mangione. And that's really what brings us to where I am right now. We're at the courthouse. We're on the back side of the courthouse where we've seen Luigi Mangione come in every time. This is basically where we're expecting to see him exit this time again. But this man you're looking at, we believe, has New York plates, so he may be on his way to New York in a short amount of time now that he is officially and formally waived extradition, Jim.",

I assume his attorneys have brought him a change of clothes. We're seeing a very different Luigi Mangione and his appearance, as Danny has described, So, I think we're going to be seeing even another side, a different side of Luigi Mangione when he appears here at some point.We do think he will be making his way to New York City. We have been told that he will be flown here. Where he's going to be flown to his unclear. You know, this is all moving very quickly and really just an unprecedented process here too, in which the NYPD is doing this by flying him here. And then we expect now that at some point he will appear at a Manhattan court to face a judge on the indictment of murder one and murder two and the other charges. We expect to see his New York lawyers here when he makes that appearance. They will have a conversation with him. And then he will ultimately plead. And then we will see where that goes and then the process begins. The thing that I want to point out here is we will get perhaps maybe some indications during the court proceeding if where this defense is going, are they ready at this point to say that they want to -- want a psych examination of Luigi Mangione, his defense attorneys. Are they at a point where perhaps -- so all of that. So, that's what's going to be happening here today.",

And, again, only a matter of minutes, less than a half hour after that, there he was getting into that black SUV with New York plates on his way, presumably back to New York to face these much more serious murder charges that we've been talking about for the better part of the past a couple of days or so. And I'll just tell you, I mean, this is a, this is an alley that is not used to this much media presence.

It had a whole host of other provisions.But because of the opposition of Elon Musk and those late demands by Donald Trump, that has upended everything, now trying to figure out how to move ahead. Now, Donald Trump's late demand to include the toxic fight of increasing the national debt limit has only complicated things further. Remember, a debt default probably wouldn't happen until middle of next year, but Trump is now signaling he doesn't want to deal with that in his term. He wants to deal with it now. So, now they're trying to appease Donald Trump, appease Republicans, and try to figure out if Democrats could go along. And Democrats are signaling they're in absolutely no mood to negotiate.
