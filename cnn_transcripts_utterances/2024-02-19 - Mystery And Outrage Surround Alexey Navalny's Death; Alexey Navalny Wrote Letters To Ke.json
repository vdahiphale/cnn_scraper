      "sentences": "Yulia Navalnaya today talking about the 47-year-old man who a day before his sudden death seemed in good spirits, looking thin but energetic and animated in a video court appearance. Navalny was no stranger to hardship. He returned to Russia knowing he would likely be arrested, put on trial and imprisoned, this after he had been poisoned.Even in death, he is inspiring others. Some Russians have risked arrest and beatings to simply leave flowers at makeshift memorials and leaders around the world are hailing him for his stance on human rights. But to some, he's no martyr, any more than his widow and children are worth even perfunctory condolences, let alone normal expressions of human decency. Here's what Donald Trump posted online today: \"The sudden death of Alexey Navalny has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our Country. It is a slow, steady progression, with CROOKED, Radical Left Politicians, Prosecutors, and Judges leading us down a path to destruction. Open Borders, Rigged Elections, and Grossly Unfair Courtroom Decisions are DESTROYING AMERICA. WE ARE A NATION IN DECLINE. A FAILING NATION.\" There's no mention of Navalny's wife, no mention of Vladimir Putin. He did not compare himself to Navalny the way he once did to the late Nelson Mandela. Instead, his followers did. Most notably, New York Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin, who tweeted: \"As the world reflects on the murder of Alexey Navalny at the hands of Putin, it's worth remembering that Democrats are actively doing Biden's bidding as they also try to imprison his chief political opponent, Donald Trump, remove him from the ballot, and ensure he dies in prison.\" Now, for the record, as Mr. Zeldin should know, grand jury is made up of ordinary Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, handed up indictments using evidence obtained by lawful subpoenas and search warrants authorized by judges and upheld by other judges, including Republican appointees, even including Trump appointees. Any due process Alexey Navalny got was ceremonial, if not purely incidental. But Donald Trump's message today did not merely reflect his indifference to the death and possible murder of Russia's leading dissident or even his obsession with himself and his own legal troubles. In not criticizing Vladimir Putin or even mentioning his name, Donald Trump sent a message to the Russian dictator, something he also did a few weeks ago when he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us? I said, you didn't pay? You're delinquent? He said, yes. Let's say that happened. No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The very same poison that nearly killed him in 2020. Traces of Novichok were confirmed by a German lab while Navalny was convalescing in Berlin. His return to Moscow, another example of the courage that has continued to shine through his many letters written from prison as he stood defiantly against Vladimir Putin. Like the series of exchanges with the Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky obtained by The Free Press in which Navalny writes: \"I understand that I am not the first but I really want to become the last, or at least one of the last of those who are forced to endure this.\" In another letter he writes: \"One day, in Russia, there will be what was not. And will not be what it was.\" His hope in so many of the letters contagious, as in the one he wrote to an American journalist which was obtained by the Russian media outlet Holod: \"I'm doing well, and I don't regret anything,\" he writes. \"And don't regret it, and don't be upset. Everything will be fine, and even if it isn't, we will be consoled by the fact that we were honest people.\" The ink of his pen, one of his final acts of staining Putin's power, not only to be remembered in history books but even now being amplified by his wife to carry his most subversive message yet, that his courage and anger should live on.

What's going on where you are now?WALSH (on camera): Yes, to be honest, in the dark of night here, we aren't entirely clear what the shelling we've been hearing pretty much constantly over the last two or three hours actually means. We know that there are Ukrainian forces on the other side of the river behind me, and that the Russians have for months now been trying to make this town liberated from their grasp after it fell in the early days of the invasion two years ago now make life here pretty much unlivable. Drones fly overhead, and so people live in the night in darkness to try and be sure they don't become a target. And this, the daily life, frankly, of Ukrainians is worsening across the front line. We talked about Avdiivka in that piece, Anderson. You've got to remember that's just one place that has already fallen. Kupyansk, Zelenskyy visited today, that's potentially next in the crosshairs. Robotyne down in Zaporizhzhia, a tiny village, a key gain though in the summer counter-offensive, that looks vulnerable. Areas around Bakhmut, remember that from May last year, the Russians took that after a similarly bloody campaign to that which they inflict on Avdiivka. Areas around Bakhmut look vulnerable, as do other couple points along the eastern front lines. So a very nervous Ukraine, the lack of western aid, it's hit morale, it's hit ammo supplies and now it seems to be allowing a resurgent Russia to get its foot forward on the front line here. But the noises you may be hearing around me here, just emblematic of what Ukrainians are living with daily. This is not, as Vice President Kamala Harris hinted in Munich at the weekend, a time for political gamesmanship. It's a really serious life and death thing every hour here, Anderson.",
