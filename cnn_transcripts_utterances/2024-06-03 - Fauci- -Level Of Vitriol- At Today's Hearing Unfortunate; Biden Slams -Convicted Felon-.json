He'll respond live, in moments. Also, the sitting President's son is now on trial. And we now have a jury that will decide Hunter Biden's fate. A gun purchase and an addiction to drugs is at the center of this case. But it could very well turn into a soap opera. Wait till you hear who's on the potential witness list. And Donald Trump's latest plea, as he is facing the potential of prison, in just a few weeks from now, when that sentencing hearing happens, he's now calling on the Supreme Court to step in. While President Biden, for the first time, is calling Trump, a convicted felon. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. He's either a hero, or a villain, depending on who you ask, in an era of extreme division and hyper partisanship. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who became the face of America's response to the COVID pandemic, went before Congress, today, for the first time since retiring from government service, two years ago, for perhaps his final showdown with Republicans over mask mandates, vaccine guidelines, and the origins of COVID-19. Things quickly went from tense to emotional to chaotic. Exhibit A, Georgia congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

How could we as a country have saved more lives? Public officials should be held to account. We can all agree to that. But fact-finding can and should be done with some level of decency.

And I think the kinds of things we saw was a weakness, at the Public Health implementation, we did extremely well, from the scientific standpoint. The investment of decades of research, led to a vaccine in 11 months, which is unprecedented in the history of vaccinology that has resulted in the saving of millions of lives.

And Quentin, it's great to have you on. Obviously, quite strong statements for President Biden to make there. We had heard him weigh in on this, last week. But certainly stronger, tonight. I think one question is why make them in private? Why not say it, publicly, on camera, for all the voters to hear? QUENTIN FULKS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER, BIDEN-HARRIS 2024 CAMPAIGN: Look, I don't think the semantics are important here. I think what's important is that the American people know that somebody, who is the Republican nominee for President of the United States, is a convicted felon. And I think we see the split-screen of President Biden, on the world stage, the global stage, the domestic stage, trying to deliver for Americans. And Donald Trump railing against democracy, railing against the judicial system, continuing to double down on calls for political violence and extremism. And so, our campaign is going to continue to stay focused and make sure we're highlighting that contrast, in full display, for American voters.",

While Trump, on the other hand, is spending all of those resources, to the extent that he does have them, on his legal fees. And so, again, Donald Trump is not in this campaign for the American public. Donald Trump is in this campaign for himself, revenge and retribution, and to continue to double down on calls for political violence. And so, we're going to continue to make sure that we're building out the apparatus, from a campaign standpoint, that we know we're going to need, to make sure we're talking to those voters in critical battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, to make sure that we are in a position to get to 270 electoral votes.
