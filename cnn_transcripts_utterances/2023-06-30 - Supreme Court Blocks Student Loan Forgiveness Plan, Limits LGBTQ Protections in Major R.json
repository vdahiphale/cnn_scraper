Tonight, the case that pits a chief executive against the chief justice in a string of big decisions this week, including one today on LGBTQ protections in the First Amendment, now pitting some of the justices against one another. Also tonight, a CNN exclusive: The shocking details from a report on sexual assault at the Coast Guard Academy that went unreleased for years. Plus, a week after leading a failed rebellion that sent him into exile, where is Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin? And is Russian intelligence now gunning for him? First tonight, President Biden is vowing to work around a Supreme Court decision blocking his plan to forgive some $400 billion in student debt taken on by tens of millions of Americans. This is the latest from the Supreme Court that has now reshaped the constitutional landscape on abortion, affirmative action, and today, on how much leeway a president has to carry out legislation, and that would be less of it. In a six to three decision, the court holding that President Biden could not interpret a provision of a post 9/11 law to cancel student loan repayments. Chief Justice Roberts writing that something this significant required clear approval by Congress, so the president announced a detour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He even used the phrase \"sleight of hand\" as he denigrated the Biden administration's legal arguments.And he essentially said that it is not a matter of -- it is not a question of whether something should be done, it is a question of who has the authority to do it. Now, this was another one that drew a sharp rebuke right there in the courtroom, this time from Justice Elena Kagan, who said, you know, this is part of the conservative majority's effort to crack down on agency activities, protections for the environment, protections for public health and welfare, and in this case, to give some relief, in another national emergency the wake of COVID to some 40 million borrowers.

The Supreme Court strikes down President Biden's student loan forgiveness program. So this afternoon, he comes out and says, I have another way.

The decision that came out today was not the Supreme Court deciding whether student loan forgiveness is good policy, bad policy fair, unfair, something in the middle. The decision today was that the president exceeded congressional authorization. Like Joan said, the first student loan plan, which has now been struck down was based on a 2003 law called the Heroes Act that said in times of national emergency, the secretary of Education through the president can issue certain loan modifications or waivers, and Chief Justice Roberts said, if you're going to spend $400 billion, you need much more specific congressional authorization than that. Now, what President Biden has said he's going to do is use a different law, but it is similar really in the way it works. It gives the Department of Education authority to make certain modifications. But again, let's play this out. If they're going to try to do this again, it's going to take several months to put the new plan in place. It's going to be challenged up through the courts, and then it's going to come back to the exact same court barring some unforeseen developments.

And so we had a book in my grandmother's house that said, okay, if we go on a road trip, here is a hotel that will let us stay there, but these won't. Here is a gas station that will let us have gas.Can you imagine living in a world where people could say, because of religious reasons, by the way, in the south, they were religiously commanded to separate the races, that was -- it was religiously demanded. You're a good Christian if you believe in segregation. And so the First Amendment, their religious rights meant, we couldn't where we wanted to go. We weren't free. And the government said, you know what? That's wrong. If you're going to open yourself up for business, you've got to open up for everybody and that is what public accommodations law means. We have now had the Supreme Court say it is okay for businesses to say, because of my religious beliefs, I can turn you away at the door. I don't have to serve you. I can humiliate you in front of your children. I can send you away, and Supreme Court says that's fine with us. It is a horrible day in this country. It is a huge step back. I cannot imagine what people who are waiting now for a floodgate of other businesses to throw up the same signs. You're not welcome. You're not welcome. You're not welcome. And that's what this is about. You can't hide behind the First Amendment. You can't use First Amendment language to conceal bigotry. That was done to my family for generations. It was a religious argument. And so if you don't believe that somebody could lock me out of the store, because they believe that God separated the races, you cannot accept a company turning away someone else.

Will they be successful in doing that? We'll see with time\". We're joined now by CNN National Security Analyst, Steve Hall, a former CIA Chief of Russia Operations.

They know how to kill people. We've seen that many times before. For me, the big question is, why now? I mean, this -- if they were going to kill him, the time to have done it would have been before he caused all of the difficulties that he has caused. And, of course, the FSB is the -- are the ones who are responsible. It's the organization that is responsible for informing the president, in this case Putin, and those close to him that something is a mess. And either they did that and he ignored it, unlikely, or they failed to see it. And so, you know, yes, it's kind of obvious now that they would want to get rid of him, but why not two, three weeks ago they would have saved themselves. A lot of trouble had they done it then.",

But, obviously, the people who have the most power and who are closest to Putin are the ones who, ironically, are not only the ones who would be called upon to take care of problems, but also the ones who pose the greatest danger.

Now in Norway, as she looks for work, she was glued to the images coming out of Russia over the weekend. OLESYA KRIVTSOVA, EXILED RUSSIAN STUDENT (through translator): I watched it nonstop. I followed this justice march all day. I wondered how it would end. And I really wanted to see in person how Prigozhin was taken to the pretrial detention center. BELL (voice-over): Pretrial detention centers are well known to Olesya, but that's not where Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin ended up, heading instead to Belarus, where Putin ally, Alexander Lukashenko offered him refuge. ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUS PRESIDENT (through translator): I also realized there was a harsh decision taken to destroy. I suggested Putin not to hurry. Let's talk with Prigozhin with his commanders. BELL (voice-over): No such help for Olesya as she fled Russia, prizing off her own electronic bracelet on the way to the border. CNN first brought you her story earlier this year. She'd just arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, after fleeing her home in northern Russia. Taking very little but a reminder of the cost of her freedom. The reason she was made an example of, she says, is there are many ordinary Russians like her. KRIVTSOVA (through translator): Every day we see the people are put in jail for the post on the Internet. But a person who is guilty of killing 20 people, 14 people according to the official version, and they tell him, you can go to Belarus. Every time I think about it, I get angry. BELL (voice-over): But there is only one Prigozhin, even if Vladimir Putin never named him as he addressed the failed insurrection. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): What we are facing now is treason, unreasonable ambitions and personal interests led to treachery, state treason, and betrayal of one's own people. BELL (voice-over): The man behind an insurrection facing no charges at all. KRIVTSOVA (through translator): There is no law and no justice in Russia. It's just all one big act of insanity and hatred.
