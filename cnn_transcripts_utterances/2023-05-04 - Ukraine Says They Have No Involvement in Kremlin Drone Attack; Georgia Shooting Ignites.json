Video from Moscow shows two drones flying inside the Kremlin walls early Wednesday. And you can see one of them exploding just above the building's dome roof there.A CNN analysis does support Russia's claim that two drones flew by the Kremlin, but doesn't show evidence Ukraine was behind this. A former Russian lawmaker who now lives in exile tells CNN he thinks Russian partisans trying to discredit Vladimir Putin are to blame. Others suggest it may be a Russian false flag operation to justify more brutal attacks on Ukraine. CNN's Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton-Walsh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON-WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's on the edges of imagination, but the Kremlin insists it's real. An apparent drone flies into the Kremlin and detonates right on its dome, captured on many cameras a truly seismic allegation. Russia saying Ukraine sent two drones to kill President Vladimir Putin, but he wasn't home. As the smoke rose, these videos played out globally, unverified and the only slim evidence of the Kremlin's claim. It is a moment that carries great risk for the Kremlin ahead of an annual Victory Day parade there just next week. It's embarrassing they have claimed such a breach of security happened. And there will be calls for their battered military to find a way to escalate, now they have. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, on a visit to Finland today, issued a flat denial. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELLENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE: We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We're defending our villages and cities. We don't have, you know, enough weapons for this. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (voice-over): The U.S. also, not convinced. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I would take anything coming out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker assault. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (voice-over): But fear of Russian reprisals rising again in Ukraine, where bombings already definitely do happen every day and night. Over a dozen dead this day in a recently liberated Kherson, a railway station shelled and a supermarket mid-morning. Tension mounting here ahead of an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive, so from Friday there's a 58-hour curfew, nobody coming out of their homes. In Zaporizhzhia, our nights were shaken by sirens and blasts. Here is where they hit, homes. The first missile landing outside and leaving enough time for families to jump into the bath or shelter their children before the second left this hole.",

That opens up all sorts of opportunities for the Russians to bring in additional forces to also, more importantly, leverage other aspects of Russian industry and society to support the war effort.So, in other words, if they're going from what they're calling a special military operation to an actual declared war, suddenly a whole set of new operations and rules and opportunities kick in for the Russians that are not there at the moment that they can bring to bear. And I think that the Russians are thinking very much in terms of what happens at the end of the upcoming Ukrainian offensive, which is likely to go well. What the Russians want to be able to do is ultimately withstand that offensive and then come back stronger later this year or into 2024 to sustain the war, because the Russians want a prolonged war. They do not want, essentially, to see defeat staring them in the face.

He was captured in the suburbs here in Cobb County, Georgia, about 11 miles northwest of where the shootings took place. Right here at a gated community, a condominium called Waterford Place, we saw police cars speeding down the street and entering inside there.We thought maybe it was just a tip. We had heard all day that the belief was that he was in the suburban Cobb County. Fifteen minutes after police entered, we talked to an officer who came out who confirmed to us that Dion Patterson had been captured. We talked to neighbors inside this condominium community. As we said, people have been saying all-day to authorities that it was very possible that he was here in Cobb County. Cameras picked up the license plate on a car that he allegedly carjacked and it indicated the car that he then abandoned was only two blocks away from here. So, police were searching this whole area. They went inside and according to the women who live there, who we just talked to a short time ago, they told us they heard dogs barking and they weren't stopping barking. That was very unusual because they knew this man might be in Cobb County. They were suspicious. One of the women had a hunch. She called the police and said we have a pool and gazebo area. It's possible that he's there. We hear the dogs barking there. The police entered. The next thing the ladies tell us is the police yelled, get on the ground, and they realized that this man had been caught and now he is in custody. This is Gary Tuchman, CNN, County Georgia.

Police say it was committed by a 13-year-old boy who shot and killed nine people in his elementary school in Belgrade on Wednesday. A candlelight vigil was held for the victims. Officials say the suspect didn't show any remorse after the attack and his motive is still under investigation. CNN's Scott McLean has more on the attack and the aftermath.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Handcuffed with a jacket over his head, a teenager is whisked away by police. He's the suspect in a mass shooting that's brought Serbia to a standstill. The 13-year-old was accused of using his father's handguns to kill at least eight children and a school security guard at a renowned elementary school in an upscale part of Belgrade. Serbia's interior minister says the boy had the code to the safe where his father locked the weapons. In the immediate aftermath, worried parents rushed to the school anxiously, waiting for news their kids were okay. The ones who do emerge are shell-shocked or overwhelmed. Some parents recalled their children seeing the attack right in front of their eyes. ASTRID MERLINI, MOTHER OF SHOOTING SURVIVOR (through translator): She heard shots before that, but thought those were firecrackers. When she saw the security guard fall, she immediately rushed back to the class. She was scared. She told her teacher there is a shooting upstairs. MCLEAN (voice-over): Police and ambulances quickly rushed to the scene to treat victims. Six students and a teacher were taken to the hospital, some in stable condition, others fighting for their lives. DR. SINISA DUCIC, CARETAKER DIRECTOR, TIRSOVA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL:  It is very difficult surgery because of severe brain injuries. The child is out of operation room and is vitally endangered and is in Intensive Care Unit. All resuscitation procedures are performed. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Belgrade police said the teenager waited to be arrested in the school yard after calling police himself to confess what he'd done. VESELIN MILIC, BELGRADE POLICE CHIEF (through translator): Upon arriving at school, he immediately pulled the pistol out of his bag and shot DV, the security guard. He then went past the on-duty staff member and sat down at his desk like he did nothing wrong. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Despite one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, mass shootings in Serbia are rare. Police said the attack had been carefully plotted for more than a month.

Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, and company raised rates by one-quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, making it the 10th increase in a row since the Fed began lifting rates in March of last year.This now brings the Fed's benchmark interest rate to 5.25 percent, the level not seen in more than 15 years. Now, when the Fed raises rates, it makes it more expensive for banks to borrow, which then makes it more expensive for us consumers to borrow. Think anything with an interest rate that is not locked-in. So, mortgage rates for new loans, auto loans, credit cards. The idea is that when borrowing costs go up, it will curb consumer demand, and ultimately bring down consumer prices. But, there is a lag with interest rates. The effects from higher rates can take months, if not more than a year, to show up in the economy. Meaning, most of the effects of the Fed's rate hikes are still in the pipeline. That's just one reason there is a growing chorus of voices, including economists, including lawmakers, urging the Fed to pause for the rate hikes. Another reason, banking stress. Earlier this week we also witnessed the second largest bank failure in U.S. history with First Republic. That said, inflation does remain elevated and it continues to run hotter than the Fed's 2 percent target. In Wednesday's press conference, Fed chair Jay Powell signaled this. JAY POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: These tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with monetary policy restraint we put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold.",

So we saw loads of similar cases come in, especially in America, but also some of the U.K. as well after the \"Blurred Lines\" case. We really felt the impact of that as opening up the door for more cases like this. And Ed has been sued, while for this case, there are three cases. He's had a case in the U.K., and another U.S. case as well. So he has really been part of that impact of the \"Blurred Lines\" case. We've had some other cases in-between. There was a re-hearing of a Led Zeppelin case, there's a Katy Perry one where we thought, mainly they were bringing it back a little bit into kind of more of a balance.
