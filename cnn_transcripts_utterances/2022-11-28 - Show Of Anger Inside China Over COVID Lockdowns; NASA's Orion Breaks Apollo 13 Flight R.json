Ronaldo will delight World Cup viewers with his skills tonight but no such luck from Brazil's Neymar. His team is on the pitch in an hour without him. More game highlights coming up. And a new record for space travel and NASA's Orion. We'll explain why the Artemis 1 mission is made Houston proud. I'm Becky Anderson. Hello, and welcome to our special coverage of the World Cup. This is CONNECT THE WORLD live from Doha. And if you can hear the noise behind me that is the Ecuadorian fans more on what is going on here coming up. We begin though tonight with an eruption of fury and frustration rarely seen in China. These are unprecedented scenes playing out across the country. For the first time in decades, thousands of protesters are demanding freedom not only from three years of Beijing strict zero-COVID policy but also from the government's grip over all aspects of life. Now this is -- China reports a sixth day of record COVID infections. Some people openly defying the Chinese president calling on him and the Communist Party to step down. Chinese police have been out in force in Shanghai, police dragged people away and loaded them into vans on Sunday night. A BBC journalist amongst those arrested. This video obtained by Reuters shows him being dragged to the ground by officers. The network says he was beaten and kicked by police before being released. A Swiss T.V. correspondent and a journalist for Reuters were also detained after -- and then released. Well, a deadly fire appeared to act as a catalyst for the outpouring of anger. 10 people were killed in the capital of Xinjiang on Thursday. Many believe firefighters arrived too late to save the victims because of strict COVID-19 measures. As people gathered grieve and protest in that province, Beijing changed part of its COVID containment measures in a rare concession. But it wasn't enough to quell the dissent. CNN's Selina Wang attended a rally in the Chinese capital and filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They've been chanting, no to COVID tests, yes to freedom. And this is happening in Dalian (ph) district. This is where the center of the COVID outbreak. It's in Beijing, where they urge all residents to stay at home. So it's really unprecedented that we're seeing such a large crowd of people here. A lot of the folks as well, you can see they're holding these white pieces of paper. This is a symbol of anti-censorship. And we also saw protests in Shanghai. We saw protesters also hold those white pieces of paper. Now in this district as well around here, there are many foreign embassies, including the American Embassy over there. So notable that they chose this site for this protest. Now, this protest has been going on already for several hours. It's very late. You can see the policeman right now is telling me to move back a little bit. But there is a large police presence. There are actually on this whole row, a whole row of policemen. But it is a peaceful protest so far. You can hear the cheering. The chanting, cars are also driving by frequently they're honking in solidarity. The folks here don't look like they're going anywhere anytime soon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Investors typically like things bundled up very neatly and with a roadmap for the future. But as China faces a future that could include more COVID lock downs, markets are certainly reacting. You pointed to the losses or the declines that we have seen in the opening trade here in the United States. You pointed to the declines that we saw in Asia. I mean, Hong Kong's benchmark, the Hang Seng, it was down by 1-1/2 percent. But at one point during the Asian trading day, it was down, I believe, more than four percent. So this shows that the world is having a hard time digesting this outpouring of unknown from China. I also think it's significant to point out that even Europe is seeing declines. The footsie has had a rough trading day, the CAC, the DAX in Germany also having some upheaval with trading. And this is not just about politics, and COVID lock downs. There are some real tangible impacts from all of this. Number one supply chain, if China remains closed, getting products that people around the world depend on, it could severely be inhibited. I'm thinking in particular, Apple and iPhones. There is the Foxconn factory in central China. It is the big provider of iPhone manufacturing. Of course, in the U.S. today is Cyber Monday, a big shopping day and electronics are a top purchase. So Becky, unless we get some direction that these notions of things being a bit out of control crawl down. The markets are up for a rough ride.",

That should help things domestically. I guess the sort of the backdrop to this is this second term for the president who has indicated that it is about China going forward where his focus is and the domestic scene there, less of an outward sort of message about China on the global stage. And I wonder whether investors are also just slightly concerned about what that means for the Chinese economy ultimately going forward. There -- I guess my point ready some concerns about where China was that going forward, and we're certainly not seeing the growth numbers that you and I are used to seeing over the past decade or so.",

I mean, I think, as we have seen in recent weeks, especially with the People's Congress inChina, we saw almost a new unveiling of policy from something that was economically focused to something a little bit more at home focus. So that without question is in investor's minds as well. I also found it curious today about oil markets. I mean, I know -- I mean, you -- you're based in the Middle East, you know, how fragile oil markets can be. I mean, what's happening in China is also going to perhaps have an impact on the global oil supply. If lock downs continue, demand is going to dwindle, that can impact prices as well.",

So, the fact that you had two different demonstrations take place in the city this evening and one of them that I visited was described as a vigil for the victims of China's zero COVID policy. It was not huge, it was less than 100 people, there were a lot of police around. And they started taking down the details of some of the demonstrators who were staying out there. But we saw people holding up the white scraps of paper that have become a symbol for some of the protesters in the demonstrations that have erupted across Mainland China. Take a listen to what one man I spoke to what he had to say. He says he's from Shanghai, and he describes himself as a victim of the zero COVID policy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN has been able to confirm at least 16 protests across 11 different cities across the country. And there because of the strict censorship, there may there have been reports of many more. The trigger for this weekend's round of protests seem to as been a deadly fire in the west of the country in the Xinjiang region in the capital Orochi (ph). At least 10 people dead in an apartment fire and a narrative has emerged that the high death toll may have been due to the fact that people couldn't escape their apartments due to concerns suspicion that they may have been locked. Some of the authorities have actually locked buildings to prevent people from being able to get out as part of these lockdowns. I mean, they're literally locking buildings. Over the weekend, authorities in Beijing announced that it is illegal to block the exit ways and entryways of apartment buildings as part of COVID lockdowns.

About 270,000 miles away from Earth, setting that record. And, you know, beating that record that was set by Apollo 13. And you know, Becky, remember Apollo 13, that was the mission that was so dangerous. I mean, there was an explosion inside the Apollo 13 service module. They didn't know, NASA didn't know if they were going to be able to get those three astronauts back. It took a team of engineers to figure out how to do it. One of them in particular was an electrical engineer who figured out a way to keep the electricity, keep the lights on so to speak and get those astronauts home safely. And now Becky, one of the mannequins inside the Orion spacecraft that just broke this record is inside that Orion capsule today, breaking that record. So, it all comes full circle. It's been quite a long time since a spacecraft designed to carry people has flown this far. But, you know Becky this entire Artemis 1 mission has been going so well.
