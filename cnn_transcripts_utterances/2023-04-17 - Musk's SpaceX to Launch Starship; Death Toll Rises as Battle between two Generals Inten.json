      "sentences": "A warm welcome to FIRST MOVE, as always lots to get to this hour. So don't touch that dial. We've got asurprise delay in the Fox-Dominion defamation trials, the first batch of U.S. bank earnings, making investors smile. Profits from the rest of the economy could be less fertile and at the IMF debt relief for needy nations may finally be in style. And I do want to begin there at the IMF, World Bank meetings in Washington D.C. last week. I definitely saw more commitment and consensus from officials to finally tackle the unsustainable debt burdens of poor nations and it's a serious issue for us all. Developing nations need to free up trillions of dollars over the coming years to help them adapt to the impact of climate change in particular, and protect against further social instability. We all need to care more. China, the largest sovereign lender to developing nations is also I think, realizing it needs to be part of the debt refinancing solution. And all this of course, despite the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and fragmentation too the fight clearly isn't over. In fact, it's just beginning but I came back from those IMF meetings with hope. And you can compare and contrast that to the paralysis that we're seeing. In another debt debate the fight to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, laying out his vision for how to reach a deal and prevent a damaging debt default during his speech at the New York Stock Exchange in the next hour. The clock is clearly ticking with the United States set to run out of cash to pay its bills as early as this summer. McCarthy's proposals already seen as being completely unworkable, but I guess debate is progress when you have seriously low expectations. I'll refrain from rolling my eyes. Financial markets are watching all of this too extremely closely. Plenty of nervousness, I think already with the cost of insuring against that default on the rise, but we do see a relatively calm start to the trading week so far after last weeks. Across the board, Wall Street advanced lots of earnings challenges ahead, too, and information to digest with more big financial firms set to report this week. Elon Musk's Tesla also released his results on Wednesday. Musk's week already rocketing ahead though, as we count down to a major SpaceX launch in Texas. And that is where we begin today's show. You are about to see live pictures of the SpaceX craft on top of the world's largest rocket booster called the super heavy appropriate. It's set for a test launch by Elon Musk's SpaceX in Southern Texas this Monday. Starship is designed to ultimately take a human cruise to Mars. Joining us now is Elizabeth Howell, a writer at Space.com. Elizabeth, this is a hugely exciting moment and, fingers crossed, we are expecting this launch to take place this morning and not be delayed. Walk us through what we should expect. ELIZABETH HOWELL, STAFF WRITER AT SPACE.COM: Well, what we're hoping to see is that this big system is actually going to go into space today, which would be a big deal. But no matter what happens any kind of a test of a new system is exciting. And so we'll just have to cross our fingers and see what happens next.",

Thank you so much, Elizabeth Howell, Staff Writer at Space.com. Great to have you on thank you. For now, a surprise twists in Dominion voting systems high stakes defamation trial against Fox News. The judge in the case announced a one-day delay without further explanation, raising the possibility that a settlement is in the works. The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Fox Corporation, Chairman Rupert Murdoch, reported that Fox News has made a late push to settle. Oliver Darcy joins us now. Oliver, you and I have been discussing this now for weeks. And we both discussed in the past why this hasn't already settled.

Instead, the judge is making an announcement about why this trial has been delayed until at least tomorrow. And it comes amid reports as you said that there isn't last minute push by Fox for settlement. That report first came in Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. It's now been confirmed by several other outlets. So we'll see what happens if its settlement is in the works Dominion, however, just walked into the courtroom, our Marshall Cohen is in the courtroom and they've walked in with 40 boxes four zero boxes of evidence. So they're clearly prepared to take this to trial, we'll see if they somehow managed to avert a trial. It would be an agonizing process, as we've discussed for the past few weeks for FOX News for Rupert Murdoch. He'd have to come to Wilmington and take the stand, be questioned about why he allowed election lies to be broadcast on FOX is there. That's not something I don't think he wants to do.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Two Generals at war since Saturday, the forces of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as a Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, or RSF have been locked in battle with a Sudanese army led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The fighting comes the Sudan tries to finalize a deal to return to civilian rule after two military crews in recent years, with temporarily united the army and the RSF. In a phone interview, Dagalo who is better known as Hemeti told me ruling Sudan is in his endgame. MADOWO (on camera): What do you personally want from this situation General Hamdan? Do you want to leave the army? Do you want to be the chief? GENERAL MOHAMED HAMDAN DAGALO, LEADER OF PARAMILITARY RAPID SUPPORT FORCES (voice over): I don't want to be the leader of the army. There's a framework agreement between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don't want to lead anything. These are all propaganda they are making MADOWO (voice over): As part of the agreement, the RSF some 100,000 strong would merge with the army, but differences over how long that would take and who would end up with more power aggravated tensions between the two factions, which have since erupted into up in warfare. Residential areas across Sudan have become battlefields with anti-aircraft weapons in the streets. And warplanes hovering overhead scores of civilians have been killed. The army blames the RSF for the violence with Hemeti pointed the finger back at al-Burhan. MADOWO (on camera): What is your message to the many people of Sudan was cared about this fresh round of violence? DAGALO (voice over): We offer a serious apology to them because what we can say is al-Burhan is the one that forced us to do this. It was not us who did this. We were defending ourselves. MADOWO (voice over): Doctors Union says it's been difficult for medics to move about amid reports of many people being trapped near fighting hotspots. Despite a U.N. brokered temporary truce. There were reports of gunfire in Khartoum, which Hemeti, again, blamed on the army. DAGALO (voice over): We're under attack from all directions. They are attacking us with marked and unmarked vehicles. Unfortunately, they're not stopping. MADOWO (voice over): It's unclear what side was firing during the ceasefire, but the army says it retains the right to respond if any violations of card. Sudan's neighbors are looking for ways to de-escalate the violence. Egypt and South Sudan have offered to mediate talks between the two sides. The African Union and the Arab League both held emergency sessions, with more calls for an immediate end to the hostilities. The Army has said there will be no dialogue until the RSF is dissolved. Hemeti says the stakes are so high in Sudan that any possible negotiations would have to be serious. DAGALO (voice over): We are not refusing to go to the negotiating table, as long as the negotiation is true and truthful, honest, not playing games. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So when Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo says as he did an excellent interview that Larry did, when he says, I want to return to the civilians, he is not a part of the infrastructure of rule.

She says a quarter century that is a five plus for your courage, consistency and honesty in your many years of work. I am eternally proud of you, my dear and I am always with you.

Coral reef cover less than a 10th of 1 percent of the world's oceans and yet they support over a quarter ofour planet's marine life and a billion people who also rely on fishing tourism and other related industries. But it's a well-known fact that climate change threatens their very existence. Right now, we lose more coral in a day that can be restored in a decade. However, a new project to install more resilient artificial versions is taking shape. These specifically manufactured weeps off the coast of Antigua and Barbuda consists of pH neutral concrete skeletons made of calcium carbonate. They mimic natural reefs using corals which are grown in an underwater nursery and attached to the original skeleton. Dr. Deborah Brosnan is a Marine Scientist at Ocean-Shot Project. She's also President and Founder of Brosnan and Associates. Dr. Brosnan Deborah, fantastic to have you on the show! Just explain the vision of this vital technology and the focus of what you're trying to achieve. DR. DEBORAH BROSNAN, MARINE SCIENTIST, OCEAN-SHOT PROJECT: Yes, so first of all, coral reefs are vital to our economy and also to the health of the planet, as well as our own health. And as he pointed out, we're losing more calls in a day than we can currently restore in a decade. So, John Paul DeJoria, who is supporting this project, and I sat down one day and said, what can we do to speed up the restoration of these coral reefs, and to make it scalable and transferable to other nations around the world that need this kind of technology, and need their -- reefs. And coral reefs are amazing, because it's a combination of the corals. So, corals are both architects, and they're builders. So, this tiny call, it looks like a tea anemone actually creates a whole skeleton of calcium carbonate concrete, if you like. So, the whole reef structures that we see whether it's a great barrier reef, or off the coast of Florida, is made literally by this tiny coral secreting the calcium carbonate. So, what we're looking at here is not just restoring endangered corals themselves, but also the kinds of structures that they build over hundreds and thousands of years. But to do it at a faster rate, so that we can keep up with climate change, keep up with the calls, that we're losing the reef that we're losing, and how to restore that resilience on which a billion people depend right now. So that's the vision behind it.",

And how do we design reefs and monitor those reefs, for the conditions that we will be facing. In essence, to give the reefs a leg up, to transition them to a new world, and also to transition ourselves because we depend so much on reefs. So, we are using AI technology. We are, for instance, we have some AI technology cameras that are now deployed on these roof structures. And they're looking at what kind of survival we're getting called, what kind of species are coming into the reef. And right now, we've planted nine different species, we're getting 97, to 98 percent survival of those newly planted corals. But we also have 20s. I know, it's amazing, which types of corals are tough and features and resilient. And we have 26 species that moved in there.

I mean, John Paul and I are actually doing it. Other people can do it. And there's a lot of investment, we're seeing now a lot of good work going into coral reefs. So how long does it take? It really depends on how quickly we can really grow the corals. And we're now growing resilient corals; there are several groups that are growing with resilient corals. So, we know that the corals can survive the transition. And really the trick is to be able to build these reefs fast enough and scalable enough that we can deploy them in different parts of the world. It's not this, we've got the science, this is not an intractable problem. I feel like saying it's not rocket science, because it is so doable. It's very practical. We just have to do it.",
