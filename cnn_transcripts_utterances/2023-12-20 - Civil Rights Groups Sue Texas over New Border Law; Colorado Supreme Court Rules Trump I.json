Joining us this morning, Noah Bookbinder, the president and CEO of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. It is his organization that filed this lawsuit. Noah, good morning. Thank you for being with us. That's your case -- I mean, you prevailed here so far. That is your argument, that it is necessary for the future of democracy. What about those that say actually not letting the voters have their say is antithetical to democracy? NOAH BOOKBINDER, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBILITY &amp; ETHICS IN WASHINGTON:  Yeah. The problem with that is that we tried that already, right? In 2020, voters had a chance to decide if they want Donald Trump to be president. They decided that they didn't. And what happened after that was Donald Trump refused to accept that result and incited a violent insurrection to try to keep himself in power despite having lost. There's simply no reason to think that somehow we can do it this way and it will come out differently. That's why the framers of the 14th Amendment put this provision into the Constitution. It was specifically meant to defend the republic from those who have attacked it in the past, attacked the democracy in the past. That's what we have here. And, you know, the Constitution sets out what the qualifications are to be president of the United States. You've got to be 35 years old. You have to be a -- you have to be --",

In the -- the trial court held a multi-day evidentiary hearing with testimony from law enforcement officers, members of Congress, experts, other government officials, organizers of the January 6th protests, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.

This one at his posh lakeside home near Orlando just weeks before Election Day in 2018. CNN obtained this exclusive video. That's Pirozzolo arriving for the fundraiser with Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, who as a state lawmaker in 2014 introduced legislation that became Florida's first marijuana law. Pirozzolo's attorney says he never discussed marijuana legislation with DeSantis. Also at the party, then Florida State Representative Halsey Beshears, his family's tree farm later joined with other nurseries to become Trulieve, that top medical marijuana producer, which donated to DeSantis's campaign.

So, it's not going to be a list of people. She individually went through all these people, more than 150 names, and going through why they would be unsealed. And so, as she wrote it -- and this was a constant thing she wrote in a lot of these. The material should be unsealed in full. First, this individual did not raise any objection to unsealing and thus did not meet his or her burden of identifying interest that outweigh the presumption of public -- of access with specificity. Now, another thing she noted through a number of these names was that these names were already public, a number of these people had already given interviews to the media, so they made themselves public, and that there were also names that came out during the course of the trial. There are some names that will not be made public and those are some of the victims that were minors at the time. She's saying that those will not be made public. But the vast majority seems to be people who were in his orbit, associates of him. And the judge even noted that the some of these references are not salacious, but their names are included in the documents, and they have been protected for years because of the association. But now that so much of this has already come out to the public, she's saying that, you know, there is no reason to keep it sealed anymore going forward. Now, if anyone objects to this, she's giving them 14 days to appeal this decision. But if not, these names will be public just right around January 2nd, just about the first of the year.",
