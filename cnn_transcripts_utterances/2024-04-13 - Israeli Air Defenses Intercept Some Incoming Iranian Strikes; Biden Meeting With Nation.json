We're following the major breaking news at this hour in the Middle East.Fears of a wider regional war are heightened once again in one of the biggest escalations we've seen since the Israel-Hamas War began just over six months ago. Our team on the ground in Jerusalem hearing explosions and sirens just moments ago as intercepts are happening in the skies above. Dozens of Iranian drones are heading for Israel right now, maybe more than a hundred. It's a very, very delicate moment, very, very dangerous indeed, and reportedly, waves of ballistic missiles from Iran are heading towards Israel as well. They are more deadly and they fly much faster. Both Israel and the United States say they will aim to intercept as many of these drones and missiles as they possibly can. But this much is already certain. These attacks directly from inside Iran and indeed the suspected attack from Israel to which Iran says it's responding. Have these two nations, both with a lot of military power, as close to all out roar as we've seen in recent memory. And that could have far reaching implications within the region and certainly well beyond the region.",

We have heard distant booms of intercepts in the distance.You heard from our Nic Robertson, seeing some of those intercepts lighting up the night sky. I do think it's very important to emphasize that so far, we do not have any indication that there have been any impacts. We are hearing from the IDF. They have told people across the nation to be very vigilant. They have told people in certain areas to stay close to protective shelter, to go immediately to the shelter if they hear the sirens to wait at least 10 minutes. And they have focused primarily on the areas of the Golan Heights, Dimona, Eilat, Nevatim. These are strategically relevant and important sites. They are the home to the Nevatim airbase, which is where the F- 35 fighter jets are based. Dimona, of course, where there is a nuclear reactor. And everyone, essentially, really kind of holding their breath now, Alex, and waiting to see what the night will bring. We expect there to be waves and waves as this attack could go on for many hours. We, in this hotel, went down to the lobby. We saw a number of people had brought their pillows down to the lobby. They wanted to know where the shelter was. The people in the hotel told them that wasn't necessary. At this stage, we saw people who were coming back from the airport because the Israelis have closed Israeli airspace. And there is a sense, most importantly, as we'll just touched upon, that this is an unprecedented moment in this conflict. It is one that many had desperately hoped to avoid. The Iranians have telegraphed that it is now over in their eyes, but it remains to be seen how the Israelis will take that claim, what their response will be, whether there will be some kind of a retaliation, whether that is a direct attack or an attempt to deter further attacks. A lot of moving parts and a lot of anxiety about what could take place next.",

Normally, when Arab countries or various proxy groups launch rockets and missiles towards Israel, they aim towards Tel Aviv or Haifa. But not necessarily Jerusalem, given that it's a holy city for Muslims and a lot of Arabs live in Jerusalem as well.

We reported in the last hour, according to two U.S. officials, that U.S. forces had intercepted a number of these drones, and now we know that process is ongoing. We've got a short statement from a defense official, just a short time ago. I want to read this to you here, it says, in accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel's security, U.S. forces in the region continue to shoot down Iranian launch drones targeting Israel. Our forces remain postured to provide additional defensive support and to protect U.S. forces operating in the region. Now, what's not clear at this point is what types of U.S. forces and military assets have been used to shoot down this drone. There was a tanker, an aerial refueling platform that we saw on flight tracking websites some time ago. That's indicative of U.S. fighters up and active in the region. Of course, a tanker wouldn't simply be flying around and certainly -- not under these current circumstances. So it's possible that these were intercepted by U.S. aerial fighter jets, or it's possible that they were ground-based aerial defense systems that intercepted these drones, or both. That's the type of information we're still looking for at this point. But crucially, that effort to continue to intercept these drones that have been coming in for some time now, and we see the interceptions over Israel, that effort is ongoing by U.S. forces in the Middle East. Wolf. BLITZER: Yes. The Israelis are clearly relying a lot on the United States to help intercept a lot of those incoming drones with rockets and missiles on board, as well as those cruise missiles that may be coming in as well. This is a joint project from the United States and Israel. And it's significant, Oren, the head of the U.S. military Central Command was just in Israel, coordinating with the Israeli military.

We'll watch that unfold.Oren Liebermann's at the Pentagon. I want to go to the White House right now. Our correspondent, MJ Lee has been monitoring what's going on.

But he ended up cutting that trip short and return to the White House earlier this afternoon.And I am told by a White House official that he remains in the situation room right now with his top national security advisors to assess this situation and, of course, figure out what comes next. You know, the White House has been preparing for this very possibility for a number of days now in the aftermath of those Israeli strikes in Damascus that took out a number of top Iranian commanders. And you'll notice that in the White House statement that we got earlier tonight, it said and reiterated the U.S. support for Israel's security is ironclad. And to that end, as Oren was just reporting on, that is why we are seeing, of course, the U.S.'s involvement here and working to intercept some of these weapons that have been launched by Iran. And it is a part of why, of course, we saw in recent days, the U.S. moving extra forces into the region and getting them in position in preparation for exactly this kind of scenario. And I think, Wolf, it is also just worth underscoring that this state- on-state conflict between Iran and Israel was exactly the kind of scenario that U.S. officials had very much hoped to avoid, given the real volatility and unpredictability that this could potentially usher in. And I think that is why one thing that we should be watching out for very closely in the coming hours is any indication of what U.S. officials are advising Israeli officials to do in response to these attacks that Iran has launched. You know, at the same time that we are hearing from the White House, and it is being reiterated that the U.S.'s commitment to Israel's security is ironclad. At the same time, the U.S. also wants the situation in the region to very much be contained. So, again, those conversations that have been going on over the last few hours, the last several days, certainly worth keeping a very close eye on, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's a very calibrated response from the Iranians and certainly something that seems to have been in the works for a couple of days.We've heard the Iranians essentially telegraph this with a lot of the phone conversations that the Iranian Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir- Abdollahian, has had with some of his European counterparts, but also, of course, with some Middle Eastern counterparts as well. And if you recall, Wolf, in 2020, when the U.S. assassinated the top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, we heard something very similar from the Iranians back then as well. Actually, I was in Iran then and I was called in to the Supreme Leader's military advisor and he said to me, look, the Americans killed one of our top generals. We are going to respond and it's then up to the U.S. whether or not it concludes there. And certainly if we're looking at the statement now that we saw from the Iranian representative to the United Nations, it seems very similar where we keep that hearing that sentence that we've repeated a couple of times on the air here as well. The Iranians saying the matter can be deemed concluded. That doesn't mean that their retaliation is over yet, but essentially what the Iranians are saying here is, look, you attacked our embassy. You killed a lot of our top military officials inside that embassy. We are going to retaliate and then it's up to you whether the matter has concluded or not. So certainly what the Iranians seem to be saying here is that the ball is now in Israel's court, whether or not it's going to strike back and then possibly obviously the situation getting even worse. I think one of the other things though, Wolf, that we're also seeing and which certainly I've seen over the past couple of years, as I've been reporting from Iran is that a lot of Iran's especially missile systems, but their drones as well are a lot more capable than many people in the West thing. I mean, one of the things that we have seen, over the past couple of years, is the Iranians capable of shooting down a U.S. reconnaissance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. But I'll also, if we look at this drone and missile strike now, some of those images that Nic Robertson has been bringing us with those drones and possibly also cruise missiles as well, making it all the way into Israeli airspace and clearly also putting Israel's air defense under pressure at least as well. We heard from Oren, of course, that the U.S. is also apparently involved in trying to shoot some of those projectiles down. That certainly does seem to show that the Iranians have a, first of all, a pretty large arsenal that they can fire at the Israelis and at anybody else, but also that the accuracy that the Iranians seem to be achieving appears to be considerable as well if there's several areas in Israel that are under threat of being targeted. So, certainly, the Iranians on the one hand showing that they can retaliate, but also showing that they are very capable of hitting targets very accurately over a long distance, which is, of course, something, Wolf, as we've been reporting, and as you know very well, the Iranians have been developing for quite a while. That missile program that they have and the drone program that they have, those are really the cornerstones of their modern military with which they say they can put the U.S. in the Middle East under pressure and clearly Israel as well, Wolf.",

We're not hearing any more sirens. We're not hearing any more intercepts. But the fact that those fighter jets are flying in the sky over Jerusalem, at this time, is unusual. It is clearly related to what's happening here right now. The intercepts that we saw before General Hertling suggested that he believe that they were being some of the intercepts we were witnessing were intercepts by fighter jets. The fact that we're seeing the fighter jets up there now certainly brings additional credibility to his already very credible words. But I think that's what we're witnessing here tonight. Multiple layers and levels of Israeli air defense systems. But, again, the fact that these missiles, these Iranian missiles, could reach this city relatively long way inside of Israel, even with the United States aircraft in the air giving additional support. And potentially, we may learn more in the coming hours about additional support from friends and neighbors in the region about how their airspace may have been used to defend Israel. But the fact that so many intercepts were necessary over Jerusalem is a mark of just how many missiles Iran has fired here. And the fact that we didn't hear any direct impacts that we're aware of, yet, indicates how successful Israel's air defense systems have been so far this evening, it appears.

And that is what it has been so far. Now, this evening, we know that Hezbollah put out an announcement that they had fired what they said were tens of Katyusha rockets at Israeli air and missile defense positions in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights and we also know from sources close to Hezbollah that the intention is that if it escalates beyond the immediate Iranian response that we've been seeing in the last few hours, that indeed Iran's allies and proxies in the region would become involved, would escalate. But at the moment, what we are hearing from, for instance the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations, that they consider that this is it. This is the conclusion of their response. Now of course, missiles and cruise missiles and drones are still perhaps on the way. But the Iranians have made it clear that as far as they are concerned, that is over. But in the preceding days, we have also heard the Israelis basically saying if Iran attacks from Iran, Israel -- then Israel will respond. And this is now -- the real question is, what comes next?

And it is arguably the most dramatic option that Iran chose tonight of the various scenarios that could have played out, Iran tonight directly attacking Israel from Iranian soil in anticipation of something like this, the US military had moved more assets to the Middle East. We understand that they've strengthened Air Defenses. Of course, they are US troops and US Air Defenses all across the Middle East. There are also a number of naval ships in the Red Sea, in the Gulf of Aden, in the Eastern Mediterranean, all in anticipation of what we saw tonight. But Wolf, we have been talking to our sources for the past two weeks trying to figure out what Iran would do, and it really only came into focus yesterday that Iran could indeed carry out tonight's attack from Iranian soil. CNN reported yesterday that a number of military assets, including drones and cruise missiles, around a hundred cruise missiles were being moved in Iran. That was certainly an indication of what we saw tonight, and I am really struck by this, the two facts, Wolf, that Iran is claiming that this is over. That's according to their mission at the United Nations. At the same time, Israel and the US and the support role of very, very much dealing with what is still incoming, those drones. We believe they are also cruise and ballistic missiles. It remains to be seen whether Iran is done firing everything that it intends to, so far as our correspondents have noted, it does not appear that anything has hit its target. No craters, no blast, no destruction, death. But this is far from over, despite those Iranian claims, what you're hearing there, those sirens, those interception, Israel is still very much in a defensive posture. So it also, we will see what Israel decides to do in the coming hours in terms of a response. We will see whether Iranian proxies decide to take up a supporting role with what Iran is doing right now. But no question, Wolf, we are turning a corner here.

The fact that Iran, with a huge military capability is launching rockets and missiles against Israel from Iranian territory and they are not simply relying on their Iranian proxies, whether Hezbollah or the Houthis or others to do the work. They are doing it directly themselves. Give us a sense of how significant this is.",

MILLER; I mean if you remember, Wolf, the summer of 2006, which is the last major confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah, the Middle East's most preeminent military power, Israel, the northern half of that country from Haifa to the Lebanese border was shut down for 33 days, and that was when Hezbollah had a relatively crude inventory. Now, they have anywhere up to 150,000 high trajectory weapons of varying ranges and validity and precision that could cover most of Israel. That raises a very serious question about Israeli deaths and casualties and Israeli response in Lebanon, which is going to be directed against Lebanese infrastructure with many, many, many Lebanese deaths and casualties. So in coming days, or maybe even sooner, Wolf, that's the critical -- that is to me is critical issue is you know, is Benjamin Netanyahu going to be restrained, picking up enormous points with the Biden administration if he were not to respond? Easing US-Israeli tensions, which are already eased, any thought of conditioning or restricting military assistance to Israel as a consequence of what is going on in Gaza. I think, he is now gone. And one last point, Gaza is now secondary and the tragedy here is, any prospects of an Israeli hostage for a prison deal. I think already very slim, it is going to be very, very difficult to put back on track because Hamas will wait to see how much regional chaos Iran and Israel can cause, which is precisely what they want.",

Aaron, in the olden days, an Israeli government would launch, what they used to call a preemptive strike, let's say against Hezbollah in South Lebanon tried to use their air power to destroy as missile and rocket capability as possible on the ground. I anticipate though that that is not necessarily going to happen this time, but what do you think?",

I was in the border between Gaza and Israel a few years ago when another war was going on and I remember standing there and the Iron Dome would go off and destroy an incoming rocket or missile coming into Israel. But the shrapnel, the metal that came down from that destroyed missile, it was so powerful, there were huge holes in the ground and I can only imagine if some of that hit a person, the damage that could be done.So it is one thing to see those missiles destroyed because if they're not destroyed and they hit a populated area, it could kill a lot of people, but it is another thing, once they're destroyed, they've got to come down, all of those -- the metal and the shrapnel that potentially could kill people on the ground as well. Standby Nic, we are going to get back to you. Colonel Cedric Leighton, retired US Army, is joining us right now. You're a military analyst. What's your assessment of what is happening on the ground militarily and over the skies, and not only of Jerusalem, but elsewhere in Israel? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Wolf, one of the big things about this is that this is really a change as Nic was mentioning in his reporting and Alex had mentioned as well, this is going to really change the way in which the armies of the Middle East face each. There is going to be a different style of warfare. There is going to be in essence, using swarms, what the Iranians have talked about for a long time. Now, they are actually putting this in into practice and were seeing, I think maybe they have learned some lessons from Ukraine where some of the things that have happened in the Ukrainian war are now being used, transferred by the Iranians to Israel. And I think the key thing here, Wolf, is that with the way in which the Iranians are doing this. They are kind doing a multi-layered attack. That multilayered attack is going to have a major impact on how your defense systems are structured as well. Right now, the Iron Dome, Arrow, David's Sling, those Israeli systems seemed to be fairly effective, very effective actually against the Iranian attacks as far as we know at the moment. But clearly this kind of volume that they're dealing with is going to impact how these systems are designed and how intelligence is the integrated into their radar picture.",
