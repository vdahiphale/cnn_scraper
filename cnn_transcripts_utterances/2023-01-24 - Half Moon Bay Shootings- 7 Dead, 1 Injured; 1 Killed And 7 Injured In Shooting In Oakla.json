I'm Laila Harrak, and you're watching CNN Newsroom.Begin in the U.S. state of California, where a pair of new shootings have claimed the lives of at least seven people. It comes just days after 11 people died in a mass shooting further south in Monterey Park. Monday's rampage took place in the coastal city of Half Moon Bay, where authorities say the shooter opened fire in two different locations roughly 2 miles apart. Another victim was critically injured in the attacks. Police took 67-year-old Chunli Zhao into custody, and they say they found a handgun in his vehicle close by. Well, now they're trying to figure out a motive. Here was the San Mateo County Sheriff speaking on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

According to authorities, this happened at around 2:22 p.m. on Monday local time here in California, and the shooter went to the first location, shooting at least five people, killing four, and leaving one in critical condition. He goes to a second location about a mile apart, and that's where he killed three others. Now, we have been told by sources that this was a mushroom farm. Authorities are describing this as a nursery, but in general, this was an agricultural area. And we know that they were not able to arrest him until about 04:30 p.m. local time. That's when a law enforcement officer spotted the suspect, spotted his car at the sheriff's substation. He decided to make an arrest. This was a plain clothes law enforcement officer and took that suspect into custody. Now we know he is cooperating with authorities. He was being interviewed on Monday night by members of the District Attorney's office. And we also know that authorities found a semi-automatic handgun in his car. Now, in terms of motive, authorities have not said what this motive was. They do not know why this man did this, but they are working to find out. He was a -- he is a 67-year-old man. They believe that he was an employee of this nursery. They believe that the people he killed were also employees at this nursery. Again, they do not know why he did this.

What we need to do is, I think a lot of people in the United States do not realize that gun owners are mostly in sync as non gun owners. If you ask gun owners, they believe in these things like personal background checks, so we need stronger people like when we passed gun legislation in June. Republican Senator John Cornyn from Texas pulled his Republican -- his gun owner constituents and found out they were in favor of gun reforms. We need more people like John Cornyn in the Senate, who were willing to take a stand on the issue.",

On the federal level, Because the Republicans now control the House, there are several Republicans that favor us reform, not nearly a majority, not even one tenth of Republicans in the House favor gun report.So nothing is going to happen in the house. That means that for the next two years at least the actions is going to be on the state level. I do think that you'll see that states such as Michigan, for example which now is a Dot Democratic legislature and a Democratic governor in Pennsylvania. The same thing -- I think they'll see these actions take place. We just saw federal action, I think you'll see the actions on a state level going forward.",

You could ask it to take a huge corpus of text and turn it into a very brief summary or even a song.And there are many different amazing opportunities here. While it is easy to be scared of new technologies, every time we've been scared of those kind of technologies -- the computer, the car, the calculator and even the Internet itself -- they've created more jobs than they have destroyed. So I think we're going to see amazing opportunities to use AI ChatGPT to translate legal documents from human English into actual legalese in fact like what they call tome. It can do spell checking and even composition suggestions like Grammarly to replace copy editors. It can schedule meetings for large groups of people using motion or providing an instant text based customer service with systems like Smith.AI. There are incredible opportunities here to both reduce the cost of producing these services which will make them more accessible to people and also do jobs that humans are not very good at by nature. We're not great at looking at tens of thousands of different billing codes for hospital bills and picking the right one. Doctors screw this up all the time. And so these kind of AIs can take over these dull, dirty or dangerous jobs on our behalf. And leave us to focus on the things humans are still really good.",

Though Open AI has done a better job than almost any every other company in this space in safeguarding its AI.It paid moderators to look through all of the text results that the ChatGPT could give and make sure it would not give offensive or graphic answers to questions which has made it much safer than many other Ais from Microsoft and others that have come before it. Though I think one of the biggest risks of AI is the U.S. not being the benefactor of it. If we overregulate this new technology, we don't put in the right safeguards or we just expect others to use it, we could see other countries leapfrogging our ability to use this technology to increase productivity, make humans happier in general and get jobs done that we never dreamed possible.",
