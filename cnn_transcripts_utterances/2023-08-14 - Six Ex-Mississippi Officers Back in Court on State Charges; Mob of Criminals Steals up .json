Prosecutors say the suspects were all white, nicknamed themselves the Goon Squad. They're accused of using excessive force and then covering up their crimes.Our Ryan Young joins us now from Atlanta. Ryan, you were reporting on this a few weeks ago with us. Now they're back in court. Talk to us about the significance of this, what they're facing on the state level.",

You had members of law enforcement calling themselves the Goon Squad. And for folks who are not familiar with the details of this story, I will warn you, some of it is graphic. They decided to show up to these men's home, they went inside, and then once they went inside, they went through a series of just touristic physical abuse of these men. They called them the n- word, they shocked them with a Taser, they poured oil on them, they threw eggs at them. And then, at one point, they even tried to sexually assault one of the men.And if that wasn't enough, at one point they pulled a bullet out of a gun, they stuck it in a man's mouth, and they pulled the trigger. And when it didn't go off the first time, they racked it, and they pulled the trigger again, lacerating a tongue of one of the victims. And as you can imagine, this happened back in January. These men were coming forward basically saying, hey, something was done to us. No one believed them for quite some time. In fact, take a listen to the spokesman for the two victims in this case.

BARNETT, FOUNDER, TRUE HEALING UNDER GOD: Sheriff Bailey, I know you was -- your voice was cracking last week, buddy, and you was sitting there and crying, and he say he didn't know nothing about it. And I didn't -- I didn't - I didn't know nothing about it. I'd be a fool to think that. It's a squad! So, we come to disassemble, dismantle and terminate the Goon Squad. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, a lot of work for police to do there on the investigative side. Just to set the scene for our viewers. I mean imagine you're out and about, like so many of us on a weekend, at a shopping center, and you come face-to-face with a mob of criminals that are smashing and grabbing their way through a store. That's exactly what happened here Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles at Topanga Mall. You had shoppers that were just going about their business. You had store employees who were doing their work.

Nothing that he can do. A truly terrifying situation.The Los Angeles Police Department issued a statement. I'll read part of that. They said that, \"to criminals, this is just property taken. To those who live in the area and patronize the Topanga Mall, it is a loss of feeling safe. The LAPD will exhaust all efforts to bring those responsible into custody and seek criminal prosecution. Now, it's worth pointing out, Phil, that a very similar incident happened just days ago in nearby Glendale, California. I believe we have some of that video to show you. You had a very similar criminal mob of people descend on a shopping center. They got away with upwards of $300,000 worth of goods, according to authorities. And that investigation still very much underway. For law enforcement, they're hoping that members of the public, people who might know these groups, will come forward. There is a reward of $50,000 that's currently being offered. But a lot of the times, because these groups are, you know, closed off and they're, obviously, hiding their faces, it's up to police to try to find the goods on the back end, once they actually make their way onto the black market, these illicit trading platforms. And so that's very difficult to crack. But, obviously, for members of the community here, very unsettling. For those who were there, certainly terrifying.",

They have an organization.

And so you do see them doing these things on the ground and not taking his lead in Iowa up to chance. But at the same time, we are -- we've been talking to voters all weekend. And there's this - we're seeing what campaigns are arguing, which is, there is significant interest in a non-Trump alternative. So, how do you square that with the fact that when Donald Trump does show up at the state fair, he still draws the biggest crowds. He's able to successfully drown out all of his opponents.

And granted the way that they are trying to keep the focus on him is by having this massive operation on the ground, but the candidates themselves are on the ground. And so it is making a difference.
