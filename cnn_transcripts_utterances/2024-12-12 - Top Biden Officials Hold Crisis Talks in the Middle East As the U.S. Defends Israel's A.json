Earlier, he defended Israel's moves in Syria, including its airstrikes on military targets and moving ground troops beyond the demilitarized buffer zone. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is now in Turkey, earlier held talks in Jordan where he spoke about the importance of a unified effort in Syria, and a, quote, \"inclusive transition\".

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, with just over a month left in President Biden's term in office, his National Security adviser Jake Sullivan sitting down with the Israeli Prime Minister to see if a hostage and ceasefire deal can be reached before Biden leaves office. And Sullivan struck a tone of cautious optimism, saying that he believes that there is optimism in the air, that there is cause to believe that a deal can indeed be reached, and that he believes the Israeli Prime Minister is indeed ready to reach a deal. He gave a number of reasons for why things have changed, for why there is more optimism in the air. He said that following the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, that Hamas seems to have changed its negotiating posture somewhat, recognizing that it was no longer receiving the support of Hezbollah and that perhaps other actors that it had hoped would come into play in its defense ultimately will not. At the same time, he also indicated that there were changes on the Israeli side as well, noting that Israel has killed Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar, and that some of its other military successes in Gaza may have made Israel more willing to reach for an agreement. Now, at the same time, Sullivan did caution that the United States has said that a deal was close, that a deal was at hand before, and ultimately it didn't happen. So, here was that more cautious side that he voiced.",

And, of course, to get the Americans who have been held hostage in Gaza out as well.

What Warner Brothers Discovery is doing today is not a spin-off. It's kind of an internal re-organization or restructuring, but would make it easier to sell the cable networks or other assets in the future. That is the great unknown here. But that's what Wall Street analysts and investors have been looking for, for quite some time. The Warner Brothers Discovery stock has been starting to rebound after declining for months and months and months. And as you said today, it is up 10 percent-15 percent on this news, that's because Wall Street types believe that some of these channels, some of these assets are going to be better valued in the future. Meanwhile, streaming services like this company's Max, that seems to be the growth area. That's what Zaslav describes as the growth area. He says it's separating the company into basically two halves, will make it easier to run both. And here's what I think this kind of boils down to, Jessica, and I say this having not talked to any of our bosses about it, but here's the impression I have having covered this industry for a long time.

And as they prioritize streaming, they're trying to figure out what to do with traditional cable. Of course, the thing about a channel like CNN or \"TNT\" or \"TBS\" or the other Warner Brothers Discovery assets is they are also  valuable in the streaming world.
