That is according to the State Department.And Americans are due to land in Florida this afternoon. That's a flight organized by the state of Florida after two planned rescue flights on Tuesday were scrubbed. The situation on the ground was deemed too volatile as the Caribbean nation reels from gang violence and political instability. CNN's Carlos Suarez is in Miami for us. Carlos, tell us what you're learning about this. It sounds like there's at least a little bit of movement, although, obviously, a lot more people who want to get out.",

As you just reported, according to the State Department, the U.S. is going to start to take Americans that are stranded in Port-au-Prince via these chartered helicopter flights over to Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic.Now the State Department did not want to say exactly how many Americans they plan on getting out today, citing security concerns. But they said that once these Americans are in the Dominican Republic, it is up to them to figure out how they are going to get back to the U.S. As for the efforts now underway by the state of Florida to get citizens back to Florida, we're told hold that at least 348 Americans have told state officials here that they are trying to leave the country from the Caribbean here back to south Florida. At this hour, we believe that there are going to be at least two flights that will take some of these 348 Americans from Cap-Haitian -- that is a port city in the north of Haiti, about a seven-hour drive from the capital there -- to the central -- central Florida area. We expect that that flight will land at some point this afternoon. The flights were supposed to take off yesterday but we're told that security concerns on the ground prevented the flights from taking off -- Brianna?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and this really means that Boeing's quality control issues are translating into financial losses.One of the reasons that Boeing is reporting this massive loss is that it now must shell out huge payments to airlines. Remember, the Alaska Airlines door plug blowout was back on January 5th. That led to a grounding of the 737 Max-9 for19 days. And airlines, like Alaska Airlines, had to cancel something to the tune of about 150 flights each day. Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci says he now expects Alaska Airlines to get paid back by Boeing $150 million from Boeing because of all of its losses. The other reason for all of this is the expense associated with Boeing now having to get its house in order. It's under a lot of pressure from the FAA. They just completed an audit, a Boeing quality control. And I want you to listen now to FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker. He says that now it is on Boeing to come up with new changes to its quality control and report those back to the FAA in the next 90 days. Here's what he said to NBC News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They were then hoping that two- thirds, 66 percent of cars sold, would be electric by the end of this decade. But carmakers pushed back, especially Toyota. They call this draconian way too much, too fast. And as a result, the White House has pulled back to those numbers that you displayed there, 35 percent to 60 percent or 56 percent of E.V.s, and they could also mix in plug-in hybrids or more efficient gas engines that get the right mileage, the right tailpipe emissions to meet these mandates.
