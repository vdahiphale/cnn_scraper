Tonight, the U.S. conducts a third round ofstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen just as Iran begins flexing its military muscle in the region, striking sites in Iraq and in Syria. We'll have all details for you on the regional escalations. Then all eyes now on New Hampshire after Donald Trump's decisive win at the Iowa Republican caucuses, plus, a plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, asking the West to step up aid. We are live for you in Davos at the World Economic Forum. But first, this evening, the U.S. has launched its third round of strikes against Iranian- backed Houthi rebels inside Yemen. A U.S. Defense official said forces Tuesday destroyed four anti-ship ballistic missiles that were preparing to launch and were posing an imminent threat to merchant as well as U.S. Navy vessels in the Red Sea. But a few hours later, the Houthis reportedly launched a missile at a Maltese flagship, there was no significant damage and the vessel continued its journey. Earlier, the U.S. military said its Navy sees Iranian-made missiles headed to the Houthis in Yemen. The weapons were reportedly found in a vessel that was boarded off the coast of Somalia. U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan is calling on all regional governments to protect the vital Red Sea corridor. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Isa, we've heard from the U.S. describing these strikes as both reckless and imprecise. But Iran'sRevolutionary Guard has said that these strikes were targeted, as you mentioned, they say they were focused on what is being described as the main espionage headquarters for Mossad; Israel's Intelligence agency in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. They say in retaliation to the targeting and killing by Israeli actors of IRGC commanders and officials, that this was a security threat, this was a security target for the IRGC. Now, of course, Kurdish media is reporting that, at least, 10 missiles were fired from Iran, five of which they say were targeting the residents of a Kurdish businessman. And of course, we have reached out to Israeli authorities on this for further comment. But we have in the last few hours heard from Iraq's Foreign Minister, who has denied any presence by Mossad in Iraq, including in northern Iraq, issuing strong words of condemnation, saying that the Iraqi government will be issuing complaint to the U.N. Security Council, characterizing this as a violation of international law. But also warning that Iraq is now seeing those tensions, those hostilities between Iran and Israel playing out on its own soil. Of course, at least, four civilians are said to have been killed in those overnight strikes. And as you mentioned,  Isa, we also saw strikes in Syria. Now, these strikes by Iran, according to the IRGC, were said to be targeting what they have characterized as anti-Iran terrorist organizations and actors coming in response to those twin blasts we saw in the Iranian city of Kerman earlier this month. Of course, dozens of people were killed, many of them pilgrims who had been visiting the burial site of slain Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani when those blasts exploded, killing dozens, and of course, at the time, those blasts were claimed by the Islamic State, Iranian government and officials vowing a strong response. But this comes at a time of increasing tensions, increasing hostilities, note, just when it comes to the rhetoric we're hearing, the actions of Iran, particularly with regards to their relations with Israel, but also, of course, groups were broadly in the region backed by and funded by Iran. As you heard from Oren, we have seen the Houthis carrying out attacks, again, backed by Iran along the Red Sea, they have vowed to continue those attacks so long as Israel strikes on Gaza continue. And we've been hearing similar messaging here in Lebanon from the Iran-backed Hezbollah. Of course, we've seen hostilities and crossfire on Lebanon's southern border between Hezbollah and the Israeli military from the outset of the war in Gaza. We have seen that crossfire continuing to escalate, but what we've been hearing over the last few days and weeks is a real emphasis, a real doubling-down on the messaging from Hezbollah. This is coming in direct response to the situation we are seeing in Gaza. In fact, just over the weekend, we heard from Hezbollah's Secretary- General, Hassan Nasrallah saying that there can be no discussion around a possible cessation of hostilities on Lebanon's southern border so long as Israel's airstrikes on Gaza  continue. So, of course, what we are seeing is exactly what has been the main concern for many across, not only the region, but internationally is the potential for the war in Gaza to spread out more broadly into the region. We've seen a flurry of diplomatic activity trying to defuse those tensions. But clearly, as Israel's airstrikes continue on the Gaza Strip, what we are seeing is continued hostility spreading across the region, real fears, real concerns and alarm bells sounding of the potential for this to escalate further and more broadly.

Our Fred Pleitgen gives us a closer look at the Bradley fighting vehicles. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As the Russian army assaults Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, U.S. provided Bradley infantry fighting vehicles are key to keeping the Ukrainians in the fight. We're ready, the crews say. And then unleash their powerful 25-millimeter gun on Russian troops in nearby tree lines, helping Ukrainian infantry blunt an assault. The vehicle's commander's call sign is Barbie. And he tells me the Bradleys are making all the difference. I doubt that we'd be talking with you doing this interview if we didn't have the Bradleys, he says. Most likely the northern flank would have been already lost without the Bradleys. They have no time to lose. The next task waiting as the Russians try to press forward.",

Because of its armor and its strongcanon, it can easily defeat Russian armored vehicles. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The Bradley's also own the dark, the crew says. Able to find and target Russian troops with their thermal scopes. You can see the rounds impact after they fire a salvo at Russian forces. I asked Barbie if the Russians fear the Bradley. The Russians are very afraid of the Bradley. He says, we were getting radio intercepts where we could hear their infantry shouting that the Bradley was coming and they couldn't do anything against it. They've come a long way since Ukraine's failed counteroffensive this past summer when Bradley's and other Western vehicles were often bogged down by minefields and Russian artillery barrages unable to unleash their firepower. Now, it often looks like this, Ukraine's 47th Mechanized Brigade provided us with these videos of what they say is Bradley's firing at Russian infantry positions. They also provided several videos purporting to show a Bradley beating Russia's most capable main battle tank, the T-90, in a duel. The Bradley fires salvos at the Russian tank, after taking many hits, the T-90 seems to be out of control, its turret spinning. The vehicle then hits a tree before the Ukrainians send a drone to finish it off. The Russian crew manages to bail. But the Ukrainians fear this could end soon if U.S. Congress doesn't OK additional funding for military aid. And both U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said that Ukraine is already forced to ration some ammunition. JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: The assistance that we provided, has now ground to a halt. The attacks that the Russians are conducting are only increasing. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Barbie and his crew say, so far, they have no shortages of ammo or spare parts for the Bradleys. A key weapon as they try to hold the line against a massive Russian invasion force. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, near Avdiivka, Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
