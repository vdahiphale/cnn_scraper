And so, I think that there's two points to be made here. Number one, in terms of the law. People lie every day, unfortunately. What is the nature of that? Did you lie on a federal form? Did you otherwise indicate when you were signing a form that you were swearing under penalty of perjury? All of that has to be investigated. The next step, you talk about a congressional inquiry -- an ethics inquiry. They will look, they will examine, and they will make a determination as to the specific lies that he told and what references he made on forms. If that happens, Don, the answer is there is trouble here big time. If that didn't happen, then he has to explain to voters why he made up these things concerning his education, concerning his employment, concerning his philanthropy, concerning his employees who died at the Pulse nightclub.
