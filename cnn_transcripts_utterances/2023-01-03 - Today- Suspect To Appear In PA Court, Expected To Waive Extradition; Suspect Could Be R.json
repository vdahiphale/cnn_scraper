He's going to have to answer before a judge in Idaho -- to the charges and the prosecutor is going to have to lay out some evidence that will allow this court to hold him over, to hold him, presumably without bail, given the seriousness of these crimes. So we're going to have to learn a lot more than what has been told so far to the media as it relates to how is he assessing. His family said that they were completely shocked by the arrest as well as Kohberger himself, apparently through his attorney has stated that he was surprised. So we have two very different stories being painted, one by the prosecutors that they have all the evidence that links him to the murder, but yet the family and Kohberger himself speaking through the lawyer saying that he will be exonerated.",

We have been able to force, to force some rules changes to make things better. Even so, even so, we gave out -- and look, we've been working on this since last summer. I worked personally on it since last summer when I went to the leader and said, I anticipate this moment. We would like to avoid this moment. So let's start working on all these issues right now. Issues that will work for the American people. Because the American people don't care who the speaker is. The American people care that they're paying $5 for a dozen eggs. They care that they can't afford their energy bills. They care about a wide-open border and rampant crime in their communities. They don't care about this. So how are we going to fix this if we keep doing the same things and getting the same outcomes? So, in the summertime, we were rebuffed. I went back in the fall, not really interested in talking. Once we get a very slim majority after we were told there was going to be this huge red wave, well, then the conversation got a little interesting. But even so, even so, what do you want? What do you want? We said, you're the guy that wants to be speaker. Tell us if you want to earn our vote, how we're going to transform this place so that there's a different outcome for the American people. Tell us how you're going to do that. Yet nothing. So finally, he said, put something down. I want to know what you want. So we did in the beginning of December. And even at that point, even at that point, there were people that said, I will not vote for Kevin McCarthy. But yet I'm still working to try and avoid this moment that we're at right now. The whole time. The whole time. And so that's one question you should ask yourself. Instead of saying to these folks that are standing with me, why have you brought us to this point? Well, we surely haven't come here alone. There's one person that could have changed all this. All right? So, we send the letter, you see the letter, you see what's in it, and we start working on some things in trueness and fairness, some things, I think on the Jermaine-ness and single subject, I think we got to a decent place. But it was like pulling teeth and it took three weeks. And none of the other stuff was being worked on during that period of time. And some of the big issues for people, the rules that hold the speaker, the most powerful person on this side of the building accountable, that Thomas Jefferson wrote, that stood for over 200 years, that speakers from Democrat to Republican during Civil War, World War, pandemic, close majorities, large majorities.
