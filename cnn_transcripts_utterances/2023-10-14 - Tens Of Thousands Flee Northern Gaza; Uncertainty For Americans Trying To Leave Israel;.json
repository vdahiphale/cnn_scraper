      "sentences": "Well, Michael, we are talking about a population in northern Gaza of about more than 1 million people. As you mentioned, this literally happened Friday morning.So far, according to the U.N.'s humanitarian office, we've seen tens of thousands of people, now, fleeing and evacuating to the south, as ordered in that warning by the Israel Defense Forces on Friday. But this comes in addition to more than 400,000 Palestinians and civilians in Gaza, already displaced by the Israeli airstrikes since they began one week ago. We are talking about, as you know, an area that is very small, densely populated, an area that has been under a land, sea and air blockade and continues to be since 2007. So when you think of the sheer scale, the number of people now that are being told to evacuate, some of them, of course, unable to physically do so, particularly when you think about the number of hospitals in the north of Gaza. This is, as the U.N. has termed it, \"impossible.\" We've heard from Doctors without Borders, who said yesterday that one of their hospitals was given just two hours' notice to evacuate. But their doctors stayed behind, in order to continue treatment to patients. So this is very dire. We've heard condemnation from across the border and across humanitarian groups. The U.N.'s humanitarian relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, spoke yesterday. He said that the noose around the civilian population of Gaza is being tightened. And we heard from the Norwegian Refugee Council, addressing this issue specifically, saying this could tantamount to a war crime. And when we hear from the Palestinians inside Gaza, who are being told to move southwards, many fear that this displacement they are experiencing could lead to long- term displacement. Many fear they will not be able to return home. As we know, these airstrikes have continued throughout the last week. They have continued as civilians tried to flee from the north. According to Palestinian authorities, in Gaza, they say schools, residences and medical facilities have been targeted. And as we know, the death toll is steadily rising, already topping 1,900 people killed in Gaza, by Israelis, with thousands more injured so far.",

They've had five wars against Hamas and Hamas is still there. And there is also the risk of increasing public support for what they will see as a resistance if the civilian suffering is too much. It is complicated. O'HANLON: Yes. And I think we will all have to watch what happens on the ground because it is too hard to speculate. But one possibility is that Israel is successful in fundamentally weakening Hamas and making sure they cannot rule the Gaza Strip the way it has in recent years. Who is going to replace Hamas? And under what auspices? And one possibility that comes to my mind is a U.N. trusteeship or perhaps a coalition of different kinds of Palestinian groups. But all of these conversations are premature when Hamas is still in power and when Israel has not meaningfully entered into Gaza, at least not in any kind of large-scale operation to overthrow Hamas. So I think Israel is going to take its best shot. And none of us really know. Israel doesn't know how well it is going to work. They have not really made plans for this. This was the scenario they were trying to avoid. That's why they left 16 years ago. So a week or two or three, I hope you will have me back on because we can have a more productive conversation about what the realistic options for the end game are. Right now, all we can do is speculate and hypothesize. I think the bottom line is how well can Israel do at decimating Hamas? It's going to try. And there are going to be collateral damages and civilian deaths along the way. But Israel is going to try. And then we will see how well it does in a week or two or three.",

The roads, many of the main arteries have been destroyed at the very same moment that the Israeli army is calling on 1 million people from the northern part of Gaza to evacuate southwards. It's a logistical impossibility, given the destruction. And at the same time, we've seen convoys, just like today, people evacuating their homes, based on the idea that they would be safer elsewhere, only to have Israeli missiles attack them in their civilian convoys. So it is really quite a dire situation.

This is, I think, quite dangerous and that is why you need responsible actors in international communities, who can say, yes, what happened to you was outrageous. But the response cannot be equally outrageous. And we are just not seeing it. We are not seeing the outcry that even we've seen in the past.
