Well, this is what's left of a gas station in Valley View, Texas, north of Dallas. And it's just one of several reports of major damage following overnight storms in the area. Officials in Denton County say they are responding to reports of multiple victims and people trapped. It's unclear how many people are injured.There are also reports of overturned 18 wheelers, damaged homes, and downed power lines. Residents of Salina, a city within Denton County, are being urged to stay in their homes and off the roads following apparent tornado activity. And in Oklahoma, police say the town of Claremore is shut down to avoid the area. There too, reports of extensive damage to homes as well as downed trees and power lines. The state emergency operations center has been activated. Right now, around 240,000 customers are with power -- without power, across multiple states in the region. And the threat is far from over. For more, I'm joined by CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Allison, tell us, what is the latest?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so again, it's been a very active last 24 hours. All of these dots you can see here on the screen indicate where we've had a severe thunderstorm report of some kind. Over 200 total when you break down. Over a dozen tornado reports, over a hundred damaging wind reports, and many hail reports. Some of them the size of baseballs.So again, you're talking a pretty wide swath, but it's not over. In fact, a lot of the severe thunderstorms are still ongoing. We have a severe thunderstorm watch that the yellow color you see there still going on portions of Texas. And a little bit farther to the north and east, we have these tornado watches in effect for several more hours as we go through the day, because this is where some of the strongest thunderstorms are located as we speak. Again, you can see that line beginning to spread through Springfield, Missouri through Northern Arkansas and eventually in towards Kentucky and Tennessee. Still looking at some active tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm warnings as well as these storms continue to progress eastward. And this is likely to continue through the rest of the day today because while the main focus of the severe weather shifts a little bit farther to the east, the threats themselves remain the same. So, we are still looking at the potential for a few tornadoes, some very large hail that could be golf ball size or even larger. And again, some damaging wind gusts. And you can see a lot of pretty big cities here that have the potential for those storms. You're talking Chicago, Cleveland, down through Atlanta, Georgia, back up into Nashville, Memphis, St. Louis. Again, a lot of these same cities that even had severe weather just a few days ago are now going to be seeing severe weather yet again. Here's a look at that line. Again, as we go through the morning, it's going to continue to slide off to the east, Chicago down through St. Louis by late morning and especially into the afternoon. Then you start to see that initial line begin to spread over in towards the northeast. But you also start to see a new line develop. That's going to be later on this evening. That's what's going to impact states like Kentucky, Tennessee, and eventually spreading down into Georgia and even into the Carolinas. That's where you can see there. So, Monday morning, but it might end up being a pretty rough go in the morning hours for places like Chattanooga, Knoxville, Atlanta, and even into Charlotte on up. Anna.",

Thanks so much for having me this morning. This was certainly a different crowd for Trump. He's used to his own events where audience members are vetted, everyone's wearing red MAGA hats. Instead, he was walking in as a persona non grata, a big government conservative, who represents, in many ways, the antithesis of libertarianism. This is a very self-selective ideological crowd that shows up to an event like this. A lot of hardline libertarians believe that most mainstream Republicans and Democrats are cut from the same cloth, that neither wants to shrink government, that neither wants to reign in entitlement and discretionary spending. When you look at Trump's record, forget all the scandals, there's not a whole lot to like. If your goal is to diminish the size and scope of the state. During his term, Trump added about 8.4 trillion to the national debt, which came in the form of pandemic bills and executive actions and general spending increases. Some from tax cuts.

That's within the margin. Interestingly, though, these tend to be voters who, in a typical election, would vote Democrat and now are more likely to defect to Trump. But I think the real question is how Kennedy positions himself down the stretch. If he's going to focus on COVID vaccines and government conspiracies, et cetera, it's going to damage Trump by eating into his popular space. But if he focuses more on democratic issues, climate change, minimum wage, labor rights, et cetera, I think it'll take support away from Biden. The other question is how hard Trump and Biden or their Super PACs and surrogates actually start to attack Kennedy on the campaign trail and with advertisements.

He has expressed uncertain hints, I should say, as what -- as to what his policy would be.He gave an interview to an Israeli newspaper just a couple of months ago in which he made strange statements that don't totally indicate what I think Netanyahu would like to think, which is that he would be even more supportive of everything Israel wants to do. He said things like the war has to end eventually. But it's not clear exactly what he means. There has been tension in that relationship too. But certainly, I think Netanyahu has been a big part of this increasingly partisan view of the U.S. within Israel, such that the right-wing, again, assumes that Republican presidents would be more supportive, whereas they simply sort of take prima facie that American Democratic presidents like Biden, which is, of course, extremely ironic considering how much Biden has done for Israel in general over the years, and particularly so much support during this war. And that's why you see surveys showing that a greater number of Israelis -- I don't want to overstate the case. It's not a majority at this point, but a plurality of Israelis still think that Trump would be better than Biden. And these are dangerous dynamics. I mean, if you're going to have an alliance between these two countries that reflects the special relationship of the past, you need to have the public basically trusting that the other side of that alliance is on its side no matter which president there is. You know, we have to take into account that the long-term trajectory does not look good if Israel continues its politicization of how it views the U.S., whereby, again, the Israeli right always thinks the U.S. isn't doing enough unless it gives a blank check, and the American public is increasingly split.",

The U.S. has had so many contradictions in its policy of seeming to take a -- you know, a critical position of Israel's actions, right? I think the main disagreements have been over humanitarian aid, over an operation in Rafah, which the administration did not want, and over insisting that Israel communicate -- define and communicate its day after plans. Israel has done none of those things with some exception of allowing more humanitarian aid and not enough. And of course, without a ceasefire, it will never be enough.But even on those three major points, Israel has not really complied with what America has said it wanted. And as a result, it's very hard to see exactly what Israel could do that would go beyond even America's red line because to the extent that America has conveyed where it disagrees with Israeli policy, it has not taken positions that are firm enough to actually push Israeli policy in that direction. We see this also with relation to the West Bank. The U.S. has finally adopted certain policies, particularly sanctioning settlers, individual settlers, that indicate its disapproval of Israel's settlement policy and the escalations in the West Bank. But those are signals. Still, they are policy, but they are signals. They are not actually constraining Israel's actual actions in the West Bank, which by many accounts could very easily lead to an escalation imminently. And so, I think that it's very hard for me to say that there is a red line that this administration will -- you know, will cause this administration to take more significant action.",
