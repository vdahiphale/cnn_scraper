We talked to Professor Adam Hartstone-Rose who set out to study animal behavior during the moment of eclipse totality. He was studying, among others, Galapagos tortoises.Now, in the eclipse of 2017, he observed that some of the tortoises started inexplicably mating, so he wanted to see what happened this time. Would they do it, literally, again? The professor sent me some of his preliminary observations from Monday. \"They did have sex,\" he writes, \"but not during the eclipse. That group of tortoises is rather amorous.\" And prior to the eclipse, the females spread out around the enclosure and one of the males basically made the rounds. He writes, \"I think the answer is that tortoises just surprisingly mate very publicly and with literally zero discretion. Twenty-seventeen,\" he writes, \"was probably an honest coincidence.\" \"However, the tortoises did do something else amazing,\" he says. As totally approached, one of the females went toward the barn where they are led in for the night, but right at totality, all of them piled up to be led in and they pushed with such force some apparently, literally, rearing up -- they jammed the door. He writes that \"Almost all of the animals they watched went into their evening routine during the eclipse, clamoring to get into their night holding areas, but none, other than the tortoises, did so with such determination as to cause a literal maintenance problem.\" So there you have it. Sex, but not eclipse sex -- and some aggressive door-rushing. This is very important, Kate.",

We also refer to them as forever chemicals because their chemical bonds are so strong in order to do the things we wanted them to do that they never essentially break down. And they can persist both in the environment and in our bodies and accumulate over time.Now, these have been used since the 1940s for various things like non- staining clothing, non-stick cookware, heat-resistant items -- things like that -- and they're found in a lot of different products. Teflon is one of the famous ones, but also food packaging and many other household items. And they have been starting to be phased out, especially as their health risks have become more and more apparent. Studies have linked PFAS to different kinds of cancer, to high cholesterol and obesity, to immune issues, essentially making your immune system not even respond as well -- as well to vaccines and to developmental issues as well. And so, today, the Biden administration and the EPA are finalizing a rule around setting limits for how high PFAS levels can be in drinking water -- essentially, to almost not detectable levels. This is going to focus on six of these chemicals and they say that this will affect PFAS exposure for about 100 million people in the United States. They say because of the health effects here they think this should prevent tens of thousands of illnesses and thousands of deaths -- guys.",

The Biden administration also is implementing $1 billion funding as part of this to try to help water authorities do this.

The way the family and the attorney -- and I certainly understand where they're coming from, but they're making it sound as if he was shot because he was not wearing a seat belt. He was shot because he shot a police officer. That's why he was shot.I mean, the stop was made and we can argue whether or not tactical officers should be making traffic stops for seat belts and things like that. But it would not have occurred had he not fired first and shot a police officer, period. I mean, so, you can't shoot a cop and expect not to get shot in return. It's just the way it is. And so, I really understand what they're saying. This is going to be investigated by the state's attorney. It's going to be investigated by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability. The final shots that were fired are the only ones that I saw on the videos that give me some concern -- those last three shots, in particular. Now, even though the majority of shots were fired while he was in the car and had very dark tinted windows, obviously, he wasn't incapacitated because he was able to get out of the car and get to the rear of the car. They believed he was still armed. They continued to fire. Now, the last three shots are the ones that will have to be scrutinized very, very closely. But having been in shootouts if you will before, myself, your adrenaline is pumping. And believe me, it's a very, very tense situation. And when you're firing that gun you're trying to make sure that individual is no longer a threat to you. So not to make excuses. It does need to be looked at. I am concerned about the last three shots. But the use of deadly force, in my opinion, overall was justified in this case.",

Gold prices up 14 percent so far this year -- up 11 of the last 12 days. Look at this -- moving closer and closer to the $2,400 range. If you take a live look at gold prices right now, they're up another .2 percent -- again moving closer to $2,400, which would be the first time ever.So what's happening -- because this move is getting some attention on Wall Street, right? Gold is a safe haven so a spike like this could be looked at as potentially an ominous sign. There's a few factors here. One, gold is viewed as a hedge against inflation. And we know prices have been going up. Consumer prices are slowing in terms of their growth but they're still so much higher than before COVID. Rate cuts -- the Fed may be cutting interest rates. When that happens, sometimes that tends to boost gold prices. China is buying. Central bankers there and other countries, they are diversifying away from the dollar. That is lifting physical demand for gold. Also, listen, these are scary times and gold is viewed as kind of a war hedge during geopolitical fears. We have the Ukraine-Russia War, the situation in the Middle East. All of that is also boosting demand. And then there's FOMO, right -- fear of missing out. To some extent, gold prices are going up because people see the prices going up and they know other people are buying. Suze Orman was on and speaking to Erin Burnett last night.

A lot of times those hidden fees -- things like data caps or throttling, or you have to pay more for data. The FCC, for the past seven years, has been looking at this problem and saying what can we do about it? And so, they borrowed something from the pages over at the FDA and they said we can make a nutrition label that's going to help people understand what all those hidden costs are.

They've shown that they can win against Putin. They're not going to lose for lack of morale. They're not going to lose for lack of ingenuity on the battlefield. The only way they can lose is if we don't give them the support they deserve.You know, our economies together outrank Russia's 25 to one. Putin has already paid a huge price for this terrible strategic error of invading Ukraine. He's lost 350,000 soldiers. He's lost so much of his fleet. He's lost a huge amount of his aircraft. It's been massively costly to Russia. A huge mistake. And NATO has got stronger. And one of the points I'm sure, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, you'd appreciate is back in 2014, when I was prime minister, only three countries in NATO were spending two percent of GDP on defense. It's now around 20. So, Europe is doing more, and rightly so. But Europe and America sticking together and standing up against bullies and dictators -- that's good for both of us.",

      "sentences": "Well, the point I would make is the NATO of 2024-2025 is different to the NATO of 2014. We've now got Sweden and Finland, two highly capable members who have joined. We're more united than ever before.And where as it was three countries spending two percent, it's now around 20 out of the 32 members with many of the other members having plans. And a lot of that is because of the pressure -- the success that American presidents, quite rightly, have put on Europeans and said come on, guys -- you've got to spend more of your own money on your defense. That is happening. So whoever is president in -- after November of this year, I want them to be in a position where they can see a strong and united NATO that's succeeding, and a strong Ukraine that is pushing back Russia and capable of achieving that defeat for Putin, and a just peace that will be so vital for America's national interests. Because, of course, China is watching this. Iran is watching this. North Korea is watching this. Even if you think China is a more important threat than Russia -- and right now, I think Russia is the key threat that we face. But even if you think it's China, China will draw a lesson. If we can push back Putin, deliver a win for Ukraine, deliver a just peace, show that NATO is strong, show the United States is strong, that will send the clearest possible message to President Xi and to China not to take risks in the Pacific.",
