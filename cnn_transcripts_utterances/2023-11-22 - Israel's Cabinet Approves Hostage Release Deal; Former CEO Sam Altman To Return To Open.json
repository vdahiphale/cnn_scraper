      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world as we continue our breaking news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. I'm Rosemary Church. Israel has signed off on a deal to release at least 50 hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. In a move that's bringing hope to families waiting for the return of their loved ones.The government overwhelmingly backed the deal after a six-hour long Cabinet meeting for hostages to be freed are expected to be women and children. In exchange, Israel will pause its air and ground campaign against Hamas for four days. Hamas says 150 Palestinian prisoners also women and children will be released from Israeli jails as part of their deal. Qatar delivered the proposal following weeks of continuous negotiations and now says the humanitarian pause will be announced within the next 24 hours. Hamas says the deal involves the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying aid, medical supplies and fuel into Gaza. And earlier, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said the deal was set to include Red Cross visits to hostages that are still being held in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden released a statement welcoming the deal adding that it should bring home additional American hostages. And he said \"I will not stop until they are all released.\" Among the Americans taken hostage by Hamas is Abigail Edan who's just three years old. Her great aunt spoke to CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ HIRSH NAFTALL, GREAT-NIECE HELD BY HAMAS: I'm very hopeful our family is hopeful this little three-year-old is somewhere in Gaza. I hope that she is with the mother that was taking care of her at that time with her own three kids. And I just hope that Abigail is being taken care of and loved and that this deal will follow through and that these hostages -- these children will be back home with their families in the next couple of days.

They are also -- that is north of Gaza City. They are also pushing into areas southwest of Gaza City, as well.The Qataris who brokered this deal say that look, the international community should take this opportunity to take this pause to try to pursue the path of diplomacy.

You had the Egyptians, the Americans, in addition to the Israelis, and Hamas. Plus, you had the Qataris who were mediating this. We understand that the Qatari Prime Minister was in direct contact with the leader of Hamas is Ismail Haniyeh.This took place over many weeks, obviously. And it was quite complex. You had, obviously indirect communication taking place between the Israelis and Hamas, which added time. You also had poor communications in Gaza as well. It also wasn't entirely clear for some time, whether Hamas actually knew the precise locations of where these hostages were actually located or Hamas leadership knew the precise locations and Israel didn't have assurances that they were, in fact alive. And that the deal, actually, according to sources almost broke down when the Israelis entered the Al Shifa Hospital complex. It was some behind the scenes furious diplomacy that got things back on track and all ultimately led to this deal. Prime Minister Netanyahu also pointed out in his speech to Israelis yesterday that President Biden was instrumental in getting this deal done. He says that he managed to improve the deal when he got involved, though he didn't say precisely how his involvement was helpful. Rosemary?",

The details of the deal as we now understand them are 50 women and children released from captivity with Hamas for the exchange of Palestinians, women and teenagers, held in Israeli prisons. And the opening of the Rafah border for more fuel, including for more aid, including fuel, to be brought back across that border, crucial for humanitarian efforts, of course.And in a statement from the lead negotiator in Qatar, Doctor Mohammed Al-Khulaifi, he said, and I quote here, \"Qatar's aim since the start of this escalation has been to find ways to reduce tensions, stop the bloodshed, protect civilians, and protect a regional spillover. The international community must now seize the brief window of opportunity to generate further momentum for the diplomatic track, recognizing it as the only viable route to ending the conflict - in both the short and long term.\" Qatar's statement earlier suggests that the pause will start within around 24 hours. And a statement from the lead negotiator went on to say Qatar's priority now is to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected and this statement includes the term \"Redoubling our efforts to secure a long-term ceasefire, end the war, and work towards lasting peace through a comprehensive political process.\" Perhaps not a surprise that Qatar would be seeking a long-term ceasefire in this statement, after all, that has been its position from the outset of this conflict.
