The National Institute of Elections said there was a glitch in the system that delayed their announcement until earlier this morning. But, when they announced the results, it was clear that Mexicans are ready to be led by a woman.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VALDES (voice-over): Claudia Sheinbaum has made history as the first woman projected to be the next President of Mexico. The 61-year-old handedly defeated her two opponents with at least 58 percent of the vote, according to the National Electoral Institute. CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM, PROJECTED MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WINNER (Interpreted): Our duty is and always will be to look after each Mexican without distinctions. Although many Mexican women and Mexican men don't agree fully with our project, we will walk in peace and harmony to build a fairer and more prosperous Mexico. VALDES (voice-over): Besides being the first woman set to become President, she would be the first one of Jewish ancestry. Her grandparents migrated from Eastern Europe, fleeing Nazi persecution, although she rarely mentioned her religious background. Her parents were leftist, according to a biography by journalist Arturo Cano, in which Sheinbaum says that she grew up talking about politics all day with her parents. But, her first career is academia. She has a PhD in Environmental Engineering, focused in renewable energy and climate change. Her introduction to politics happened in 2000 when she became Mexico City's Environmental Minister under the head of government Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. She became part of his team during his three presidential campaigns, and in 2018, when he won the presidency, she was elected chief of government of Mexico City. She pledged to continue the policies of Lopez Obrador with a five-point plan, increase public safety, free public education, fight poverty through social programs and higher minimum wage, better regulation of water resources, and transition to renewable energies. On Foreign Affairs, she has pledged to protect Mexico's sovereignty. And while recognizing the importance of their relationship with the United States, she wants to focus on growing ties with Central and South American nation. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, what we know at this point is that we've heard from the U.S. side that this is effectively an Israeli proposal. They have built this up to show that that they are certain that Israel will go along with it.We heard from John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson, on the weekend, saying that he was sure that this would go ahead because it was effectively Israel's deal that was on the table. So, certainly, there is pressure for Benjamin Netanyahu to push this through. Now, he said just after that announcement by the U.S. President that there still needed to be certain guarantees. There needed to be a guarantee that Hamas did not have governmental or military capabilities, something which President Biden did address and said he did believe that they have had their military capabilities taken away from them. He also said he wanted to make sure all hostages were released, and that Gaza would not be a threat going forward. But, of course, the issue is these far-right coalition members who have said that if a ceasefire deal goes ahead and they have not completely destroyed Hamas, then they would pull out of the coalition. Now, there is somewhat of a safety net. We've heard from opposition leader Yair Lapid, for example, saying he could be a safety net just to make sure that this deal goes through. So, there could possibly be other elements within Israeli politics, not those that support the Israeli Prime Minister, but ones that support a hostage and ceasefire deal that could put themselves forward to try and make sure this goes ahead. But, many analysts and experts do fear that if it doesn't work this time, there may not be another chance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: If this proposal is not accepted, there will not be another one. The Israeli negotiation team and the Israeli war cabinet exhausted their maneuvering space, meaning there will not be a more forward-leaning proposal than the one they got. And if Hamas says no to this, I think the whole issue of a hostage deal and a ceasefire will be off the table for a very long time, and this war will likely escalate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The ball is in their court to have an official acceptance, saying that the initial statement from the group was positive after this proposal was made. And we had a joint statement as well from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, those three countries which are really key mediators for this deal, pushing both Israel and Hamas to take this proposal on the table, certainly heard from President Biden himself, saying on Friday, it is time that this war ends, and that's certainly a sentiment that has been felt by many around the world for many weeks and months.

It comes just two days after Trump's conviction, and the account appeared just one day after the Biden-Harris campaign's TikTok account started posting, attacking Trump for that conviction. So, you have to imagine that Trump wants to be able to respond directly to those attacks on the platform. But, it is striking, right? It was under Trump that these conversations first began about the national security concerns surrounding TikTok, as President Trump tried and failed to ban the app.But, in the last few months, as Congress and the Biden White House moved closer to and eventually did pass a law that could ban TikTok, Trump has had an about-face. He now says he doesn't support banning TikTok. He thinks that could alienate young users and it could benefit the Facebook parent company Meta. And -- but, I have to say that this has to, at least in part, be a political move on Trump's part. He wants to curry favor with these young voters, these young users who love this platform, and at a time when Biden has signed a law that could ban the app, Trump is saying, no, I think this app should be allowed.

She is joining us now from Mexico City to discuss this election. Hello to you, Carin. Let's talk about the fact that -- I mean, this election was historic in so many ways, of course, namely because we're talking about a first female President in Mexico, a first Jewish President in Mexico, but also the sheer size of this election. CARIN ZISSIS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AMERICAS SOCIETY AND COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS ONLINE: Absolutely. This was a massive election, because due to a series of political reforms, many elections across the country aligned to be held at the same time. We're talking about 20,000 seats across the country up for election, the entire Congress, and of course, the presidency, as well as nine governorships. Now, her party, Claudia Sheinbaum's party, won by a landslide in not just the presidency. She won by about 34 points. It's important to note that she won by more votes than her predecessor, the popular -- the person who will be her predecessor, the popular President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and she won by more votes -- a greater portion of the votes than any other President since Mexico went through a democratic transition. It also is appearing as though her party has won two thirds majority in the lower house of Congress, and in addition, potentially close to a two thirds majority in the Senate. She will come in and have an ability to carry out sweeping changes. And as you mentioned, this is a historic election because she is the first woman President. She will be governing the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. And given that size of Mexico's population, there are more women in Mexico than even in the second largest Spanish-speaking country in the world.

Thank you.So, as Mexico gets ready for a new leader, sources tell CNN U.S. President Joe Biden is preparing to roll out sweeping executive action on arrangements at the southern border. Basically, he will be cracking down with more restrictive policy there. They say an announcement could come as early as Tuesday. The President is expected to dramatically limit the scope for migrants to seek asylum at the U.S. border. We're hearing the White House is aiming to neutralize Republican attacks, claiming the President has failed to tackle the border crisis. CNN's Arlette Saenz joining me now live at the White House with more. So, what are you learning in terms of what kind of policies President Biden could announce, and could some of it, I guess, mirror those policy that were in that bipartisan agreement that we saw was torpedoed by Trump several months ago?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Amara. Sources have told us that President Biden could announce his executive action relating to the border as soon as tomorrow. In fact, sources have told us the White House officials have started reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the U.S. southern border to potentially join Biden here at the White House for that event.Now, the President has been weighing this potential executive action for months now in the wake of that failed bipartisan border talks up on Capitol Hill. In recent weeks, administration officials have been working towards this executive action, which would dramatically limit people's ability to seek asylum at the U.S. southern border. It's expected that this policy could be reminiscence of an approach President -- former President Donald Trump took while he was in office, tapping in to an existing authority -- a pre-existing authority that would severely clamp down on border crossings at the border. Now, the White House has so far has not detailed exactly what would be in this executive action or confirmed that it's actually coming this week, a White House spokesperson simply saying quote, \"As we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\" Now, it comes as the President and his team are really trying to tackle a politically problematic issue for the President heading into November's election, and before that all- important first debate with former President Donald Trump a bit later this month. Now, Americans have increasingly shown concern about issues relating to the U.S. southern border. It's something that Trump has really tried to seize on within his campaign. But, you have also seen the President and the White House really take a more aggressive approach when it comes to the border at a time when they were frustrated with the fact that Republicans blocked those bipartisan border talks at the urging of former President Trump. Now, Biden is seeking really to try to turn the tables on Republicans as they are trying to roll out these measures to address the issues at the U.S. southern border. It comes at a time when apprehensions at the southern border have actually been down this year, in part due to Mexico's own stepped-up enforcement along the U.S. southern border. But, administration officials are keenly aware that there could be a border surge in the coming summer months, and at this time, are trying to take some steps to try to show that the President is trying to address this issue that many voters have expressed concerns about and that Republicans have tried to use against Biden heading into November's election.",

Thousands of people have been without water for four days. Now, some of the top tourist attractions in the south, including World of Coca-Cola and the Georgia Aquarium were forced to shut down. Two major concerts by a rap artist had to be canceled, and at least one hospital was forced to transfer dialysis patients to a different location and bring in tens of thousands of gallons of water by tanker truck to be able to operate.

But, it's also a product of the dry grasslands. So, we had above average snow and rain this past winter. Then the atmosphere decided to turn off the faucet, right? So, we've gone into the drier season. And all that grass that was able to grow amongst the abundant moisture that fell through the winter is now starting to dry out and it's drying out rapidly. And unfortunately, these are the combinations that you need for timber box conditions to ignite wildfires, just like the Corral Fire.So, the good news is the winds have relaxed. So, we've seen this containment go up. The firefighters starting to get a handle on this fire, 50 percent containment. San Joaquin and the Central Valley there still seen relaxing winds, but it's the temperatures that are really the concern for many locations because excessive heat warnings are in place, larger city centers as well. So, we're talking Las Vegas. They're under a heat warning that we could see temperatures climb to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. That's your heat indices. So, what it feels like as you step outside, record-high temperatures, record-low high temperatures as well. So, just hundreds of them being broken over the coming days. And of course, this poses a risk to the elderly and also to the vulnerable within these types of conditions, stretching from Texas through the four corners and into the Central Valley where San Joaquin location is located, and the Corral Fire is actually located. And you can see the triple-digit heat that's going to last through the week for Vegas, Phoenix to Palm Springs. It's set amongst a cooler weather pattern over the eastern half of the U.S. So, anytime we get these collision of air masses, we get the chance of severe weather. So, we're looking out for that across the central U.S. Seven-day forecast, not looking that promising, though. If you're located in Las Vegas, you're going to hit the strip with temperatures well above 100 degrees, and that is just a scorcher. So, take care. Drink water.",

So, the agreement was made in September of 2018 between the North and the South. And what they essentially said they were going to do is pull back their respective militaries ever so slightly from their activities in the DMZ in order to build up trust. Fast forward to now and everything that we're witnessing here, South Korea says that so much of that trust, from their point of view, is gone, and they want to perhaps fully suspend this military agreement.So, that's the diplomatic dimension. The human dimension, though, we have 26 million people or thereabouts in greater Seoul, this huge metropolis, and if you put yourself in their shoes, seeing perhaps one of these balloons descend from the sky, hitting a car, landing on your local school grounds, having hazmat teams inspect these balloons all weekend long to see what is in them, what, if any, kind of waste is in them, and it certainly left a lasting impression with so many people. Here is just a sample of what we've heard. SONG KWONG-JA, RESIDENT OF YONGKIN CITY, SOUTH KOREA (Interpreted): I had goosebumps. It felt like a childish prank. I was surprised to hear about it.
