Also with us in studio former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor. Jill, let me start with you, Soledar, just a small mining town, but obviously, it's a means to an end for Russia. And that end is controlling the key city of Bakhmut that took months for Russia to make even the small gains. And it's worth noting, Ukraine still controls about 35 percent of the Donetsk region. The Institute for the Study of War think tank adds, quote, \"even taking the most generous Russian claims at face value. The capture of Soledar would not portend an immediate encirclement of Bakhmut.\" Do you agree with that assessment?",

President Putin can't figure out what commander to keep. He had three commanders, he had four commanders, they've lasted three months each. And now he took his chief of staff, chairman and joint chiefs, he's got his General Milley and put him in charge of the battlefield.

And in Season 2, we try and offer an answer or a thesis at least, right, which, you know, I think every audience member who comes to this will have a different point of view. And as you can tell from that clip, he invokes Adolf Hitler still being alive. So, Season 2 is very alternate history. It's set in 1979 with the idea that Hitler did not commit suicide. But instead, he escaped down the ratlines to South America. [17And the reason to invoke Adolf Hitler in this is that obviously, you know, in true history, he evaded justice. He was never brought to justice. As a Jewish kid growing up that that filled me with such fury. You know, he was not only the villain in the world story, but in my own very personal story, because he was my grandmother's villain, right in her own. So, you know, I hope by invoking him and delivering justice in some way this season. We get a sense of catharsis for the audience, a little bit of wish fulfillment, though fictionalized. And so, I'm very excited for people to tune in and see that happen.",
