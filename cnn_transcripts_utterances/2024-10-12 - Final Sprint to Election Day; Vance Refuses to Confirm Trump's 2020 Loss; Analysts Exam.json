New \"The Wall Street Journal\" polling shows no clear leader among registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. Trump holds a slight advantage over Harris in Nevada. Voters say they trust Trump more than Harris when it comes to handling economic issues. His lead grows when it comes to immigration. Voters surveyed put the issues of the economy and immigration at top of their list of importance, followed by abortion and inflation. The Biden administration is suing the state of Virginia over its plan to purge voters identified as noncitizens. The suit says officials violated federal with systemic removal of voters from registration rolls. Virginia's Republican governor gave an executive order 90 days before the election. But the law says any such program must be completed no later than 90 days before the election. So the Justice Department alleges a violation of the National Voter Registration Act. The order is targeted at non-citizens voting, though instances of non- Americans casting ballots are considered very rare. Voter registration is something both campaigns are watching closely. And in swing states like Pennsylvania, the race is so tight, a few votes in each precinct could sway the outcome of the whole election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But also it's notable in that time, independents registered in Arizona, the portion of Arizona voters who are registered as independents has gone from 25 to 29. So it's really independents rather than Republicans per se who are picking up those Democratic losses. In Nevada, it's -- Democrats had a six percentage point advantage in 2020.

Both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo beat third quarter expectations. Boeing's new CEO says the company will cut 10 percent of its total staff in the coming months. That's about 17,000 jobs. The troubled aircraft maker is contending with a month-long strike of hourly employees, which has delayed production of some of its jets. Boeing has been experiencing problems for years, starting with two fatal crashes of its best-selling plane, the 737 MAX. That jet was grounded for 20 months worldwide. The company has reported core operating losses of more than $33 billion. The world's richest man says the autonomous future is here. On Thursday Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled his long-awaited robotaxi at a glitzy event at the Warner Brothers Studio near Los Angeles. Musk showcased the cyber cab in front of an audience. About 4 million others watched on X. The robotaxi has no steering wheel or pedals. Production is set to start in 2026 but Musk is known for over- promising. Five years ago, he said the robotaxi would be available in a year. And Musk also showed off a robovan. It's a larger vehicle that he said could carry up to 20 people. He gave no timeframe for when that vehicle might be introduced.

But now that the fighting has begun, leaving isn't always an option. Jomana Karadsheh has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Baby Abdul's life has barely begun. And yet when he hears bombs, he points to the sky. MARYATO SUWARI (PH):  Maybe in the night, when the night, he just points up, like the sound. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  He and his mother, Maryato Suwari (ph), are one of hundreds of migrant families left with nowhere to go in Lebanon. They say they've been abandoned by their employers. SUWARI (PH):  They go, all of them go. I don't know, I don't know where they go. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Night after night, day after day, Israel's missiles are raining down on the Lebanese capital of Beirut. They're hitting the southern suburbs hardest. It's where Hezbollah has a strong presence but it's also where many migrant workers live. Migrant workers CNN spoke to described how their employers fled for safety while they were left behind to fend for themselves without the means or paperwork to leave. The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration estimates that there are around 170,000 migrant workers in Lebanon and they're predominantly women. The Kafala or sponsorship system used in Lebanon, Jordan and many Gulf countries gives employers almost total control over their freedom of movement. Some workers told CNN they were refused entry to official government shelters because they're not Lebanese. Many resorted to sleeping on the streets. The Lebanese governments rejected any accusations of discrimination between displaced people. LEA GHORAYEB, VOLUNTEER (PH):  As you can see, some of them have all their stuff with them and some have literally nothing. Hey, mama. Hi. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Volunteers like Lea Ghorayeb have stepped in where consulates and embassies have failed to respond, identifying buildings to use as makeshift shelters in a country where so-called safe places are shrinking by the day.",
