      "sentences": "The Biden administration has signaled to several European allies in recent weeks that it would allow them to export their F-16s, according to several sources familiar with the matter.This, as the White House faces increased pressure not only from Congress, but also from allies to get Ukraine advanced fighter jets, because of the increased barrages of aerial attacks that the country has faced, especially in recent weeks from Russia. However, the administration hasn't gotten any formal request to approve the transfer of foreign F-16s to Ukraine. Nor have State Department officials begun the paperwork that would be required to do so. Several European countries possess F-16s, and fly the U.S.-made fighter jet, and have signaled a willingness to put together some sort of package that would allow them to transfer their F-16s to Ukraine. However, as the pressure has increased, the U.S. hasn't shifted its own position on its own F-16 fighter jets, mainly that the U.S. isn't willing to right now. And is reluctant to send its F-16s to Ukraine at this time. Instead, focusing on several other areas. That is armor, and mechanized capabilities, as well as aerial defenses, which has really been the priority for the U.S. sending Ukraine those at the moment. It is worth noting that just earlier this week, there was a bipartisan letter sent to the White House, urging the White House to shift its position on F-16s. I'll read you a part of this right now. \"As a bipartisan group of lawmakers, we view the transfer of aircraft to Ukraine as essential for providing Kyiv with the air support capability required to fully defend their nation against Russia's unprovoked, illegal, and brutal invasion. And to make the territorial gains necessary to reclaim their country.\" The National Security Council's coordinator first for strategic communications, John Kirby, has said the administration is willing to consider future capabilities, though not specifying whether that includes F-16s. It is worth noting that there were two Ukrainian fighter pilots in the U.S. earlier this -- this year, from late February to early March, having their skills assessed for a short period there to see what it would take for them to learn advanced fighter jets. But at least, as of right now, that hasn't shifted the administration's position. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I'm not sure the Chinese view it the same way. Heard something similar from Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. And then Mr. Sullivan met in Vienna for two days with China's top foreign policy official. And the accounts that came out of that sounded a little bit more constructive than what was going on around the time that the U.S. shot the balloon out of the sky off of the U.S. East Coast.

The debt limit ceiling wouldn't be heads until June 1 at the earliest. It would have been, under the old plan home for a week. But I think that he did not want to probably open himself up to the criticism that you're already hearing from Republicans that he's abroad at a time that these negotiations are going on. Frankly, I think the bigger damage is being done to American diplomacy in the South Pacific, by his not showing up in a meeting with 17 leaders who were going to see him in Papua New Guinea.

The war in Ukraine, obviously high on the agenda for the weekend meetings with the U.K. and European Union, already announcing new sanctions on Russia's diamond trade. Also, sources telling CNN the U.S. will not block allies from sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, something Kyiv has been requesting for months. The U.S. Supreme Court handed Silicon Valley twin victories on Thursday by protecting online platforms from liability for terror- related content posted by users. In one of the two cases, the court ruled that Twitter will not have to face accusations it aided and abetted terrorism when it hosted tweets from the terror group ISIS. The ruling, effectively raising the bar for future such claims. The Supreme Court also dismissed a case against Google. It left intact a lower court ruling that said the company is immune from a lawsuit that accuses its subsidiary, YouTube, of aiding and abetting terrorism. Joining me now is Mike Isaac. He's a technology correspondent with \"The New York Times.\" He joins me now from San Francisco. Good to see you.

I think today, honestly, was a big win for tech companies that have basically been assailed for a long time, as to how much responsibility they have for the content that's posted on their platforms, whether it's Twitter, or Facebook or any of the different social media companies like YouTube under Google. And, you know, basically, there has been a long-standing sort of argument that they should be no longer shielded by this law called Section 230, which essentially gives them indemnity from the types of different content that's posted on the networks, whether it's violent extremism, like in these cases, that led to the deaths of people or, you know, things that are more benign.

Colombia's president tweeting that four children on board the single-engine aircraft that crashed in the jungle on May 1 had been found alive and well, rescuers using scatter debris to trace them. But on Thursday, the president's tweet was deleted, saying the information could not be confirmed, government officials blaming poor communication. And the head of the country's Children Welfare Authority later saying she was, quote, \"very confident\" about the rescue. She said, quote, \"We're still missing that very, very last link that confirms all our hopes. Until we have the photo of the kids, we won't be stopping. We're not underestimating the information we received, but we want to confirm directly ourselves.\" The Colombian armed forces have been using dogs to search for the children. The plane had taken off from the remote area of Araracuara, bound for San Jose Del Guaviare. Rescuers from the military and local indigenous communities aren't giving up hope to bring home the little ones, as they follow a trail of small objects, such as hair scrunchies and baby bottles, even bringing in a recording of the grandmother to at least one of the children, to help in the search. But efforts are difficult, given the rainfall in the dense parts of the jungle.",
