That number is not correct. And PacWest is down this morning as well. Charles Schwab, which is also a west coast money manager, down eight percent. So we're watching these very closely. Other banks are down. The big national banks are also down one percent and two percent this morning so you're going to see a lot of unease in the banking sector. It's not necessarily concerns about their balance sheets; it's concerns about profitability. And what do I mean by that? Well, these banks are going to have to start paying more interest for depositors to keep depositors happy and to keep the deposits in their banks, and that means that they're going to make less profit. So that's one of the things you're seeing in the banking sector. But overall, I can tell you that stock index futures are just barely mixed here. So this could have been a very different-looking day here today if the Fed, and the FDIC, and the Treasury hadn't stepped in. So you've got some stability overall in the stock market, but in the banking sector we'll be watching very, very closely because there is still some unease there.",

Listen, the New York law is a bit convoluted and I think the biggest problem here is the acceptance of the idea of indicting a former president -- unprecedented move -- with a law that's sort of a couple of steps removed. In other words, the law here makes it a misdemeanor to falsify business records with the intent to defraud. So the idea there would be that payments were falsified that were made to Michael Cohen to reimburse him for payments to Stormy Daniels -- Ms. Daniels. And then it becomes a felony under 175.10 under New York law if there was the intent to defraud, to commit, or conceal another crime. And so we're a couple of steps removed here. It's a fundamental assumption or principle of prosecution, both federally and in New York State, that we don't prosecute unless the prosecutor is convinced that you would get a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. That's a very dubious theory of prosecution here. It's not the kind of case in which to indict a former President of the United States. And by the way, I think the political fallout plays both ways. There's an election blog piece by Rick Hasen, who is not a Trump lover, who says this is not a prosecution to bring. You risk making President Trump a martyr by doing this kind of thing. And the public is already so skeptical of these kinds of things. I think it's a big mistake to handle -- to bring this prosecution.",
