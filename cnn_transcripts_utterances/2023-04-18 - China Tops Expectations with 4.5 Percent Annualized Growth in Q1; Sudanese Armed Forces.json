This Tuesday, FOX or systems go for the start of the FOX News Dominion defamation trial in the U.S. state of Delaware jury selection set to begin today as talks of a last minute settlement recede. Lion Chinese GDP roaring back in the first quarter up a better than expected 4.5 percent amid strong consumer spending but a bit of weakness behind the main number we'll explain. Also bees, consumers making a beeline for Apple's first physical store in India, the tech world buzzing over Apple's new high yield savings account too. Will it be a sting at the bottom line of some of the bigger banks? Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities will be here to discuss it all. And of course, dog in bank earnings today a rough Q1 for Goldman Sachs but fetching results from Bank of America. Yes, --. Goldman Sachs set to fall some 3 percent after missing on revenues deal making actually and bond trading was sore spots. Bank of America meanwhile, higher pre market after posting a strong set of results, even as it announced $20 billion in deposit outflows and they're not the only one. According to the FT Charles Schwab, State Street and M&amp;T Bank have seen customers pull a total of $68 billion in deposits tempted by higher interest rates from money market funds and other financial products. That's probably OK for the bigger banks less so of course, for the smaller ones, as we've long been discussing, because of course lending and profits will be squeezed at some of those smaller banks as a result. So that's something certainly we'll continue to watch. All this plus, slow growth bears and sticky inflation suggests a continued battle between Wall Street bulls and bears, but it is as you can see a mostly higher U.S. open on tap after Monday's leopard leap forward. Europe high too, after a spotty Asian handover, I'm stopping now. But the lion's share of our attention today does begin in China with China posting growth, as I mentioned, a 4.5 percent in the first quarter that's compared to data from a year ago driven by strong consumer spending. The solid rebound, comes after Beijing ended its zero COVID policy back in December. And Ivan Watson joins us now. Ivan, plenty of speculation that China could if they continue in this manner, exceed their 5 percent growth target for this year. The question is, is it sustainable? What do you make of the numbers?",

There are three separate cases here. The first, as you mentioned, two men U.S. citizens were charged with running a secret Police station here in the U.S. in Chinatown, where they tried to identify, track and harass dissidents. In a separate case, the U.S. government charged dozens of officials connected to China's National Security Operations. With also harassing dissidents in this case, they alleged that they were building social media profiles in some cases, posing as average Americans weighing in on anything from foreign policy to George Floyd. But these accounts would not only promote the People's Republic of China, but also attack adversaries in some circumstances, issuing death threats that successfully dissuaded some people from attending pro-democracy demonstrations. And then there's yet another example where the Justice Department has charged several people, including CNN has learned an Executive at Zoom for interrupting and disrupting calls, trying to be arranged by dissidents, including one meeting to discuss commemorating the massacre at Tiananmen Square. Now that Zoom Executive was previously charged, but in this latest round, they charge nine additional people.

It was so strong that I could hear the thoughts coming through those walls. It's just absolutely appalling and these people are trapped inside their homes. If they were to leave, there would be no way for them to get any kind of medical care. And we were able to speak to doctors on the ground in Sudan to give a picture of what it's like to be targeted for attempting to save lives. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELBAGIR (voice over): Sudan's military with a show of strength over the Capital Khartoum. As birdsong and artillery fire -- this country roiled in recent years by conflict and coups is once again the plaything of strongmen and what the military is calling an attempted coup. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Sudan's Military's leader is fighting for dominance with Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who leads the paramilitary rapid support forces, which gained notoriety in the Western Darfur region, and it is the most vulnerable who are paying --. Two doctor's organizations say that in Khartoum both sides have head hospitals in the fighting. At least half a dozen, though both sides denied CNN obtained eyewitness accounts from doctors on the ground, who told CNN that the paramilitary rapid support force directly targeted a hospital where wounded Armed Forces soldiers and their families were being treated, including one doctor who says she witnessed the RSF approach -- in hospital in Central Khartoum. ELBAGIR (voice over): I have to be strong enough to speak to you; you're the one that's going to tell the world what's happening to us. The evacuation was chaos. We were running a soldiers were shouting run and then someone else would yell stop it's not safe but what choice did we have? Three separate doctors that describe to us coming under intense bombardment the country's central committee of doctors tells CNN that with no doctors to tell them the dead and injured are left to rot in their beds. And the Sudan doctor's trade union called the targeting of hospitals and the housing of military personnel there. A clear breach of International Humanitarian Law, a charge both sides denied. Both military leaders now fighting for control were key allies in subverting the country's Nascent Democracy after the popular uprising in 2019, which deposed Sudan's longtime dictator, Omar Al-Bashir, who now languishes in prison. The memories of those protests and the symbolic photo that became its emblem, I slowly fading as has the promised transition from military to democratic civilian rule.",

And he's currently being held at Lefortovo complex in central Moscow, which is notorious holding facility. And that's what this appeal was about. It was about trying to get him out of Lefortovo.

Danny, -- they might eventually and yesterday on the show we were discussing, perhaps the prospect of a settlement preventing this trial from going ahead. It does look like it is now though.

That was always the big battle they were hoping to seek in this defamation case, but part of that has been $600 million dollars in lost contracts or lost profits. And the billion dollars was always for loss of reputational damage. Well, we were able to confirm over the weekend through court filings that dominion is actually dropping the argument that it lost $600 million due to lost profits and contracts. But they're still maintaining at this point that they are seeking $1.6 million in damages. So we're hopefully going to get a preview this today rather, I should say in opening statements as to how exactly they plan on justifying that if they're going to stick with the reputational damage claim basically, for that entire sum of money. But I should say, Fox, still says that all of that sum of money that dominion is proposing, that is inflated. They don't agree with, you know, even getting to a billion, let alone 1.6. So that's going to be one of the interesting parts of this case is that we hope to see unfold, not only today in opening statements that should happen after jury selection, which just began, as you said, a few moments ago. And of course, as this trial goes, remember, we should be expecting this trial to last maybe as long as six weeks. So there's plenty of time to get into the specifics of that damages. I should say, jury selection, of course this morning, so important because the jury will ultimately be responsible for determining if those damages of $1.6 billion is appropriate in this case, Julia?",

The Governor did lay out a number of concrete things he intends to do in the coming weeks to hurt Disney and get them to cave in this battle that has been going on for a year. He has threatening to pass a bill that would revoke the bill, the agreements that Disney has passed in recent weeks to try to protect its autonomy. He is suggesting that they might go after Disney's utilities in the area as well and potentially sell them off to other private companies.

As I stated, we're targeting 6 p.m. local this evening. We are very hopeful that in the city centers where there is conflict, there will be a ceasefire, this will be the first of hopefully several successful ceasefires that allow the civilian population to be very direct to get out of the way. Those windows of opportunity are very important; they have been successful in other conflict regions. And then if you're outside of those centers, where there's not a lot of fighting, you either can have the, if you have the mobility, if you will, you have to make that move early in this conflict, move to another area that's out of the fighting zone, go to family members and or coordinate with your employer to see what they're recommending, and to see if they can bring firms in like Global Guardian, or they're coordinating with government forces, as you described, German forces might be on call. I would tell you that bringing in a foreign military at this point will be a very difficult call for the Germans. And even if they do deploy, they're going to face the exact same infrastructure challenges and roadblocks that we have today. And frankly, this timing of this will be really, really important.",

When you look at the RSF, they're \"better trained\", but they don't have a logistical train or support. So, we've already seen at scale, the RSF, primarily, they had been going after institutions and hubs, whether its food, water, money, weapons assets, because they just don't have the logistical train behind them, if you will. So, when you look at the open-source reporting, we've already seen a Gibson advisors taken, we've seen an assault of a Japanese diplomat, the Kuwaiti Embassy has been approached. Diplomats from the U.S. the European Union and the Japanese have all been either assaulted or approached. And then of course, when you look at the forces on the ground from the U.N., typically these compounds the U.N. have set up are well funded, they have a lot of resources. And that's why the U.N. is going to be targeted primarily by the SAF, the RSF. But the Sudanese army at some point, if they become desperate, that also could be a target for them. So, this just we would expect more of this, especially the longer it goes. If this goes for months to years, then all of those assets are going to be targeted by both sides throughout the conflict.",

The tech giant which is the world's second biggest smartphone maker currently holds just 6 percent market share in India. Until now, it had been selling its products through third party sellers and through its online retail stores. Apple which is the world's most valuable company is looking to expand its operations and increase its retail share in India which is seen as an emerging market with huge potential. After recent supply chain snags in mainland China, which accounts for a bulk of iPhone manufacturing, Apple has been looking to expand its phone production operations here in India. The company has significantly increased its Indian exports; iPhone shipments grew 65 percent over the previous year. Apple store presence in India is a part of a larger trend that we are now seeing of companies diversifying their manufacturing away from China. According to Apple, the company's mobile apps, businesses supporting more than 1 million developer jobs in India.
