Officials say that air monitoring tests that were done throughout the evening showed that there were no toxic levels of this chemical in the air. So after that, the shelter in place order was lifted. But very intense moments inside that chemical plant where dozens of first responders descended there on the scene to handle the situation. This is what the mayor of Deer Park had to say late last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But for the 12 people who were trapped for at least six hours last night, this was a truly harrowing, terrifying ordeal. This was all after an elevator malfunction or an equipment malfunction left one person dead.By 8:00 p.m. yesterday evening, all of them were above ground. They were given pizza, that's what they ask for. They were safe and in good spirit, according to the sheriff. And as one official put it, this was basically a big, happy ending to an otherwise tragic day. All of these events began to unfold at around noon. That's when the sheriff perceived information about a mineshaft cage elevator. And you can sort of see that white structure behind me, that goes down 1,000 feet below ground. That was the mineshaft cage elevator. There's two groups in the mine. One of them was trapped inside that elevator, 500 feet below the surface. We know that the death occurred within that group which also included 11 people, two children. They were brought to the surface pretty much immediately for injuries. The dead body, the deceased person's body was also recovered in that group and brought up. No information on how the death exactly occurred, but officials did describe it as a, quote, \"tragic accident.\" We do know that the other group was stocked all the way at the bottom of 1,000 feet down. And just for some context, this is not an actively working mine. This is a historic mine. Tourists can, you know, take an hour long tour down there. They can see how, you know, mining worked in the gold rush and they have to take this two-minute right in this really tightly packed elevator to get down to the bottom. When they were stuck there, officials didn't know how they can get them up because they weren't sure that the elevator was safe. They thought they might have to use ropes. But just for context, 1,000 feet down. I mean, that is nearly the height of the Empire State Building. That is why it took so long to determine that the elevator was safe to pull them back up. Those folks didn't know that the death occurred until they got up to the surface. But the sheriff tearing up when he talked about the emotional impact for all of those after this experience. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

Good morning from the great state of Nevada. While some folks who aren't voting may have excuses, most of the black men that I talked to are really just looking for questions.

We have Vice President Kamala Harris, who is about fundamentally protecting our freedoms, our rights and our opportunities and Donald Trump who wants to take them away based on Project 2025. And so those are the choices. And people actually have the power to determine our future and it starts by voting early, and making sure that all of our friends are voting and that's why this \"Souls to the Polls\" initiative led by the Harris-Walz campaign is so important because we have to reach people where they are.

I was angry. I was confused. I felt helpless. And it was at that moment, I said, I need to do something to help them. How can I help them?
