And the international humanitarian law is clear. International humanitarian law forbids to take hostages, and I strongly, strongly appeal for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages by Hamas. And I've always been very clear on that.International humanitarian law says that human shields should not be used by parties and I strongly condemn the fact that Hamas uses human shields. But international humanitarian law also gives a primacy to the protection of civilians, and this is what is not ethnic. You mentioned the graveyard of children that I -- that expression that I used. Now as you probably know, every year I publish a report about children killed and maimed and used -- victims of conflict. And the countries that do it are listed. And this usually generates a polemic. Remember the past situations of Saudi Arabia, of Israel, of Russia, et cetera. Now, in the seven years I've been secretary-general, in the reports that have been presented, the maximum number of children killed during one year by any party to the conflict was about 600. Six hundred by the Taliban in one of the years. 600 by the Syrian government and their allies in another of the years. If you remember, the polemics about the uproar about the Saudi bombardments in Yemen. 600 people in one year. Now I'm not going to enter into this discussions about the accuracy of the numbers provided by the de facto authorities that exist this Gaza but it is clear that the number of children killed in a few weeks in Gaza is in the thousands. Now it is clear that the protection of civilians, that is paramount in international humanitarian law is not paramount in the strategy that is being applied by the military operations in Gaza.",

And then the second aspect, and it's not humanitarian law, is that you must guarantee (INAUDIBLE) access of humanitarian aid to all areas where the conflict is taking place.And what we have seen until now is a drop by drop in the increase of humanitarian aid. After today we have about 900 trucks in this 22 days. 930-something trucks. Before, in the past, there were 500 trucks every day supplying Gaza. You can imagine what this means. In addition to water, in addition to medicine, in addition to food. And fuel is not authorized. And that is why in many hospitals you have problems with incubators, you have problems with dialysis, you have lack of anesthesia, and many other things that transform the situation into an extremely horrendous situation for the people of Gaza.

The international community needs to come together to find a transition that is acceptable to Israel from the point of view of the guarantee of security of Israel. And I understand the concerns of security of the state of Israel. But at the same time, that allows for the transfer to an effective Palestinian Authority.How this transition is organized, it's our problem at the present moment. I think it will have to involve the whole of the international community, of course the countries of the region, the U.N., the U.S. But it is essential to make it happen. And it is essential to take profit of this situation to finally create the possibility of a two- state solution. I don't believe there is any other solution. What will be a one-state solution with such a large number of Palestinian people inside that state without any rights? That would be inconceivable. So the two-state solution is in my opinion the only way out. To build the two-state solution, Israel must understand that they have to accept it, which is not obvious at the present moment. But at the same time we need to create the conditions of a transition that gives Israel the guarantees that their security will not be put into question. Now the models of our CNDH (ph) is complex. We have not a solution here just in the pocket. But I am ready to put the U.N. at the service of the international community for what needs to be a multi- stakeholder involvement to allow for the best-case scenario to be possible because the worst-case scenario, we need to avoid at all cost. And the worst-case scenario will be Gaza to be transformed into a permanent nightmare, the two-state solution to be buried, and the peace in the Middle East to be lost forever.",

Right now, you have lotas of young voters who are much more likely than older voters to say be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause in this case but they are also the most likely to be checked out of the news and not paying as close attention. So, there is a lot of moving pieces here.I do think ultimately when it becomes a choice, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, even if you're someone who is say, not enthused with Joe Biden's policies on these issues, he will be very eager to point out, well, what do you think Donald Trump would do if he was president and try to draw that contrast in order to take voters who are unenthused now and make them enthused as the election approaches.",
