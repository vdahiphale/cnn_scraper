I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour in Selma, Alabama, where just moments ago President Biden arrived to mark the 58th Anniversary of the day known as Bloody Sunday. On this day in 1965l, six hundred people began a march from Selma to Montgomery, demanding an end to discrimination in voter registration. Marchers, including the late Congressman John Lewis, were beaten by White State Troopers as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, an event that sparked outrage and helped rally support for the Voting Rights Act. CNN's Arlette Saenz is in Selma for today's event. Arlette, the President is expected to give his speech. Set the stage for us right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, President Biden's speech here in Selma on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday really has two purposes.First off, the White House says that he wants to ensure that the memory of what happened on that day 58 years ago is not erased from American history. And secondly, the President is expected to use his speech here to once again make the case for voting rights. Of course, that brutal and historic day here in Selma, Alabama, really served as a significant moment in the Civil Rights Movement and also led to the signing of the Voting Rights Act. And what the President has repeatedly tried to do throughout his administration is stress and try to put the spotlight on new voting rights legislation. Of course, that was a hallmark of his 2020 presidential campaign promising that he would get some type of voting rights legislation passed up on Capitol Hill. But so far, those efforts have simply floundered. They were unable to get two pieces of legislation, one named after the late Congressman John Lewis, they were unable to get those pieces of legislation passed when Democrats controlled both chambers. And now, it's an increasingly a more uphill climb as Republicans have control of the House. Now, a short while ago, we had the chance to catch up with Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a key powerful Biden ally, and he essentially said we are on a road, and we just have to keep rolling, that they will keep working to try to get Voting Rights legislation passed. But he was also very cognizant of the hurdles that remain up on Capitol Hill, particularly when it comes to the filibuster, that 60- vote threshold that would need to be cleared in order to get anything passed in the Senate, and now that GOP control of the House. Now, the President will once again try to make his case here at a time when many activists have become frustrated with the inability to get voting rights legislation across the finish line. I will also note that in addition to this Voting Rights push coming from the President here today, it will also serve as his first visit here to Selma after those tornadoes devastated the city and neighborhoods nearby. As we drove through the city today, we saw much of that devastation that impacted homes and buildings, the President might have an opportunity to see some of that as he is driving here to this site today, but in just a short while we are expecting the President to once again make his push for Voting Rights at a time when many activist wants to see the White House doing more.",

People didn't know that he was coming here that day, and he had taken his car to the top of that bridge, gotten out and said that people needed to keep fighting for Voting Rights.

And of course, we'll monitor those comments if not able to, of course, take them live.All right, turning now to another Norfolk Southern freight train derailment in Ohio, this one near Springfield. That's about 200 miles away from East Palestine, the site of the company's fiery train derailment and toxic spill one month ago. Twenty cars came off the track early Saturday evening. Nearby residents were temporarily asked to shelter out of an abundance of caution. That order was lifted earlier today. Norfolk Southern officials say there were no hazardous materials on board. Hazmat teams from the EPA and Clark County, each independently examining the site to confirm that. CNN's Polo Sandoval is following the latest developments. And polo, of course, people there and everywhere are wondering how can this be, yet, another train derailment involving the same company, same State, and really very similar worries even though we're told now no hazardous materials. So people have to, you know, wonder what is going on with the tracks there and with this company?",

This accident also happened in an area that does not have a protective water source, so that is putting some concerns to bed. Also, when you look at this aftermath, it really is quite incredible. About 20 of 212 train cars derailed, four tankers that you may be able to make out there in the lower portion of your screen, were identified. They were transporting what the Fire Chief described as common industrial solutions. Two of them carried residual amounts of diesel exhaust fluid, while the other two contains a water soluble solution and no evidence of any leaks. But this kind of gives you a breakdown of what authorities took a very close look at and this was authorities from three separate entities. There was the local hazmat team, you also have the EPA, not to mention the Norfolk Southern company that owns this train, all of them independently were able to confirm that this is not any sort of public health threat. But still, it is certainly going to be quite the aftermath that has to be cleaned up there. In terms of the why, Fred, that's still a question that is yet to be answered regarding what took place here in Springfield, Ohio yesterday. And this also happens just a couple of weeks after the preliminary report was released by the National Transportation Safety Board when it comes to the East Palestine, the nonrelated East Palestine accident when the head of that agency admitted that more needs to be done by the rail industry to try to keep some of these derailments from happening again.

So it's essentially one wave after the next. That's why you have so many of these areas under winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings not just for the West Coast States, but also spreading into the High Plains and eventually into the Midwest.In addition to the snow, we also have wind as a pretty big component here. Wind advisories with gusts up around 65 miles per hour, the high wind warnings that could make it as high as 80 miles per hour. Now, a little further east where you don't have the moisture with it, but just the strong winds and very dry conditions, there, there is going to be some fire concern as well, at least in the short term. When we take a look at least for today, the main focus for the heavy snow and rain is going to be across Oregon and California. But by Monday, we really start to see that spread out into the Intermountain West and eventually in towards the Midwest once we get later into the week. Overall, most of these areas, you're talking up to about a half a foot total of snow, the highest amounts are really going to be across the Sierras in California where we could be measuring one, two, even three feet of snow over the next several days. Rainfall along the coast, likely looking at one to two inches, but remember, this is on top of what they've already had. Now, part of that is good news. When we look at the Drought Monitor, significant improvements for a lot of these Western States, but specifically in California, when you look back just a few weeks ago, December 27th, two months ago, look at how much of this area was in red in that deep red color. Now you fast forward to what the current drought monitor looks like. We've not only eliminated both the exceptional and the extreme drought, but the severe drought has gone from over 80 percent down to just about a quarter of the State. So we've made huge improvements, especially in the case of the reservoirs, Fred.

Officials with the NYPD say it began burning shortly before 11 this morning and officials are giving an update right now. The cause is believed to be from a lithium battery that was in an e- bike. We'll bring you more details as they come. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he plans to have private conversations with the White House after President Biden surprised Democratic senators last week by saying he would not veto a Republican-led effort to rescind a controversial DC crime bill. The decision leaving many Democrats angry and divided. A Senate vote to scrap the DC law is expected this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Depending on what the Senate does, the President will have to respond one way or the other. I haven't had an opportunity to talk to the White House yet about the President's views. So I'm not going to characterize his position one way or the other until we've had a chance to talk about that issue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The President now supporting a move by Republicans in Congress to rescind a controversial new DC crime law. A law that would take measures like lowering the penalties for carjackings. Just last month, the President was in favor of that DC law, his administration saying: \"Congress should respect the District of Columbia's autonomy to govern its own local affairs.\" So why did the President just change his mind?",

TODD (on camera): One big complaint from the Democratic side about the President's decision to support rescinding that DC crime law is coming from House Democrats who had already voted in favor of the DC law. Now, some of them are complaining that there wasn't adequate communication from the White House over all of this and that they're now going to be subjected to fresh Republican attacks that they're soft on crime and to the left of President Biden on the issue.
