The judge saying he didn't believe what Trump told him under oath, this as at least six were Trump co -defendants in the Georgia election subversion case have talked with prosecutors about a potential plea deal. Stand by for details on CNN's exclusive new reporting.Also breaking, the U.S. House of Representatives has a new speaker at last. Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson managing to pull a splinter party together to win the job breaking a three-week deadlock. But how will he meet the huge challenges ahead? And as new rocket fire from Gaza hits an apartment building near Tel Aviv, Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issues a new warning that all Hamas terrorists are, and I'm quoting him now, dead men walking. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in the Situation Room. We're following two major breaking stories here in the United States. In New York, Donald Trump takes the stand, the stand at his civil fraud trial as the judge hits him with a $10,000 fine for violating his gag order again. And here in Washington, Republicans finally put an end to weeks of chaos, electing Congressman Mike Johnson as the new speaker of the House. We will get to all the drama on Capitol Hill in just a moment. But, first, let's go to New York where CNN's Brynn Gingras is standing by outside the courthouse. Brynn, this is another major rebuke of Trump. How did all this unfold?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't get a jury. This was a trial should have never been brought, but if we had a jury, it would have been fair, at least even if it was a somewhat negative jury, because no negative jury would vote against me. But this judge will, because this judge is a very partisan judge, with a person who's very partisan sitting alongside him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is. So, we are doing very well. The facts are speaking very loud. He's a totally discredited witness. And you haven't seen anything yet. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Once we got back from the lunch break today at the civil trial, the judge made Trump take the stand, and under oath he asked him, who was he talking about when he said the person next to him was very partisan. Trump said he was a very partisan judge. And he was talking about Michael Cohen. When he left the witness box, the judge basically said, I don't believe you, and put in place that $10,000 fine. Now, this was argued by Trump's attorneys, but the ruling still stood. Let me tell you why the judge put this fine in place. He says, I am very protective of my staff, as I believe I should be. I don't want anyone killed. And he said the ruling stands, even though there was an argument from the defense team, don't do it again, or it will be worse. Wolf?",

Those four people all agreed to cooperate. That includes some top lawyers. And with those initial plea deals, Sidney Powell's, Jenna Ellis', Scott Hall's, and Ken Cheseboro's, the dominoes then start to fall. And so prosecutors go reach out to others, these six others, at least six other co-defendants, to see if they want to take deals. Those are people like a campaign official, another pro-Trump lawyer. And so we're going to wait and see what happens with them. And when you're looking at these, the prosecutors, as they're trying to get people to plead guilty and take deals, it's good for them because it helps them focus their case against Trump. The more defendants they can pick off from going to trial, they can get these cooperators, get more information. And the defendants, you don't want to be last in line standing. You don't want to be the last one standing going to trial because you can get a deal that means no jail time. You can get a lot of benefits out of taking a plea deal if you choose to do it early. And so right now, that's where we stand in this case. But we do know from our team of reporters that there are four people right now who haven't been offered plea deals in this case that are on the table from Fulton County, Georgia. Those are some of the biggest names in this case, Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, and, of course, Donald Trump himself.

Cohen was sitting a distance away and below the judge. That was clearly a reference to the judge's clerk, and the judge found that Trump was not credible. This is going to be a continuing problem.

There could always be the penalty of having your bail revoked, meaning you could be put on house arrest or put in jail. Now, that doesn't seem to be something that's been on the table in this case. This case is about holding Trump accountable on the money side of things, but at the same time, as both the other panelists mentioned here, there are other debates over gag orders, specifically, there's a judge in Washington, D.C., a federal judge looking at a gag order has already imposed it on Donald Trump, has it on hold right now, and the debate is ongoing. We're waiting to hear if the Justice Department, even today, wants to flag what has happened in court in New York to that judge in Washington, D.C. And so each of these cases, all of the judges are watching what is happening with Donald Trump on a day-to-day basis, what he's saying publicly, and determining how they should respond.",

Fani Willis is masterfully working her way, as we say, up the food chain to the big fish.

These plea deals are really, really bad news, legal news for him.Joey, of the remaining co-defendants in Georgia who have yet to take a plea deal, whose testimony do you think could potentially be the most damaging to Trump? JACKSON: Yes. I think, Wolf, if I have to put that on the people who did, right? And that is, if you're the attorneys for Donald Trump that are spinning the narrative, we've seen a plea of guilty, right, by Sidney Powell as it relates to breaking into the systems to determine whether there's fraud. None was determined to exist. You see the issue of Cheseboro as it relates to the fact fraudulent elector scheme, that's compelling. And then, of course, we saw Jenna Ellis. Why do I raise them? No, they're not remaining, but those are the attorneys, right? And those attorneys are people who were propagating a narrative. Remember at the outset, this is about RICO, Racketeering Influence Corruptor Organization Act. And so to establish that, not that that's what they pled guilty to, but you're talking about an enterprise, and that enterprise existing for the purposes of sustaining power. So, I think prosecutors have a compelling case with them. And I think if the other parties don't get on board with regard to a plea deal, of course, the consequences elevate and those consequences could mean, unlike these three, jail.

They're seeing all sorts of health problems associated with that, including a spike in preeclampsia in pregnant women.And as you mentioned, the U.N. -- the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which is the agency inside of Gaza, is saying that, basically, they will not be able to carry out their full services if they don't get fuel tonight or tomorrow. Now, yesterday, they had said that they would be forced to suspend their operations tonight. So, it appears that there's a little more fuel in order to give them that extra bit of wiggle room. But everyone we have spoken to, from humanitarian organizations to ordinary civilians on the ground, is saying that this really is at a crisis point now, not to mention the fact that ordinary aid is not getting in. Last night just eight trucks, nothing today. So, fuel is the primary consideration, but, still, food, water, medical equipment, and all of this taking place against the backdrop of the heaviest, most intense and most punishing bombardment that Gaza has ever seen, Wolf.",

It's become constant all night for and most of the day. My son was not able to sleep, Yousef. We've been trying to soothe him as much as possible and keep him shielded from the wrath of the war. Unfortunately, yesterday, we ran out of milk for him. We opened the last box and basically tonight, we will be completely out. It would be his first night ever in his entire life to go to sleep without having milk. All it takes is one missile, one airstrike to miss its target or be too close to where you are, and that has happened before where we are staying. And that would be it. We're trying to stay strong, but we cannot help but feel hopeless and abandoned given it's been 18 days and yet no concrete help from the State Department to get us out of Gaza. We are staying in Rafah, about ten minutes away from the borders with Egypt. This way we are prepared for initial notice by the State Department to head towards Rafah crossing where we can cross to Egypt and exit Gaza. We are hopeful that we'll live another day to see that happen. (END AUDIO CLIP)",
