Jean Carroll. His testimony stricken from the record more than once when his answer veered from the original question. The judge also admonishing Trump for saying, quote, I never met the woman. I do not know who this woman is. It's important to note here, Trump has already been found liable of sexually abusing Carroll and defamation. This trial is to determine how much he must pay now, in damages. It's a case that has long consumed Trump. According to his former White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, who wrote about Carroll's initial allegations in her book, writing, quote, Trump was doing his usual routine when accused of misconduct. She's a liar. She's grossed. Do you think I'd be with that? And on and on, mostly attacking her physical appearance rather than the -- I would never do that to my wife line. You're going to hear more from Grisham in just a moment. But first, Paula Reid is OUTFRONT live outside the New York courthouse while at Trump already posting on social media after this court appearance. What's he saying? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Erica. Well, shortly after the court, Trump took to Truth Social to say he would rather be campaigning that in court. Erica, there's nothing stopping him from campaigning. He is not required to attend this case. In fact, he did not attend a single minute of the trial in the spring when the allegations at the center of this case, allegations of rape or litigated. But now, in the 2024 campaign season, he has attended much of this trial using the media attention to try to frame himself as the victim. Former President Donald Trump brought his 2024 campaign to a New York courtroom today, briefly, taking the stand in the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial against him. After days of speculation about whether he would take the stand, Trump answered questions from lawyers for about three minutes. Judge Lewis Kaplan and Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, spent more time discussing what Trump would be allowed to say, then he spent on the stand. Habba said she would only he asked her client three questions. And after Trump was sworn in, they largely stuck to that plan. Habba asked, do you stand by your testimony in the deposition, Trump replied: 100 percent, yes. Then she asked: Did you deny the allegation because Ms. Carroll made an accusation? Trump responded: That's exactly right. Yes, I did. She said something that I considered all false accusation, totally false. But the judge kept strictly to the plan, cut Trump off, saying everything after \"yes, I did\" is stricken, which means the jury cannot consider it. Habba's final question was, did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Ms. Carroll in your statements. Trump said, no, I just wanted to defend myself. My family, and frankly, the presidency. Then Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, was allowed to cross-examine Trump. She asked: Is this the first trial with Carroll that he has attended? Trump replied, yes. Her question, a reference to the fact that Trump never attended the spring 2023 trial where a jury considered Carroll's claim that Trump raped her in a department store in the 1990s. The jury found him liable for sexual abuse. The current trial deals with 2019 statements Trump made about Carroll after she wrote her story in \"New York Magazine\". She is seeking $10 million in damages and candidate Trump has attended much of these proceedings.",

One thing that really I thought was interesting is that, you know, it's been reported when he walked out are off the stand.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  A U.S. provided Bradley infantry fighting vehicle almost single-handedly stopping a Russian assault near Avdiivka in southeastern Ukraine, pelting the Russians with tracer rounds from its powerful 25 millimeter gun. Vladimir Putin's troops pin down, unable to advance. This is just one element of Ukraine's efforts to hold Avdiivka run from underground command centers in secret locations. The Ukrainians have given us access to their command and bunker for this part of the frontline. From here, they organize part of the defense of Avdiivka. It's rarely calm here, they say. The Russians assaulting nearly all the time. A Russian tank with a small group of troops shows up that Ukrainians track their movements. And these two soldiers, probably from an already decimated unit, cowering in a trench, aware the Ukrainians have spotted them. They hit the Russians with a kamikaze drone but they survive for now. The commander tells me Russian losses here are staggering. They use a lot of equipment, we destroy a lot of equipment, he says, a lot of infantry assaults. They expand people, they step over each other, don't provide assistance. It's true. There's a lot of infantry equipment and meat assaults. From the many drones monitoring the battlefield, we see the bodies of dead Russian soldiers frozen amidst their destroyed vehicles. The command post also directs artillery and rocket strikes and even counter-assault with ground forces to clear trenches and stop the seemingly endless waves of Russian infantry attacks. Fortunately, they have a lot of losses, he says. Yet they do not stop, but Avdiivka will be ours. They will not succeed. But Ukraine's American provided guns could go mostly silent soon if Congress doesn't end its impasse and pass additional military aid, President Biden says.",
