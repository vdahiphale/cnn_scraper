It appears unless she picks up her momentum here, it's unlikely these charges will go before a jury before 2024. So if that's the case, can Trump make this all go away if he can delay it long enough if he wins? MOOREOr, as we talked about some during his last term, whether he could actually self-pardon himself or prospectively pardon himself for any conviction that might come about, since it's a federal court. This is different than in a state court. He has no authority to issue a pardon or to control a prosecution by a state prosecutor. In the federal system, prosecutors effectively work under the president of the United States. And so that's a possibility if, in fact, he were to win the election.",

There had been a video of her taken out of a Jeep in Gaza previously, and her pants bloodied. And thus, the focus on really that concern and that war crime began, after that video. She is in this video, as well as five other, four other IDF spotters, these young females who were captured in their camp there at the military base and then went into a bomb shelter. I spoke with Naama's mother, who told me they and the other parents had seen this video, had had it and knew about it for a few weeks. They were very, very confused about whether they should come forward with it or not.

And that's what they're trying to do. The Norwegian prime minister said, look, a two-state solution is required. There needs to be a Palestinian state, an Israeli state. That's the only way, he said, to have peace in the Middle East. So you have to, he said, therefore declare a Palestinian state so you can, therefore, get to a peace situation. But, you know, the Irish prime minister framed it this way. He said he knew that there would be pushback on this, but he thought it was important from Irish history, you know, getting independence from the British 100 years ago, for there to be independence for the Palestinians. So they've all come at it from different angles, but they really have timed it together to try to shift the dial on getting a change in what's happening in Gaza because they're frustrated about all the civilian deaths and humanitarian suffering there.",

But as you said, this is really a string of the latest accusations against Diddy. And, of course, this comes after that violent video that we released here at CNN of him beating Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel. So he came out and he had an apology video after that video came out.

Allegations of this nature have been swirling around Sean Combs for decades. A very similar in ways that we saw with respect to R. Kelly. Unfortunately, many people in the inner circle of people like Sean Combs are aware of the violence and the predatory conduct that he has engaged in. And when Cassie Ventura filed that lawsuit at the end of last year, that just gave a voice to so many other victims to come forward and to tell their stories. I don't think the lawsuit that was just filed by the former model is going to be the last lawsuit that we will see where someone comes forth.
