How a civil case involving Gaetz could offer some new insights.Plus, throwing oil on fire, that's a quote from the Kremlin, responding to President Biden's decision to let Ukraine use long-range American made missiles against Russia. And, oh, how the mighty have fallen, the Kansas City Chiefs undefeated no more. Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. All right, some breaking news into CNN just a few moments ago, we've learned that the House Ethics Committee will meet on Wednesday. This comes as pressure is building for them to release their findings on President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, and we're getting a fresh look at some of the evidence in the hands of House Ethics investigators. That evidence stems from some salacious allegations against now former congressman as part of a Florida civil court battle. And CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is with me now. Paula, what more do we know about this case?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, this is a case that was brought by an associate of Gates and this associate sued their friend, a former friend, Joel Greenberg, and also the underage victim at the center of the criminal investigation against the former congressman. And as part of filing this lawsuit, they opened the door for discovery. So, there are depositions and additional evidence and they created this whole record.Well, the former Congressman is not a party of this lawsuit. Not surprisingly, his name comes up a lot. Now, they did take the depositions of several women involved in this case. They also collected some affidavits. The deposition of the underage victim is under seal, but the lawyers in the case, when they deposed Geatz's associate, they quoted some parts of her depositions and her way to get her story into the public record. For example, the attorneys recounted how the underage girl had testified to having sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table. They also introduced the fact that a friend of the underage woman who brought her to the party testified that she too had Gaetz -- had sex with Gaetz at the same gathering. Of course, having sex with multiple people at a party is not a crime, but the former congressman was under federal investigation for, in part, allegations of possibly having sex with someone who is under 18, questions about obstruction of justice. He was never charged, and the former congressman has always denied wrongdoing. But the reason the civil is because it's believed that the House Ethics Committee has a lot of the evidence that was gathered in this civil litigation. They've talked to many of the same people. So, it gives you a flavor. Of the kind of evidence that they've gathered in their investigation and what could be in that report.",

The House Ethics Committee is expected to meet on Wednesday, as this committee is weighing whether to release this final report on Matt Gaetz. I suppose we don't know exactly whether or not that is what they're going to tackle at this meeting, but we saw over the weekend is that there is some mounting pressure to have this information come out, including from some Republican senators.

I will tell you that the House Ethics Committee, I've broken more stories than anybody on this ethics investigation, it doesn't leak. They're not terribly cooperative. There are certain some people, perhaps a former House speaker who may have an incentive, right, to want to leak this, to damage the former congressman, but there were also legitimate request for this information as they weigh his nomination as attorney general.I will also say in this civil litigation, those depositions that are under seal, there have been moves to try to unseal those. So, that is another way that additional evidence that the Ethics Committee has could come to light even if the Ethics Committee does not release its report.",

And I think I've said publicly that I thought those were irresponsible statements and a wrongheaded approach.If you've got concerns about what's going on at the Department of Justice and you want to reform it, target your efforts towards that. But totally abolishing the Department Justice, A, is impossible, B, doesn't make any sense. They provide critical legal representation for the United States in civil cases, criminal cases, spy cases, national security matters. Eliminating 110,000 employees who do, I think, pretty much outstanding work across the board would be the wrong way to a terrible disservice to the American people.",

You know, as far as I know, I don't think he has any prosecutorial experience at all, much less at the Department of Justice. So, you're talking about someone taking over, you know, one of the most important agencies in the United States of America, becoming the chief law enforcement officer for the United States at a very critical time.You know, during the campaign, there were a lot of concerns expressed about the border and immigration issues. The Department of Justice would play a key role there. The Republicans complained a lot about the FBI and called for the need for reform. Certainly, the attorney general should play a key role there. But it helps to, you know, have the experience to do that. I mean, if you got a car that's broken down, I think you want to have a mechanic who knows how to fix the car as opposed to someone who's never even seen one before. So, you know, if they want to find somebody who can do the type of reform that they have in mind, there are a lot of Republicans out there who've worked at the Department of Justice or currently at the Department of Justice or just have, you know, experience going up against the Department of Justice. They probably have the type of experience that would be better suited for this role.",

And it appears that they are going to join forces in order to attack the Ukrainians in that Kursk area that Ukraine went into in August. And this is very concerning. It's concerning to the United States and to its European allies. So, that's one factor I think that at least the administration says is very important.And then also, the administration is looking at really these, you know, barbarous attacks right now by Russia on Ukraine. Pretty obvious that Moscow is intent on just attacking and destroying literally the energy structure, heating, et cetera, especially as we go into winter, Jim.",

Because the writing seems to be on the wall, if you look at what incoming President Trump is saying, that there will be pressure to come to some type of agreement.Now, it could be, you know, peace agreement, freezing lines, whatever it is. Each side needs to grab and hold as much territory as possible. So, I think that's also part of the administration, the Biden administration's calculus here to help Ukraine pull out all the stops, do what you can in these two months that are left.

Putin over here, by the way, saying that giving the green light to use those ATACMS on the territory of Russia is a red line. And, essentially, and I think that we should pay attention to this, essentially what he's saying is, okay, this means that the United States is part of the war. Therefore we can do something to the United States, retaliate. Now, they're not going to probably start a big war, obviously, but they can do things like, you know, arm the Houthis. Remember that group that is -- the terrorist group that's carrying out attacks in the Red Sea? So, this is a really fraught situation right now. The timing is incredible.",

However, the scratches don't stand alone. Any case, you have to evaluate it in the context of other evidence. And what is that other evidence? We know that his DNA is under the fingernails of Laken Riley. Well, how did it get there? And now you see that there are scratches on him. Now we know specifically how.You look at it in the context of the actual smart phone data, which showed Lincoln Riley running and then, of course, her stopping in the trail, according to that watch data, her being pulled into several minutes later, the woods, according to that data, her roommates, Laken Riley's roommates, alerting authorities after going to the trail and seeing her ear bud there. And then you have the jacket that he's wearing. He's seen on a really surveillance video, discarding the jacket, that jacket, having blood and hair fibers of Laken Riley as well. And you hear on the smart phone back to the scene itself some words in Spanish. He happens to be Spanish speaking. And so all in all, the reaction is that, wow, it seems to be very compelling evidence. Everyone, Jim, of course, deserves the presumption of innocence. You're not guilty until that's established beyond a reasonable doubt.
