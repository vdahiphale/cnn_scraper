Tonight, Brazil's justice minister saysthe attacks on major government buildings were carried out by, quote, \"mad men and public agents as well\". We are live for you on the ground as the fallout from the attack continues. Then leaders from the U.S., Canada and Mexico are meeting this hour, of course, migration is top of the agenda. We are live for you in Mexico City. Plus, fierce fighting in the east of Ukraine as Russia sets its sights on the town of Soledar. We'll explain why it's so significant on the battlefield. Brazil's Justice Minister says the attack on democracy was not only carried out by mad men, but also by public agents as well, either by action or by a mission. He's adding to growing questions today about how federal authorities failed to stop mobs from storming the seat of power in Brasilia. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva suggests that some security forces were indeed complicit with the rioters. He met with Brazil's governors in a show of solidarity against what he called an attempted coup. Supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro attacked the presidential palace, they attacked congress and the Supreme Court, demanding that Mr. Lula da Silva be overthrown from power. The president said they made no attempt to hide their intentions before the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT, BRAZIL (through translator):  I couldn't believe it, that's why I was forced to talk to my justice minister, to take a strong attitude. Because the police in Brasilia neglected it. Brasilia's intelligence neglected it. There is an explicit connivance of police with the demonstrators, even here inside the palace. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the governor has been suspended for 90 days, even though he quickly -- he quickly fired the secretary of security as the -- as the riots were unfolding. And remember, the secretary of security at the time was in Bolsonaro's former justice ministry. So, there's a lot of finger-pointing going on. But certainly, right now, it is focused on the Brasilia authorities. Lula himself criticized police and Intelligence in Brasilia, saying that they've not only failed to recognize what everybody else in Brazil was recognizing, which is there is some protest coming. But once these thousands of activists started marching in Brasilia, they failed to stop them, and in some cases, it appears they even encouraged and enabled them. So, we will certainly get more as these investigations go deeper. But it has enraged the nation, right here on Avenida Paulista. This was one of many sites across the country where Brazilians poured out onto the streets last night to not only show their support for President Lula and his democratic election, but also to denounce the riots, and what they say was an assault on democracy itself. Take a listen to what one demonstrator said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NETO DUARTE, PRO-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATOR (through translator):  Totally absurd, it's the worst moment in our history after the 1964 dictatorship. I think everyone was appalled by the images we saw in the national congress. So, I think the response is this, it was well done occupying the Paulista Avenue, the fight now is to support the government that was democratically elected. And we are not going to leave the streets, that is the message. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But these are governors from many different parties. The same in congress, he doesn't have as big a showing in congress as he did in his previous government. It's a very splintered political system.

So, I mean, there's a majority of Brazil, clear majority of Brazil that never saw delayed months. As it is now condemning what happened and is united for democracy.

All right, leaders from the U.S., Canada and Mexico are preparing for talks this hour, and migration is set to be top of the agenda. It's understood that the Biden administration is working on a round of new measures to curb crossings at the U.S. southern border. It comes as Biden is facing mounting pressure back home after classified documents dating back to his time as vice president were actually found in his private office. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is standing by for us in Mexico City. Just in terms of the focus of the summit being on, partly on migration and the crisis at the U.S. southern border, just explain to us what sort of cooperation Biden is expecting to get, I should say hoping to get from the Mexican president to combat the crisis.",

And the measures that they're rolling out are a reflection of that. They are planning to announce, for example, a virtual portal for migrants who are in the region to apply for legal pathways to either the United States, Canada or Mexico. Serving, for example, as a sort of one-stop shop, then two, there is the physical center in southern Mexico that they want to put up. And that would be in Tapachula, that's a transit location where many migrants pass, where they would also have services available to them and learn about legal pathways. Now, of course, all of this really depends on whether they serve as viable options for migrants who, as we know, are desperately leaving poor conditions in their native countries. And so, the question is, whether these types of measures can meet their immediate needs. And a senior administration official I spoke to said, it's an experiment, that they expect that these discussions with Canada and Mexico, they can come to agreement on how to work on this issue together, because as you mentioned, it is a political liability for President Biden back at home. Now, of course, this is one of many issues that they're going to touch on, they're also expected to talk about economic development, climate change and trade. We heard briefly earlier from President Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who really talked about strengthening their relationship and building on it. We anticipate those same discussions are happening now at the national palace behind me, and we'll hear from the three leaders later today.",

Obviously, there's still an investigation into Donald Trump and his handling of classified materials. Of course, the volume is vastly different, where there were, you know, hundreds of documents, classified documents that were found in the former president's home in Mar-a-Lago and as opposed to what we're talking about here. Sources are telling us, there is about ten documents we're talking about, and they range from 2013 to 2016, during the time that Joe Biden would have been vice president. And they dealt with, you know, basically Intelligence memos and briefing documents that were prepared for the then vice president, you know, dealing with things like the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Iran. So, these were the things that are the subject of this review that is ongoing from the Justice Department. As you pointed out, the U.S. attorney in Chicago who has been doing this investigation has at least completed the preliminary work on this. And now, the Attorney General, Merrick Garland has to decide whether -- what next steps to take, right? And if we follow the format that we saw in the Donald Trump case, it means that they're most likely are going to have to do a full investigation. They're going to have to interview who may -- anyone who may have been in this -- in this office, and who may have had access to these -- this room where these documents were being stored. So, those are the tricky questions that are lying ahead for the Justice Department and the FBI as they try to make sure that they're handling this in the same way that they handled the Trump investigation.",

And then, they do a routine thing, which is a damage assessment to make sure that anyone who may have been in a position to have access to them could have maybe done harm to national security as a result of that. So, we don't know exactly the details of what were in these documents. Just those are the themes that we know were being discussed. But Zain, one of the things that we know is that Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, is under investigation separately for his businesses in Ukraine. So, one of the first questions, of course, that comes up is, you know, was this having to do anything with regard to Hunter Biden? Those are questions that of course, the White House is going to have to face, I think, you know, Priscilla is there with President Biden in Mexico City. We expect that he's going to answer questions in the coming hours. And I bet you, those are among the questions that are foremost on the minds of people who are going to be questioning him.",

The Ukrainian military, not long ago, said that they are in control of the situation, though they acknowledge that the fighting there is extremely fierce. They also did not rule out the possibility of withdrawing troops or having them retreat in the interest of keeping those soldiers alive to live to fight another day. The head of the Wagner Mercenary Group acknowledged that his forces are doing the bulk of the fighting there, and he says that Soledar is particularly, strategically important in part because of the salt mine there, which he says makes an ideal place to hide troops or to store weaponry. It is also strategically important, potentially, for the Russians, because if they were able to capture Soledar, it would allow them to then attack Bakhmut from a different direction, from the north, since they have had no luck so far capturing it from the east.

And they will also come down, again, reducing a climate effect. We will avoid about 0.3 to 0.5 degrees Celsius change. So in equivalent to Fahrenheit, about 0.6 to 1 degree global warming by the year 2100, because we've controlled the hydrofluorocarbons in addition to the CFCs. So both of these are very positive.

For the big storythis year, it is not the movies, it's actually the awards themselves. Allegations of racism and other ethical questions about the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which hands out the Globes, severely diminished the stature of these awards in recent years. Last year's Globes were not actually even broadcast on TV. And many stars chose not to attend the ceremony. This year, the show is back on, though it is being held on a Tuesday, not its traditional high-profile spot of Sunday night. Let's bring in Stephanie Elam, joining us live now from Los Angeles. You know, Stephanie, when people accuse your association of corruption and racism, it is pretty hard to shake that off. I mean, adjectives like \"prejudiced,\" \"racist,\" \"corrupt\" have a way of sort of sticking with you. When it comes to the awards tonight, they were usually held in the past on Sundays. Now they're going to be held at a low profile spot of a Tuesday night. Are people actually going to watch this time?",
