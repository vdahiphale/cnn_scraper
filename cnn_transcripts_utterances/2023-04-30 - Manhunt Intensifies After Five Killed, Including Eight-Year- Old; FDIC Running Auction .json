Thank you so much for joining me, I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Armed and dangerous, that's how police in Texas are describing the suspect in a horrific mass shooting. 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza has not been seen since Friday night's attack in Cleveland, Texas. Investigators say he opened fire on his neighbors when they asked him to stop shooting his rifle outside so that their baby could sleep. Five people were killed, including an 8-year-old. Authorities are expected to give an update on the manhunt at any moment. CNN's Ed Lavandera is there in Cleveland, Texas. He's joining us now on the phone. So, Ed, what has been said thus far? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Well, the last we had heard from law enforcement investigators is that the trail for 32-year-old Francisco Oropeza has gone cold on Saturday. However, investigators are -- just moments away at some point here in the next few minutes scheduled to hold a briefing with reporters covering the story for an update. We don't know exactly what they plan on saying or exactly the nature of what this update will entail. But the search in the manhunt has continued well overnight and into this Sunday afternoon as well. All of this stemming from the deadly shooting that took place Friday night just outside of the town of Cleveland, Texas, which is about an hour's drive northeast of the Houston area. And that's where investigators say Oropeza was upset with his neighbors who had asked him to stop firing his firearms on Friday night because one of their babies was trying to sleep in their home. And it was after that confrontation, if you want to call it that, that investigators say Oropeza walked over to that neighbor's house. There were 10 people inside. And he started shooting people, killing five in all. And there were five other people, including several small children who survived the attack. But Oropeza left the scene and then that manhunt has continued since that Friday night shooting. Investigators say they are continuing to search, and that search has continued since Friday night. This is the sheriff here in San Jacinto County who spoke with reporters yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just a few minutes ago final bids were due in the auction that is being held for First Republic by the FDIC.Now, no word yet on whether or not any big banks have bid enough to satisfy regulators. But we should find out pretty soon. In the past we've seen that U.S. officials have tried to come up with solutions during the middle of a bank crisis before global markets open. And the clock is ticking. Markets open in Tokyo in less than two hours. Now, First Republic has been teetering really for weeks. This bank's stock price is down by 97 percent since the bank crisis began in March. March 1, it was trading at $122. And look at that. It's now below $4. And for some context, this is not some tiny bank. It held $233 billion in assets as of the end of March. That means if the FDIC did step in here, this would be the second biggest bank failure in American history. Now, First Republic really had been the envy of the bank industry for a long time because it caters to rich clients. The problem, though, is that the Silicon Valley Bank implosion last month, that made a lot of uninsured depositors, those above $250,000 that made them nervous. And First Republic disclosed just how nervous last week. The bank said that a stunning 41 percent of its deposits left the bank during the first quarter alone. That equated to a loss of $72 billion in deposits. Fredricka, now we wait to see if the FDIC will decide to take control of First Republic or if another big bank will come to the rescue.",

They could potentially not bid enough.But I have a felling, if you think about it from the FDIC perspective and the government's perspective, you know, that is the best-case scenario to make sure that there (INAUDIBLE) to make sure somebody gets it because at the end of the day, if the FDIC picked it over, the government is involved, it's more of a loss. So you kind of -- you know, it's kind of a negotiation this aspect. Obviously the bids are in. But I would have a feeling, when you're on banking side who were making some of these bids, there are bids that are kind of really extreme, they're saying, well, what if they take it?

Ukraine has, it's clear, been doing precision strikes on parts of Russian infrastructure in occupied areas particularly in the Kherson area along the Dnipro River and also in (INAUDIBLE), not far from where I'm standing in Zaporizhzhia.

For Russia's part, though, as you said, a public series of comments by Yevgeni Prigozhin, probably one of the more well-known military figures in Russia, head of the Wagner mercenary group, who've been so much part of the brutal fight Russia's put up for symbolic but not strategically that important city of Bakhmut. Thousands dying in that. He's basically said we're not getting the ammunition, the artillery shells that we need. Only 2 percent of what he says they need. And pointed the finger squarely at Russian's defense officials for not supplying what they say they actually need. Now, I should point out, Prigozhin has got a history of making statements often without evidence that later turn out not to be correct. But it's interesting that given we are hours, possibly days away from this counteroffensive beginning, a real test of Russia's armed forces that he's publicly stepping out and pointing fingers towards defense chiefs back in Moscow, one of whom in fact appears to have been removed in the past days. The deputy defense minister responsible for a lot of the activities here in Ukraine taken from his post. What does this mean? Well, it means Moscow is really airing its disputes in public. And that's not a good sign if they're trying to be unified and focus ahead of fending off the Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Here is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): The White House, since this Congress began, has had no ideas whatsoever except jacking up taxes and spending even more money for a country that is in trouble financially. We got to get this right, Dana. And the Senate -- the Schumer Senate, they have no ideas either. It's just repeated rhetoric. So, to say it's dead-on-arrival in the Senate, when you've got even Joe Manchin suggesting support for this type of approach, I think that's not exactly accurate. Our recommendation is we pass it through the House, take it up in the Senate and pass it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And really, I would say Democrats are also refusing to even consider that Republican bill as a jumping off point for a future deal. And so, there's not really a big chance of seeing any sort of further passage of that.But I will point out that there are beginning to be cracks in the Democrat's position. Emmer mentioned Senator Joe Manchin, He's one of a growing number of Democrats who are urging President Biden to move forward and start negotiating on this. And really, it's all about timing. Congress is running out of time. The current estimates put the deadline for when a deal must be reached at some point in July. And meanwhile, Congress is out this week or the House at least is out on recess this week. And so, it doesn't look like there will be any further action at least in the immediate next few days on this. And so, we'll have to wait and see whether a meeting will take place in the coming weeks.",

He will kneel before his father, place his hands between the king's hands, and pledge an oath of allegiance. He will say, he's going to be his liegeman of life and limb. These are words that we last heard when the Duke of Edinburgh said them to the queen at her coronation.
