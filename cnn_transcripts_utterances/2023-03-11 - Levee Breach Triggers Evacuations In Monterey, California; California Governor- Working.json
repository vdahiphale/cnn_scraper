I'm Jim Acosta in New York.It is six o'clock here in the Big Apple, 3:00 PM in California, which is likely to be a long sleepless night and soggy weekend lying ahead for much of Monterey County. The county is the epicenter of catastrophic flooding in that State. These are new images of the levee that failed around midnight local time. Mandatory evacuations are now underway in parts of that county. A string of deadly storms has unleashed massive flooding across the central and northern portions of the State. At least two people have died in this most recent storm. This week's atmospheric river is the 10th to hit the State this winter. It's dropped more than a foot of rain in some areas and several feet of snow in others. Let's begin in Monterey County and the site of that levee breach. CNN's Mike Valerio is there. Mike, the state of that breach? Could this continue to dump more flooding into that area? What can you tell us?",

It's going to be the biggest problem leading into the next event, round two, Jim, you're exactly right with that and we want to start on that point.Round two: We have new information, Jim on the next flood watch which has been posted by the National Weather Service Monday evening through Wednesday morning. Jim, the next major impulsive moisture is going to come through the Central and Northern Coast of California. Tuesday, Tuesday morning, that would be the 11th atmospheric river system to hit across the State of California this year. But in terms, Jim, of how the situation has changed today, we want to show you a video that our intrepid producer, Sarah Moon shot off of her iPhone as people here in our backdrop were being rescued after dawn today for hours. You're going to be looking at a couple, Sierra (ph) and Freddy (ph) with their dog, Zeus, rescued by the National Guard. They were woken up at 8:00 AM, realized that there was so much water around them that had poured in from that levee breach, they couldn't get anywhere, called 9-1-1 and were rescued, they told us in minutes by the National Guard after they call 9-1-1. Now, Jim, we did have a chance to speak with a County Supervisor talking to us about how this is nothing new, but this is certainly a worst case scenario for this area of Monterey County. Listen to him talking about the resiliency, Jim, of this area. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIS A. ALEJO, MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERVISOR: Even before the storms hit, there was a lot of courageous work happening, for example, on these levees to try to add additional protection. A lot of community volunteers came through this community because they care. These are our friends, these are our neighbors, these business owners have struggled so much in this community. But I think that what I've seen is this community is resilient. It is strong. When these waters recede, Pajaro is going to rise and that's why we're out here trying to give this community all the support that they need. This is such a great hardship on this community, but we know that we will get through this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They basically made a bet that interest rates were going to stay low, and then interest rates didn't stay low.I think that, you know, the Federal Reserve is operating to control inflation that is why it is raising interest rates. It had nothing to do with the banking system, per se. But I think there are real questions about whether there should have been better oversight of this institution as it was growing very rapidly, as it was pursuing this business model, which was a semi risky one in this kind of environment, and the Fed was actually also the primary regulator of this entity. And so I think we're going to have a lot of sort of, you know, second guessing, and thinking about what happened there, why regulators didn't flag this, why supervisors didn't stop it earlier, and I mentioned that's only just starting today. You know, I think we're going to hear a lot about this in the coming weeks.",

And so I think this is a very challenging world for them to operate in, it's probably going to make it hard for them to be as aggressive as they had been planning on being and I think, you know, we're going to have to wait and see if this is bigger than just this bank, it's going to be a real problem for them.",

You know, the Fed signaled that it could do a bigger rate increase in March, I think that has to be -- and markets certainly suggest that that is being called into question now because can they go by, you know, can they make a bigger adjustment?

She is with her family and that she is doing okay.And as you can imagine, the family right now is asking for some privacy as they try to process everything that has happened in the past week. As for the Facebook Live video that CNN was able to obtain, that video was taken when the group was driving in Mexico. They had crossed the border. Now according to the timeline that is being offered by the Mexican government, the group was in Mexico for about two hours when members of the cartel began following them. And so right now, it is still unclear exactly what happened from the moment they crossed over from Texas into Mexico, and they were being followed by the cartel. Now on Friday, the Mexican government announced the arrest of five individuals. It is equally unclear whether the five folks that they took into custody are the same five men that the cartel said they were going to turn over to authorities. On Thursday, they had released this letter where they apologized for the incident and they told the Mexican government that the people that were responsible for it were going to be handed over. Now, we did get a little bit more information from Mexican officials late Friday night. They released some information about the initial encounter with the group of men that they arrested. We translated some of that information and it reads in part: \"Due to the conditions in which five men were found in Matamoros along with a car and a letter, they were initially treated as victims of crime. But this changed to suspects when they began to report their participation in the events of March 3rd.\" Coming back out here in South Carolina, McGee and her family again, they are back together again after all of this happened. She is doing okay. But right now the family is asking for some privacy.

We have a source saying that Trump is huddling with his legal advisers at Mar-a-Lago this weekend to really go over options of how to respond. Now, I don't think really anybody thinks there's a great chance that Trump is going to take up the DA on his invitation to come in and testify before the grand jury, but it is clear that we've reached a different phase of this investigation that's gone on for about five years, and really raises the potential question of whether or not we could see a former President, for the first time be indicted. And more importantly, as we look ahead to the presidential election in 2024, there is a scenario where Trump could be under indictment and still running for President as the top Republican candidate in that moment, which has also never happened before.

The biggest change is the new pitch clock designed to speed up a game that unlike football or basketball never had a clock before. It's a change that not everyone loves at this point.And CNN Contributor and legendary sports broadcaster, Bob Costas, joins us now. Bob, I can't think of anybody better in broadcasting to break this down for us. I know you're a student of the game. What is your take on the clock? How is it working so far during spring training?

The question is do you do it thoughtfully.And in this case, I think they have. They tested this out in the minor leagues. They did it very, very carefully. The pitch clock will take some getting used to. There will be a few incidents and now with everything on video and all kinds of highlight shows, even if they're rare, you'll see them. So there will be some occasions where a pitch is on the way and the guy hasn't quite beaten the pitch clock and it should be an automatic ball and the guy will swing at the pitch and hit it and put it in play and confusion will ensue. A lot of this is a matter of rhythm, not so much the clock but the rhythm. Batters get into the batter's box, they take a few little swings, they go through their motions. The pitcher comes set, but the rhythm is already falling into place. Spring training games on average about 25 minutes shorter than they had been a year ago. It worked in the minor leagues. And interestingly, Jim, when baseball doing its due diligence, superimpose the pitch clock, 20 seconds with a man on base, 15 seconds without one, on games from the past, famous games from the past where there was no clock almost always the pitchers and hitters beat the clock. Now this may seem like ancient history, but it's so famous fans have seen it. I know you have. Kirk Gibson's famous at bat against Dennis Eckersley --",

And Tom said, yes, but he went and tested it and he put a clock on it, and there wasn't a single time, when Eckersley or Gibson wouldn't have beaten the clock, since by the present rule, you're allowed one timeout and Gibson did ask for timeout before the three two pitch.Now as we've seen so far in spring training, there are more ground ball base hits, because they've outlawed the shift.
