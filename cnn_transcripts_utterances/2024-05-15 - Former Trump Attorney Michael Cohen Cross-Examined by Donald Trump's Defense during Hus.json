We do know that they are actually going to spend the whole time tomorrow likely doing cross-examination. Essentially Todd Blanche was using Michael Cohen's words from his book, from his podcast to attack him and get him to show for jurors what they believe, that he's profiting off of Donald Trump, that he's out for vengeance, that he just really has flipped on him and wants everything bad to happen to Donald Trump. I think at some point during the trial he called Trump with his own words again, boorish, cartoon misogynist, a Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain. And Donald Trump -- or rather Michael Cohen just said, yes, that sounds like something I would say.But he's really trying to -- they're trying to show that he's really made a living off of Donald Trump. And they also went back in time when he was complimentary to his former boss. And Michael Cohen said this, that's when I was knee deep in the cult of Donald Trump. So that was pretty interesting, too. Obviously trying to show some flip- flopping here. Prior to that we did here the prosecution wrap up that whole narrative that he was on the stand for about eight hours going through all of what we have been hearing from witnesses before, corroborating what we have heard, and essentially talked about the moment that he did turn on Donald Trump. It was after that FBI race. They went through his criminal history. And at the end of it, there was a moment where the prosecution says, did you regret it? And this is how Michael Cohen responded. He says, \"I don't regret working with the Trump Organization. As I expressed before, some very interesting, great times. But to keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass, and I suffered the penalty, as has my family.\" So that was a really striking moment, and maybe somewhat credible to jurors. We'll have to find out.",

Michael Cohen still faced questions from prosecutors before Todd Blanche started swearing in front of the jury yesterday. And this was an exchange that gets to the heart of the case, and clearly the prosecution wanted another bite at this apple after their first day. So the prosecutor, Susan Hoffinger asks, \"Why, in fact, did you pay the money to Stormy Daniels?\" Michael Cohen says, \"To ensure that the story would not come out, would not affect Mr. Trump's chances of becoming president United States.\" Hoffinger says, \"If not for the campaign, Mr. Cohen, would you have paid that money to Stormy Daniels?\" Cohen says, \"No, ma'am.\" Todd Blanche, the defense attorney, says \"Objection.\" The judge says, \"Overruled. You can answer.\" Cohen says \"No, ma'am.\" And then Hoffinger asks, \"At whose direction and on whose behalf did you commit that crime?\" Cohen says \"On behalf of Mr. Trump.\" I feel like those are important words legally from the prosecution, and the fact they did it on day two with Michael Cohen tells us something.

We need to have Donald Trump's intent, not Michael Cohen's, to find a conviction here.So that's what they're doing. Just put it all together for the jury.

ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTmajor news from the Biden campaign this morning as they are saying that they are willing to debate former president Donald Trump two times. And campaign -- one of the top campaign officials, Jen O'Malley Dillon, sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying that President Biden will not participate in the debates that they currently have scheduled. Now, Biden himself released a video just moments ago where he said that he will debate Trump two times in this upcoming election. Take a listen to what the president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn't shown up for debates. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice. Plus pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It means that one central question has been hanging over this rematch, are there going to be debates? And President Biden now firmly saying, yes, he will agree to two debates in June and early September. We will see what the Trump campaign says to this. But at every recent Trump rally, there has been an empty podium that says, anytime any place. So Donald Trump is out there saying he will debate. Interesting in this letter as we are just reading it here from Jen O'Malley Dillon, a top campaign adviser sort of outlining all of this, also saying one-on-one debates only, so that would exclude if this is -- if this comes to pass, that would exclude a debate with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and of course that is a central question as well hanging over this campaign. Is this going to be a one-on-one contest or is this going to be a debate where he is allowed to participate? So all of these things, of course, will have to be worked out, but very significant the timing of this. And one of the reasons for that, really the timing of voting has changed in America. Voters now were going to the polls much earlier in some respects, a month before the traditional election day, if you will. So the earlier schedule that was laid out by the Commission on Presidential Debates, I was just looking it up, the earliest one was supposed to be September 16th, followed by September 25th with the final debate on October 9th. Now, under this new plan that President Biden's team is proposing, the debates would be over by then. One in June, one in early September, so we will see how the invitations for these debates come forward if the Trump campaign agrees, but those are the significant things. Earlier debates and a one-on-one debate with that shade thrown in, \"We hear you're free on Wednesdays,\" perhaps a bit gratuitous because they said after the trial is over here, but that is certainly the state of things here. The debate over debates is just the beginning, but it looks like we likely will have debates in this presidential campaign -- Sara.",

Michael Dukakis was ahead of George HW Bush at this point in 1988, by high single-digits, it was actually George HW Bush who won by high single digits and keep in mind, Trump is only up by a point at this particular junction.

But if you look nationally, look at the national house vote, the polls actually underestimated Republicans by about two points.

Now, what we know about it, it comes with the list price of about $240.00. That's the cost without insurance, and Labcorp says it has 90 percent sensitivity, so that means it can accurately identify someone at high-risk of preeclampsia about 90 percent of the time, and your doctor would have to order this test for you. So in a doctor's visit, you and your physician would talk about your risk, how you're feeling during your pregnancy, your risk factors, and if they think this test could benefit you, then they would order it. And how it works, it looks at four data points; two are biomarkers in the blood, the third data point is a blood pressure measurement, and the fourth data point is taken from an ultrasound. It assesses those data points and then presents an estimated risk assessment. Now, Sara, I did speak with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists about this, and they said this test does not change current clinical guidance around preeclampsia, but knowing your risk early does come with a benefit because if you do have high risk, you can then plan for potential complications. Like, you can have more doctor visits. You can check your blood pressure at home potentially, or if you are seen as a candidate, your doctor might recommend for you to take a low-dose aspirin to reduce your risk.
