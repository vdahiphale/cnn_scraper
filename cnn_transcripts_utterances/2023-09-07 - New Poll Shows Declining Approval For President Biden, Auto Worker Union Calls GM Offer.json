You saw the big number there that you just laid out, 39% across the board. That's a low place to be for an incumbent president that's going to be heading into a re-election campaign. If you divide it out by party, if you look at Democrats, he's seen his support fall within Democrats from 80 to 74% now. Independents at 36, that is just a stubborn number that he's going to need to improve. Those independents are obviously going to be very key in 2024, and then you see the Republicans there at the bottom. Another additional data point that is important here is we asked people how his policies have affected the economy and look at that there. 58% believe that Biden's policies have worsened conditions in the U.S. economy.Only 24% believe they've improved conditions, 18% saying they have no effect. And that worsened conditions number, Boris, clearly going up by eight points since last fall. We hear the president and his team talk about Bidenomics all the time as they are out on the road, as they are at the White House, really trying to convince the American people that these policies are actually improving the economy. And look, the economy has improved, but if you look at those numbers, it is just not something that Americans are feeling right now. They feel generally pretty sour and pretty down on things.",

So, we ask people, does Biden have stamina, the sharpness to serve as president? Look at that number, 74% say that does not apply to him, that they don't believe he has the stamina and sharpness. That's a very high number. It is hard to get to 74% on anything, get 74% of Americans to agree on anything. So that is certainly a troubling number.And then let's take it down, even still take it down even more narrowly. Let's look at Democrats and voters who lean Democratic. When we ask them what their biggest concern is about the president, 49% cited age. And that was the number one thing, by far, age, 49%, everything else right there at 7%, Boris.",

The White House continues to say that the policies underlying the president's messaging and his administration remain deeply popular and that it's just a matter of getting that message to sink in.Of course, recently, the president has put that message under the -- banner of Bidenomics. That's only been about a month. And aides say, give it more time. A month is not enough time for it to sink in. And certainly, when I talk to sources and members of Biden's inner circle, they suggest that as the economy improves and as that messaging sinks in, then perhaps the poll numbers will improve, too. But those questions about age and stamina continue to get deeper from voters. And just today, Vice President Harris answered a question from CBS trying to put some of those concerns to rest.

And Melissa, that effort perhaps highlighted by the U.S. recently supplying cluster munitions to Ukraine, which of course have the risk of those that don't explode. They last a long time.

And of course, as you say, that's going to take years, decades possibly to get through and lots of consequences for the civilian population, the children especially, going forward. Essentially, what Secretary -- the Secretary of State came here to announce was this $1 billion package. Now, part of that is military aid, Pentagon stockpiles that include those controversial depleted uranium munitions that should allow Ukrainians to help better get through the very formidable Russian defences we've been talking so much about these last few weeks and that are proving such a challenge to their counteroffensive.Essentially, however controversial these munitions, the idea is that because they're much denser than ordinary lead munitions, they get through tanks, for instance. And the understanding is that this might be, as with the controversial cluster munitions that Washington announced it was sending just a few months ago, a key piece of weaponry, of ammunition for the Ukrainians as they desperately try to press further southwards. In the end, after two days of meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts and his trip here is now wrapped up, he joined their assessment that this counteroffensive is making progress and that was really now the message that both President Zelenskyy and the United States are going to be taking to the United Nations General Assembly next week, Jim, as they try to hold together this alliance after 19 months of  war that has exhausted absolutely everyone and not least the Ukrainians. And of course, Secretary Blinken's visit was punctured by precisely the sort of attacks that he'd come here to talk about, a reminder that the Russians were only too happy to oblige, Jim.",

And, interestingly, very interestingly, in the context that we know that there seems to be a gathering momentum for President Putin to meet with Kim Jong-un, that they said that we have new work ahead of us set by our country. There are new tasks for us. That was a message from the diplomats arriving there in Pyongyang amongst each other.
