We only look at the violent actions that take place, that are visible, such as the horrible shootings that we see, Israeli actions in places like Jenin, and the horrible shooting in east Jerusalem. All of these things, obviously, matter. The administration wants to maintain offset of escalation. I wouldn't say de-escalation because de-escalation means the end of violence.

Obviously, they don't want that. Clearly, they want to try to find a way to keep the lid on that. Number two, he obviously is worried about the proposed changes of Israeli legal system. That clearly would weaken the Israeli force and supreme court and give the Israeli government for more ability to act both -- under all the territories, including inside of Israel.

According to Iranian state media, on Saturday night, a military factory in the central Iranian city of Isfahan was attacked with three drones.Again, according to the Iranian state media, one of those drones was shot down, the two others caught in the country's air defense systems and exploded. Now, Iran has not accused any certain group or country of carrying out this attack. But a top official, the Iranian foreign minister, is calling it a cowardly act and saying it was part of efforts to incite insecurity in Iran. Now, separately, \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\" have spoken to U.S. officials, unnamed U.S. officials, that say Israel was behind the attack. Now, in the past, Israel has been accused by Iran and others of carrying out these covert attacks against Iranian military sites in an effort to deter that country's nuclear program. To make clear, Israel has made no comment on this recent attack. Now, separately, there was also a response from Ukraine. A top official, again, a Ukrainian presidential advisor in a tweet saying it was -- quote -- \"an explosive night in Iran,\" going on to use the Ukrainian flag and saying, did warn you. Now, it is important to note here that Ukraine has accused Iran and Ukraine's allies agree that Iran is providing drones to Russia, which are being used in Ukraine in Russia's invasion of that country and have caused, according to Ukrainian officials, again, civilian loss of life. Now, all of this quite murky. Unclear who is behind the specific attack. But very much a part of a shadow war and a continuation of the increasing isolation of Iran. Over the course of the last few months, that country has been cracking down on a protest movement. The result of that has been that nuclear talks. Attempts to restart nuclear talks have all but faded away. No hope there. More sanctions from the west. Iran increasingly turning to Moscow, helping to provide and replenish its arsenal for the war in Ukraine. And concerns and fears that the Middle East already in a very fragile place, that this could escalate tensions there. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But the proper whole organization, the official spokesperson of the TTP, the Tehrik-i- Taliban, which is the Pakistani Taliban, has denied responsibility behind this attack. And this comes at a period of increased militancy over the past couple of weeks in Pakistan, not just in Peshawar, but across the north of this country, especially in the areas bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan has accused Afghan authorities, has accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring the Pakistani Taliban and providing them safe havens, for being able to be there and then come into Pakistani territory and commit these acts, according to Pakistani authorities. Now, this increase in attacks has happened since November of last year when a cease-fire between the Pakistani Taliban and the Pakistani State (INAUDIBLE). We've also seen an increase in attacks since the summer of 2021 when the fall of (INAUDIBLE) happened. And an increase in attacks happened when the Pakistani Taliban regrouped. Now, Pakistan has seen many, many years of militancy, of attacks like this on its soil. But over the past couple of years, there have been, since at least 2015, a period a relative calm. There have been operations by the military. That had been stopped and it had become a distant memory for many people, especially in the city of Peshawar where we have just seen many similar attacks.

The Russians have massively beefed up their forces around Kreminna. They believe that they have to prevent the Ukrainians breaking through here to sustain their own offensive against Bakhmut and are now also launching fresh attacks near Vuhledar further south. This video near Vuhledar shows Russian armor getting hit by Ukraine's artillery. The soldiers run away. A wounded comrade tries to crawl to safety.

We still have very elevated levels of vacancies.
