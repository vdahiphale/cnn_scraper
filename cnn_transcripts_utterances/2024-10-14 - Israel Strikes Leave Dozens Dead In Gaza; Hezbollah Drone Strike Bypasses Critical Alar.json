Now a deadly few days in Gaza,Israeli air strikes hitting Al-Mufti school and the courtyard of Al Aqsa hospital, killing dozens, including 13 children. And in Israel, the Minister of Defense visiting a military base where four soldiers were killed after Hezbollah drone attack that happened without setting off alarms. Meanwhile, polls tightening between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris just three weeks from the U.S. election. The war between Israel and Hezbollah is taking a new turn as a mostly Christian village north of Beirut was hit by an Israeli strike just a short time ago. The Lebanese health ministry says nine people were killed. This as a Hezbollah drone strike killed four IDF soldiers deep inside Israel and after a new incident Sunday, the United Nations warns Israeli attacks on its peacekeepers in Lebanon could amount to war crimes. We are live on both sides of the border. We've got CNN's Jeremy Diamond with us from Jerusalem. And we've also got Ben Wedeman standing by in Beirut. Ben, I want to start off with you and this attack on a village about 100 kilometers north of Beirut. Can you give us some perspective on the village and why the strike is so significant?",

I mean, the first of which is that this isone of the highest casualty attacks inside of Israel since October 7th of last year with four Israeli soldiers confirmed killed, at least 61 others injured, eight of whom are in serious condition. But beyond the casualties, of course, it also comes at a time where Israel has felt on the front foot in its offensive against Hezbollah, where it feels like Hezbollah is in disarray. Most of its senior leaders have been killed in airstrikes over the course of the last couple of months. And in addition to that, Israel also feels like it has destroyed a significant share of Hezbollah's operational capabilities. And yet, we see with this attack, a coordinated attack of rockets and drones fired at the same time, according to Hezbollah, that Hezbollah has actually been able to pull something off quite significant here. Hitting an Israeli base some 40 miles or about 60 kilometers south of the Lebanese border, striking this Israeli base at dinner time, resulting in high casualties, and in particular, being able to fire this drone and not have it trigger any alarms in Israel. Indeed, this drone not only was it not intercepted before hitting its target, but it also didn't set off any of those air raid sirens that Israelis have grown so used to over the course of the last year. The Israeli military says that it is going to investigate why this drone was not detected, nor was it intercepted, and that they're going to carry those lessons forward. But make no mistake, a very significant event, one for which we expect the Israeli military will deal some kind of a significant retaliatory strike against Hezbollah. Eleni?",

Short range, it has the Iron Dome.Medium Range, has David's Sling, and then we've seen its long-range interceptors, the arrow, three missiles operate against the October 1st barrage from Iran. But it's not just a question of quality. It is also a question of quantity. And we saw Iran launch 180-plus ballistic missiles on October 1st. So, the THAAD system, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense will add to that layered defense. In addition, THAAD can communicate with the Navy destroyers and ships that are right off the coast of Israel or somewhat off the coast of Israel, to bolster defense from that perspective as well. So, it's an incredibly capable system that adds to Israel's already capable systems and that's why it's important here. Israel, from the prime minister to the defense minister and more, have vowed to retaliate for the October 1st barrage. And Iran has said it would respond to any further attack on its own country. So, the U.S. is preparing for that possibility of an incoming attack, and this will add to that, simply because of the quantity of missiles Iran has at its disposal to fire. And that's why this THAAD deployment is so significant. The U.S. doesn't have many of these batteries. So it's not very easy to move them around. And it's essentially a bit of a cost benefit analysis on the military's part, likely on the defense secretary's part on whether it's more needed in one spot or another. Clearly, the perspective from the Pentagon is that it's needed in Israel as the U.S. watches the rhetoric and the threats going back and forth between Israel and Iran. THAAD has been in Israel before. It was there in 2019 for an exercise with the Israelis, and it was also used for the first time operationally in the Middle East. In January 2022, a THAAD battery in the UAE intercepted two Houthi ballistic missiles and it may very well be called on again in the mid -- in the Middle East intercept ballistic missiles one more time.

The survey, which finds the average of nationwide polls shows Harris with 50 percent support among likely voters, and Trump on around 47 percent with everyone expecting a tight race, both Harris and Trump are pitching to voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania today, with 19 votes in the Electoral College. Pennsylvania is the biggest single prize of the seven most closely fought states in this year's election. CNN's senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak joining us now from Washington.

And in fact,some polls over the last week or so have shown Trump eroding some of the advantage that Harris had in the entire country in the nationwide polls. Of course, this race is going to be won or lost in those seven battleground states, and even in those states as well, every single one of them is within the margin of error. And I think strategically, practically for these candidates, what that means is that there is no place, there is no state on the battleground map where they're not competing. You know, this is ordinarily the point in the race when the campaigns look very hard at the battleground map and say, you know, this is where we have our chance. This is where, you know, we're just going to cut bait and sort of seed advantage to the competitor. There is no state on either of these candidates maps where they think that they can give up, and that means, practically, that they're spending resources in more places than any candidate would ordinarily be at this point in the race. So, this is an expensive part of the contest. It's very bitterly fought and it's the reason why you see these candidates heading to Pennsylvania specifically, that is sort of considered the linchpin to both of their electoral strategy. What we'll see Harris doing there today is speaking in Erie, which is one of those Bellwether counties, you know, as goes Erie, as goes Pennsylvania, she'll be talking specifically to black men trying to shore up support. She has this new economic plan where she is rolling out policies specifically meant to advantage that voting bloc. The real fear among Democrats is that, you know, not that she's going to lose black men, but that she's underperforming in this group compared to previous Democratic candidates. And it just shows in a race this close, any kind of erosion in the Democratic coalition could have a real effect and the final result.",

So, I guess we'll find out in a few weeks' time. Good to see you, Kevin, thank you. Well, the economy has been a key voting issue in the 2024 U.S. election. A new survey from the Wall Street Journal has found that most economists think inflation, interest rates and deficits would be higher under Donald Trump. These results echo a similar survey taken in July before Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Of the 50 economists in the survey, 68 percent thought prices would rise higher under Trump compared to Harris, which they're expecting around 12 percent. Joining us now from New York, we've got Matt Egan again to break down these numbers. Good to see you again, Matt.

Yesterday was historic. That was history in the making. I think a lot of people don't really understand what it really means because this rocket is the largest rocket ever launched. It's more powerful than the Artemis or the Space Launch System rocket that NASA flew about two years ago. It's much more powerful than the Saturn V moon rockets that brought the Apollo missions to the moon. And yet it came down, barreling down lit its engines and landed. I mean, it actually came in to the launch pad, hovered over it while this mechanical system that they affectionately call Mechazilla or nicknamed the Chopsticks, gently grabbed the rocket and then shut its engines down. That shows that they can do it, and that means they can refurbish and reuse this huge booster, these boosters that used to be thrown away on prior large rocket programs and it's going to dramatically bring down the cost of launching things. Similarly, the ship Starship, you know, could have gone into orbit, but it was planned to be a suborbital flight. It came back through the heat shield on flight four was not robust enough. This time, it looked like it did very well. Uh, but there did look like some hot spots, potential burn throughs on some of the control surfaces.

They're in quarantine. And those you saw there were the zookeepers from the national zoo, as well as some caretakers from China.",

But there's still more work to go.The Panda Exchange, also called Panda Diplomacy dates back more than 50 years now, when China gifted two pandas to the U.S. following President Nixon's historic visit.
