On the stage foreign policy dominating with tough talk and is really Ukraine and China. But it got personal too, Nikki Haley calling Vivek Ramaswamy just scum after he attacks her daughter. And Congress again taking government funding to the cliff's edge; we will ask Republican Mark Green about that and also about military aid for Israel. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 am here in Washington Thursday, November 9th, just 67 days until the Iowa Caucuses only 361 days until Election Day. This is today's \"State of the Race\". He is way ahead of the poll -- in the polls repeatedly skipping Republican Presidential Debates. Donald Trump's big lead poses a big problem for his challengers. How to win over the base that remains loyal to him no matter his legal troubles or his repeated false claims that the 2020 election was rigged? At his solo rally in Florida Wednesday night Trump scoffed at his Republican rivals and said their debates are meaningless. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I was watching these guys. They're not watchable. Somebody says, oh, some one of those dumber ones. He doesn't have the courage to stand up. Well listen, I'm standing in front of tens of thousands of people right now and it's on television. That's a hell of a lot harder to do than to debate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Moderator Lester Holt, I thought asked a very valuable first question, why you and not Donald Trump? And the candidates answered it somewhat.

Chris Christie has been doing that it hasn't been working, having run against Donald Trump in 2016. I can tell you, I mean, look at what happened in the primaries there. People sort of ignored him, and then they tried attacking him. And that also didn't work. I continue to think Nikki Haley may have the right strategy. You know, and this is a unique thing for women candidates, obviously, they have to campaign differently. She seems to be trying to be a little bit more of the truth teller, like on abortion, she said, I'm going to have to have the votes setting up a very good argument for a general election contest. So it does feel like and you would know better than I Kristen, but as Republican voters perhaps are getting more concerned about, well, what if he is in jail? What if maybe I should have a number two in mind? This idea of who's the number two that actually matters? And she seems to be making slow and steady gains. I think people have decided Ron DeSantis is not the one. I think Ramaswamy we can all agree it's not going to be the guy and Tim Scott just barely seems to show up for these debates.

But I mean part of this, right, is that there are too many candidates on the stage so right? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: And there I mean, I think it's very telling that the most viral moment of last night's debate, was all the conversation me and others were having on social media about was that a soft launch of Senator Scott's girlfriend or not? You know, and he has struggled to make moments for himself. He struggled to create a lane for himself among a crowded Republican field. And a lot of people believe he may be one of the ones who drop off after this debate. He -- I know there are a lot of people who support Tim Scott, they were ready to spend money on Tim Scott. But they were waiting for like the signal that his campaign was truly catching fire. And that still hasn't happened. And so I think he's losing.

But what Tim Scott hasn't done is differentiated, why him and not the others? And so after that first lackluster debate, he just hasn't caught fire. Now, the big thing that's going on in the undercard situation is that well, Nikki Haley, I think I totally agree had a very strong night and she had a first two debates that were strong. Her problem is that the other four didn't all fall on their faces. That Ron DeSantis probably had a better night in this debate than his last two. I still don't think he's as strong as Haley in this setting. But it wasn't terrible. And so her big problem now is not only just Trump's still hold the majority of Republican voters, but she's also going to struggle to clear that field as quickly as would be necessary to get that head to head matchup with Trump.",

But I do think his platform has changed. He was de-platformed on social media, and then added back. He does not have the megaphone he enjoyed during his four years as President, and that does matter. But in the -- where it matters right now, where he's able to reach voters where voters are listening, are those stock Trump supporters that can sway the Republican primary. So it doesn't really matter that, you know, mainstream channels aren't seeing much of Trump as long as his base is and that they're ready to turn out for him at the polls.

His negatives are going up because at the same time, people actually don't like watching a man attack a woman in that way. With Hillary, it was a totally different phenomenon, because for some reason, attacking her didn't feel like the same to people. Not enough to make light of that. But you know, and one of the things on the flip side, if you notice, with Nikki Haley, and this is something female candidates have to be mindful of. When they attack, their negatives go up higher, and it's harder to get them back down. For men, actually, the cost of those attacks is much lower. So I suspect he felt like I can attack these women.

He has always thought that his lane is to get to Trump's right. And that's how he's going to pull conservatives away. This is just a piece of that strategy. I do think a problem is that DeSantis' early argument was I'm more electable than Donald Trump. And then he passes a six week abortion ban in Florida, which winds up not being the most popular policy, and it does undercut a little bit of his argument. I'm the one that knows how to win swing state America. And so frankly, Donald Trump getting to DeSantis' left or center or whatever you want to call it on this issue, has actually kind of made Trump look more centrist and therefore maybe more electable than DeSantis. I really think that the confused politics of that and DeSantis trying to hit him from the right has undercut that electability argument that DeSantis tried to make and has not yet succeeded that.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Kasie. The big thing about Ukraine is right at the doorstep of the rest of Europe. And when you look at the NATO alliance and every single 30 member state of the NATO alliance, Ukraine is kind of the key to everything there if Russia takes over Ukraine, then the problem becomes that the NATO alliance gets weakened and the American security is impacted by that as well. So what Vivek Ramaswamy was saying is basically incorrect on so many levels for example, when it comes to the election, in Ukraine, the presidential election that is due next year. That the reason Zelenskyy is considering postponing, that is for security reasons. It is not to the standard. I'm a dictator. I'm going to take over like Putin would have done. He is basically conflating all of the things that Zelenskyy stands for, with other people, including people that have come before in Ukrainian politics. Zelenskyy was basically the cleanup guy.

What I do know is that a steel dossier was completely manufactured against this guy. We spent $45 million on a Special Counsel all because it was made up.

Let me ask you about one of the issues that really came into focus earlier this week on Tuesday, when Republicans especiallyin Virginia were surprised, in many ways that Democrats won handily and it's been attributed in large part to abortion politics. Glenn Youngkin, won by pushing for a 15 week ban, he wanted to use slightly different language, but it was a test of whether or not that was something voters would say it was a reasonable compromise. Where do you come down on this? Do you believe that the 2024 Presidential Candidate should campaign on a nationwide abortion restriction?",

And if you believe in theConstitution of the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled this is a state's issue. They overturned Roe V. Wade, which was about whether or not a state could have its own policy versus the federal government. So this is in the states. Now, on the Virginia piece, I would submit to you that Virginia is a blue state. Youngkin is an outlier, because the issue the assault on basically on parents who were petitioning school boards and that catapulted him and gave him a victory. And unfortunately, for a lot of people, it falsely set expectations for Virginia. I think Virginia is a blue state. So I'm not so concerned about that loss. And -- but I do believe that, to answer your question, the Supreme Court has made a decision this is a state's issue. Let's let the state's decide.",
