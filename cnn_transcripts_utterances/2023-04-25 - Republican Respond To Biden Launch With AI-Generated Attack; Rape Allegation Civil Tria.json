And he's taking digs at his former and potentially future opponent, Donald Trump.Also tonight, a rape allegation lawsuit against Trump goes to trial with opening statements in New York. We'll have the latest on E. Jean Carroll's civil case against the former president and Trump's defense. And in war toward Sudan right now, Americans are part of an urgent race to flee the country as bursts of violence mar a fragile U.S. brokered ceasefire. This, amid new fears of a biological nightmare after paramilitary forces seize a public health lab. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world, I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. The 2024 race for the White House is taking shape in a big way tonight with President Biden's official campaign launch. His announcement video driving home team Biden's strategy if a historic rematch with Donald Trump actually becomes a reality. Let's begin our coverage this hour with our Chief White House Correspondent, Phil Mattingly. Phil, the President clearly facing some headwinds as he jumps into this presidential race. How is he making the case to voters?",

And in doing so, he will seek reelection.And in his announcement video, much like he did back in 2019, laying out his theory of the case, connecting the line from that campaign announcement, campaign in his first two plus years in office to what he wants to do in the years ahead, but also the stakes, the stakes of this moment, a moment where he made clear that his initial line and initial campaign promise for the ballot of the soul of the nation was something that was still ongoing. And because of that fact, he decided he needed to run again. Now, it is very clear, Wolf, and as you noted, the President facing underwhelming poll numbers when it comes to his approval, facing general apathy, not just among the broader electorate, but amongst some Democrats about running for reelection, particularly as the oldest president in U.S. history. And that's where the window that the President and his team gave today with that announcement video is critical. They view this as a choice election, an election where contrast will mean everything, not necessarily how people feel just about the President but how they feel about who he'll be running against. And that, more than anything else, was what that initial campaign video laid out. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Very clear the campaign is going to hammer home attacks on Republicans, attacks on former President Donald Trump, currently the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. But also the President, just a few hours later, going to some of his closest allies, union members here in Washington at a legislative conference and detailing his legislative successes of those first two years. Sweeping agenda items that are now being implemented. Something he'll be talking about over and over again in the next couple of weeks and months.It's worth noting, Wolf, it's not a dramatic shift from where the President has been the last several months. To some degree, his campaign strategy, from the personal sense, has been hiding in plain sight, something advisors say he will continue in the months ahead as they build the campaign towards that critical 2024 year and the general election. One thing is also clear, though, the campaign is moving very quickly, not only to build out their staff, build out their infrastructure, but also to raise money, expected to raise as much as $2 billion over the course of the next year and a half between the campaign and their outside groups, underscoring just how complicated and difficult the battle will be ahead. But very clearly, at least at the moment, laying out a message of contrast, a message they believe, despite the President's age, despite his current approval numbers, will win the day come November 2024, Wolf.",

In fact, you had Congressman Jim Clyburn, one of the President's closest allies, say there will come a time when he's going to have to talk very bluntly about age. And what the language you're likely to hear is that age is a synonym for experience.

Trump not being there, I think, is a poor visual optic because it makes his lawyer Tacopino look like his stand in. He's a very blustery style of attorney.

At the time, he was a fixture of the New York tabloids, he was the big real estate developer. And they said, you know, he will take her down. He's too powerful.They also say that they're going to call two witnesses from Bergdorf Goodman. Now, these witnesses do not have any eyewitness accounts. They can't say anything about the alleged assault. But Carroll's attorney say they want to call them to back up Carroll's description of the department store, of the dressing room. How it was so quiet. How people were there on a Thursday night that's the night, the one night a week where Bergdorf Goodman stayed openly, but that it was generally empty. So they are calling them to try to set the scene and back up Carroll's description of the scene because one of the issues is, how is this able to happen in a public department store? And Carroll's lawyer saying that it happened because it was -- there was no one there. It was just an empty department store on the 6th floor in the lingerie department and so there were no witnesses. So they're trying to buttress her claims with both the real time people that she confided in as well as setting up the scene of the store. But of course, that is something that Trump's lawyers are already attacking by saying that she never went to the police, that she didn't write it in her diary. She was an avid diary keeper, they said, and she never noted this. They're also suggesting that she never even told one of these friends until years later, only when she decided to write a book. So there's going to be a lot coming down to the credibility. But her attorneys here are focusing on any real time conversations she may have had that could set the scene in the '90s and those Bergdorf Goodman employees who can describe what the dressing room was like and how it was quiet on that floor.

I mean, it was still the highest rated hour by a smidgen over on Fox News, but much softer than when Tucker Carlson hosted that hour. And notably Fox News's smaller rival and right wing talk television Newsmax, they saw a very big boost in their viewership. So it looks like some of Tucker Carlson's fan base may have migrated over that channel and sampled some of their programming over there. Now, of course, the Murdochs, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch, they're betting that in the long run, Fox News is much bigger than Tucker Carlson, that Tucker Carlson is not bigger than the big brand they've built over the last couple of decades. And they have some evidence to suggest that's the case. I mean, they have rid their channel of people like Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Megyn Kelly left, and those people, they've never been bigger than the Fox News brand. I mean, if you look at the platforms they've had since leaving Fox News, they've been noticeably smaller than when they were on that primetime perch over on Fox News. And so, I think the Murdochs are making a bet that, yes, maybe in the short term we'll take a little bit of a ratings hit. They're still, you know, doing pretty well in the ratings. But in the long term, they're betting that they make the stars and not the other way around. Wolf.",
