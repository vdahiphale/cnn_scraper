Welcome, it's the second hour of \"Connect the World\" and you are most welcome.Kherson is unbreakable with those words, a jubilant official as Ukrainian forces have taken control of a key city and almost entire West Bank of the Dnipro River. These are the celebrations. Social media images show residents flooding the City Central Square, waving and cheering the arrival of Ukrainian troops. Even as the crowds ring in the new day Ukraine is wearing accusing Russian forces of hiding in civilian clothes and destroying infrastructure as they left. Dozens of buildings and bridges including this key bridge across the Dnipro River were destroyed or damaged as Moscow retreats. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry is confirming its withdrawal of all troops and equipment from the West Bank of the Kherson region. But it sounds a note of caution saying Kherson remains a part of Russia. Sam Kiley is with me from the Capital Kyiv. And square that circle for me, Sam. This is another part of Ukraine that Russia has allegedly annexed, but they no longer have control over.",

Now, it was also the first regional capital, the only regional capital indeed, to have fallen to Russian forces. It felt very early on in this campaign, because it was a great strategic significance, arguably the most important strategic capture in this war so far, and it is therefore deep strategic significance that they've lost it. Why does it matter, Richard? Well, because it is there at the Delta effectively, of the Dnipro River. And it is from that delta on the other side of the river that the freshwater supplies for Crimea, which was illegally occupied and annexed by Russia, following their invasion in 2014. So it controls the water supply into Crimea. Now that water supply still in Russian hands, the Ukrainians are still saying that they are going to fight on when they can get across that river. That is going to be a very formidable defense barrier, though, for the Russians. And I don't think the Ukrainians are going to be in a great rush to invest a lot of troops in a very visible ways along that opposite bank, because of course, they will now be within the range of Russian artillery. But that said the Ukrainians now are also have equipment that can strike using artillery all the way into the Crimean isthmus they say. So, again, this does give the Ukrainians a very significant bridgehead, effectively for a continued campaign, which they say is all about driving every single Russian soldier out of every single bit of Ukrainian territory notwithstanding Richard, some hints coming out of Washington that perhaps they might begin to start thinking about talking to the Russians, Richard?",

And that has been critical because that new equipment now can be deployed along that Western Bank of the Dnipro, opposite whatever it is, the Russians are going to try to use there. But they now have a defense in depth and they have got that Dnipro River to try and protect themselves. It's going to be a much, much harder military challenge for the Ukrainians and I would bet not that not one, they're going to engage in this side of the summer. They will need to reorganize very significantly before they get back on to any further assault, I would argue across that river very, very substantial, natural barrier very easy to for the Russians to defend there Richard.",

A CNN team was in the newly liberated Ukrainian town of - only hours ago where they witnessed theelation of residents of being freed from Russian occupation. CNN's Nic Robertson says the town has been through a lot. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (on camera): It's quite an incredible everyone's telling us we are the first reporters here literally the Ukrainian troops only arrived here yesterday and liberated the town. The Russians left two days before as you drive into the town here, everyone's waving. Everyone's happy. People I've talk to here have horror stories to tell about their treatment by the Russians, particularly over the last few days. I'll give you an idea of what you're seeing behind me. You see a couple of young teenagers here with Ukrainian flags on their shoulders. They were the first to raise the flag when the Russians left even before the troops arrived. So sort of a pre-liberation by teenagers here and they tell us that a month ago, somebody had been shot here shot and killed for raising a Ukrainian flag. And in the middle of the crowd here, everyone's gathered; we're sort of in the center of the town outside the administrative buildings here. That's the Regional Governor, he's just visiting here. He's just arrived in the last few minutes is explaining to people how they're going to get support from the Ukrainian government in the coming days, that they're going to be bringing humanitarian aid, supplies and support into the town here. The situation for people here is really difficult. There's no electricity, there's no gas. So they've had a very difficult time just in terms of surviving under the Russians. But what's happened in this town over the past few days as the Russians the past couple of weeks, as the Russians knew that they were going to pull out there was widespread looting vehicles looted. We've been to the bank here; it's completely ransacked and looted. The police station here were told was used as a base of torture that people would be taken in here and tortured and if they want to extract more information, and they would take them there 45 kilometers on to Kherson. I spoke to a young girl here and I'm telling you a lot of things here because everybody wants to talk everyone you speak to her the roadside here wants to talk. This young lady 15-years-old, she told me her mother confirmed her story, that in the past - over the last few days are the Russians being here she was taken away kidnapped to hurt put over her head. She told her she was afraid of being raped. She was only released yesterday. This is a town that is only just now getting to grips with the idea of liberation of what it means to be free of what it means not to have Russian rule here. And I think people are in all of it. We've seen people on the streets, meeting friends they haven't seen for a long time hugging each other in tears. But I think also there's a sense of OK, what's going to happen now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Or should they settle in for the winter and try to reconstitute, and candidly, at the same time that the Russians are trying to reconstitute both which would focus on a spring campaign, rather than try to either advance or win this war during the wintertime. My view is that the Ukrainians have done very; very well, they really didn't win Kherson. They lost Kherson to Russia, excuse me; the Russians lost Kherson because they're pulling out candidly, not from pressure by the Ukrainian ground forces, but by the Ukrainian artillery and missiles that have been devastating the supply depots and the ammunition depots of the Russians.",

And on the other side, I would expect the Ukrainians while those frontline forces are digging in for the artillery, the missiles and the drones on the Ukrainian side, to be going after those very, very vulnerable supply depots of the Russians. Remember, the Russians left Kherson, not because they were fought out but because there were starving because the logistics couldn't get to them. And that's because of the pressure the Ukrainians. So winter digging in, but at the same time continued this, what we call an indirect fire campaign against key logistics for the Ukrainians and key infrastructure on the part of the Russians.",

And we know the anatomy quite well; you know how the nerve cells talk to each other and things like that. But how it actually works, we don't know very much about that. DR. GUPTA (voice over): Each of these buckets with a hand drawn number represents a life a person and then total, a range of psychiatric disorders. DR. NIELSEN: Back then they really had no idea about what these diseases were, we still know very little about them, actually. But they knew that those diseases were in the brain. And so they said, OK, we'll get all the expertise that we have to sort of help future patients in the same situation. DR. GUPTA (voice over): Roughly 5500 brains here with dementia 1400 with schizophrenia, 300 with depression, 400 with bipolar disorder and more. And what's key is that the brains collected during the first decade are virgin brains, meaning they are untouched by modern medicines. DR. NIELSEN: So if you examine a patient from --a brain from a patient today, who died and who had schizophrenia, you would not really know whether the changes you see in the brain are because of the disease or because of the treatment. DR. GUPTA (on camera): It's sort of a time capsule of schizophrenia at that pre-medication sort of phase. DR. NIELSEN: Yes. DR. GUPTA (on camera): Is there anything else like this that exists in the world? DR.

But we did see markets and Investors cheer this news as a sign that the top leadership here recognizes there needs to be some adjustment in their approach as public frustration over this policy is mounting because for nearly three years, this policy has been up ending people's lives devastating the economy, countless and growing heartbreaking stories of suffering because of the zero COVID policy. So these new measures include cutting down the amount of time that inbound travelers and close contacts of COVID cases have to spend in quarantine down from 10 days in total to eight days, having just wrapped up a 10 day government quarantine myself this is a small but very welcome move. The government is also scrapping a penalty system for airlines that bring in travelers with COVID. Another important change is that the government is no longer identifying close contacts of close contacts of infected people. So what that means is that overall, a fewer number of people will be sent to government quarantine facilities. But let me walk you through the key restrictions that are still in place. Communities in China can still go into lockdown over a small number or just one COVID case. COVID cases and close contacts are still sent to government quarantine facilities. A recent PCR test is still mandatory to enter public places; I've got a line up pretty much every single day. And our daily lives here are still dictated by the color of our health codes.

He is a key figure there who gives a lot of advertiser's confidence that their ads aren't going to be placed next to hate speech or misinformation. He's gone from the platform.
