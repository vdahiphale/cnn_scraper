But the visit has also been dotted with some controversy as well as there have been some students and faculty who have expressed frustration with the fact that the president was invited here as they have criticized his approach to the handling of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.People will be watching very closely to see whether there is any type of protests during the president's remarks. Of course, the president of the university said ahead of time that he does not want to see any major disruptive protests that if that occurs, he would stop the commencement ceremony on the spot. But we will see whether there is any engagement of some type of peaceful protests from the students who are here. I will note that just before President Biden was set to speak, the valedictorian of the class. DeAngelo Fletcher, addressed the conflict in Gaza and in his remarks, he talked about the need for hostages to be released, but also said that there needs to be an immediate and a permanent ceasefire. So you can see how that issue is in the minds of many students here at Morehouse today. And I think in a short bit we will be hearing for President Biden himself.",

      "sentences": "Well, one key thing is that the Biden campaign is fully aware that they still have more work to do with black voters. Black voters made up a core part of Biden's coalition back in 2020. But there have been some signs of narrowing of support within that group. If you take a look at a recent \"New York Times\" poll in a hypothetical head-to- head matchup between Biden and Trump, it had Biden at about 63 percent support from black voters, while Trump had garnered about 23 percent.So that is a tightening from what we saw back in 2020, but it's clear that the Biden campaign is taking this issue relating to some struggles they're having with the black voters very seriously. Biden has been engaged over the course of this weekend in multiple appeals to try to reach black voters. Just yesterday, he met with people in here, Atlanta, Georgia. A bit later today, he is traveling on to Detroit where he will speak at an NAACP dinner. But the group of people that he will speak here today is also very important as they are specifically young black men. That is a group that has shown some disaffection when it comes to politics, when it comes to President Biden. And so these are all groups that the president will need to continue to make inroads with as he looks to secure a second term and really the black vote is critical to try to stitch together that diverse coalition that he had back in 2020 including in a battleground state like Georgia.",

In Augusta, Georgia, a righteous man once enslaved set foot for freedom. The story goes, he feared no evil. He walked through the valley of the shadow of death on his way north to free soil in Philadelphia. A Baptist minister, he walked with faith in his soul, power in the steps of his feet to glory. But after the Union won the war, he knew his prayers availed him freedom that was not his alone. And so this righteous man, Richard Coulter, returned home, his feet weary, his spirit in no ways tired 157 years ago. You all know the story, but the rest of the world doesn't and should. In the basement of a Baptist church in Augusta, he and two other ministers, William Jefferson White and Edmund Turney, planted the seeds of something revolutionary. And it was at the time, a school, a school that helped formerly enslaved men enter the ministry, where education would be the great equalizer, from slavery to freedom, an institution of higher learning that would become Morehouse College. I don't know any other college in America that has that tradition and that consequence. To the class of 2024, you join, as you know, a sacred tradition. Education makes you free.

But, by Christmas, I was a newly elected senator hiring staff inWashington, D.C., when I got a call from the first responders, my fire department in my hometown, that forever altered my life. They put a young woman, first responder on the line to say, there was an automobile accident. A tractor trailer hit your wife's car while she was Christmas shopping with three children. And she -- poor woman just blurted out, said, \"Your wife and daughter were killed,\" my 13-month-old daughter dead. \"And your almost 3-year- old and 4-year-old sons are badly injured. We're not sure they're going to make it either.\" I rushed from Washington to their bedside. I wanted to pray, but I was so angry. I was angry at God. I was angry at the world. I had the same pain 43 years later when that 4-year-old boy who survived was a grown man and a father himself lying in another hospital bed at Walter Reed Hospital having contracted stage four glioblastoma because he was a year in Iraq as a major, won the Bronze Star, living next to a burn pit. Cancer took his last breath. In this walk of life, you can understand -- you come to understand that we don't know where or what fate will bring you or when. We also know we don't walk alone. When you have been a beneficiary of the compassion of your family, your friends, even strangers, you know how much the compassion matters. I have learned there was no easy optimism, but, by faith, by faith, we can find redemption. I was a single father for five years. No man deserves one great love, let alone two. My youngest brother was a hell of an athlete. He did a great thing. He introduced me to a classmate of his, said: \"You will love her. She doesn't like politics.\" (LAUGHTER)",

I look down and see the rosary on my wrist that was out of my late son he had on him when he died at Walter Reed, and I was with him, and I ask myself, what would he say? I know the answer, because he told me in his last days. My son knew the days were numbered. The last conversation was: \"Dad, I'm not afraid, but I'm worried. I'm worried you're going to give up when I go. You're going to give up.\" We have an expression in the Biden family when you want someone to know -- give your word. You say, look at me.

Stay engaged. Promise me. Promise me.\" I wrote a book called \"Promise Me, Dad,\" not for the public at large, although a lot of people ended up buying it. It's for my grandchildren and great-grandchildren to know who Beau Biden was. The rosary around my wrist, the bust in my office remind me that faith asks you to hold on to hope, to move heaven and earth to make better days. Well, that's my commitment to you, to show you democracy, democracy, democracy is still the way. If black men are being killed in the street, we bear witness. For me, that means to call out the poison of white supremacy, to root out systemic racism. I stood up for George Floyd's family to help create a country where you don't need to have that talk with your son or grandson as they get pulled over. Instead of a trail of broken promises, we're investing more money than ever in black families and black communities. We're connecting black neighborhoods cut off by old highways and decades of disinvestment, when no one cared about the community. We have delivered checks in pockets to reduce child -- black child poverty, the lowest rate in history, removing every lead pipe in America, so every child can drink clean water without fear of brain damage and they can't afford to remove the lead pipes themselves. We're delivering an affordable high-speed Internet, so no child has to sit in a parent's car and do their homework in a parking lot outside of McDonald's. Instead of forcing you to prove you're 10 times better, we're breaking down doors so you have 100 times more opportunities, good-paying jobs you can raise a family on in your neighborhood...

He does that a lot, but it's the fact that he went into the history of Morehouse College and tie that into protest and said, look, young man, I understand you have every right to protest. People have to remember Samuel L. Jackson actually held the board of trustees hostage, so we could change -- have policy changes on campus. Julian Bond went to Morehouse College. I mean, we had a history of protests on this campus in Atlanta, Georgia. And so, he was speaking to that history of protests and said, look, I understand what you're protesting. You have every right to do. I understand that history. And then he pivoted and went directly into it. Now, I don't think anybody thought he was going to bring up Gaza, Palestine, Israel today, but he went in and he talked about it from a nuanced fashion which I thought was very appropriate. I think we were having a question about how it how it was received in the audience. I'm not sure, we're not there. But I do believe this speech will be well-received around the country to one group and one group only, that's Black men. He has to talk directly to Black men because that is where he's lagging.

I think that he should have spoken more directly about some issues that are more consequential to all black men writ large, we're seeing a significant percent of black men that are struggling with mental health issues, we have seen an increase and suicide rates for young black boys. We know for a fact that there is an education crisis with young black men across this country that are not getting college degrees compared to our black women who are killing it by the way.But I would have wanted to see the President speak directly to what his administration would do to tackle that issue. We still have this you have over criminalization of black men, that is still a problem that this country continues to tackle, the President should have spoken about that issue. I do give credit to the President that he acknowledged the history of the college. And he did weave in and I would argue very well, but in terms of some more concrete things that the average black man is dealing with in their everyday lives.

I was taking a look, scanning in the crowd of roughly 470 graduates, and I was able to count at least seven students who had turned their back on President Biden as he spoke, they remained seated in their chairs. So, they weren't entirely visible because they were still seated among the graduating class. There was a number -- another member of what appeared to be the faculty standing at the very back of the commencement address, who stood up and turned her back and raised her fist in the air throughout President Biden's speech.So, it's clear that the -- is still very palpable frustration when it comes to President Biden's handling of the conflict in Gaza. I will say the Morehouse president had warned students ahead of time, saying that he didn't want to see any major disruptions, a public outbursts at this commencement ceremony that if there was shouting and interruptions, he would be ready to stop the ceremony right on the spot. But really what the students engaged in today was in a very peaceful protests. It's unclear whether President Biden was actually able to see this with his own eyes. But he did address the general issue of peaceful protests in this country saying that he respects, that that that is a right that people have and that people should make their voices heard. The President said that he's hearing a lot of that frustration, especially when it pertains to the issue of Gaza. And in his remarks, he actually went and address Gaza head-ons, talking about the heartbreaking loss of civilian life there, while also talking about the work that his administration has been doing to try to reach a temporary ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
