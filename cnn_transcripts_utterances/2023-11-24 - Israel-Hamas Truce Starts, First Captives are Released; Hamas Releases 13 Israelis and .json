      "sentences": "All right. We are following breaking news at this hour because right now we are told that the hostages, the first ones to be released by Hamas as a part of this deal that they have struck with Israel, are right now in the process of being released from Gaza. That includes 13 Israeli women and children, and we believe 12 Thai nationals who were also had their release negotiated for by Egyptian officials.CNN's Eleni Giokos is following this live for us from Cairo. Eleni, you know, we had known that the 13 were initially expected to be released, these Israeli hostages coming here ultimately to Israel. But what can you tell us about the release of these Thai nationals that is also happening simultaneously?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this was a breakthrough moment, right? I mean, you know, hearing about the fact that we're seeing 13 Israeli woman and children that will be released today. And, you know, big focus on that cessation of fighting and importantly seeing aid passing through. I mean, about an hour ago, we had this information coming through from the state information services here in Egypt, and they announced that Egypt had intense negotiations with Hamas and was able to secure the release of 12 Thai nationals.Whether they will be released today or in the coming days, that remains to be seen. And then just some updates in terms of the actual number, they told me a short while ago that this is still in progress. We know that we've heard from Thailand as well, from Thai officials, and they have confirmed that this is the expectation. But this is really big news because you get the sense that the Egyptians are, of course, able to negotiate in tandem with what we see coming through with the Qataris, with Israel and Hamas, and be able to secure the release of other foreign nationals that are currently held hostage in Gaza.",

So, that's a really good question because anyone that is a foreign national or is a dual passport holder, defector is able to come into Egypt, and that is the process that we've been seeing for many weeks now. We know that the Egyptians have told us in tandem with this announcement, they said the Rafah Border Crossing is waiting for hostages. And they mentioned that they are prepared and ready and waiting, not only for the Israeli hostages but also for the Thai hostages.If we -- if the -- in terms of the precedent that has been set, all foreign nationals would be coming through into Egypt, and then they would be hosted here until an arrangement is made for them to leave, Kaitlan. So, that is the anticipation, given the fact that we've been seeing this playing out over the past few weeks.",

Oren, obviously this is the start of what we expect to be a 96-hour process. Not just these 13 hostages and those 12 -- we believe 12 Thai nationals being released, but ultimately, at least 37 more Israeli hostages, from our understanding, of how this is going to go. What's next, and what are Israeli officials saying based on how this has happened so far on day one, since we've seen this temporary truce go into effect?",

Their ultimate destination is here in Israel, where they will be reunited with their families. In addition to undergoing medical checkups, having interviews with government officials about what the last several weeks have been like for them. What we've heard from the IDF is that Israeli helicopters will be the ones carrying those hostages. They're expected to land at an airbase in southern Israel. That is where CNN's Matthew Chance is joining us from that airbase.Matthew, obviously there's a lot of waiting right now to actually see once these hostages have made it back. What are you expecting once those helicopters arrive?",

Matthew Chance, thank you for that.And, John, Matthew makes a great point that that what all of these 13 believe that number is that what they're coming back to is a completely changed world. A completely changed Israel certainly for these hostages who are returning after being taken against their will into Gaza on October 7th. It's just even hard to imagine what they've been through for the last several weeks as you can see why the officials here at every step of this process that they're going through are handling things just so delicately.",

Because we believe that the hostages are being driven through the Rafah Crossing right now. They're being taken -- we believe they met with Red Cross officials or were handed over to Red Cross officials and Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza, then taken over the Rafah Crossing, that's what you're seeing right now, those live pictures from Rafah. They will continue to move on back into Israel as Matthew Chance was just saying in an airbase there.And Kaitlan, as you were saying, again, just imagine what these people have been through. The reporting that they'll be given noise reducing headphones for the helicopter trip. Yes, they're doing everything they can, the Israelis, to make their transition back into regular life more tolerable or to ease it in. But to think, you know, noise reduction headphones versus the 48 days in captivity, versus the knowledge that they're all going to learn over the next several minutes and hours about how many of their loved ones, their relatives, their parents were murdered six weeks ago. This is going to be an excruciating period for all of them, Kaitlan.",

And just to speak to the significance, John, of what it means here in Israel, everywhere you go, you see the flyers of these hostages. The ones that you see in the U.S. and London and other countries.And you can see there, that is the convoy. We don't know who's inside this convoy, but you can see, John, that convoy making its way through the Rafah Crossing. That is the crossing between Gaza and Egypt right now. You can hear cheers and horns honking.",

We cannot know for certain who is part of that convoy right now. If the hostages are part of it, but you did hear some honking, some celebration. They're unclear to me exactly where that celebration would be coming from. If it was the Red Cross convoy carrying those hostages, but we are seeing that activity at Rafah right here, which will be a key transit point, Kaitlan, for these hostages as they move through.And you brought up another point here. One of the things, the developments, the twists today is not only has a number of hostages been turned over from Hamas to the Red Cross believed to be Israeli hostages, but several Thai hostages, people from Thailand who had been held, we understand they've been turned over as well. And it's not completely clear if those two groups are traveling together or separate at this point, Kaitlan.",

And just to recap for everyone who's watching at home and just tuning in, what we are seeing is a key step in this process. The -- this temporary truce that was negotiated between Israel and Hamas with Qatar acting as the intermediary.What we just saw happen is a convoy of Red Cross ambulances, making their way through the Rafah Crossing coming from the Gaza side. We have not yet confirmed who is inside that convoy. That is the way we were hearing from sources that those hostages were going to be traveling through. So, we are still waiting for official confirmation of that. But you can see this moment here as they are making their way into greater The Rafah Crossing. As we're continuing to monitor this all as it is unfolding truly minute by minute here, CNN's Jeremy Diamond is near a crossing in Southern Israel near the Israel-Egypt border. And Jeremy, this is one of the two locations that we have heard, Israel-Gaza border, this is one of the two locations that we have heard officials say that hostages could be entering through. What is the latest that you're hearing from officials?",
