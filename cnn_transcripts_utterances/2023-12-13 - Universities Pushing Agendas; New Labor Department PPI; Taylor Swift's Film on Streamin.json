He argues, quote, \"America's top colleges are no longer seen as bastions of excellence but as partisan outfits.\" And this criticism comes after three university presidents faced quite a bit of backlash over their answers at a congressional hearing last week. Asked whether calls of the genocide of Jewish people would be considered against the codes of conduct at their institutions, all three presidents initially answered that it would be context dependent.The questioning led to the resignation of the University of Pennsylvania's president, but Fareed argues this shift in college campuses goes beyond last week's viral hearing. It is rooted in something deeper. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, CNN'S \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\": American universities have been neglecting a core focus on excellence in order to pursue a variety of agendas, many of them clustered around diversity and inclusion. It started with the best of intentions. Colleges wanted to make sure young people of all backgrounds had access to higher education and felt comfortable on campus. But those good intentions have morphed into a dogmatic ideology and turned these universities into places where the pervasive goals are political and social engineering, not academic merit.

FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST, CNN'S \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\": Well, because I -- it's growing frustration. I mean I love these institutions. I went this them. For me it was gamechanger. I was a scholarship student at Yale. I got a scholarship when I got my Ph.D. at Harvard. I was on the board of Yale. So, it's been very sad to watch over the last 10 or 15 years the way in which these universities have, you know, as I say, moved away from a core focus which should really just be about education, research, learning, teaching, and they've gotten into all these political issues. You know, they start telling students how to speak, how to even dress. You remember that case of a dean at Yale telling students, don't wear Halloween costumes that might offend certain people. And I think it was - you know, they've created these ideas of safe spaces and all that detracts from two things.

So, he's hugged Israel very close and privately been telling them lots of things about how to conduct the war with greater restraint. They didn't want the -- the Biden administration didn't want a ground invasion of northern Gaza. They wanted much more selective use of force, much more -- you know, sending in special forces rather than bombing indiscriminately.They have been frustrated by the fact that Bibi Netanyahu has essentially pocketed all the support, but resisted all of the pressure, all the advice.

That's some good news and that's actually better than what we had been expecting.On an annual basis you saw prices increase slightly less than 1 percent. Let's call it 0.9 percent in the report. Now, when you look under the hood here and you look at the difference between prices for goods, physical things, versus services, think things like hotel fares, airfares, both of those prices, on a broad level, were unchanged. Also some good news. I should say that the fall in energy prices was part of this. The reason why we pay attention to this report so closely is because, again, it's what businesses pay. So, the thinking is that the inflation that businesses experience could be passed on to consumers. So that's why we pay really close attention to it. The Fed also paying close attention to it. As you said, this is their last meeting of the year. We're going to hear from Jay Powell in almost exactly six hours. Three things to watch. Of course, what they do with interest rates. The expectation, broadly, is that they will keep rates steady where they are. They will hold steady. But then watch what he says. There is going to be a lot of questions about when we can start to expect rate cuts in 2024. I imagine he will probably be pretty guarded about his language, but I can tell you that, if he raises his eyebrow a different way, if he coughs a different way, it will be closely scrutinized because everyone's looking to see, when are we going to start talking about cutting rates. And then, finally, watch what they expect. We're going to get the summary of economic projections. We don't get this every meeting. Every other meeting. This tells you what they expect for GDP, what they expect for unemployment, and what they expect for the federal funds rate. So, a lot to watch here. It all kicks off in about six hours. Can't wait.
