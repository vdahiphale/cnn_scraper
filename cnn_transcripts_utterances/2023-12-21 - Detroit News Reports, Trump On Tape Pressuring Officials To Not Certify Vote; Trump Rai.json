The former president is reportedly caught on tape yet again. In just moments, I'll speak live with the Michigan secretary of state after it has been revealed that Trump allegedly pressured more state officials to not certify the 2020 vote. And the tape includes a surprise accomplice. But, first, let's keep in mind this comes as Colorado is kicking Trump off the ballot for his role in the insurrection. He is on a bender, ripping the state's decision, which is ironic because, frankly, Donald Trump is usually the head cheerleader for team disqualification. He did it as a birther with the bogus argument that Barack Obama wasn't eligible for the presidency. He did it with Ted Cruz in 2016, calling on Iowa to give him the boot. And he also did it with another rival that same year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Kasich shouldn't be allowed to run. Honestly, Kasich should not be allowed to run. He's not doing well in Ohio. Kasich shouldn't be allowed to continue and the RNC shouldn't allow him to continue. He should not be allowed to run. It's very unfair because he's taking our votes.

His issues with the first are lengthy, whether it's calling to silence the press or essentially declaring that the U.S. has one religion, he's used the second on the campaign trail, weaponizing it against Democrats. Legal experts are worried that the third will become relevant as Trump reportedly plots to use the military in American cities. And, of course, the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, and 12th Amendments have all been uniquely relevant throughout Trump's presidency or in his many, many court cases. But let's begin in the state of Michigan, where tonight an incident -- an indecent proposal to stop the 2020 election is caught on tape. The Detroit News says that they have listened to the recordings of the former president, Donald Trump, turning the screws on Republican canvassers in that state. Now, that call took place on November 17th, two weeks after the 2020 election. On the phone was Trump, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and two canvassers from the Wayne County -- from Wayne County, that's Monica Palmer and William Hartman. Now, here's what they were offered. Trump implored the pair to reject the vote, which went for Joe Biden, of course. In exchange, he and McDaniel offered legal protection for the canvassers. Listen here to the reporter who broke the story, describing the moment that he heard Trump's voice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so I believe that he should not be running for president of the United States. And that's why I'm a candidate. I want to see him beat at the ballot box and the voters are going to have to hold him accountable more so than the courts. But the Supreme Court needs to be definitive about this.

After his time as mayor ended, he did not become the Republican presidential nominee as he had wanted to in 2008. Things did not really go well for him. He was sort of on a downward slide and fading from relevance, and Trump brought him back. He was a fixture on cable news. He was a fixture in right wing media.

There are countless people like that.And so I think it would be certainly out of character for Donald Trump to decide that he wants to be extremely generous with Rudy Giuliani. And the loyalty with Rudy and Trump, like loyalty with everyone else in Trump's orbit, is sort of just a one-way street. Trump does not often repay loyalty with loyalty.

And that includes my next guest, Congresswoman Delia Ramirez, who is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. And she says she can't campaign for President Biden.Congresswoman, thanks for joining us. What action, in your view, is the president not taking now that you believe is within his power to deal with what we are seeing at the border? DELIA RAMIREZ, REPRESENTATIVE, (D-ILLINOIS):  Abby, I think that this is a moment where we can choose how we lead. We can lead with courage, with creativity, and with political will to do something about what's happening. I just got back from Guatemala and Honduras. I just saw that footage. And for me, it's personal. I heard the stories of people that were coming to Venezuela to Guatemala. My mother crossed the border pregnant with me and nearly drowned in Rio Grande. We have to find legal pathways. We need to address the issues at the border. But it can't be going to draconian Trump era policies that leaves a woman begging, crying, to not be abandoned and at the risk of dying in those waters.",

We've been working on immigration policy for a very long time. We've been talking about border policy and how we work with the Northern Triangle.We're not really at the table. To have a meeting -- to have a meeting just a couple of days ago to check the box, but not take any of our input or no real negotiation and compromise is pretty insulting to a community that has been working so hard to convince people that Democrats and our President cares deeply about immigration and wants to make sure that we protect asylum. It doesn't feel that way. So, the first thing is we have to actually work together. Secondly, there are people that are coming through that need to be processed immediately. And getting a supplemental that actually gets funds for administrative officers is a very good first step. Finding legal pathways so people stop coming, nearly dying through the border, I think that's a second step. Strengthening our relationship with Guatemala, with Honduras, with Nicaragua, which is challenging there, but through our Latin American relationships to get to the root cause of migration, that's another step. But here's the thing. When we're talking about this moment, I serve in Homeland Security. We are giving Republicans the opportunity to use fear mongering, to exploit this moment, migrants, women and children, to be able to score cheap political points so that they can regain the White House. They have no interest in fixing the border.",
