It happened while it was enroute, you remember, to the Titanic wreck. Five people on board lost their lives. Investigators are trying to determine if there was any negligence or misconduct by Oceangate, the company responsible for that submersible.Joining me now is Tim Taylor, underwater explorer and CEO at Tiburon Subsea. I am well familiar with Tiburon. It is a beautiful place. But this was a terrible tragedy. Of course, the people on the submersible knew that there were always going to be risks. But what questions do you think should be asked in this hearing about this tragedy and how it can be - could be prevented in the future?",

When you get on a ferry or if you get on a passenger vessel, they are all inspected. They're all from - the materials they're built with, to the construction, to the passengers on board certified to take care of and operate these things, they are all inspected in regulated. And that is to protect you, the consumer, when you walk on. Even the subways in Manhattan, you get on the subway in Manhattan, it's regulated. So you know and you can travel safely.It - I would - if I was doing this, I would be asking, who knew when these passengers actually knew that this wasn't a certified vessel that this was not regulated, that it wasn't inspected. And there - it's not just one person who lied on this. It's the whole chain of command. Who's asking the questions. Who's - who's trying to keep them honest. And if they did do that, what happened with the - how - how - how come it didn't come to light. And that's the kind of questions I'd be asking in this - this - this (INAUDIBLE) - this situation.",

And they sold that to consumers as we're more efficient, we're cutting the costs of exploration.But what they're actually doing is no one would allow them to launch a submarine that isn't rated off of - off of those ships. So, no ship, no, no, no support vessel would support them because you cannot crane a submarine off their decks. They would lose their licenses. So, they put it on a barge and towed it behind it. So, they're selling a - they're selling a work around as a feature and a benefit, which, I guess, if - if you're the marketing and sales team, that's good. But if you're the safety and inspection protocol team, that's really not a good idea. And that's what I look forward to this hearing to get to those decisions. We know that the technology failed. We know that they were told it was going to fail. But who looked the other way?",

SNYDER: I think the first question, obviously, that they'll want is, is this a conspiracy? Did this guy act alone? Is he a lone wolf? Possible. Or was he sent by some group to get the president of the United States? I mean, I understand there was a rifle. There was optics on the rifle. That's pretty serious. That - that wasn't somebody who just woke up and thought, well, let me see what I'm doing. We understand he's not from the area. So, are we tracking with a conspiracy?
