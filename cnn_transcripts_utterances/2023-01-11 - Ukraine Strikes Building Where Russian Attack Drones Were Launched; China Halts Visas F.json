Here's Ben Wedeman. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Commander Maksimilian, or just Max as he's known, is finalizing the coordinates for a strike on the Russian-occupied town of Kreminna. Before the war, Max was an English teacher. His 43rd artillery brigade has already seen action in the battles of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and now, Donbas. Their target today, a building in Kreminna from where, he says, attack drones are launched against Ukrainian forces. WEDEMAN (on camera):  This artillery system is known as a Pion. That's a Soviet-era artillery system -- 203 millimeters. The rounds weigh 100 kilos -- 220 pounds. This is a system used both by the Russians and the Ukrainians. WEDEMAN (voice-over):  The cold here chills to the bone, making this work all the more difficult. To protect against Russian drones, they deployed a special weapon that depletes drone batteries. First, the round goes into the barrel, then the core dye, and the trigger cord is pulled, sending the massive round hurtling toward its target 18 kilometers, around 11 miles away. It fires again and again. A forward spotter radios Max that the target has been hit. He tells his men to use shrapnel rounds to finish the job. MAKSIMILIAN \"MAX\", 43RD ARTILLERY BRIGADE:  We damaged it. We destroyed the building where they hide. And I suppose they will not make problems for us in the future. WEDEMAN (voice-over):  A small victory in a big war. Ben Wedeman, CNN, near Kreminna, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

About a dozen countries around the world have placed restrictions on Chinese travelers -- again, because of the mistrust about the extent of the COVID problem. China has said there are 37 cases but pictures and reporting on the ground obviously suggest otherwise. With all of that said, many countries and many cities, such as Hong Kong, are welcoming Chinese travelers -- this new back and forth. These restrictions have been lifted so travelers can come here to Hong Kong. And Chinese tourists are very important to a city like Hong Kong. As you well know, China is the world's second-largest economy. More than a billion people live there. And in 2019, before the pandemic, Chinese tourists didn't just spend millions of dollars around the world, they spent billions of dollars around the world. So whether you're here in Asia, the United States, or Europe, this opening -- this new two-way street of tourism certainly could be a big economic jolt at a time when many economies simply feel like they are in peril, Christine.",
