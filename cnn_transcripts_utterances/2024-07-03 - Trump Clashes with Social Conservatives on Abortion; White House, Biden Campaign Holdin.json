In Tuesday's private conversation, Biden was also chastened as he blamed himself and not his staff for the terrible debate last week. He said, I have done way too much foreign policy, this person said. Biden said that the back-to-back trips to France and Italy, and the jet lag and exhaustion that had caused was detrimental for the debate but wanted to put the debate in the rear-view mirror.

It just reinforces the idea that the next -- the actions by the White House and by the president specifically in the coming days are so crucial to the future of his campaign now. And I will say, I'm also talking not just to Democrats outside the White House, but those inside the campaign that are also watching this meeting with the chief of staff today, watching his events to see sort of what the future is for this campaign at this time.

This has taken their eye off the ball on Donald Trump and the contest.That is why, someone said to me this morning, it took Biden a long time to decide whether and when to run. He is known to be a very deliberate/slow decision-maker. They say he does not likely have that much time in this scenario, A, because the convention is coming up, but B, just the amount of lost time here. Again, the silent campaign has been the Trump campaign because they know this is beneficial to them.
