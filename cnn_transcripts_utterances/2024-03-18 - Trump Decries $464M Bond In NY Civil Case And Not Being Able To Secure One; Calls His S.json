We're keeping him honest. And more exclusive reporting from Haiti and how ordinary people there are taking desperate measures to try and stay safe from the growing violence. Good evening. We begin tonight with the former president, a self-proclaimed multibillionaire, telling a New York court he can't secure the nearly half a billion dollar bond in his civil fraud case. In a court filing today, just a week from the deadline, his attorney wrote: \"The amount of the judgment with interest exceeds $464 million, and very few bonding companies will consider a bond of anything approaching that magnitude.\" Ten million of that 464 million is from the part of the judgment against Eric and Don Jr. And just moments ago, their dad, on his social network, the man who often boasts about how liquid he is, writes: \"The bonding companies have never heard of such a bond of this size before nor do they have the ability to post such a bond even if they wanted to.\" Joining us now a Trump biographer, investigative reporter, David Cay Johnston, CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig and CNN's Kara Scannell. So what did the former president's attorneys say?",

Now, Trump's lawyers say that some of the reason why they wouldn't do this is because they have their own internal limits not to secure a bond in excess of a hundred million dollars. Trump needs five times that amount, so that was one of the big issues.But they said what the major obstacle that they faced was that none of these insurers would accept real estate as collateral against the money that they would underwrite. So they said they wanted only cash or stock, something that could quickly turn into cash, and Trump doesn't have that on hand. They acknowledge that in this filing. And so they came to the judge saying they are unable to get this bond as part of their effort to try to either have the judge knock down the size of the bond or tell them they don't have to post it and just kind of take them on faith that they can - that the New York Attorney General's Office can take his assets once this appeal process is over.",

There's been, frankly, a little bit of misreporting that he cannot appeal until he posts the bond. He can appeal. That's a constitutional right that he has.But the difference is if he manages to somehow come up with the money or get a bond, then Letitia James, who's the plaintiff in this case, cannot try to seize his assets in the meantime while the appeal is pending. But if he fails to post that bond come Monday, yes, he gets to appeal, but Letitia James is going to start seizing his assets. Now, it's not an immediate process. It's not going to turn Trump Tower into \"James Tower\" immediately, but she can start the process to actually take control of and then liquidate, sell off some of those assets.",

There's another example where there was a $30 million bond that was lowered down to six figures. So courts of appeals will take big numbers down on the bond, but it's up to the Court of Appeals.",

People are having to figure out how to run it themselves. And there was an added layer of complexity with that, Anderson, because we'd have folks come up to us and physically grab us and explain to us how they were terrified. And I assumed it was because of the gangs. And they said, not just the gangs, we've now been forced into a community that doesn't want us. And they are also attacking us. And it's because the folks who are their neighbors now look at them as drawing unwanted attention and bringing more gangs into that community. So they fear they're essentially a magnet for more trouble. As far as getting to the hospitals, that is a huge issue right now. And there's basically no ambulance system. So you have people who will often be brought on motorbikes or just carried in some cases, if they're lucky to get through the gang territories, to get some medical treatment. I was inside of one emergency room and standing with the doctor and I said, well, this one is actually quite quiet. And he said, yes, but that doesn't mean that things aren't happening. He said, listen, and there was gunfire going off at the same time. He said, my concern is, I know that it's going to be 12, 24 hours before the people who are wounded by those bullets you hear, before they actually come in here to seek treatment.

It's an in-depth documentary, a fascinating look at how this conspiracy theorist was held accountable finally for the dangerous lies he spread about the 26 children and adults murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:33:58] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Last week, we told you about private conversations involving NFL star quarterback Aaron Rodgers, where he said the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was not real. Our Pam Brown said that in 2013, he had told her it was a government inside job. Another source shared a similar story about Rodgers. Rodgers, who's on the VP shortlist for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. later said in a statement he's never been of the opinion that, quote, \"The events did not take place.\" He didn't cite, actually, which events he was referring to in that statement. The outrageous lie that Sandy Hook was some sort of false flag operation was, of course, propped up and frequently shared by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones now owes more than $1 billion for spreading those lies, which are recounted in a fascinating new documentary, \"The Truth vs. Alex Jones.\" It tells the story of the fight for justice for the parents of the Sandy Hook victims, and how quickly and savagely these lies spread.

And they -- one of the things that C.J. always argued was that when he turned in his phone, when he turned himself in after he'd been named as a suspect from a confidential informant, he turned in his phone when he turned himself in and he figured that the police would get the phone records and see he was in West Philadelphia at the time of the crime, not South Philly, where the crime was.But the police never did that. And he would plea for his incompetent attorney. Please get the phone records. And she never did it. And what they heard -- what the assistant district attorney told me they heard in these phone conversations that he had with his mom and others was C.J. pleading with them, please get the phone records and him having -- C.J. having call after call after call with people trying to track down the phone because he was so convinced the evidence on that phone would prove he was not at the scene of the crime. And that's not what, according to the assistant district attorney I talked to, that's not normally what they hear when they listen in on these conversations. They normally hear people trying to concoct, alibis.",

      "sentences": "Vladimir Putin is basking in an election victory that was really never in doubt. What is surprising though is this, during his victory speech for the first time in years, Putin mentioned the name of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died of the Arctic penal colony last month. His widow, meantime, has been spending the election calling for protests at the polls.More now from CNN's Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A landslide victory for Vladimir Putin that was never in doubt. Securing the Russian president a fifth term in office and solidifying his grip on power with a record 87 percent of the vote. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): There are a lot of tasks ahead of us, but when we are consolidated, and I think now it is understood to everyone, no matter how hard anyone tries to frighten us, whoever tries to suppress us, our will, our consciousness, no one has ever managed to have done such a thing in history. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Both the U.S. and European countries are condemning the election. Any serious opposition candidates were banned in advance, and dissent effectively outlawed. And yet, a surprising show of defiance, with protesters targeting dozens of polling stations across the country. Setting fire to ballot boxes, pouring dye into others, while in Berlin, Germany, thousands turned up at the Russian embassy, following calls from the opposition to swarm polling stations. Including Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, who died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony last month. Navalnaya said she wrote her husband's name on the election ballot and has vowed to continue his work. And in his post-election address, Putin uttered Navalny's name for the first time, claiming he would have agreed to release him in a prisoner swap. PUTIN (voice-over): A few days before Mr. Navalny passed away, some colleagues asked me if there is an idea to exchange Mr. Navalny for some people who are in prison in Western countries. Maybe you believe me, maybe you don't. The person who spoke to me had not finished his sentence yet when I said I agree. But, unfortunately, what happened, happened. There was only one condition that we will exchange him for, and that's not to come back. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Backlash, not just from the U.S. and its allies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy describing the election as, quote, \"sham.\" VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): These days, the Russian dictator is simulating another election. Everyone in the world understands that this figure, as has often happened in history, has simply become addicted to power and is doing everything he can to rule forever. There is no evil he will not commit to prolong his personal power, and there is no one in the world who is safe from this. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia's ally, China, though, was quick to congratulate Putin's re-election, saying it, quote, \"fully reflects the support of the Russian people.\" With no one standing in his way, Putin is now on course to rule for as long as Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.
