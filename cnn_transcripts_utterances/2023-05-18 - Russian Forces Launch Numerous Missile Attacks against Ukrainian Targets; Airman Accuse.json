Explosions heard in Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions as authorities reported a countrywide air attack. This as fierce fighting continues around the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut with Ukraine gaining some ground in recent days. We do have new video to show you from those recent days, showing Bakhmut getting absolutely pummeled in shelling. CNN has obtained new satellite imagery just showing the devastating toll the war has taken on this city in particular over the past year. This as Ukraine prepares for its long awaited counteroffensive to try to reclaim occupied land. Sam Kiley joins us this morning from eastern Ukraine. Sam, good morning.",

But I think the main thing to take away from this latest wave of attacks by cruise missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, the full panoply of sophisticated missile technology fired by the Russians, is once again they are trying to soak up the air defenses of the Ukrainians and expose vulnerabilities such as they could find in Kyiv. There were 30 missiles filed, 29 the Ukrainians claim, we have not independent verification for this, but the Ukrainians claim to have shot down 29 out of 30. Either a missile or debris of a missile hit the southern port city of Odessa killing one person. Three people were killed the previous day in missile strikes and artillery attacks in Kherson around the country.So this is a sort of situation, normal in the sense that the Russians are doing this regularly in order to possibly absorb or get the Ukrainians to spend as much of the air defenses as they can ahead of the planned summer offensive that the Ukrainians are expected to launch, when the Russians will want to get their aircraft in the air more freely to use against the ground forces that the Ukrainians no doubt will unleash. But the ground battle continues in Bakhmut with a peculiar situation in which the Ukrainians are saying they are advancing on the northern and southern flanks around the city, but within the city, the Wagner mercenary group claims to have concentrated the Ukrainians down to a very small area where they say they are fighting bitter battles against diehard Ukrainian fighters holding out to the bitter end it would seem, Poppy.",

But despite those warnings, he was allowed to keep his job. That is the new and alarming revelation that federal prosecutors made yesterday. According to military memos that date back to September of last year, 2022, members of Jack Teixeira's unit at his Air National Guard base alerted commanders after they saw him writing notes about classified intelligence, stuffing those notes into his pocket. He was also reported for doing, quote, \"deep dives\" in searching the base's computer system for intelligence that wasn't related to his job. And all of this came months before he was arrested for allegedly leaking a trove of embarrassing and damaging and revealing documents from the Pentagon to video gamer friends online.Here with more is CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller. John, learning this from federal prosecutors as they are saying there are these three incidents where he was writing notes on classified intelligence, which you know you're not supposed to do, putting it in his pocket. Then he was looking at a trove of information, deep diving, they said, and then he was looking at intelligence that was not related to his primary duty. Why were those incidents not enough to remove him from his role?",

The commanding officer has been suspended from command of it as well as the executive officer. So in the Pentagon's review, clearly they have recognized problems there and basically shut that operation down in terms of the classified intelligence side.But the question is, he is making notes of classified documents. We know from earlier court filings that he was nervous about this because he had been caught, so he just started taking the documents wholesale. [08:05:06] The real answer is, had these three things been treated seriously at the time, this would have been a referral to the base's security officer who is supposed to ensure the security of those documents, and then logically it should have gone to an organization like OSI, the Office of Special Investigations, which is the Air Force's criminal investigation bureau, to see -- one thing is one thing. Two things, three things. He went to a classified briefing and sat in the audience and asked extraordinarily detailed questions about things that nothing had to do with his realm. And remember what his realm was. He was the I.T. guy. His job was to make sure the systems were working. He wasn't an analyst. He wasn't a targeter. He wasn't a drone pilot. So all of this should have been setting off alarm bells sooner.",

So this is a holistic review about where do you put up these fences. But to get back to Kaitlan's question, the real thing is we don't need to change all the rules. We need to go by the rules that were already in place. When alarm bells go off, that has to go up the chain further.",

We learned in a letter from the FBI last night, they ruled out examples of three employees of the FBI whose security clearances had been revoked either because they attended the Capitol riot on January 6th or they espoused essentially alternate theories about it. We're learning that two of those employees that the FBI lays out in this letter are going to be witnesses in this hearing today. So that I think gives you an idea of where these folks are coming from that Jim Jordan is putting forward.One of these men is someone who emailed his colleagues at the FBI telling them to exercise extreme caution and discretion in pursuit of any investigative inquiries or leads pertaining to the events of January 6th. He had also been asked to investigate a possible subject who had been there on January 6th. He said he found nothing. Another FBI employee looked into it and found a bunch of evidence of this person's participation in the Capitol attacks. They're saying one of the witnesses Joran is putting forward has hindered investigations into January 6th. Another one declined to participate in a SWAT attempt to arrest someone who was there on January 6th and went to the FBI, tried to download FBI files on an unauthorized flash drive. So these are the men that Jim Jordan is going to be putting forward in part to make the case that the FBI is somehow weaponized against conservatives. You can imagine Democrats have had a lot of issues with the legitimacy of these whistleblowers. But Jordan is standing behind these guys. His staff says that this is just the FBI's desperate attempt to salvage their reputation, Poppy.",

Instead, the overwhelmingly white male Republican majority is going to focus again and again on abortion.So we will, all of the five women will be fighting against this bill. The big nailbiter is whether the three men who stood with us last time, whether they will stick with us. And they are going to be studying today the bill that the House passed back to us. I heard you mention a minute ago that there was longer time for minors. That's not correct. We passed a bill that would give minors up to -- without our vote, of course, up to six weeks -- I mean an additional six weeks, so up to 12 weeks. But, no, the bill that the House passed back to us takes it back to six, and they have to go to a doctor twice. So in order to get an abortion in South Carolina, the female is going to have to go to the doctor two times, is going to have to get an ultrasound, verify that there is no heartbeat, and wait an hour while she is given literature and things of that nature and asked if she wants to see the ultrasound, and things of that nature.",

One of our concerns is we think one of our colleagues who was called up to active duty, that would be Senator Stephen Goldfinch out of Georgetown County, he apparently might be getting permission from Commander Snow (ph) to allow him to come back and vote on this issue. So I guess, maybe abortion is a national emergency at this point. I don't know.

I haven't spoken to Senator Feinstein. So, I'm not able to comment on how she's doing and her recovery. But I do think that the Senate in our country needs to look forward and think about, how are we going to address these issues going forward.We're going to have more people who are absent, we are going to have more people who fall sick, we are going to have more senators who age, given the age of the body. And I think we need some forward-looking policies, not just focusing on Senator Feinstein, although, I understand the concerns, but really look at how are we going to deal with this structurally. This is unfortunately, not the first time that we've had this situation where we have real concerns about how senators are recovering and whether they're able to come back and really do the job.",
