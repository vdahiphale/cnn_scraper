If you're just joining us here, our top stories today.Former President Donald Trump completed his pre-sentencing interview with the New York Probation Office following his hush money trial conviction. Trump's sentencing is set for July the 11th. The jury in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial will resume deliberations today. The U.S. President's son faces three felony charges related to a gun purchase. Prosecutors say he was using illegal drugs and lied about it on a federal form. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will soon depart Tel Aviv for the Gaza Humanitarian Assistance Conference in Jordan. In Israel, Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed the urgency in reaching a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Now to a renewed push for that ceasefire in Gaza as the United Nations holds a key vote on a plan to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas. The U.N. Security Council on Monday adopted a U.S. drafted resolution which endorses a proposal for a permanent ceasefire and the release of the hostages held by Hamas. The resolution calls on both parties to implement the terms, quote, without delay and without condition. Hamas said it welcomed the resolution and is ready to engage with mediators. But whether Israel and Hamas will move forward remains unclear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Colleagues, today this council sent a clear message to Hamas. Accept the ceasefire deal on the table. Israel has already agreed to this deal and the fighting could stop today if Hamas would do the same. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Kylie Atwood has more. [04(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the view from the helmets of the Israel Defense Forces as they unleashed heavy gunfire, searching for Israeli hostages held by Hamas. A daring daytime raid that freed four of those kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th and held captive ever since. It was an operation that took weeks to plan after receiving intelligence that the hostages were being held in apartment buildings inside the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.",

The magnitude of the moment struck. Then he, quote, immediately reported that the diamond is with us and in good health. Some of the special forces were disguised as displaced Palestinians and members of Hamas's military wing, eyewitnesses told CNN. And there were also reports of large gunfire after the hostages were rescued. At least 274 Palestinians were killed in the operation and hundreds injured. That's according to the Gaza authorities, who do not distinguish between civilian and military casualties. The Israel Defense Forces dispute that number, saying the death toll was under 100.",

We don't know exactly what it is that they're going to do. ATWOOD (voice-over): As Secretary of State Antony Blinken travels to the Middle East to continue ratcheting up pressure on Hamas to take the deal, he also isn't sure what Hamas will do. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I can't put myself, none of us can put ourselves in the minds of Hamas or its leaders. So we don't know what the answer will be.

We haven't yet heard a direct and public show of support from the Israeli government for this peace proposal.In fact, yesterday we have been hearing some mixed messages at the U.N. Security Council. We heard from Israel's representative to the U.N. saying that Israel would not engage in meaningless, endless negotiations with Hamas. The objectives of the Israeli government and military remain the same, that they want to see the full destruction of Hamas and the full return of all hostages held captive in Gaza. Of course, in this three-phase peace proposal laid out by the United States at the U.N. Security Council, there are the parameters, the provisions for the full release of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza in exchange of Palestinian prisoners. But it also calls for the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, for the return of Palestinian civilians to all parts of the Gaza Strip. And, of course, what Hamas wants to see ensured in this ceasefire agreement is the territorial integrity of the Gaza Strip and, of course, no demographic shifts, crucially, within the Gaza Strip. Now, what we have heard so far from Hamas is a statement yesterday off the back of that resolution vote saying that they welcome the deal. As you mentioned, they want to carry on with discussions with mediators, that they are open to those ongoing discussions. It remains to be seen whether they issue a full and firm agreement to this deal. But we also haven't seen that full and firm agreement by the Israeli government. The U.S. continues to reiterate that they believe that the Israeli government will back this deal. But, of course, we've been hearing different messages from those far-right elements of Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition who do not want to see this deal being signed.",
