The one is -- one thing is we have to bring those costs down, those inflationary pressures down and it has to be all government approach. As you said, the Fed does their thing. I don't comment on Fed policy.

The President is making investments in those areas right now, so that we can have a strong America moving forward. We invented the chip here in the United States of America, the microchip. We don't make any, we're going to be making them in America over the next five years, because we're building manufacturing plants here in the United States that will help us ease pressures. The President took on pharmaceutical companies and in Inflation Reduction Act, he won, and we're going to bring cost down for insulin drugs and then combined what people pay out of pocket.

We have four deals that are still out there. We're going to be getting the results, hopefully, the next week or so. The members are voting on it. We have two that got voted down. It's imperative that the companies and the union stay at the table and try and get in the deal so we can get that vote out there.At the end of the day, if we don't have a deal, one of these unions for some reason doesn't get to an agreement with the company, then the way that the Railroad Act works is Congress will have to take action to avert a strike in our country.

This is a man remember who the defense is clearly trying to show his soft side, or maybe that's what he is trying to show. He's also talked a lot about historical things.He was asked about, for example, 9/11. What that has to do with the attack on the Capitol is another thing but he was asked about 9/11, and he started to choke up and cry, talked about having colleagues he knew that were inside of the towers. He talked about him himself being a libertarian, having worked for Ron Paul, that he -- you know, he was really trying to show that this group that he formed, the Oath Keepers, which he formed in 2009 isn't, in his words, racist or anti- anything, anti-LGBTQ. He talked about being at different areas and places. For example, he was invited, he said, to Lexington Green, where people came together after they were formed. And he started to cry on the stand talking about the historical issue that -- or incident that happened at the battle of Lexington Green. That is where the first shots of the American Revolution happened, for those who are unfamiliar. And so, it was sort of meandering what we heard from him, but he was making some very clear points to the jury trying to set up that he is showing them that he's not racist. He's telling them that he is not anti-anything. And he talked about going, for example, to Ferguson, Missouri. And I remember seeing the Oath Keepers there in the death of Michael Brown who was shot by a Ferguson, Missouri Police officer and there were huge protests and some riots after that happened. There, he said, he only went there to help protect businesses. He mentioned that they were black businesses. So he's setting the scene personally to show his personal side to show, if you will, his soft side. I don't think I have ever seen Stewart Rhodes or talked to him at any time where he choked up the way he has done on the stand in front of this jury. So clear, they're trying to set a scene about who he is personally, as they go forward. They have not yet gotten into what happened on and right before January 6. They haven't talked anything about the plotting or the conspiracy that they're accused of. They really kind of set the scene for who he is in front of the jury.",

The National Retail Federation is projecting sales growth of 6 to 8 percent. Now, that's not too shabby. That's roughly in line with the last 10 years. But it is a big slowdown from the record of 13.5 percent last year.And in many ways, it makes sense that people might chill out a bit with their spending this year. I mean, inflation is obviously very high. We have these recession fears and some companies, especially tech companies have been laying off workers. Now I think the good news is that the experts are expecting a lot of discounts here. Retailers have a lot of stuff that they need to get rid of these high inventories. And so that does mean we're going to see some discounts. Adobe is actually calling for massive discounts online, especially for computers, electronics and toys. And a lot of retailers they kicked off this holiday shopping season early. They offer these Black Friday, like discounts starting in October. The bad news, though, is that as we know, paychecks are not keeping up with the cost of living. And so, we are expecting that people are going to have to dip into savings this holiday season. And they're going to have to tap credit cards, and neither of those things are sustainable. We have to also remember that right now, the Federal Reserve is rapidly raising interest rates to try to fight inflation. And so that has driven up credit card rates to near record highs. There's never a good time to carry over a credit card balance. But, Jim, in a lot of ways, this is probably the worst time to rack up a bunch of credit card debt because you splurged on, you know, Christmas gifts.",
