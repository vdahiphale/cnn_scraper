      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\" this Monday. I hope you had a great weekend or a fantastic start to the week, whereveryou're joining us from its good to be with you for the next hour. Coming up, a surprise move by OPEC Plus, the oil producers group saying they'll cut output by more than 1 million barrels a day from next month. As you would expect and as you can see in front of you all prices are surging on the news, we'll discuss the implications and what it means for global inflation very shortly? Plus, a bombing suspect arrested; the latest on the explosion in St. Petersburg that killed a prominent Russian military blogger. And in just a few hours time too Former President Donald Trump expected to land here in New York, the first time in American history that a President has faced criminal charges. And last but most definitely not least the world's first lab grown shrimp? Yes, you heard me the CEO of Shiok meets with her ambitious plans to reduce farming and fishing. In the meantime investors also fishing for returns on the first trading day of the second quarter the NASDAQ Futures as you can see slipping. But what a performance from the first quarter; they fell hook line and sinker for a storming 17 percent rally for the tech heavy index. So giving a little bit back today, at least pre market we shall see what happens it's best quarterly gain though in fact, in more than two years shrugging off banking sector volatility and in fact, benefiting from it. Higher market volatility meant lower interest rate expectations, and lower interest rate expectations are good for tech stocks and we certainly saw that. And then in the meantime an upbeat mood across Asian markets earlier Monday too Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai all higher boosted by energy stocks as you would expect. And that brings us back to that output reduction from OPEC Plus, which is where we begin today's show. Anna Stewart joins us now with all the details. Anna, the observation straight away from me not only the knee jerk reaction in oil markets, but also this is the largest OPEC members taking this decision and therefore more likely to adhere to the cuts that they promised.",

      "sentences": "And we also had that element of surprise, didn't we? This coming on a weekend not during an OPEC meeting itself so Ithink that surprise has also caught the markets off guard. And this comes despite the fact that China oil hungry China, of course has come back to the market in full since ending its zero-COVID policy. So in terms of demand for oil that has increased since the last output cut in October, so we are seeing prices much higher this morning. I think they were above 8 percent higher when they open this morning, they come back a little bit some analysts saying this morning that they could hit $100 a barrel by the end of the year. And we can show you where those cuts fall as you see the big players obviously taking the biggest cut Saudi Arabia opting to take 500,000 barrels per day off the market. Russia extending its cut that already existed, we were largely expecting that and also big cuts from players like the UAE, Kuwait, and Iraq overall more than 1.6 million barrels off the market. So this speaks to the fact that the cartel clearly wanting to put a floor under prices. But also I think aren't that worried in terms of market share. And I wonder whether that's to do with U.S. shale output slowing, and also looking at those U.S. strategic reserves, which are now at the lowest level since 1983 the U.S. still hasn't bought oil back to fill up its reserves, which I think also feeds into this story.",

And let's be clear, particularly in the United States, there was a lot of noise and disgruntled commentary about that. And yet, we did see oil prices fall. They match the growth slowdown that we were seeing this time around; perhaps the story's a little bit different. What does it mean for global inflation? I think that's the big question now.",

But the U.S. response was very much the same from the White House Spokesperson from the NationalSecurity Council saying they think it's inadvisable given market uncertainty and it does really muddy that outlook, doesn't it for economic growth for inflation, given so much hinges really on energy prices? And we're looking at whether it's the Federal Reserve, the ECB in Brussels, and the Bank of England over here, all looking to come to the end of their rate rises. That hinges on inflation and energy is such a big part of that. So it has really complicated that picture. And I think for anyone who is already struggling with inflation, the cost of living crisis, the cost of loans of debt of mortgages, this potentially isn't really that good news.",

We just don't know at this stage. But she - it was a 24 second video where she's being questioned by a male voice says that she was at the scene where Vladlen Tatarsky this blogger was attending an event, was giving an event that she gave him a figurine and it exploded. She was then asked who gave her that figurine and she declined to talk about that? So strange, bizarre video we don't exactly know the circumstances of that yet. And obviously, we're not showing that to you. But obviously this is also very political Julia. This is happening in the context of the war in Ukraine the Russian authorities, including the Kremlin Spokesman, blaming Ukraine for this. Dmitry Peskov say, you know, they have been linked with terrorist activities in past. They've been killing people since 2014 he said and justified the military operation because of those that this is why we're carrying out this special military operation in Ukraine. But of course, this has happened this was an attack in Russia's Second city a pretty major attack more than 30 people injured alongside that one death, given the amount of resources that Russia is now piling into its national security they clearly cannot let this one lie Julia.",

So if you take a piece of shrimp, and you d-shell it and d-rein it, the meat inside is just pure muscle, and maybe fat in lobster and crab, but in shrimp, its pure muscle. So we take the stem cells, and these stem cells are like cell zero of an animal. So they're like the bird cell of any organ any tissue. So we take the stem cells outside of the animal's body and these cells have an amazing capability to grow outside of the animal's body. Because we mimic the surrounding two feel, makes them sort of trick them into thinking that they're still inside the animal. So these cells then start forming the muscle outside of the animal's body in a large stainless steel tank called a bioreactor or a fermented. Much like a brewery but instead of beer, you're sort of brewing seafood and meats here. And how we do that is by feeding these stem cells with nutrients and that's where your question about chemicals and hormones and all that comes in. So one of the largest codes that we have crafted at Shiok Meats is not using any hormones or chemicals, or any of the animal serums or any extracts from animals for this. This is called a nutrient mix or a nutrient broth much like a soup for the cells to grow in, and a nutritional sort of a protein shake. It's made up of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and all of that. And we extract all of these ingredients from plants. And we grow this liquid medium along with the cells. And in about four to six weeks, we get real shrimp meat real crab or lobster meat. This is sort of the shortened version of it. Of course, to answer your question on scale, we are not there yet. I think the industry is less than a decade old, the whole cultured lab grown cultivated industry. So we are all trying to scale up our technology. I would say majority of the companies that started in the last, let's say five to seven years, including ours are at a stage where we can produce small quantities of it in smaller kilograms or pounds. But we are all aiming to get to that mass production that we need for the rest of the population that will take about a decade or so.",

I think that company and that Professor make it a few $100 right now. We are at about $50 to $75, a kilogram right now, which is still premium priced, I would say, for shrimp, but not so premium price for lobster and crab, if you think about it. And also in our case, if you're paying $50, you get hundred percent meat, you don't get the shell or the wastage or any of that.

So I would say early adopters for us are either flexitarians or people who don't eat meat for animal cruelty or ethical reasons for example, vegans who have become vegans in their lifetime over their lifetime. So we are seeing a lot of interest from early. Early interest from Millennials, Generation-Zs the younger generation that is extremely worried about the environment, animal cruelty, nutrition, at the same time, what is happening to their body, as well as the animal's body eventually when they eat meat. So I would say it's more on the flexitarian. But the essential target market in the longer run is actual meat and seafood eaters. Because what we're telling them is, here's another choice for you to make. You can enjoy the same taste of shrimp, crab and lobster, or red meat or white meat or whatever it is, but it doesn't have to come from a slaughtered animal.",

Founders and those in these companies that we've spoken to even recently have said, look, it is early days, to your point too.

Singapore is also something that I see tying a lot of the investment and the location of these kinds of businesses.

      "sentences": "For sure, I mean, I have a very interesting anecdote here. When we started in August 2018, Singapore wasn't talking about food tech, or foodsecurity or any of them. I mean, food security is always on our minds here, because like you said, we import 90 percent of our food. But then six months after we started the company, the week, we launched our prototype dumplings, Singapore announced this whole foods story and 30 by 30, where they want to increase their local food production from the current 10 percent to 30 percent by 2030. So much millions of dollars are going to get injected into this industry. And we're going to support plant based and cultivated insect base and so on. The whole bus has been awesome for us that boost has been awesome. But I think Singapore is basically setting an example for the world to show how the government, the private, the universities, the education sector, the startups, the large MNC companies can all come together to solve one big problem, which is food. And food is so essential for our livelihoods on a day to day basis. And I think through the pandemic, we learned that we weren't able to get the products that we generally walk into a supermarket and buy, it was hard to go and source them. There were so many food supply chain issues, disruptions here and there. And I think it also showed us that regional food production is what we should look at. So I think Singapore strengthened all of that. And they're working towards a step by step sort of a format towards showing the world how it can be done. And also bringing in the regulatory framework, which is so important for cultivated meat as such. So we need a proper framework. It is a novel product we need at most safety assessments done. And we are happy that Singapore is one of the first countries to come up with a regulatory framework and also approve a product a couple of years ago.",

But yes, I do think the timing of it was a little bit surprising in the sense that. You know, I am very much - I owe rather I understand the logic behind this. The fact that OPEC needed the market to stabilize outside of the macro mayhem, so that when they do put through the cuts, the oil markets actually pay attention, rather than putting to the cuts at a time when it was all about the banking crisis. And even if they cut production, we could have still sold off $10. So I understand the logic and the timing of it. But and I did somewhat expect that there is definitely something in motion.

Weknow lending will tighten up that does mean we are looking at a recessionary environment. Our balances actually talk about or they have factored in a recession in the U.S. in Europe. And that does mean oil demand is going to slow. I'm in Asia right now, China is reopening. It is definitely booming over here. But there are parts of China that are slower to reopen than other parts. Jet is one of them; you can't get flights, because flights take time to be added back. So there are headwinds to demand. And I think the main thing is people were just very scared. And a lot of people were coming in and shorting Crude Oil, expecting it to go down or rather betting on it to go down. That's what OPEC wanted to stop and stop very clearly saying, we are still looking after the market, we will ensure that stocks don't build even if demand goes down.
