We will continue to follow all the action ahead of his expected appearance in court on Thursday. But first there's plenty more going on elsewhere in the world global stocks under pressure a slight knee jerk reaction I think after a surprise U.S. debt downgrade by the ratings agency Fitch cutting America's AAA long term debt rating to AA plus. It follows a similar move by S&amp;P more than a decade ago now regular viewers will know exactly what I think of the usefulness let's call it that of rating agencies. So I leave it to smarter economists to comment. Bizarre Internet, Absurd and Off-base those are some of my favorite choices. Anyway, there was a point to it, I think and that's politics. Fitch fears a deeply divided U.S. Congress and its ability to tackle excess debt and things like skyrocketing social benefit costs. Now the Fitch ditch might be a slight stimulant for investors looking to take profits after a strong summer on and a solid earnings season so far, and auto giant forward one of the large blue chip firms to report better than expected second quarter results. Ford beating on earnings and raising guidance amid strong demand. But losses inside its EV its electric vehicle division are widening. And they also pushed back their production timetable. We'll hear from the company's CFO John Lawler later on in the show. But first, let's get more on that reaction to the U.S. debt downgrade. Arlette Saenz join us now where President Biden is on vacation, I believe so yes, you're in a holiday town to talk about this, which is an interesting one. The White House reaction to this, I think was also interesting. We've got the economist reaction I think, deeply skeptical, the White House sharing, I think their confusion and annoyance about this?",

Now Russia continues to target Ukraine's grain infrastructure in the Odessa region, this time drone strikes damaging a major port on the Danube River near Romania a NATO nation.

And typically for Moscow, they're using violence against civilian targets again here, but startlingly too these attacks. The closest that Russia has got to potentially hitting a NATO member Romania, these port facilities lining the Danube River that separates Ukraine and Romania. Romania's President Klaus Iohannis, saying clearly that this is unacceptable, calling it a war crime and it again, I think, adds to the potential here of an escalation in this conflict. I think it's likely that Moscow does not want to provoke NATO into a larger role in this war. Remember, they are already arming and assisting Ukraine a lot. But we've also seen a protest from the Polish President about an incursion, they say by Belarusian aircraft across the border in the last 24 hours and so this potentially forms part of a pattern of Russia now increasingly desperate, struggling on the southern front lines here to hold territory, pushing and provoking NATO in small elements like this. Now that may just be feeding into President Putin's narrative that they are at war with the entire NATO bloc that's perhaps the Kremlin's way of explaining the disastrous conduct of this invasion so far, but it is certainly, I think, a moment of pause and too important to remember that this grain deal isn't just about negotiation between Ukraine and Russia here. There are African States much of the world waiting for these grain shipments to resume in order to keep food prices at a sustainable level here. So coming as we also see today, concerns about how Ukraine is progressing in the East. They are suggesting some potential advanced there and in the south. But the counter offensive still moving at a pace that is not necessarily as fast as Ukraine would like it to Julia.",

Jack Smith, the Special Counsel whowas overseeing this investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election says Donald Trump was \"Determined to stay in power, and that he and his six unindicted co conspirators essentially carry out a plot a failed plot to overturn the legitimate results\". The indictment really details a sweeping case that Jack Smith and his fellow prosecutors are put together against the Former President. You know, as you said, they include four counts, including conspiracy charges that are really serious and carry very serious repercussions if convicted, and obviously Donald Trump has not been found guilty. And, you know, guilty until proven innocent. But this indictment is historic on several fronts. It says that Donald Trump and these unindicted co-conspirators worked for two months after the election, to overturn the results through a variety of ways all the way leading up to January 6th when, as you know rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol and tried to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden's legitimate victory. So Trump was doing this all by spreading what he knew to be lies. That's what prosecutors say. And that's what this case is really built around the idea that Trump knew what he was saying about allegations of widespread voter fraud and about the election being stolen were lies, and yet he used those to try to sow distrust in the election results and ultimately try to overturn the election, his election loss into a win.",

Though there was a bit of a reality check for investors regarding its electric car ambitions. Now, although sales in the period jumped to nearly $2 billion, Ford said its annual losses in that division this year could hit $4.5 billion. That was way higher than expected. They also push back their production targets too. Now while demand for EVs may be a touch slower than expected. The firm also said it's working on a slate of new hybrid models to facilitate the transition. Now I spoke to Ford's Chief Financial Officer John Lawler about EVs and why take up has been slightly slower than anticipated. John, fantastic to have you with us, a fascinating and a strong quarter, I think for Ford.

First of all, one of the things that we've done by joining the Tesla charging network is we've given ourcustomers a much broader base for charging to ease some of that charge anxiety. The other thing we're doing is our dealers are installing high speed chargers as well. So about second quarter next year, our customers will have choice of about 25,000 chargers across the country, which we think of make a big difference for them. And for when it comes to the rest of the adoption, where you've moved from the early adopters into early majority. So those customers are going to behave a little bit differently. We're seeing how their needs need to be met. We're seeing that price is important. We're also seeing that charging is important. And we're addressing both of those issues. So the response we had to recent price changes on our lightening vehicle has been tremendous. I think our order take is up about six times since we've reduced the price. We've tripled production. So I think we're in a good spot. And I think we're in the spot where you're going to continue to see us ramp in volume. And you're going to continue to see the adoption rate come along.
