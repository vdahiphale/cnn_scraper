      "sentences": "The discount chain, Dollar Tree, says it will close almost 1,000 stores, nearly all from the Family Dollar chain that it bought out. And that will leave a void for many low- income customers who rely on discount and dollar stores for groceries and essentials.The stores have come under fire for poor conditions and for product safety issues. At the same time, the CEO said Dollar Tree plans to offer more expensive items, including some that are worth up to $7,to cater to its new customers, many of whom make more than $100,000 a year. We have CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich following this story for us. Tell us, Vanessa, what led to this decision. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: You have 1,000 stores, Family Dollar stores that are going to be closing over the next couple of years. The first 600 closing this year and then about 370 over the next couple of years. The CEO of Family Dollar saying that the reason for these closures is that inflation and fewer government assistance programs for their low- income customers has really impacted them. And that has impacted the amount of money that those folks can spend in stores. There was a purchase that was made. Dollar -- Dollar Tree bought Family Dollar in 2015, and there was an effort to improve a lot of the Family Dollar stores. But they were hit, as you mentioned, with safety violations, food violations that actually resulted in a fine by the Department of Justice for over $40 million and Family Dollar really took a hit there. On the flip side though, the parent company, Dollar Tree, as you mentioned, is finding success with Americans who are making over $125,000. So those $1 items are now being -- are going to be $7 items in some cases, because they're finding more traction with those types of customers. But ultimately, the closure and the focus on the Family Dollar family, closing 1,000 stores is really designed to set the entire company up for profitability.",

      "sentences": "It's going to have an impact. Dollar stores, Family Dollar have been very important to Americans who are bringing in lower incomes.Family Dollar is mostly in urban centers and they have faced obviously competition from other stores. Dollar General, a separate company, has found incredible success in rural areas because, as you mentioned, there are places around the country that don't have access to grocery stores within a 30-mile radius. And Dollar General has, in fact, provided that for them. But in both situations, when you have dollar stores in urban centers and in more rural areas, it can create a little bit of competition for smaller mom-and-pop shops that are providing healthy food options for people. The problem is that when you put $1 store in these types of areas where there are smaller grocery stores, people are spending their money on perishables and shampoo and toothpaste at the dollar stores. And not then spending that money in the grocery stores, in addition to all of the fresh produce that they're buying. So there's a flip side to this. It's great for people who don't have access to supermarkets within a large radius. However, for some of the smaller mom-and-pop stores, it has put them out of business. But clearly dollar stores are an important part of the American landscape. And Americans are going to be feeling the loss of 1,000 stores over the next couple of years in the Family Dollar family -- Brianna?",

Rodgers, like Kennedy, has been one to embrace anti-vax conspiracy theories, covid conspiracy theories, that sort of thing. This is complicated because he says -- he ran out onto the field carrying a flag at the beginning of the NFL season with the Jets. He promptly got injured and that was the end of his season. But he's a guy who has -- has clearly shown an interest in doing other things. Says he wants to keep playing with the Jets. But then he also auditioned to be the host of \"Jeopardy!\" And like the Jets, he lost. Moving on to Jesse Ventura. Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, he was a former pro wrestler who won the governorship of Minnesota in 1998, promising a lot of reforms there. He said, sort of famously, \"My job is not to make people comfortable,\" while the deficit went through the roof, they had different things change there. He had one term. So obviously, he's succeeded. People weren't very comfortable, so he was out.",

And he said there's very little focus now on developing players and help helping them be successful in life. He also said there is no framework in place to keep schools from buying their way to the best players, which melts healthy competition. \"Bleacher Report's\" college football writer, Morgan Moriarty, is here with us on this. OK, Morgan, so it -- at this roundtable yesterday, Saban said all the things that I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching no longer exist in college athletics. He got quite a bit of blowback for that. He kind of got roasted to a crisp on social media. But what are Saban's major gripes here? MORGAN MORIARTY, COLLEGE FOOTBALL WRITER, \"BLEACHER REPORT\": Yes. So his comments obviously yesterday made a lot of waves and headline in general. And I did think they were particularly interesting because he was asked in the days after his retirement, you know, did you retire because of the various issues facing college football? Obviously, there's NIL, how that affects recruiting, the transfer portal, the kind of unrestricted free agency that we have in college football. And he pushed back against that a little bit initially. But it's clear from his comments, yesterday, that this did play a factor into his decision. And I think, when you have a guy like Nick Saban, who is, no question, college football's most dominant and greatest coach of all time -- I don't think there's any argument to go against that. He did things at such a high level and created a gold standard throughout the sport. And he was able to continue and do that even with the changes with NIL and recruiting. He was still recruiting Alabama, putting together top classes, utilizing things like NIL and the transfer portal to find success. But it is clear that with the current model that college football and college sports has currently, there is very little restrictions over things like NIL and things like the transfer portal and how that can impact recruiting. And I really do think that he was periodically able to kind of evaluate his program from a multi-year basis. And with the way that things are going with college athletes wanting to maximize their potential, he wasn't really able to do that. It was turning more into a year-by-year basis. And you do see that in terms of how college sports -- obviously, college football, but college athletics have to kind of rebuild and reevaluate their rosters each and every year. So for a guy who's accomplished so much in his career and he's -- who's already endured so much change in the sport, it was very obvious that he saw the way the sport is going and said, you know what, this is enough for me, I have nothing else to prove, I'm ready to step away.",

I think that that is a good idea. I don't know if that's the end-all, be-all solution. I think the bigger thing kind of coming down the pipe for the NCAA is this notion of athletes becoming employees of their respective schools. And we saw, last week, Dartmouth men's college basketball team voting to unionize, 13 to two. That came after the NLRB allowed them to do so, approved this unionization. And I think that that's kind of the next big thing that's coming down the pipe for the AA. And Saban is against that. But I do think if you have things like contracts in place, your minimum salary caps, that would help alleviate a lot of the current issues that are facing college athletics.",
