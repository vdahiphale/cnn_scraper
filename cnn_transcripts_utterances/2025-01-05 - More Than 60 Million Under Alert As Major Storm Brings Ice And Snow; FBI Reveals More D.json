We're also seeing a dangerous combination of snow, ice, and freezing rain hitting those states, as well as parts of Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. And as the evening progresses, that system will then keep heading east. Thousands of flights nationwide have already been delayed or canceled on account of this major storm.

And based on information that we got earlier from the FBI, it seems that it was probably weeks, if not months. And let me tell you why. We know, for example, that Shamsud-Din Jabbar visited New Orleans at least twice in the months prior to the attack, once in October and then again in November.The other crucial piece of information that was revealed by the FBI today was that Jabbar also traveled internationally. He went to Cairo, Egypt in the summer of 2023, and then a few days later to Ontario, Canada. Earlier, I had an opportunity to ask the special agent in charge of the FBI here in New Orleans whether they know at this point if there was any connection, whether Jabbar had any connection with a terrorist organization that might have financed his trips, and this is what he had to say about it.

So that's the Super Bowl, inauguration, State of the Union. What's new this year is January 6th. President Biden designated January 6th as an NSSE. He did this before Donald Trump won. So it wasn't at all clear what January 6th would be like. But basically, to put. D.C. security and safety features to have sort of a lead federal agency to ensure not that just they're ready, but that they were doing preplanning for anything that could happen. I think tomorrow is fine. I mean, I think there's not lots of rallies, there's not lots of protests. You always worry about a lone wolf. This is, you know, Donald Trump wanted a crowd to come and the crowd came and got into the Capitol and people were killed four years ago. That's not happening this year because he won. And there's going to be a smooth and peaceful transition of power as President Biden has promised. You know, there will be a lot of people with narratives about this, but that's just basically why tomorrow is not a big deal. January 20th is always an NSSE, always focused on it's the variables of what January 19th, this rally, is going to look like. It's at a coliseum.

It can be a very long and arduous process, but we have seen presidents in years past utilize it to sort of push their agenda through Congress when it is stalemated.And that is what the speaker is hoping he can do with many of Trump's top priorities, including border security package, extending the debt limit ceiling, but also extending the Bush -- excuse me, the Trump-era tax cuts and some of the tax cuts that he promised during the campaign as well, like no taxes on tips or overtime. However, there clearly is also some disconnect between what Johnson is proposing and what the incoming Senate majority leader, John Thune, believes can get accomplished. Take a listen to what these both had to say this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I think at the end of the day, President Trump is going to prefer, as he likes to say, one big, beautiful bill. And there's a lot of merit to that because we can put it all together. One big up or down vote which can save the country quite literally, because there are so many elements to it, and it will give us a little bit more time to negotiate that and get it right. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): We have the same set of objectives. We want to get to the same destination, but I think at times there will be differences in how we get there, and understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the president and help him understand I think what the, you know, what the contours are of what we can accomplish here in the Senate and what's realistic.

In the Senate you need 60 votes to do pretty much everything that is not -- except for confirming appointees and justices, judges, that is not part of this reconciliation. So senators are kind of used to a more accommodating style. That's what they, you know, are sort of marinated in through their career.Thune certainly comes out of that tradition himself. You know, Johnson was someone who was basically elevated from the right end of his caucus, and you can lose sight of the fact that Johnson, his you know, his experience is coming out of the much further to the right than the several of the previous speakers, McCarthy and Ryan. Johnson was a leader in the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the House. So he is someone who I think is going to be deferential to the right and what we have seen, I think as I mentioned, both in the vote to make him speaker and in the difficulty they had last year in getting the votes to keep the government open is that the principal pressure on him is going to be from the right and over a very specific issue, demanding bigger cuts in spending to accompany -- to be part of this reconciliation. And Jessica, it's easy to forget, but that in Trump's first term, his lowest point in public opinion, his weakest job approval apart from January 6th was when they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.

In the past, you know, you had not only Donald Trump in 2020, but 139 House Republicans and eight Senate Republicans voted to reject the election results in the state. The key states that Biden won and, in effect, overturn the election.Now, with Trump winning, they're all saying it was fine and there was no fraud. Well, is that the new benchmark? Because if Republicans lose in 2028 or 2032 and our two-party system, the wheel always turns, are those Republicans going to revert and suddenly say, now that we've lost, there was rampant fraud after there was no problem when we won? It's also, I think, an important anniversary in terms of Trump's pledge to pardon, you know, a significant number of the January 6th rioters. One thing we know is that I think Trump won because there were a substantial slice of voters who held other reservations about him, but voted for him anyway because they thought he would be better on the two issues they cared most about, inflation and to some extent, immigration. But pardoning the January 6th rioters was one of those other Trump agenda items that they kind of sublimated as they were making their decision, because it's a pretty popular idea. And I think this will be an interesting test as we go forward as Trump advances some of the ideas that voters kind of put in the lower shelf, but which face public resistance, can he sustain the broad support and the expansion of his support that he demonstrated in the November election?",

The numbers, 34, sound about right for an initial swap. Of course, you'll remember there were more than that released a number of months after the terror attack. But the other conditions, a permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza at a time that they're building a buffer zone inside what used to be considered Gaza, I suspect will get in the way of this.

But we know that the Chinese knew how to play him in the first term by dangling trade deals that never came to full fruition along the way.There's a very hawkish group he has appointed, including in the Defense Department, including his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who want to get out, protect Taiwan, focus on that to the extent that they are interested in getting out of the business of supplying the Ukrainians so that they can focus on the Indo-Pacific. And then there are going to be those who just want to pull back and not deal with China. That's the true America firsters. And I think the big question is going to be which faction here wins out?

It's going to be $9 for passenger vehicles if you are driving into Manhattan during peak hours south of Central Park, essentially at 60th Street, which is where I am now. This is the end of the tolling zone. If you're going north, there will be no toll, but if you're coming south, you will be tolled. You will be tolled once a day. So it's not like every time you drive past it you get tolled. And it varies if you drive a truck or a commercial vehicle or a motorcycle, for example.Now, Jessica, if you take a cab, for example, like I did in order to get here today, that cost is also going to be passed down to the passenger. I paid an additional $1.75 as part of my cab fare in order to get here today. If you take a yellow cab, it's going to be $0.75. But again, the whole point of this is to encourage New Yorkers to ride more public transit, to raise the money that is needed to improve the system and expand it. And in the long run, to have a much better quality of environment and the air here in New York City. But as you said at the beginning, it has not come without fierce opposition.",
