As you can see the Dow is down over one percent, that's a loss of 382 points. Well, those are the markers and these are the main events: Stocks in regional lenders are under pressure as investors worry more banks could be on the brink of collapse. Late night television goes dark as Hollywood writers go on strike. And free time, the CEO of the iconic magazine tells me how she plans to draw in new reader by dropping its payroll. Live from Dubai, it is Tuesday, May 2nd, I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening, and tonight investors have fresh doubts about the strength of some US bank. Shares in PAC West and Western Alliance are sharply lower. Steep losses for other regional lenders as well. As you can see PAC West is down 25 percent, Western Alliance down 16.2 percent. Now the selloff comes one day after First Republic was taken over by JPMorgan. CEO, Jamie Dimon said on Monday that this part of the banking crisis was over. His statement hasn't restored broader confidence. The Dow is down around 400 points. As you can see, it is red across the board. The S&amp;P and NASDAQ also in the red. We've got Matt Egan joining us. Matt, great to see you. Let me tell you, putting up one fire doesn't mean the risk is out of the system as Jamie Dimon might have hoped and the numbers speak for themselves today. The question is what is under the hood?",

And clearly, we're seeing more selloff in the regional bank sector. We've now had three banks collapse in just the last seven weeks. That's after no bank failures in 2021 or 2022. I don't know that there is a single catalyst for today's selloff. I do think that in hindsight, yesterday's action was telling because here we had kind of the best-case scenario, JPMorgan coming to the rescue to buy First Republic, and yet, regional bank stocks they didn't rally, they actually ended the day, sharply lower. More selling today. There are some concerns on Wall Street about how these banks are going to make money in this current environment where you have the cost of deposits going up, and the willingness to lend go down. That is never a good recipe here. Plus, as you mentioned, we have the Federal Reserve raising interest rates most likely, again. Tomorrow, another rate hike is going to add pressure to the system. Former FDIC chair, Sheila Bair, she told me yesterday that she thinks the Fed needs to pause here. She said that Jerome Powell and the Fed have to stop trying to look so tough on inflation, because it's going to backfire. Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren, she is calling for accountability here related to the bank failures. Listen to what she told me today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): We cannot be a country that just time after time rolls through another banking failure and nobody gets held accountable. Not, the CEOs of these giant banks and not the people in government who were responsible overall for how the government supervised and regulated these banks. It's both places. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm just looking at some of the numbers coming through from the banking sector. Look, we don't know what daily market moves actually mean, but here is the thing, we are really worried about just the kind of contagion within the banking sector that still has not been discovered that might be bubbling under the surface, and what this could mean for the overall economy.",

And they clearly thought that that was going to be the end of things too. And instead, we have seen further contagion throughout the banking system, throughout primarily regional and smaller banks, that some of which have similarities to those couple of banks that I just mentioned, you know, more high net worth depositors, more uninsured deposits, but a lot of them look pretty dissimilar, and you're still seeing nervousness about the financial conditions of those banks. And I think that's partly a reflection of higher interest rates is going to put more stress on the system in general, you know, that's what's going to happen, particularly for the smaller banks that hold a lot of commercial real estate on their books. Commercial real estate is in trouble. And if those interest rates reset sometime in the next year, as many of them will, we don't know how those loans will fare, but also, I think, general anxiety about the state of the economy and what other shoes are yet to drop.",

Again, there are multiple things that went wrong here, even without these particular banks, SiliconValley Bank and Signature Bank being declared systemically important. There probably should have been more oversight from the regulators. So yes, having that label will subject them to more scrutiny, but even the amount of scrutiny that they had, seems to have had failed, if that makes sense that that there were again, risks pretty much in plain sight. If you look at, for example, Silicon Valley Bank, they were pretty open about the fact that they had decided to stop hedging against higher interest rate risks, which most people could tell you they expected interest rates to keep going up. This was probably not a great move. This was in their quarterly filing or their annual filing, I believe, at the end of last year.

Well, President Biden will meet with House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy to discuss the debt ceiling next week. The two have not met since February. The President and House Republicans have been in a standoff over the issue for months. Mr. Biden said he wants to pass a clean bill to raise the debt ceiling. The House passed a package last week that would have cut spending, and included other measures Democrats would not accept. It comes as the Treasury secretary warns the US could default as soon as June 1st. Janet Yellen wrote in the letter: It is imperative that Congress act as it has done in the past. Lawmakers have raised the debt limit 78 times since 1960. Secretary Yellen urged Congress not to wait until the last minute. CNN chief White House correspondent, Phil Mattingly is at the White House for us. I'm looking at this debt limit graph. It is extraordinary. But here's the thing, Janet Yellen warning that the deadline is far closer than initially thought. It means politicians need to come together and act very quickly.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and I am going to go ahead and co-opt what you just said related to the banking industryand apply it to the next month ahead, hold on tight, it's going to be a roller coaster ride. And the reason why is, despite the sheer scale of the US debt, and at this moment, there's no question about the $31 trillion and the way that it has jumped over the course of the last couple of decades in particular, is a potentially major problem in the future. The major problem for now is the fact that the US is a liquid nation, the US has made good on its debt since it has existed. And the US is facing the very real possibility of default, default that would have a catastrophic impact across markets, across the US economy, across the global economy to some degree, and it is entirely preventable, if lawmakers passed a bill raising the statutory debt ceiling. The problem at this point in time, we've seen these fights in the past, usually they reach a resolution at this point in time with about 30 days left based on the early case deadline laid out by the Treasury secretary, there is no clear path forward, there is no clear off ramp, there is no alternative or potential compromise that is sitting out there. This meeting that will occur next week between President Biden and the top four congressional leaders, including Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is really the first movement we've seen after months of staring one another down. And even in that meeting, both sides have reiterated their very firm positions of which there is no way to thread the needle in between them. So, the question right now has largely been, what is going to give? President Biden and his team have made clear over and over again, they will not negotiate on this, they will not add spending cuts to a debt ceiling increase. They want it to be clean, they want nothing attached to it at all. And in part, that's because they want to avoid having these types of fights again. If you want to threaten government shutdowns. If you want to threaten issues related to budgets and spending, they're more than happy to have that battle, but when it comes to the nation's credit, they don't want that to be considered a viable point of leverage. Republicans have made clear they will not pass anything to raise the debt ceiling or suspend it without spending cuts. So, at some point in the next three or four weeks, they are going to have to figure out a way out of this. Right now, at this point and I know this sounds dramatic, but it should be understood as just that, there is no pathway out of this despite the fact we seem to have these fights every other year or so.",

The key sticking points really are the number of writers in the writers' room, the length of employment of writers on specific shows and films and movies and also regulating artificial intelligence, as well as residuals from streaming services. This is the key thing that we've been hearing from folks on the line. They want to make sure that they are fairly compensated as the industry is moving from broadcast to studios. You'll see a lot of the signs really talk about this very issue. One sign here says, \"I stream, you stream for a fair contract.\" Also, we're hearing from the studios themselves, they are saying that they have offered additional compensation. They have offered more in residuals around streaming and they are actually willing to go higher on their offer, but the writers saying that it's simply not enough. And the last writers' strike we saw was in 2007. It lasted about 100 days, and at that time, the economic impact was $2 billion. If you adjust that for inflation, that's $3 billion.

Ten years ago, a third of TV series writers were working at minimums. Now that number is up to half. So, we're not -- we're a middle-class union. There is a sort of an image of Hollywood writers as you know, living a sort of glamorous lifestyle.

A Spanish farmers union says 60 percent of the country's farmland is suffocating from lack of rainfall. Fred Pleitgen takes us through how some of the reservoirs are drying up. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From afar, even a natural disaster can look majestic. But up close, the full impact of the global climate emergency is clear to see. This is the Sau Reservoir near Barcelona, normally one of the largest bodies of fresh water in this part of Spain. But months of drought and the water levels are so low, an entire medieval village, usually underwater, has come to light.",
