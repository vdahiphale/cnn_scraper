They say all five of those rockets were intercepted.The IDF says its strikes targeted weapon production sites for the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Israel's military operation in Jenin began two days ago and was its largest in that city in more than two decades. Meantime, Hamas says it's responded to that operation, claiming responsibility for a car ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv Tuesday, which left at least eight people injured. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the attack cannot break Israel's resolve to fight terrorism.

And frankly, while they continue to try to move the front lines forward, they are running into some pretty heavy resistance there.We are also getting new reports just this morning from local Russian governors of two regions just across the border to the north of Ukraine saying that there were interceptions of Ukrainian drones or incoming shelling or missiles. It's not entirely clear what they say that one person was actually injured in what they describe as Ukrainian attacks. We have not heard from the Ukrainian side there. We're also getting more information on a attack in the Ukrainian town of Pervomaisk, this is about 60 kilometers or so south of Kharkiv, frankly nowhere near the front lines. It's been hit by Russia before, but the Ukrainians insist that there are no military installations here. This is only civilians. And what's interesting about this particular attack is that according to the chief of the local special forces unit, people in that town had gathered for the funeral of a fallen Ukrainian soldier. And so, when that missile actually landed, it was about 800 meters or so from where that funeral service was being held, which is why there are plenty of people injured, but no one actually killed, given the distance that shrapnel would have had to travel. So at last word, 43 people were injured, the youngest among them, according to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office, a three-month-old baby. There was also a 10-month-old baby rushed to the hospital, obviously, with shrapnel wounds straight into intensive care. Their condition, luckily, has stabilized. Quickly, Rosemary, on the Russian-occupied side of things, Donetsk City has been the target of Ukrainian shelling, according to Russian- backed officials there, saying that 24 shells actually landed in the city, 25 people injured, two of them killed. Among the injured, a two- year-old and a seven-year-old so children, among them there. And what is worth noting here is that while, of course, Donetsk City has been the target of Ukrainian shelling in the past throughout the course of this war, it is worth noting that the intensity of those attacks seems to have picked up as of late. Again, this is a city that has been firmly under Russian occupation since 2014. Rosemary?",
