I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, and we start with breaking news.Severe weather threatens more than 70 million people this Memorial Day weekend. Intense tornadoes, baseball-sized hail, and hurricane-force winds, all threatening parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Take a look at this storm chaser video in Oklahoma City. You see blue sky overhead, but they are also driving straight into that gray sky as well. It's very ominous looking. CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa joining us now. And Elisa, it looks like those tornadoes are starting to spin up and it typically happens a lot of times when the sun starts to go down.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the sun is what we need to fuel the atmosphere, to create these intense and strong thunderstorms. And it's been doing that all day. The atmosphere has been cooking all day. That's why the storms are blowing up now. And the danger is the sun is going to set soon here shortly, and that poses an even greater risk. You can't see these tornadoes in the dead of night.You've got to tornado watches in effect throughout a lot of Kansas, Oklahoma, and then going into Texas. The watch that we are watching very closely is this one. That includes Wichita, Oklahoma City, and then goes into Wichita Falls there at the top of Texas. That is being labeled a particularly dangerous situation. Not just because we're expecting tornadoes, but the tornadoes that we are expecting can be strong, they can be violent, they can be long lived. So we tag it with that elevated heightened risk. And this goes until 11:00 this evening. Could see there have been multiple tornado warnings just to the south and east there. Wichita Falls, where storm chasers have spotted a tornado there and the warnings do continue. We do have another couple of warnings getting closer to Oklahoma City, as well as the supercells ignite and they start to rotate. The risk here again goes from Wichita Falls up to Wichita, Kansas, and then into Springfield, Missouri, because we've got these discreet, strong and violent tornadoes possible now. But then this will evolve into a threat for damaging wind gusts up to 84 miles per hour and hail up to the size of grapefruits are possible as well. Here's that highest tornado risk again, EF2 or greater possible. Then we'll have the wind threat stretch into Missouri as we go into the overnight hours. This is the risk for the strong violent tornadoes. You see all those discreet dots, those are the super cells that can really spin and be quite violent. Then you see how they organized into a line? That's the damaging wind threat that pushes through southwest Missouri overnight and then continues into the Ohio Valley as we go through tomorrow. So the threat continues through Sunday, millions of people need to watch out for their Memorial Day weekend holiday -- Jessica.",

I mean, really what we're looking at in polling this year is a pretty striking both racial and generational inversion, where Biden is holding his support relative to 2020 better among white voters than he is among non-white voters. Most of Trump's improvement in the polls from 2022 now is among non-white voters, the kind of voters he was courting in the Bronx, whereas Biden, I think in many ways, if he can't entirely get back to where he was in 2020, among those non-white voters, he's going to need to improve somewhere to offset that.And the most logical place for him to go are with those college- educated suburban Nikki Haley type voters even if they weren't literally Nikki Haley voters in the primary. So, you know, the focus of each campaign in this week gives you kind of an unusual split- screen of what may be the two most movable pieces of the electorate, white-collar, college educated, socially liberal voters toward the Democrats and blue-collar, non-white voters discontented about the economy toward the Republicans. We'll see how either of them can hold up all the way to November, but that clearly are the pieces -- those clearly seem to be the pieces that are most in play at this point in the election year.",

You keep telling us that. We know. We want to talk about other policies. We want to talk about other issues.And it seems like the Biden campaign, that is a huge issue for them. It does poll, you know, very highly when people are asked about it.",

And if Biden is going to win, those generally previously Republican voting, center-right independent, college-educated suburbanites, the kind of people who helped him win Georgia, for example, in 2020 or made him the first Democrat since Harry Truman in 1948 to win Maricopa County, which is centered on Phoenix.If he is going to win them, it is going to be primarily on rights and values and democracy. I mean, I think those voters tend to see Trump as better on the economy. I don't think Biden can reverse that. They may be sympathetic to some of his environmental goals, but they like the libertarians not big regulation people. Ultimately, his pathway to those kind of voters is primarily on these non-economic issues. And it's probably more with women than with men in those groups. I know that the Biden campaign feels very confident that they can run even been better than they did in 2020 among college educated women. After all, Dobbs didn't happen until after the 2020 election, but they are worried that economic concerns might depress their numbers among college educated men.",

RUTH BEN-GHIAT, HISTORY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND AUTHOR, \"STRONGMEN\": So, Tucker Carlson has been the poster boy and the mouthpiece of Viktor Orban, any autocrat he can cultivate, and of course now that he is not with Fox anymore, he is looking for a new niche, and so he has been, as you know, traveling around, interviewing Orban and interviewing Putin who actually humiliated him on television. So he could be seen as what Russians call the useful fool. The foreigner, or native person who props the autocrat up and then is used by him because autocrats follow a use and discard policy with people even those who help them.",

Do you think that's true?BEN-GHIAT: I do. Because the sad truth is that the Republican Party has been -- has become an autocratic party. Unfortunately, it has exited from democracy, and this is why were in this very weird and surreal situation. We are a bipartisan nation and one party is not supportive of democratic ideals and norms anymore, that's why they still support the January 6 violent insurrection. They have been influenced greatly by the kremlin, and there are people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who a lot of what she says, people like to mock her or even call her stupid, but a lot of what she says lines up with Kremlin talking points, especially on foreign policy things.",

And unfortunately, the more we don't stand up for democracy, including helping democracies under siege such as Ukraine, the more the whole world becomes very dangerous because autocrats watch what other autocrats do. And so as Xi Jinping is now doing military exercises in Taiwan and he sees what is happening in Ukraine, he also knows that half the political life of the country is not into democracy anymore, as we discussed before, and is actually there is a wing of the Republican Party that is pro-Putin as is Trump. This is valuable information. So, we are a kind of a crisis point and inflection point and this is the most important election of our lives.",

We also have some images of hail and you can hear it pelting cars and windows and roofs and sidings. I've seen some pictures of hail and some of the reports have come in up to baseball size.
