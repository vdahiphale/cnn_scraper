That is certainly not going to help the cleanup efforts as they try to clear out these streets. You mentioned this already being a deadly storm. Overnight, officials here in Erie County confirming yet another death. The body of a 22- year-old woman found inside a vehicle here in Erie County. Now, just a little over a dozen deaths confirmed, a mix of folks who suffered medical emergencies while shoveling snow, but also, as we mentioned, some individuals found in their vehicles; three folks who lost their lives after EMS services could not make it to them over the weekend. Because these roads were just impossible to drive. The driving ban, the travel restriction, that is currently in place here in Buffalo still. Clearly, officials are going to wake up this morning and reassess the situation. But you know, when I say wake up this morning, they have been really, honestly, working almost for three, some four days straight constantly.

A good number of the folks here behind me, they're in pretty good shape. We talked to them just a few minutes ago, and a lot of them told us that their flights are on time, and they're hoping to get out. That said, you've still got to make a line to check that bag in, and boy, is it quite long. If you could show them what I'm talking about here. The folks have been lining up for a good part of the morning here. Everyone is just hoping to get out, considering what we've been seeing the last couple of days. We caught up with one woman who was quite frustrated. She's still pretty upset at Delta, because she's just trying to get to New York after the holiday rush.

Now what the administration is watching is, of course, the situation that is unfolding along the border but also the Supreme Court. We are waiting to hear from the Supreme Court on whether the administration can move forward with plans to end Title 42. That is that border restriction that has allowed authorities to push back migrants into Mexico. And so we are waiting for a ruling there to see whether the administration can move forward.

There was, however, over the weekend, heavy shelling down in the South, in Kherson, that killed 16 people, injured dozens more.

An Arizona judge ruling against Kari Lake's election challenge after losing her bid for governor.Lake falsely claimed that some ballot printer problems in Maricopa County were part of a deliberate effort to rig the vote against her. But the judge said Lake's witnesses did not have any personal knowledge of intentional misconduct. After the ruling, Lake tweeted that she would appeal the decision. She has until 5 p.m. today to respond. Lake lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs by about 17,000 votes in November.",

The avalanche happened Sunday near two mountainous villages in Western Austria.Rescue workers feared that all ten who were missing may be dead, based on video showing the group of skiers in the avalanche -- avalanche's path. The video cut off, though, before showing what happened to them. Officials say this morning everyone is accounted for. Four people were hurt. One was seriously injured. A final sweep of the area will be done today. And the latest drop in Tesla stock may prove Elon Musk's problems go beyond Twitter. We'll talk about that.",
