Black Friday sales were strong. A record number of people went out and shopped. Cyber Monday sales are really strong.We heard from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. He told her colleague, Poppy Harlow, that he is concerned that despite all this strength for consumers, that we could have a mild recession in the U.S. economy next year. And that is largely because of the Fed's war on inflation. These rapid interest rate hikes haven't fully hit the economy yet. And when they do, a lot of people are concerned that that's where you get the recession.",

This is after those unprecedented and widespread demonstrations that we've seen against China's strict zero-COVID policies. Ivan Watson, he's back with us. He's in Hong Kong watching this all. Ivan, what are you hearing about this? IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Right. Well, we're hearing kind of the first real signal from the Chinese government about how they view the protests over the course of the weekend. And I think it's safe to say they don't like it. There was a statement from the Communist Party's kind of domestic security committee saying that officials must \"resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilize social order.\" So, they're basically labeling anybody who peacefully came out to say, hey, I'm sick of getting locked in my apartment for two, three months at a time to try to stop COVID. They're saying that those people are basically criminals, even if they're out peacefully protesting. And I think we've seen evidence of this hardline approach with police flooding the streets of the capital, Beijing, Monday night, of Shanghai as well, the commercial capital, putting up barriers to prevent people from being able to gather where they had protested in Shanghai Saturday and Sunday night. And this is very important. We have eyewitness accounts and videos emerging from Shanghai from the subway system of police stopping travelers and searching their phones. An eyewitness telling us that they're looking for apps and VPNs that let users circumvent the great Chinese firewall that censors the internet that stops anybody in China from being able to see Facebook or Google, things like that. Those are signs of how the authorities now are going to deal with what's been the biggest display of discontent that this country has seen, really, in a generation.",

It's not everything I would like to see, I think that we should have paid sick leave. Every country -- every developed country in the world has it, we don't. But nonetheless, we have an improved situation. And again, I don't like going against the ability of unions to strike. But weighing the equities, we must avoid a strike.
