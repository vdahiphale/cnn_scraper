It's a CNN exclusive, and it's first OUTFRONT.Plus, trouble in Trump world. New reporting into OUTFRONT tonight about the former president's reaction to the big loss in Georgia as one of his own close allies calls it, quote, really, really bad. And, 25 right-wing extremists accused of plotting to overthrow the German government conspired by QAnon. The former spokesman for the Oath Keepers who testified before the January 6th committee says this could happen in America. He's my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, game changer. CNN learning exclusively that Ukraine wants deadly cluster munition warheads from the United States, weapons banned by more than 100 countries, that Ukraine tonight says will change the course of this war. And this comes as Putin tonight personally escalates his nuclear threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA PRESIDENT (through translator):  With regard to the threat of a nuclear war, Svetlana Yevgenyevna (ph), you are right, the threat is growing, so why hide the truth? Now, regarding whether or not Russia would be the first to use one no matter what the circumstances may be -- well, if it's not the first to use one, then it couldn't be the second to use one, because a nuclear strike on our territory would greatly limit our capabilities.

So, that's a major threat.And Putin, of course, has the largest stockpile, about 4,200 ICBM nuclear warheads in addition to his estimated nearly 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons. Putin is making this threat, coming out and personally doing it with his back pressed firmly up against the wall. Because he knows his invasion has not going to cording to plan. He also said today, and I quote him: Regarding the problem with equipment, as far as I can tell, this is already been sorted out. However, if something else needs our special attention somewhere, of course, I would ask you for more information. Then we will definitely deal with it, and as quickly as possible. An admission of problems with equipment, as soft as that admission may feel to you, for Putin to say this, is a big deal. And he is forced to even admit it because of what his soldiers are seeing every day and are now recorded on tape talking about. We've been sharing conversations with you between soldiers and their families. I want to play this for you. This is a newly obtained call, a recent call between a Russian soldier and his mother back home. Listen to it. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MOTHER (through translator):  And people -- you have everyone? SOLDIER (through translator):  Leaving, leaving, people are leaving. MOTHER (through translator):  Leaving? Like running away? SOLDIER (through translator):  Yes, running away, what else? Five (EXPLETIVE DELETED) days under pouring rain, with no sleep. MOTHER (through translator):  That's deserting. Watch out. SOLDIER (through translator):  If they don't let us leave in December, we'll go away, too. You just can't imagine, we live in a swamp. Everything is leaking. We have no sleep, no food, nothing.

These are very serious business.Ukrainians also developing drones that are flying deep into Russian territory, drones that have hit strategic air bases as close as 500 miles to the Russian capital Moscow. You have President Putin threatening nuclear weapons and already using 1980s Soviet era nuclear weapons on Ukraine. He's just launching them as dummies right now without warheads. But they're landing. They're lobbing (ph) themselves into buildings. And the Ukrainians know that these missiles were built in the 1980s to carry nuclear warheads, of which Putin has plenty. Is that a sign, is that a signal for the people of Ukraine? Is it an attempt to try to exhaust their air defenses? Either way, the Ukrainians certainly know what's at stake here. That's why they're launching more counteroffensives. They're defending Bakhmut, which Russia is trying to desperately to take, to demonstrate some level of success on the battlefield because they have a string of humiliating failures. There's also word tonight, Erin, that there is another potential front in this war. So we've talked about the Donetsk region to the east. We've talked about Kherson to the south. Well, now, up by the Belarusian border, there are troops on the Belarusian side mobilizing. They're calling them military exercises. But hundreds and thousands of troops are expected to be gathering there in the coming days, and the Ukrainians are also starting to dig trenches, starting to build reinforcements. This is why they are asking for these cluster bombs and any other weapons possible to prevent yet another potential ground invasion. Could it happen in the coming weeks? Could it happen in the spring when things warm up? Because temperatures are really plunging here. The official start of winter is later this month. They don't know all the answers, Erin, but what they do know is that Putin is likely going to throw everything he has into this war. And they're going to try to do everything they can to stop him.",

But what we have learned is that senior Biden officials have been weighing these requests by the Ukrainians for these cluster munitions and have not rejected those requests outright.So, what we've also learned is that the Ukrainians have been asking for these munitions for months. And obviously, it's a very controversial request because, as you laid out, these are bombs that explode and launch dozens and dozens of tiny little submunitions that then explode themselves. And part of the risk just apart from the fact that they can, you know, affect such a large group of people, such a large area of land is also the fact that many of these submunitions, when they explode on the ground, don't actually explode. And so like land mines, they kind of just lay around until people and potentially civilians encounter them. So this is very controversial. The Biden administration is weighing it, but they say that they are not necessarily considering it seriously at this point. Primarily because Congress has actually imposed restrictions on the U.S.'s ability to send these cluster munitions overseas. Now, President Biden can overrule that, but that would require an extraordinary determination that the administration does not seem prepared to make at this point. However, the Ukrainians have been saying this could really be a game changer for them on the battlefield, and the administration weighing it as they do with all of the other Ukrainian requests for weaponry, Erin.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The raid started in the early morning hours. Several thousand police officers searching dozens of locations across Germany, including the castle (INAUDIBLE), home of the alleged ringleader who prosecutors say uses the title Prince Heinrich VIII from he royal House of Reuss. CNN has tried reaching out to Heinrich VIII, but it's not clear if he has a legal representative. Based on current findings, the suspected terrorist group uncovered today was founded based on coup d'etat fantasies and conspiracy ideologies Germany's interior minister said. The group is called Reichsburger or citizens of the Reich, and the alleged plotters were trying to overthrow the German government and install a monarchy with a prince at the helm, German authorities say. Militant Reichsburger are united by the hatred for democracy for our state and for people who support our community, the interior minister said. Conspiracy theorists have a massive following in Germany. In August 2020, tens of thousands including QAnon followers and right- wing extremists took to the streets of Berlin praising Russian leader Vladimir Putin and then U.S. President Donald Trump.

That's another parallel to the alleged coup in Germany, the Reichsburger II had already established a so-called military arm, German prosecutors say.This military arm aims to set up a new German army, the federal prosecutor said, consisting of homeland security units yet to be built. According to our information, individual members of this military arm were in the past active in the German armed forces. Several suspects were flown to the federal prosecutor's office by police helicopters, an indication of just how seriously German authorities are taking this attack on their democracy.

And first of all, I really appreciated Herschel Walker last night in his concession speech said, democracy and the Constitution is more important than Herschel Walker. I thought he gave an incredible statement and I think that reflects healing power of whenever you can accept a loss and congratulate the winner and appreciate our democracy. And I appreciate what he had to say last night. But the Republican Party has to really look deep into our soul. We have to, first of all, understand that there's a price to be paid whenever you have a Trump endorsement. And then secondly, whenever you see the extremism across the country, now across the globe, we have to take every opportunity we can to reject that violent extremism. I know where it leads. You have to reject the conspiracy theories and embrace the truth and facts and the Constitution and democracy. And I really believe that you look at Governor Kemp. You know, he won handily in Georgia, and he embraced all of those values, and our candidates in Iowa and other places in the same way.
