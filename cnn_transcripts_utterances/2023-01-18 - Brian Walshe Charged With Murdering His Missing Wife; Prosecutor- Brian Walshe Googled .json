Welcome to a Special Edition of 360, \"What happened to Ana?\"Everything that we have learned, after a harrowing day, in court, about what prosecutors believe happened, to the Massachusetts mother, of three young children, who's been missing, since the New Year; what was done to her, they say, by her husband, Brian, who was arraigned, today, on a charge, of murder, and the chilling details, of the alleged research, he did, on disposing of bodies. In the hour ahead, some of the knowledgeable experts, on Police procedure, forensic science, and trying criminal cases, on how this case was made, what a trial may look like. First, CNN's Jason Carroll, from Quincy, Massachusetts, on the horrifying revelation, today, at Brian Walshe's arraignment. So, talk about the details that were released today, that shed a lot more light, on the timeline, according to authorities of this case.",

That's when her husband, Brian Walshe, claims she left their Cohasset home, in a rideshare, or taxi, to fly to Washington, D.C., for work. But prosecutors say there is no evidence Ana got a ride, or went to the airport. Brian Walshe tells investigators, on this day, he ran errands, for his mother, in a nearby town. But they find no evidence those trips occurred.

In court, today, prosecutors say, information from Walshe's phone showed that on January 2nd, he also went to a HomeGoods, and purchased three rugs. There were also more Google searches on January 2nd, according to prosecutors.

A Police log would later confirm the Head of Security at the firm was the first to report her missing to Police, and that her husband has not filed a missing person report on female.

But yesterday, a judge had actually sealed this case, to preserve evidence, for a grand jury. So, I wasn't really prepared, I don't think anybody was, for this level of detail, of evidence, to be presented, to this jury, and to the courthouse, I mean. In fact, Tracy Miner, the defense attorney, tried to stop this from happening, saying, \"I waive everything. Let's just get to this.\" And the judge said, \"No, I need to hear this.\" And then it just began! And you could hear a pin drop, in that courtroom, as the prosecutor just went through, first, these internet searches, and then all the other items that were brought in as well. It wasn't just the internet searches. We also learned today, they have video surveillance, of Brian Walshe, taking trash bags, down in the towns of Abington and Brockton, and loading them into dumpsters, down there. And the reason we don't have those trash bags, is those bags went to an incinerator, in Southeastern Massachusetts. We also found out that some of Ana Walshe's personal belongings, including her COVID-19 vaccination card, was, pulled out of a dumpster, on the North Shore of Boston.

And so, it's going to be very circumstantial. They found also this bloody rug, in Peabody, at the transfer station, in Peabody, Massachusetts. And that also, that's DNA, it's going to - it comes back to Ana. So, there's a lot of information about some crime of violence, given hacksaws and hatchets, and $450, to try to clean up the scene. And amateurs don't clean up scenes very well. Professional companies, they exist to clean up crime scenes. So, he's sloppy. It's an amazing thing, when you put all this together, and look at the Google searches, it's extraordinary.

But it's a husband, who borrows a saw, does a bunch of things, to cover up evidence.And it was - you face two things, Anderson, going into a case like that. One is circumstantial evidence. And the other is the double jeopardy factor, which is if you get it wrong, the first time, and you find the body a year later, you can't go back on it. So, prosecutors weigh these very carefully.

Pattern evidence has to do with a victim's pattern of behavior. So, you're looking at, for example, in a missing person's case, an adult can go voluntarily missing. That's not a criminal act. However, if there's going to be a prosecution, without a body, they have to establish the fact that the person did go missing, and that the person is dead, and that the cause of their death is homicide. Part of what they're going to look at, to establish that is, to say, \"How often is this person on the phone? How often do they call home? How often do they post on social media?\" And then all of a sudden, all of those contacts just stop, abruptly. That lends itself to the idea that this person didn't voluntarily go missing. This person is likely dead, and the cause of death is homicide, or manner of death is homicide. So, again, they have to establish the fact that \"Here is somebody that's vibrant, communicates all the time, 24/7.

Because, as many of the speakers, today, and tonight, on your show, even have noted, most of those go to \"How do you get rid of a body? What do I have to do around a stench,\" et cetera, et cetera. They do not go to motive, or intent, or planning before. And that's where, if you wanted to prove a first degree murder case, or even a second degree murder case, you have to prove some kind of premeditation and intent to kill. We don't know what the cause of death was. What's the - we can say homicide, and the D.A. believes that there's probably evidence of a homicide. But we don't know what that is. If someone points a gun, and pulls the trigger, you can deem that's an intentional, premeditated murder. But we just don't know.

We only have 10, 15, 20 pages of what's going to be 5,000 pages of discovery. But even what we know, today, not only is there a lack of motive, but there's lack of this premeditation, or any suggestion, whatsoever that it is the most serious charge that of first degree murder. So, then we default back to second degree murder, which is that heat of passion. And quite honestly, they don't even have any evidence yet of that. If you think about it, this could be a domestic violence fight that had a horrific consequence, the death of her. And then the cover-up is what makes it look so bad. But don't forget, no matter what he did in the cover-up, it simply does not change the level of crime, the initial crime, the murder. So, this may turn out to be the only thing that the State can prove, as some type of negligent homicide, in the middle of a fight, not even to the level of second degree. So, if I was the defense counsel, I'm focusing on getting this down, to something that only the State can prove, with the evidence available, and not focusing on the aftermath, the hiding of it all.",

There's a death, and then they freak out and panic, and try to dispose of the body. My client was just not as stupid as Walshe, with these emails, with these Google searches, et cetera. But the idea here is, to Mark's point, two things, mental state and mitigation. I think the focus is going to be - one of the things I'd want to do, is look at the history, look back, not about what happened after she went missing, but what this relationship was all about. How many domestic violence calls were made, in the course of this relationship? Subpoena those 9-1-1 calls. Because, the more we can show that there's no premeditation, the lesser the degree of crime, like Mark said, and it's more like a heat-of-passion killing. Then, also mitigation, I really don't know what's up with this guy, right? We got to take a deep dive into his mental state, afflictions, addictions, all of those things. All our clients, all the defendants think they can walk. But not all the defendants walk. So, I think, a victory is relative.
