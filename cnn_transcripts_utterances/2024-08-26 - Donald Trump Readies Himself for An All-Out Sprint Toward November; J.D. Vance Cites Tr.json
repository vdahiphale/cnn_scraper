She didn't mention anything but my name over and over and over again. She blamed me for the border, I haven't been there in four years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Mariana, we of course saw Trump in Arizona at this border state rally. Now, they clearly are feeling pressure to ramp up his campaigning there, saying he's going to be out in potentially two states a day. Sometimes, how do you think this all kind of sets up the race as we head into -- I mean, labor day is a week away, right? A week from today.

That being said that the Trump campaign is very much under the fence, and I think that we're hearing a little bit of that panic just coming out of the DNC. I think we heard former President yesterday on social media say, oh, well, I don't know if he's going to be on the debate anymore. So, I think that that's going to be the conversation for the next few days is just, is he going to stick to that already commitment he made. But I think that it's just going to be that continued reaction by Democrats to hold onto their momentum and Republicans to try to find a way to crack that Harris wall that they have seen rise up in the last few weeks.",

One other thing over the weekend, Mariana, is that Donald Trump is fully back on Twitter, the platform formerly known as Twitter, I guess I should say, X.He had been, you know, starting to get into that with this interview that he did with Elon Musk, but now, he's clearly trying to flood the zone in that way as well, and we can put up some of the things that he was tweeting about. And of course, he has settled on a nickname for Harris, it seems, \"there'll be no future under comrade Kamala Harris.\" There -- was saying that she's going to take us into a nuclear world war three.

And I think that Twitter is just like the platform that's responded to him. You know, he's been able to gather not only so many followers, but just like everything he says there becomes news. Again, I think that the media is kind of being different about the way we tackle this system around, but it doesn't mean that we don't have notifications on everything, but I think that he knows that the following there is way more significant than it is on Truth Social.",

Max, good morning to you, always wonderful to see you.So, what will Hamas accept here? Let's just start on this -- the ceasefire talks. What are they demanding and what is standing in the way right now? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, there's so much different language coming out from all the different parties involved here is really hard to get precise information, but we are getting these positive words every so often, aren't we? From the U.S. saying we're close to a deal, then it just doesn't happen. And then Hamas now specifically targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blaming him for changing the rules as they go along. But I think the fundamental part of this is really this idea that Hamas wants all Israeli troops to leave Gaza Strip isn't something that Israel finds acceptable. So, that has been the common sticking point throughout all of this, I suspect is still one of the sticking points. But there's also a lot of question about who is really committed to this peace deal and getting to it as quickly as, you know, the Americans are suggesting it, we should be getting their criticism of the Americans as well, frankly, that they haven't handled this negotiation very well, because we just haven't got there yet.",

But what we have seen, the positive news, if I can call it that out of all of this, is that both sides, Hezbollah and Israel claiming victory following both their attacks over the weekend. So, that does suggest a de-escalation are not as big an escalation that the world was worrying about, so, that hopefully calms things down across the region. But certainly, a peace deal in Gaza will certainly help relief tensions across all of those opponents of Israel there.",
