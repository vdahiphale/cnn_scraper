ColumbiaUniversity gives pro-Palestinian protesters until the top of this very hour right now to clear the encampment after talks had failed. The students say they won't move until their demands are met. We will have, of course, the very latest for you. Then, fresh hope that officials are edging closer to a ceasefire deal in Gaza. We'll have all the details   as the U.S. Secretary of State arrives in the region, hoping of course, to jump-start negotiations. Plus, CNN travels deep inside Haiti's gang territory for an exclusive interview with one of the FBI's most wanted. You do not want to miss that interview with our David Culver. But first, just moments ago, Columbia University's deadline passed, calling for protesters opposed to the war in Gaza to clear out of encampment on campus or face suspension. And here, you can see live images we're bringing that to you at Columbia University, is not live, clearly as you can see, these are Getty images. The protesters in New York show no signs though of slowing down. That is of course, despite the deadline that's just been gone in the last minute and 20 seconds or so. Now, a short time ago, student protesters voted to stay, and as you can see on this map that we're going to bring you up, you can get the scale of these protests because this campus protests are happening from coast-to- coast. Many colleges in U.S. are struggling as we've shown you for the last week or so, to really regain control. And this weekend at UCLA, rival demonstrators clashed when a security barrier was breached.

Well, support among college students for U.S. President Joe Biden is falling, thanks in part to the Israel-Hamas war. A new CNN poll shows only 28 percent of those polled approve of President Biden's handling of the conflict as you can see there. Among younger people aged 18 to 34, 81 percent disapprove of his job performance. And we should note, voters and even younger voters listed the war as lower on their list of priorities. While these pro-Palestinian protests that we've been showing you an American University campuses are being followed right around the world. In Gaza, a banner was displayed in support of the demonstrations, thanking students in solidarity with people of the devastated area. In Iran, U.S. protests in support of Palestinians are being hailed as a unifying moment against Israel.

Miguel Marquez there. Well, there is new hope meantime, that there may be some momentum behind a diplomatic push for desperately-needed ceasefire in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Saudi Arabia to try to jump- start talks. He is urging Hamas to accept what he says -- what he's calling extraordinary, generous, his words, proposal from Israel. Hamas officials are meeting in Egypt to consider the framework of a deal that would see the release of as many as 33 Israeli hostages over several weeks. And while these talks go on, there is no pause in the devastating violence as well as the suffering the war is leaving behind. Officials in Gaza say at least 20 people, including an infant and a toddler were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah. It was a heartbreaking scene at one hospital where victims were brought, loved ones gathering to sit -- to say, as you can see, their final farewells. We are tracking all the developments with CNN's Kylie Atwood with the State Department and Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem.

We heard from the Secretary of State this morning, as you said, trying to put more pressure on Hamas, but the U.S. and other parties have been doing that for some time now. He said that the offer on the table from the Israelis is extraordinarily generous. He said that, you know, Hamas has to make a decision and they have to make a decision quickly here, effectively warning them that if they don't go ahead and come to an agreement with, you know, the bits that are on the table now that the Egyptians have put together, that things could get worse for them. That the Israelis obviously have been warning as Jeremy was saying here, that they're going to go into Rafah, and it looks like they will do that if there isn't a ceasefire agreement and release of these hostages come to, in some short time here. The other part of this that U.S. officials are really focused on right now and trying to finish up is this overall framework that the Biden administration is hoping would actually bring an end to this ongoing conflict. It would be a historic and very large deal that would include the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. A new defense agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. And then of course, you know, there are other parts such as the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians that would be laid out very clearly in this framework. We know that the Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia today. The State Department in the read-out said that they discussed ongoing efforts to achieve lasting regional peace and security. Therefore, hinting at that overall framework that they're working at. So, we're watching to see when they can finish that up to lay it on the table and try and get all parties on board, which of course, is going to be a major hurdle.",

And there's some indication that, that also maybe because they are preparing for this Rafah offensive, because they know that a coming offensive in Rafah will likely mean the closure of that Rafah border- crossing between Egypt and Gaza where so much of that humanitarian aid has gotten in. Of course, they've also faced immense pressure from the United States and the international community to get more aid into Gaza. But the fact that they've kind of turned the spigot on over the course of the last few weeks is really also just a damning indictment of what they were doing before indicating very strongly that they could have done more and sooner to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. We know that the United States is now in the process of building that floating pier off the coast of the Gaza Strip. It's expected to be ready by early next month for the delivery of some up to 150 trucks of aid that could drive into Gaza. The Israeli military assisting with that project on the ground right now.

Adding to a list of nowhere villages, falling to Moscow day by day, claiming Monday to have taken here Novaya Mikhaylovka, as Ukraine almost always stops short of saying how bad it's got. No more true of that is the fate of Ocheretyne, another tiny village in Donetsk, also of southern unwanted fame. Despite the brutal pounding and evacuation you can see here, a military spokesman claims Sunday the Russians only had a partial foothold. Currently, the part where the enemy is located is under our fire control, and all measures are being taken to knock the enemy out of there, he said. This after days of Russian soldiers posting videos of them raising flags inside the town. Ukraine's official statements, as Russian footage showed a continued advance, showing a distance from reality, common when you're trying to win a war, but uncommonly now angering normally loyal Ukrainian bloggers. So Ukraine's top military commander was forced to set a bleak record straight, saying the front lines had escalated as Moscow has concentrated its efforts in several directions, creating a significant advantage in forces and in means. He said the changing situation had led to an ambiguous understanding. Here is another case in point, Berdychiv, from which Ukraine was posting bullish videos of Russians being hit just before their commander said they'd withdrawn Sunday. Across the eastern front, the news is bleak. The change since the fall of Avdiivka 10 weeks ago stark on this Ukrainian blogger's map. Russia making its most concerted, widespread and consistent advances perhaps since the invasion. This is Zelenskyy's problem to keep now as he bolsters morale in towns in the Russian crosshairs. He has the money and so soon the weapons, and the less blame he can shift for failure. \"We are cooperating with our partners at all levels,\" he said, \"to achieve the level of efficiency and assistance that is needed not only to maintain our positions but also to disrupt Russia's war plans. We're still waiting for the supplies that have been promised to Ukraine.\" But more is likely coming. Where you just saw Zelenskyy visit, this is what is left of Chasiv Yar, yet another town. Russia has turned into this smoldering ruin, here with incendiary munitions, in the name of liberating and demilitarizing Ukraine. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Vitel'Homme rarely seeks media attention, yet given he commands what some US officials say is the largest gang in Port-au-Prince, and his domain includes the US Embassy, we wanted to better understand his motives. Vitel'Homme agrees to meet us.",

You know, if anyone is on the campus in an unlawful manner, whether that be a student, a member of the faculty,or someone from outside, again, once the university itself determines that, you know, these people are here unlawfully, they need to be removed, they are trespassing, that's when law enforcement then moves in. And then if there are indeed arrests that take place, they will work to fully identify those individuals to try to determine what was their association, if any, to this university. Now, it's not a crime in and of itself to go on to a university campus and protest if you have no affiliation. But of course, once law enforcement deems what they call an unlawful assembly, anyone around that area must then depart. And if they don't, they are certainly subject to arrest and citation. One thing that we've seen across the country is that different police departments have handled this in very different ways. Texas has been very aggressive. We know last week, there were over 60 people that were arrested on the campus of UT Austin. The governor, Republican governor of Texas, came out with a statement very forcefully saying these people deserve to be in jail. Obviously, the state troopers worked for the governor, so it would be interesting to see if he had any role in ordering this. But in other places, we've seen de- escalation. Right now, certainly arrests in Austin.",

And as we -- and of course, these are images from our Ed Lavandera, who's on the grind, Josh, who you were mentioning. But, I mean, as we look at these images, one university student was saying at the top of the hour from Columbia was saying that his feeling and from those students that bringing in the police kind of inflamed the situation.

      "sentences": "Yes, that is the calculus that law enforcement has to do, that calculation. Will our very presence here inflame the situation? But I haveto tell you, you know, regardless of how one comes down on this issue, which has obviously resulted in protests across the country, regardless of how righteous people think that their cause is, again, regardless of what side they're on the issue, there is no First Amendment right in the U.S. to protest on private property. If the owners of that property say you have to go, it's the police who enforce that. Of course, what we've seen in law enforcement, they try to de-escalate whenever they can rather than coming in with full force like we saw recently in the state of Georgia where law enforcement, you know, slamming people to the ground. We're not seeing that right now in Austin. Obviously a very intimidating presence there by law enforcement in this crowd control gear, but it looks like they've been very selective in who they are actually taking into custody. And for that matter, it appears as though the protesters are remaining peaceful as well. We're not seeing, as we saw on other campuses, protesters try to antagonize members of law enforcement, throw things at them and the like. So although this seems very chaotic right now, this is certainly the best that you can hope for where it looks as though there's no violence obviously that's happening, but of course we'll have to wait and see what happens as they work through this group to try to get these people off the property hoping that it remains peaceful.",
