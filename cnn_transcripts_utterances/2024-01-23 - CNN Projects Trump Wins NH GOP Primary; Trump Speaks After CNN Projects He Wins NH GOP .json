Trump easily defeating his very last- standing major GOP opponent, Nikki Haley. Let's check out the votes. With 28 percent of the estimated vote in, Donald Trump is far and away in the lead, with 55.5 percent of the vote. That's 50,551 votes. It's about 11,000 votes ahead of Nikki Haley, who's bringing up the rear at 43 percent. Again, that's with 28 percent of the vote. And we are still waiting for most of the votes to come in. But we do expect Donald Trump to be the winner. We're standing by, to hear Donald Trump speak, about his victory. We heard from Nikki Haley, a short while ago. Here's a little bit of what she said.

And I see -- or have no reason to believe that Donald Trump is going to take her up, on that offer.I have asked about this numerous times, over the last several months, whether or not Donald Trump would ever participate in a primary debate? And the answer is no. They believe that their strategy has worked. They have seen nothing but an increase, in his poll numbers. And now, he has won both Iowa and New Hampshire. They are not going to change tactic anytime soon. In their mind, the only thing that could happen in a date like that is something that would hurt Donald Trump. And right now, they don't see any reason that they have to give her an answer, or answer to her, since they still believe that they are the front-runner. Now, I do want to say that for somebody, who earlier today said that he didn't believe that Nikki Haley was a threat, that he didn't care, if she stayed in the race or dropped out, he seems very angry, tonight, after her speech. He's been on social media, ranting. He's called her delusional. He's saying that she got in third place, last week. He repeated that she shouldn't -- she said she had to win New Hampshire, and she didn't. Clearly, he is worked up about this. Now, I have been told by allies that he is annoyed that she's still in the race. This idea, that, people have that if she drops out sooner rather than later, she might be able to save herself with Donald Trump. Donald Trump has been angry about her, and believes that she is disloyal, and said that in private for running already. So, it's something to keep in mind here that in terms of saving yourself -- she has been out there campaigning against him, which is a cardinal sin to Donald Trump, as we know. And as we already heard, after Ron DeSantis, dropped out, endorsed Donald Trump, and then Donald Trump got on \"Fox &amp; Friends\" and said that he wouldn't have DeSantis, in his administration. So, this idea that she has to drop out, in order to please him is kind of hit or miss, and particularly when you see what he's posting, right now, in social media.",

So maybe when it comes back in, it gets closer, it gets closer some, and you can have a conversation with donors. That's a tough number. Again, he's the -- you know, in her defense, he's the most formidable force, in the Republican Party. He was President of the United States, four years ago. And she's getting 43 percent of the vote. But that's still second place, which is important. Across the bottom of the state, right, we're talking about this, as we go through. Another place, we're watching. We said, Nashua here. This is Hollis. It was another key Haley target. We don't have any votes yet. So again, in the idea, can she make this a single-digit race? That's a conversation, that's a question we can't answer just yet. Is Donald Trump going to win New Hampshire? Yes. Is Donald Trump going to win New Hampshire by a healthy margin? Yes. Will it be 13 points or 14 points? Or will it shrink down a little bit? That's the unanswered question. At the moment, because you're starting to see the smaller towns, north of Concord, there's a few Haleys in there. But most of these, couple hundred votes here, thousand or so votes there, most of these are going to fill in, for Donald Trump. And so, that's what you're seeing. As these small towns start to trickle in, you're seeing the lead pad up. Is there a possibility, in the somewhat larger communities, down here, including a couple of good medium-sized suburban areas, can she narrow with some? Yes. But Trump is going to win. And at the moment, it looks like he's going to win with a double-digit lead. The pundits, the pollsters, the fundraisers can debate, is that strength or weakness. If you look at that map, right there, you see Donald Trump won Iowa. Donald Trump won New Hampshire. Donald Trump has a lead in delegates. Only 2.5 percent of the delegates.

I think Joe Biden has done some really extraordinary things, and that history will shine on those. But his performance is a problem. And that is reflected in the polls. And what it translates into is an image of weakness. Whether that image is deserved or not, given all that he's dealt with, is a different question. But that is the reality. There is a sense that the world is out of control, and he's not in command. And that is what Trump is going straight at. And that is what they have to defeat, in this campaign. And they need a counter-narrative. And it isn't, I'm a great president, he was a lousy president. It's like, this guy is consumed by his past. He's not focused on you. Our guy is every day, earnestly trying to do things, to help. It's not to put up a Mission Accomplished--",

In fact, only registered Republicans and people registered as undeclared, so, New Hampshire Independents were permitted to cast ballots, in the Republican primary. The deadline to switch your affiliation was more than three months ago, in early October. So no, Democrats, registered Democrats, were not voting in this election. And one more thing, Jake. I heard him say that people are flooding in from mental institutions, across the border. I asked Trump campaign for evidence of this claim, which he says at pretty much every rally.

But that number of people, who think that Donald Trump is going to be disqualified, if he's convicted on one of these things?I continue to believe that when you look at that number, it means that the imperative for Donald Trump, as a candidate, if he wants to win the presidency, again, is to cut down institutions, to the point that there is no credibility, in a conviction. You've seen him do it effectively with his own base. And I do think it just presages a very ugly general election season.",

That's about 15,000 more votes than Nikki Haley, who is in second place, in the two-person race, with 43.9 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has about a 10-point lead, on Nikki Haley, as of right now.

And I do think that Trump, he is the most undisciplined politician I've ever worked for. He does not take guidance. And despite having actually fairly professional team, right now, he's going to get out there, and he's going to remind us why he's exhausting, why he's vengeance-driven, why he's backward-looking. And that is the best thing for Joe Biden. Because Joe Biden is a historically weak candidate, right now. His numbers rival Jimmy Carter's, after he didn't win reelection. So, what we're basically seeing is a race, for who is more tolerable, at this point. I don't see vision on either side. I don't see people trying to bring in coalitions.
