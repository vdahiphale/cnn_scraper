So, Rudy Giuliani texting his way into trouble, Donald Trump singing no, no, no like \"Destiny's Child,\" and the Secret Service driving that train will brief on cocaine. I'm John Berman, and this is \"CNN Tonight or as I like to call it, CNN very nearly tomorrow because there is news tonight on new legal jeopardy for Rudy Giuliani and new campaign drama surrounding Donald Trump. But before what just happened, what will happen? Tomorrow, pretty early, in fact, the Secret Service is expected to say what it knows about the cocaine found in the White House. Not since Willie Nelson smoked the joint on the White House roof have drugs inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue raised so many questions. By the way, the Willie Nelson thing really happened. Jimmy Carter confirmed it. The cocaine situation has been way more mysterious than the source of way more wild and baseless speculation and led to way too many bad punts, many of which crossed the line. Sorry. This is what we know. About 10 days ago, what law enforcement described as a dime-sized bag of cocaine was found in the West Wing. Perhaps, they meant to say dime bag. It was found in a cubby near the ground floor entrance where staff-guided tourists pass through. Visitors are asked to leave their phones in those cubbies but they can also be used by staff who cannot bring their phones into a SCIF where classified materials are handled. And that is all we know. Republicans in Congress want to know more. The Secret Service has been investigating and will brief them in a few hours. Joining me now is CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow who is a former Secret Service agent, and Tyler Pager, White House reporter for \"The Washington Post.\" Jonathan, let me start with you because I think for the lay persons, they look at this and say, we're talking about the White House, this is the most secure monitored place on earth, how can it be so hard to figure out whose dime-sized bag of cocaine this actually is? What do you say to that?",

Right?You have arguably one of the most secure locations in the United States having, you know, the substance brought in. Now, this is a criminal act, bringing this contraband in, but it wasn't when it was discovered. When it was first discovered, the Secret Service reacted as a threat, that there was white powder, not knowing whether or not this was, you know, anthrax or ricin, and took those immediate actions. Now, we know it was confirmed that it is cocaine and they are leading that investigation now to make attribution as to who did it. However, John Berman, I know, you know, after all of this time, we still don't know whether or not the investigators have figured out who actually brought the substance into the White House.",

We have already seen top Republicans in the Senate and the House sent letters to the Secret Service, demanding more answers, and also asking questions about how the substance in the first place was able to pass security into the White House. Every person that goes into the White House at any given point has to pass through airport-like security, (INAUDIBLE) down by Secret Service, and put bags through a security check. So, there are questions not only about who brought the cocaine in but what are the protocols in place and how they may need to change to prevent this from happening again.",

It is currently under renovation. So, it has been moved to the office building across the street from the White House, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. So, White House aides are saying, well, they are not pleased that someone was able to bring in an illicit drug. The president and his family were at Camp David the weekend it has happened, and they have full confidence in the Secret Service ability to continue to protect the president and his family. And so, it does not seem that this has raised the threat level at the White House, but I think there are general concerns about the ability for people to bring in any sort of illicit substance into the White House.",

So, when you look at what this substance was, it was not a chemical biological agent that could impact the complex. It could not harm the president. So, the Secret Service has to explain tomorrow in the hearing the difference between investigating a criminal act and actually addressing and mitigating a threat. And I think that people are associating, just because it is a small white bag, they say, well, if I can get this contraband in, then I can bring an anthrax or other types of substances. That is incorrect because the Secret Service actually from a threat perspective has a very comprehensive program of monitoring for those types of threats. From the criminal acts -- now, listen, I think at the end of the day, the director is going to have to tell Congress what they are going to do in terms of protocol and process for screening to look for these criminal elements.

And that text right there where someone tells him, these things that you're talking about, we don't need proof, we just need to say it, that to me is the definition of recklessness. So, that text is going to hurt him in that case. Bigger picture, let's remember, he's under a criminal investigation potentially by DOJ. We know by the Fulton County D.A., they've notified Rudy Giuliani, he's a target. One of the things he's under investigation for is allegedly lying to the Georgia State legislature about election fraud claims. Here he is being told, there is no proof of these things.

No way on earth they bring him in for that kind of interview unless if they believe there's any chance he's a target. Bob Castello would ask them. I'm not going to bring Rudy in if you might charge him. So, start with that. But I also don't think there is any way Rudy Giuliani will become a cooperator in the proper sense of the term. I cannot see a scenario where a federal prosecutor for the United States stands up in court and says, our next witness, your honor, is Rudolph Giuliani. Can you imagine that? I mean, you know, whatever people may think of him, he has zero credibility. So, if they don't see him as a target and they don't see him as a witness, what is it? The best I can do is this.
