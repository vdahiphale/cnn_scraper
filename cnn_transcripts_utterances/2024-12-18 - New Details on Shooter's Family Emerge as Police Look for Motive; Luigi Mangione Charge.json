As part of that, John, she -- as you mentioned, her parents had been married and divorced several times. As part of one of the custody agreements, well, 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, who went by Sam, was enrolled in therapy. And the custody agreements for a child were pretty turbulent, John. What was described by The Washington Post in those court records is custody agreements that sometimes forced Natalie to move between homes every two to three days. So, quite a bit to learn more there, John. Law enforcement still has not released any details about who the lawful owner of the gun is. They've said that the ATF has traced the firearm but they have not described who -- again, who was the lawful owner and how that 15-year-old was able to obtain that gun. We are also learning more from fellow students about Natalie Rupnow's time at Abundant Life Christian School. We spoke with one child whose locker was right next to hers and she said this, John, she didn't really have a friend group. She's new this year. She's a freshman. She went by Sam. And this child described as being surprised that Sam was her name and saying she didn't really know that much about her, John. And so the profile of this child that is coming into clear view is one of, again, a very turbulent childhood and someone who is in this school community, but knew and possibly harboring very, very troubling secrets and what could be, at least described by this child who knew her a little bit, largely alone, John.",

It's part of an 11-count indictment against Mangione, who's accused in the killing of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.A first-degree murder charge is rare in New York. It requires a special circumstance, like an intent to commit terrorism. The indictment, coming ahead of Mangione's next extradition hearing, that is tomorrow in Pennsylvania.

But, of course, the blockbuster one, this new indictment that was announced by the Manhattan district attorney, it included that rare first degree murder charge. As you noted, the reason it's rare is because it requires special elements related specifically to the crime, and it also applies to just a narrow list of aggravating circumstances.And then Bragg also announced that Mangione was indicted by a grand jury for murder in the second degree as a crime of terrorism. D.A. Alvin Bragg saying clearly in a press conference yesterday, this was a killing intended to invoke terror. Now, meanwhile, Sara, we also have some updated information about how the outside world really is trying to communicate with Mangione while he remains behind bars. Not too far from where we are at the courthouse in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, as of yesterday, Luigi Mangione had received 157 deposits into his prison commissary account. And also, as of yesterday morning, he'd received 33 emails and 6 pieces of mail. That's actually up from the just two pieces of hard mail that we reported back on Monday evening. Still, though, the only visitors he has had has been his attorneys so far inside of that prison. But all that being said, Sara, the NYPD, they actually spoke out very forcefully yesterday about this lionizing of Mangione. Take a listen to what the NYPD commissioner had to say.

And then the second hearing that will come right after is going to be on those extradition proceeding.CNN's Kara Scannell reporting yesterday that Mangione is not going to fight extradition.

      "sentences": "Well, John, there's really not much drama over what the Fed is going to do today. The real suspense is over what comes next. Now, the market is pricing in a 95 percent chance of a quarter point cut from the Fed today. They almost have to cut because if they don't, it would shock markets and Fed officials do not like to shock markets.So, listen, if you're a borrower, this is good news because it means rates are coming down. If you're in the market to finance the purchase of a car, you're trying to pay off credit card debt, trying to get a mortgage, this is a welcome sign. Interest rates are still high, but they have started to move noticeably lower since the Fed started cutting interest rates in September. You can see it on that chart still near multi-decade highs, but coming down a bit. But the bad news for borrowers is that the Fed is also likely to signal today that they plan to tap the brakes on interest rate cuts next year. They're going to release new projections. Back in September, Fed officials were penciling in four rate cuts in 2025. Now the thinking is maybe they'll be penciling in two or three rate cuts. Listen, it is an awkward time when you think about it for the Fed to be cutting interest rates. There's really no need to come to the rescue of the economy. Unemployment rate is relatively low. The economy is still growing at a rapid pace and the war on inflation has stalled out a bit, right? We know food costs and housing costs remain stubbornly high. And then there are these risks around the policies of the incoming Trump administration, notably, mass deportations, which you guys were talking to Priscilla about last block. And if you're talking about millions of mass deportations, that, of course, could cause worker shortages in areas like agriculture and construction. And also, there are concerns around a potential trade war. So, yes, an interest rate cut today looks imminent, John. But, yes, it could be the last one for a bit.",

You can see on that chart how the market had been going straight up. I mean, John, I remember being on set with you in New York after the election, and there was so much excitement in the stock market, but it has come back here.I would caution though, we're talking about the Dow. It's just 30 stocks. The broader market, the S&amp;P 500, hasn't really dropped nearly as much. The NASDAQ is still near record highs. And, listen, pullbacks in the market are healthy. The market cannot go straight up forever. Despite these losses that we've seen in the last week and a half or so, that was still up 15 percent on the year, the S&amp;P 500 up almost 30 percent, the NASDAQ up more than 30 percent so far this year. So, you know, we shouldn't overreact to this, but, John, it is another reminder that while the initial focus on Wall Street was about all the positives of the Trump agenda, there are risks as well.
