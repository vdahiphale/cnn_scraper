We'll show you the moment it happened and the aftershocks that continue.Also, with the former president's hush money trial days away, he's trying yet again to get the judge in the case to recuse himself. We'll have the latest on that. Plus, the total solar eclipse is Monday. We'll help you get ready tonight. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. A short time ago, we experienced the 12th and latest aftershock from a magnitude 4.8 earthquake in New Jersey that rattled nerves and windows across the Northeast this morning. It was the strongest quake to hit the state since America officially secured its independence from Great Britain. No deaths or significant levels of damage, but delays at several of the nation's busiest airports, as well as rail travel, disrupted lives in one of the most densely populated areas of the country. In a moment, we'll look at why smaller earthquakes on the East Coast may potentially have a greater impact than similar ones in the West. But first, Polo Sandoval joins us from Times Square. So there was this 4.0 magnitude aftershock right before 6 o'clock. I didn't even feel that one. Did you feel it in Times Square?",

And there's actually a forecast on the USGS webpage for a sequence that could continue for months or even years at a low rate. And if you look right now, there is a chance of aftershocks and even another earthquake magnitude 5 or greater. The chances statistically of a 5 or greater are actually 1 in about 15 over the next year, so that's a low chance. But 1 in 15 is not zero.

In the West, you have two plates that are moving relative to each other, the Pacific plate versus the North American plate.On the East, the North American continent is pretty much glued to the oceanic crust. That's next to it. There's no plate boundary that's moving. So you don't have a California-style earthquake zone along the East. But you do have these broad stresses. You're getting earthquakes that are spread out along the Atlantic seaboard. We've had large earthquakes in the past in Charleston, South Carolina, close to magnitude 7 in 1886. Another event over magnitude 7 offshore of Grand Banks in 1929. So these infrequent but large earthquakes are possible along a broad zone that we really don't understand very well because of the - we don't have as much data as for California.",

The apparent delay tactic cites the former president's presumptive status as the Republican nominee for president and need to campaign as a new justification for the request.The former president also cites a comment Judge Juan Merchan made to the Associated Press last month. The judge declined to discuss the case but said the preparation for the trial was \"intense.\" And once again, the former president takes a swipe at the judge's daughter and her alleged political connections. This comes days after the judge expanded the gag order against the former president to include all family members of court staff, including the judge's daughter. The former president has apparently already flouted that order on more than one occasion. Now, the Manhattan D.A.'s office has previously said that Trump offers no evidence for recusal other than a \"daisy chain of innuendos.\" I want to get some legal perspective now from former federal chief judge John Jones III and former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. Judge Jones, what do you make of this filing from the Trump team? Is there any evidence in your mind that the judge should recuse himself? JOHN E. JONES III, FORMER CHIEF JUDGE, U.S. MIDDLE DISTRICT COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA: Well, Anderson, first of all, it's good to be back with you. I don't see anything in the motion that's new. They indicate that the predicate for this motion, as opposed to the one that they filed last year, is that he's now the nominee instead of the presumptive nominee or he's going to be the nominee. I don't think that that changes anything in particular in terms of a factual basis. And you just mentioned that the judge made some statements to the press. I frankly don't see anything there that would disqualify him. Of course, preparation is intense. Some people would argue that judges shouldn't talk to the press at all. I guess you could make a case for that. But there was nothing that he said that was, in my view, a basis to recuse.",

But he went on the Internet, logged into a site called ActBlue, and he donated $35 to, first of all, Joe Biden for President 2020, and second of all, to a group dedicated to stopping Donald Trump and his radical right-wing legacy. Now, it's a very small amount. But the reason we have recusal, Anderson, is to protect the process. Because the rules say if a person could reasonably look at the judge's activities and question whether that judge was truly impartial, then the judge should step aside. Judges do this all the time. Let the next judge handle it. And I think if the tables were turned, if this judge had donated $35 in 2020 to re-elect Donald Trump, and to defeat Joe Biden and his radical left-wing legacy, I think you'd see the case.

This is last year when the issue was first raised and that ethics panel said, you're okay, you can stay on the case if you want to.I still think the right move for Judge Merchan would have been to step off because we can debate $35 is not a lot of money, I think, by any calculation. But the problem is the man took the time to go on the Internet to click over to ActBlue. He entered his credit card information and he gave money to an effort to defeat Donald Trump and to promote Joe Biden. And I do think a reasonable person can question that. I will tell you, there are tens of millions of reasonable people in this country who question that.

The New York Times reports that Melania made a handful of appearances in 2022 that earned her about half a million dollars from both the Log Cabin Republicans and a group called Fix California. Last November, Melania attended a memorial service in Atlanta for former first lady Rosalynn Carter. And just last month, she made an appearance at a formal dinner reception for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at Mar-a-Lago.
