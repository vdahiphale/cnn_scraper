The government controlled Council reports Maduro won more than 51 percent of the vote with 80 percent of votes counted.This marks Maduro's third consecutive six-year term. Maduro suggested there would be bloodshed if he lost. They've sang a different tune on Election Day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I said it there was peace before and there was during and we have it. And there will be peace, stability and justice after the 28th of July starting from today. Peace, justice, respect of the law and justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES: Opposition leaders had called on voters to go to the polls early and stay as long as possible urging them to take part in the voting. Maduro's main Challenger was the leading opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzelez Urrutia, a soft spoken former candidate who coalition rally behind after their two preferred candidates were barred from running. Speaking in Tokyo moments ago, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on the electoral authorities to ensure quote, transparency and accountability of the vote counting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people. It's critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay. And that the electoral authorities published the detailed tabulation of votes. The international community is watching this very closely and will respond accordingly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've been worried for a long time about an accident or miscalculation in causing this simmering war that's been going on since October on the Lebanon- Israel front triggering a full outright war, bigger we think than what we're seeing in Gaza.This -- this rocket strike on Majdal Shams seemed pretty clearly an error or miscalculation. The evidence is that it's a Hezbollah rocket and Hezbollah did take responsibility in a statement for targeting and Israeli military base in the occupied Golan Heights right around the time of this incident. It doesn't make sense that Hezbollah would intentionally target Druze civilians, most of whom are loyal to the Syrian regime. These are essentially natural allies of Hezbollah so it doesn't -- it doesn't stand to reason that they would do this on purpose. But what we've been saying as analysts for the whole duration of this conflict is that when and if we get a regional war, it's going to be because of a miscalculation or an error --",

There seems to be voices in the senior military leadership who believe they have an opportunity to change the balance somehow in Israel's favor against Hezbollah. Whereas the political leadership, the same folks who are sort of pushing for a maximalist course in Gaza, Netanyahu and others in his cabinet, understand the risks with Hezbollah.

Essentially, what that means is the United States and Japan would further deepen their interoperability and cooperation when dealing and addressing with any regional security threats in the Indo-Pacific. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin described this upgrade as the biggest improvement to military ties in 70 years. And the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also hailed the U.S.-Japan alliance. Here's what Blinken had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: For over 70 years, the United States-Japan alliance has been the cornerstone for peace, for stability in the Indo-Pacific and now beyond. And it's helping make our own people more free, more secure, more prosperous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, over the weekend, we saw the first trilateral meeting between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan, between its defense chiefs in 15 years. They pledged to deepen their relations and also helped deter any threats from North Korea. Now another key detail from these meetings, Michael and also the quad that's underway today is how many times either directly or indirectly, China has been mentioned. In fact, in the joint agreement between Japan and the United States, China's political military, and economic coercion was identified as the biggest security challenge to the Indo- Pacific and beyond. So clearly China is front of mind for many of these Asian countries, especially as it grows increasingly assertive in the Indo-Pacific and specifically the South China Sea. Now another concern for these Asian countries is the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has previously toyed with the idea of pulling out U.S. troops from Asia and also has questioned the cost of these Asian allies. So really there has been some fear among these Asian countries but we saw Secretary of State Antony Blinken really tried to assuage those fears and claim and say that the U.S. was still very steadfast in its relationship with Asian nations.

He was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in military uniforms and Joaquin.

U.S. law enforcement officials had previously told CNN that Joaquin Guzman Lopez had duped Zambada and orchestrated their arrest by making him believe they were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate. Instead, the official said, their small private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, Texas, where U.S. authorities were waiting on the tarmac.
