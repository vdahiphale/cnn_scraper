Obviously not in the same words, but that essentially what they're saying that they're not leaving them. They're not putting the military option out of the table, but they still hope that they can find a diplomatic solution out of this. That's what President Ebola Tinubu, who chairs the ECOWAS of the state's summit said that they are exploring every avenue, but there's obviously some impatience from some ECOWAS leaders. Have you heard there from President Alassane Ouattara of Cote d'Ivoire who just says the continued detention of President Mohammed Bazoum, he considers that a terrorist acts and if they don't release him, we should go in there and get him out. So he just really impatient to get this done with because he says ECOWAS has always made it its mission that it is against coup. And it's had one coup to many, Niger, if successful will be after Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea and they are now getting support from the African Union. African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki said he strongly supported the resolutions from ECOWAS, and he also said this I want to read a section of this for you. The chairperson calls on the military authorities to urgently halt the escalation of relations with the regional organization ECOWAS, including the cessation of the continued sequestration of President Bazoum in worryingly poor conditions; such treatment of a democratically elected President through a regular electoral process is unacceptable. And that's become a common theme along for many international partners. The U.S. says it's worried about the well-being of President Bazoum, who has been telling us through sources that he's running out of food and medicine has not been allowed human contact. And he's been reduced to eating dry rice and pasture, so the ECOWAS mission, if it were to go ahead, Becky, will not just be a military intervention to reinstate him it's also a hostage rescue by a junta.

Described there by Bill as if abomb had gone off and it just seems that people had absolutely no time really to prepare for this Brandon, what's the story? BRANDON MILLER, CNN'S SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Becky, you're right. And it's one of those things that unfortunately, prove to just be un-survivable. The winds on Tuesday and Wednesday were gusting up to an over hundred kilometers per hour. The weather is going to cooperate now though going into the weekend where 80 percent containment on these fires and I think we'll get close to hundred. You see the winds in Lahaina 20 to 30 kilometers per hour. That's more traditional Hawaii weather. These are the northeasterly trade winds there used to and there will even be some rain that gets there although not likely to the Lahaina I'll show you why. But here's why the winds are cooperating more now. We had this high pressure to the north powerful Hurricane Dora that was a category for now as a category three, and it has pushed away. Hawaii is no longer being squeezed by these weather systems and pushing those hundred kilometer per hour plus winds over Maui. So that is why we are back to normal Hawaii weather, what they are used to that was certainly something they are not used to. And I mentioned even some rain showers if you're familiar with Hawaii weather very tropical; you can have rain for 10 or 15 minutes on one part of the island. Why the other islands -- other part of the islands stays dry. Here's Maui, and here's why Lahaina is unlikely to see any of that rain. Those winds are coming from here. They push rain up rains on the other side, but not on this side. It's the leeward side of the island. It is the dry side. And right now it's even a little drier than normal because of some drought. That has certainly been in place for much of the year and last year as well. So it's pretty long term. You can see here the rainfall totals are again on that Windward side of the island. So do not expect rain into Lahaina, but certainly some more moisture Becky and that's going to help even though the rain might not get there. It's not going to be as dry. The winds are not going to be as strong and this is going forward for the next several days. Becky so I do believe the weather at least will bring them some good news there in Maui.",

But I would also say that, you know, we are at a low point, the United States in our relations with Russia. And we continue to have negotiations over prisoners and have done two prisoner deals in the last year, one for Trevor Reed and one for Brittney Griner. Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan are still being held in Russia. So I think that, you know, these governments can engage in these sorts of prisoner deals separately from larger issues. But I think it is a sign that that Iran and the U.S. might be able to have some conversations about nuclear issue and other topics of concern to both countries.

And I think as Jason is saying, these are being, these are seen right now as very separate issues where they could try and resolve issues, including prisoners, while not really dealing with the bigger issues of the time. Someone say, look, you've taken the issue of the detainees off the table, potentially, of course, until you know, this is finalized, we'll see what happens. But if they've taken that, this could potentially make it easier pave the way for more negotiations and more talks. But I found it very interesting, Becky, that this happened just a few days after the U.S. announced the deployment of thousands of sailors and marines to the region, they say to counter Iranian threats in the Strait of Hormuz.
