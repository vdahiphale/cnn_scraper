Arwa, you were out of the country when the earthquake happened. You're back now, you'd live there, you run your charity from there. Of course, many aid workers on the ground themselves were killed or impacted. Speak to the sheer scale of the task of the aid effort from your own organization, but also the broader situation. ARWA DAMON, FOUNDER, INARA.ORG: You know, Michael, it's like trying to fight a monster with multiple heads. The scale of the devastation, the sheer numbers of people in need, and for organizations like mine, INARA, and for other organizations that were operating in the area, our own staff who would have normally been mobilized to respond to something like this, they're also survivors or victims. Luckily, all of INARA's staff has been accounted for, but we haven't been able to reach all of our beneficiaries. And A lot of the children who we treat, they were already injured, most of them inside Syria during the war, during the fighting that happened there. They're especially vulnerable to these conditions, and they have very specific needs. The scale of this, the sheer stretch and expanse of land where so much aid is needed, it's eclipsing anyone's capacity at this stage.",

And so far there has been one UN aid convoy with about five or six trucks that actually made it across that border. And it was carrying, yes, much needed humanitarian supplies.But what that area needs right now is so far beyond what that one individual convoy actually brought in. They don't have in this area anywhere near enough heavy machinery to dig through the rubble. They don't have the international rescue crews that we've been seeing landing in Turkey. They don't even have Michael diesel to run the heavy machinery that they do have in place. It's a complete nightmare. And I've been talking to a number of organizations that operate inside Syria, and just to give you one example, getting money into that area so that they could source things in country or within rebel held in the province is so difficult right now because normally money gets transferred through the system known as the PTT. It goes, you know, through a Turkish system. That system went down with the earthquake. It's back up now, but there isn't enough actual cash, so there's no way to actually purchase what's needed.

So, we're trying to reach those families, who either can't get access to distribution points or areas for whatever reason, and also sourcing and providing specific need tailored items. And then we're also looking at partnering with organizations inside Syria, trying to navigate all those challenges that I was talking about. And then we also have to think about the long term, Michael. We all need to focus on a long term sustainable response. My gut tells me that mental health is going to be a massive issue. We have families who we've been in touch with, whose children INIRA was treating, who are telling us that their children don't want to go inside anymore because indoors is deemed to be frightening. We also have families who are dealing with children who are physically disabled. We have one family whose child is in a wheelchair and they are in a tent, which is very difficult given that situation. And they're afraid to move inside into a shelter because if another earthquake hits, they can't move that fast given that they have a child with special needs. It's all these different little elements that everyone really has to take into consideration when trying to figure out how we're all going to handle this. I mean, it's awful, Michael.",

The balloons can hover, unlike a satellite, which is just going to be flying through. Now satellites will continuously capture an area from different angles, but a balloon can hover and get the kind of essentially eavesdropping that would be very hard for a satellite to capture. We know that it was hovering over potential critical infrastructure, including nuclear and energy facilities, and it may have been able to get pictures or even communications that couldn't have been captured by satellites.

I just want to raise the counter to that because this wasn't one balloon, but it's part of a policy of multiple balloons, dozens of balloons, capturing surveillance throughout the world.
