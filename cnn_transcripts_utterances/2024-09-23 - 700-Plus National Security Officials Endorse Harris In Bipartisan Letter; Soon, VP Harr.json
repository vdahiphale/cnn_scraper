And that's what Biden and Harris of tried to do. We've tried to work that through. I mean, how many times his Biden and, in particularly, Blinken been in the Middle East. So I don't think there's any duping here. This is an issue that needs to be resolved and it needs to be resolved soon. Because we're seeing what's happening in Lebanon that, if this broadens, this war, it's going to include the entire Middle East. Iran will come in. We're already in.

I don't know if anybody thinks it -- it will be done or has to be done, or the election will depend on -- on that. I mean, they're doing everything they can. But we have only so much control over this, Brianna. I mean, the Israelis are in charge. I mean, they are the ones that -- and -- and Hamas and Hezbollah, they're the three main players in this.

SAL MERCOGLIANO, MARITIME HISTORIAN, CAMPBELL UNIVERSITY &amp; FORMER MERCHANT MARINER: Yes, thank you for having me, Brianna. I thought todays testimony has been really interesting. I mean, Sohnlein talks about the fact that they we're working closely with the Coast Guard, for example. And that's one group that's really been missing from this hearing, even though they're running it, is the role that the U.S. Coast Guard has in the certification process of the vessel. I think the testimony last week gives us a lot of insight into how the Titan was developed. And more importantly, we're also seeing a little bit of finger-pointing here between different testimonies. I think a lot of people are trying to focus the blame, obviously, on the Stockton Rush, but Stockton did not build this submersible by himself. There was a lot of people involved in it.",

They were trying to become the go-to ocean explorers out there where they can operate a fleet of up to six submersibles with a mothership.But when they could not get a vessel that met their specifications, they had to go develop their own. And that's where Stockton Rush really came in. The engineer decided to use that very unique carbon fiber design. And the issue comes back to the issue about whether or not anyone was investigating whether that carbon fiber could withhold and withstand the depths over a prolonged period of time.

It's one of the reasons it hasn't been used.And one of the processes -- and we've seen it kind of unravel here during this testimony -- was that the stringent testing that was necessary to certify Titan wasn't being done. They did not want to go to a classification society like the ABS. They were really trying to get down at depth as quickly as possible. And they circumvented what would normally be a long thought-out, thorough process. And that's the issue. We're not exactly sure that carbon fiber cannot be used, but what we do know is carbon fiber was not thoroughly tested at depth until we saw the failure of Titan.",

That's led to a rise in many respiratory illnesses. Number two, we know that vaccine-induced immunity with whooping cough can wane over time, which is why it's important to get your booster doses. And we also know that we tend to see, every three to five years, an outbreak of whooping cough. And this year, like you said, it was on September 14th when data from the CDC found that the number of cases reported that week were five times higher than what was found around that same time last year. [14:54:59] And the best way to prevent whooping cough is to get vaccinated. Whooping cough is also known as pertussis. And that's included in the TDaP and Dtap vaccines. These are vaccinations that are included in the routine childhood immunizations. The CDC also recommends this vaccine for women during pregnancy. And it's also recommended every 10 years among adults. So that's why it's important to get that booster dose. And, Brianna, whooping cough itself is a bacterial infection. And while initial symptoms can be like the common cold, over time, it can cause coughing fits. And that whoop noise you make when you try to catch your breath after a coughing fit is how whipping cough got its name. So that's really the symptom to look out for with cases like this -- Brianna?",
