      "sentences": "That's right. That was really a shock development yesterday. And actually the high court did confirm that a document was inadvertently posted to the court's website and this was reviewed by Bloomberg News. And this was involving the case about abortions in Idaho.And according to that document that was uploaded, and we should caution this could change depending on what officially comes down from the high court. But in this, it was a 6-3 opinion, you had three conservatives siding with three liberals, and it essentially allows for abortions to happen in the state of Idaho in the case of medical emergencies, not just when a woman's life is at risk. And so that is what the Idaho abortion ban initially allowed for was, just when a woman's life was at risk, a doctor could perform that abortion. So, that law is essentially on hold for now. And just to put this in perspective, when it was in effect, women had to be airlifted out of the state for medical emergencies. And so now, you know, supporters of this ruling are hopeful that now women will be able to get more care in the case of medical emergencies, which is what this allows. But we should note this is not a holding. This stops short of saying, based on what was posted to the court's site, and, again, it is not official, it stopped short of saying that federal law supersedes state law. So, what that means is that you have the Idaho law, but also 13 other states with near total abortion bans. And this is not resolved. It's still very much unsettled here. And, in fact, there is a challenge against a state law abortion ban, near total abortion ban, a Texas abortion ban that's working its way through the lower court. So, that means this issue could still end up right back here in front of the high court as early as next term.",

So, first of all, a colossal screw up by the Supreme Court clerk's office for posting this opinion, which we don't know for sure if it's going to be the final opinion, but it certainly looks like it. What the Supreme Court did here is essentially say, we're not ruling on this just now. It's called improvidently granted, meaning we screwed up. We never should have taken this case, and we're not going to decide it now.So, really, what they did is they punted. And Justice Jackson wrote a dissent where she called that just out. She said, look, this preserves the status quo for now in Idaho. The federal law, the broader federal law will prevail as of now, but, really, there's all sorts of issues that need to be resolved eventually, including the constitutionality of Idaho statute, the constitutionality of other statute. And, ultimately, the bottom line question here, Jim and Pam, is what prevails, federal law or state law? Because federal law says any hospital receiving Medicare funds, which is all of them essentially, has to provide emergency care if the mother's life is in danger or if it's needed to stabilize the mother's overall health condition. The Idaho law and other similar laws in Texas say no, you only a doctor only has to provide an abortion only if the mother's life is at risk, but not if there's a different lesser but serious medical condition. That's a huge difference with enormous implications.",

They also entered into bankruptcy. And as part of a bankruptcy agreement, Purdue Pharma agreed to give up four point something billion dollars to go to treatment. But they also got a benefit in that agreement, which is that future claims, future lawsuits against them were exterminated, were extinguished in advance.And part of the agreement that the bankruptcy court agreed to is, okay, you're going to give up all this money, but future people cannot sue you for this. And the Biden administration challenged that. And the Supreme Court has now agreed with the Biden administration. The Supreme Court has said you cannot exterminate, extinguish future lawsuits. And the sort of lineup of justices is really interesting here, completely cross-ideological both ways. The majority is justices Gorsuch, Thomas, Alito, Barrett and Jackson.

It was inadvertently leaked on the court's website.But yesterday in a statement, while the Supreme Court confirmed it had inadvertently briefly appeared on the website, it did not confirm that it was actually the opinion. Instead, the statement said that the actual formal opinion would be released in due course. Well, it looks like in due course is today. So, as we reported yesterday in this opinion, the court sides with the Biden administration for now, but this is specific to the state of Idaho. They're saying, look, in the state of Idaho right now, if doctors need to perform abortions to stabilize a woman in an emergency room setting, they can continue to do that, even though the state law would require doctors to wait until a woman's life is in danger. But the reason this doesn't really resolve the issue is because this only applies to Idaho. And in her concurrence, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, she said, look, this isn't a victory because you're not answering the question of what doctors are required to do by law now that you've sort of tossed Roe -- overturned Roe v. Wade and toss this issue down to the states. So, technically, it's a win for the Biden administration in this highly watched abortion case, but it still leaves a lot of questions unanswered.",

They granted certiorari to the Supreme Court. They took the case several months ago. And now today they're saying, whoops, we messed up. We never should have taken the case back down to the normal course.And what Justice Jackson is saying is we should be able to rule here, because federal law, when it conflicts with state law, should prevail, which would mean broader abortion rights, broader obligations by doctors to perform emergency surgeries. And Justice Jackson says, the result of what we've done here today is we're going to have inconsistency state to state. We're going to subject people the country to ongoing litigation working its way through the federal district courts, courts of appeals before I think, and I think Justice Jackson agrees, ultimately will end up back at the Supreme Court when you have such a square clash between federal law and state law. And the issue is so fundamental as to when do doctors have to give emergency care to patients, to women who are pregnant? That's such an important question. There's such a square conflict here. It will end up before the Supreme Court, but not for potentially many years. So, that's the frustration that Justice Jackson is voicing. But Paula is exactly right. The practical effect for now is that in Idaho, doctors do have to give emergency care to women if their lives are in danger, or, and this is where the conflict comes in, or if it's necessary, short of saving their life, if it's necessary to stabilize a serious medical condition.",

So, this is going to have big implications for women in Idaho, as well as providers in Idaho, some of who have actually left the state because of the abortion ban. And, you know, before today's ruling, when the ban was in effect, women had to be airlifted out of the state.And so this will have a big impact on women there, but like you said, this is far from settled across the board in this country.

Elie, Pamela, thank you very much.I want to go out to Meg Tirrell. And, Meg, a little weird in terms of how this ruling came out yesterday but it sounds like it's pretty much in line with what we saw yesterday. What do you think? What is this going to mean for women's health?",
