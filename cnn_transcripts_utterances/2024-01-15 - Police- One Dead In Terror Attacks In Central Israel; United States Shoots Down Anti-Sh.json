The police suspect terrorism. Republican voters in Iowa are just hours away from officially kicking off the 2024 race for the White House, despite frigid temperatures. And spectacular scenes in Iceland as the second volcanic eruption spews lava. The Israel-Hamas war has passed the 100-day mark. Today, on CONNECT THE WORLD, we've been documenting the suffering in Gaza. But I also want to start this hour with a look at the impact the conflict is having beyond Gaza's borders, and specifically, in and around the Red Sea, where Iranian backed Houthi rebels from Yemen have been attacking commercial ships. And just within the past hour, the U.K.'s maritime security agency reports a vessel, about 95 nautical miles from Yemen was hit by a missile. That comes just days after the U.S. and U.K. attacked Houthi targets in Yemen. Britain's prime minister is expected to talk about the Houthi strikes in about 30 minutes and we'll listen in. Meanwhile, in Lebanon, Hezbollah's leader is vowing to continue confrontations with Israeli forces, saying only a ceasefire in Gaza would open the possibility of an end to the crossfire on the Lebanon Israel border. In Israel today, police say at least one person was killed and at least 17 wounded in twin terror attacks carried out simultaneously. Nic Robertson is at the scene of those attacks in Israel. And we've also got Nada Bashir in Beirut for us. Nic, let's start off with you. What are you seeing on the ground right now?",

Some people calling in even the first time of an incident like this, where there were two attackers attacking simultaneously in the same type of attack. 17 people were injured one person, a lady in her 70s was killed in the attack. And these two brothers from about 100 miles away in Hebron, the police say, stole vehicles and then attacked different areas in this middle-class town at roughly almost precisely the same time. And that's where the confusion came in. And they actually struck three different locations. This is one of the locations. And you can see the force of the impact on this vehicle. The side of that vehicle, the far side, that's smashed up by the force of the impact. But perhaps where most of the casualty is occurred, appear to have been at a bus stop where people were waiting for a bus. One vehicle can -- we're looking at before had smashed into the side of the road near that bus stop. And it's not the first time that attackers attacking Israelis in their cities have taken vehicles and try to ram into them at bus stops.

And these are really important planes for the Russians and certainly big victories for the Ukrainians if all of this holds true. One of these planes called an A-50 Beriev, which is essentially a big cargo plane with a lot of electronics inside, and a big radar dish on top that's a century, a command-and-control posts, but also an electronic surveillance radar plane as well, which the Ukrainian say, has been helping the Russians to conduct a lot of their area campaign inside Ukraine. To target areas, but also to lead jets to areas that planes would then target. Now, so far, the Ukrainians are saying that two planes were destroyed. But it seems as though they're couching that a little bit now because there was a second plane called an IL- 22, which is essentially a flying command post. It's an older plane, but also one that's full of a lot of electronics. The Russians don't have a lot of that. One of the things that we've attained now, Eleni, that is what appears to be an escorting Russian jet fighter talking to a control tower inside Russia saying that this plane has said that it has trouble and that it needs to make an emergency landing I want to listen into that very quickly.

So far, it's unverified whether or not that is actually that IL-22. But right now, the Ukrainians are saying that one plane was completely destroyed, but the other one appears to have made an emergency landing. The Ukrainians believe that, that plane suffered substantial damage, might be beyond repair, but it seems as though it was able to make an emergency landing. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians are saying that this is hugely significant for them. They are saying this operation took place in the Azov Sea, which itself is quite remarkable because it's pretty far away from anywhere with the Ukrainians would have any sorts of air defenses. Again, so far, the Russians not commenting on the matter at all. At the same time, though, you can hear from Kyiv, from senior Ukrainian military officials, saying this was a successful and very important operation for them, Eleni.",

It allows them to hold large groups of migrants there, while they figure out transportation assets to transport them to immigration processing facilities. Now, right now, the federal government does not have access. It is the state of Texas who has control and custody of that area. And it's not just that area. It's a public park that has the boat ramp that border patrol uses to launch boats into the river to patrol the river. It is miles of the Rio Grande that border patrol right now does not have access to. And the way that you really have to think about this is like this. This is a state government, the state of Texas ordering the Border Patrol agents not to enter this area. And now, the border area is jurisdiction for federal authorities because this is where they enforce federal immigration laws. This is where they apprehend migrants, this is where they inspect them and then they transport them to processing facilities. And this feud between the state of Texas and the Biden administration has been ongoing. There are various legal battles that are going through the courts right now. There is the controversial border buoys, there is the razor wire, those are just south of the river from where I am. There's the controversial immigration law that the state of Texas recently passed. That is also caught in a legal battle. But this really escalates the situation, Eleni, because there are deaths, there is tragedy. A migrant mom and her two children drowned over the weekend. And the Department of Homeland Security says that border patrol was not provided access during the distress call that came in from Mexican authorities. Now, the Texas military department denies that. Says that they -- that is inaccurate, that, that is flat out wrong. We are trying to sort out the details and trying to figure out the timeline of exactly what happened. But that gives you a sense of the escalation here. The Biden administration for its part has gone to the U.S. Supreme Court has asked the High Court of the land to intervene. The State of Texas has responded saying that it's working to provide access to that public park, to that boat ramp that I just told you about. And now, we're learning that the Department of Homeland Security has issued a cease-and-desist letter to the state of Texas, ordering it to give it access. And Eleni, here is the thing, not just access to all the things that I've already listed, but access to federal property. This is the federal government take telling a state you got to give us access to our land, to our own property, because right now, according to this letter sent by DHS, they don't have access to federal land. And the federal government right now giving the state of Texas a deadline of Wednesday, saying that if they don't get access to the border to the miles of the Rio Grande, to their federal property and if the border barriers are not removed, that they plan to take the matter to the Justice Department, which is short speak for they plan to file a lawsuit.

They either shoot up hot ash and rocks into the sky and, you know, cloud the area around it. We've seen that in Iceland before where they've had to stop air travel over the area. This is a different type of volcanic eruption. These are these fissures or these cracks that have opened in this area of the volcano that are spewing this lava.

How to deter and degrade the Houthi's capabilities to continue to attack shipping in the Red Sea, while not creating another flashpoint, another potential front in the Middle East, which is, of course one of the biggest fears that the West has alongside, of course, the war between Israel and Gaza. So, he said that their initial assessment of the U.K. action is that all 13 planned targets were hit. The U.S. has said that they are also still assessing the effectiveness of what happened last week, how effective it was, integrating the Houthis' actions. And I think, you know, case in point, just about an hour or so, before Rishi Sunak came out and made that statement, we got reports coming in that the U.S. Central Command has now confirmed to the -- that a Houthi anti- ship ballistic missiles struck a U.S. owned and operated vessel, just off Aden in Yemen -- in the Gulf of Aden. That is not adjacent to Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, but it does fit a pattern, and the U.S. is now attributing that to the Houthis. So, this continues, it's clear that the operation to try to stop these attacks on shipping in the Red Sea is not yet done. But for Rishi Sunak, an important moment here.

This is very controversial in Turkey for two reasons. First, football is intensely political here, way more than most other countries. And second off, Turkey has made very clear, at least the government has made clear that is squarely on the side of the Palestinians. The president has even gone as far as saying that Hamas is not a terror group. So, as a result of this, Antalyaspor has booted Jehezkel from the team. They say they won't tolerate this kind of thing, even if it cost them on the pitch, and it will. And just 13 games, he scored six goals this year. And the reality though is that, that is sort of the least of his worries. He was also detained and questioned by police for the crime of publicly inciting the public to hatred and hostility. The justice minister said that this was an ugly action supporting the massacre committed by Israel in Gaza. Now, he has left the country as of about an hour and a half ago or so according to the Turkish interior minister. But Jehezkel, at least according to the statement that he gave police who being reported by TRT, the Turkish broadcaster, seems to indicate that this maybe was all a misunderstanding. He said this, \"I did not make anything to incite or provoke anyone. I am not a pro war person. And after all, there are really soldiers captured in Gaza. I am someone who believes that this 100-day period should end now. I want the war to end that's why I showed this sign.\" Obviously, Eleni, this has sparked a lot of outrage in Israel. The defense minister said that Turkey is the executive arm of Hamas, that Israeli foreign minister said that \"Turkey has become a dark dictatorship, working against inhumane values and sports values.\" It's also worth noting that Jehezkel actually sat out the initial few games after the October 7th attack and after the war began because he didn't want to sit through the moment or minute of silence for Palestinians. That was going on at the beginning of those games. Eleni.",
