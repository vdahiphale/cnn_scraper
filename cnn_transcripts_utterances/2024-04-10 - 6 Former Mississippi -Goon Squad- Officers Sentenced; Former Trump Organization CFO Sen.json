I mean, it is a bit hard to put your head around that this is still going on in this country. I mean, I guess it is gratifying, to some extent, to see -- I mean, these are police officers in these, you know, these out these jail outfits that they've got them in right there that you're seeing on screen right now. So, I suppose there is accountability, but it does raise the question as to, I mean, how much of this is still going on in America right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, police brutality can be a complicated subject because you have uses of force that are engaged in many different circumstances where something has already kicked off. There's some disorder or violence going on where police intervene.This is not that. This for people who are, kind of, just familiarizing themselves with this story starts with a phone call from a neighbor saying there's an old lady who lives on a piece of property, a ranch house down the street. There's a bunch of black guys who have moved into the house. We think something's going on. These sheriff's deputies from the sheriff's office joined by one police officer from the local department drive a long distance away to get to this house, to this piece of property. And they plan to avoid the security cameras at the house, to kick in the door, to basically do a warrantless home invasion and beat and torture and terrorized these two men. One of whom was the caregiver for the woman in the house who was in the hospital at the time, and tried to get them to admit to doing things that they weren't doing, to possession of drugs, to other things. And this went on for hours, including after shooting one of them in the mouth and leaving him there to bleed while they went out back and concocted a story that would work. It was investigated by the state attorney general because of the shooting. But this was only uncovered when these two men bravely came forward with a story that was so insane, that it would be hard for anyone to believe and told this story. And then federal and state authorities did their investigation and proved it. But it is, at any level, still shocking.",

The former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization admitted to lying under oath in the civil fraud case against the former president. Weisselberg also helped exaggerate the value of Trump's New York penthouse in order to get better rates on loans and insurance policies.CNN's Kara Scannell is live outside the courthouse for us.

The hearing took less than five minutes. Weisselberg walked in with a windbreaker, ready to report to prison.During the hearing, the judge asked him if he had anything he wanted to say. He said, No, Your Honor. She then said she would sentence him to this agreed deal of five months in jail. He had pleaded guilty last month to two counts -- felony counts of perjury for lying during the investigation by the New York attorney general's office into the Trump organization's finances. Specifically, he admitted to lying about his knowledge that the size of Trump's triplex apartment was false and that about his role in his knowledge of making this -- the value of that triplex apartment false in the financial statements. Now, soon after the judge sentenced Weisselberg to the five months, the security officers came up to him, handcuffed him behind his back, and he was led out of the courtroom where he will begin serving the sentence at Rikers Island. This is the second guilty plea by Allen Weisselberg, who previously pleaded guilty to 15 counts of tax fraud. He is a long-time confidant of former President Donald Trump. And as part of this deal, he will not be testifying against Donald Trump at the trial set to begin next week. He is a central figure in that trial. This is about the falsification of the documents to cover up the hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels. Weisselberg, the chief financial officer at the time, was involved in how those payments were made. And the reimbursement of payments to Michael Cohen. But he will not be testifying in that case. Instead, he will be serving his five months at Rikers Island. Jim.",

He was not, however, he was -- although he was charged with lying under oath during that trial, the Manhattan D.A.'s Office allowed him to plead guilty instead to lying in a deposition prior to that because otherwise it would have triggered a violation of his parole from the last time that he plead guilty to protect Trump, which was, on those tax fraud charges.So, it was just very interesting to me that he's willing to do another five months like he already did rather than turn on Trump.",

At the time that he was doing this, he was candidate Trump and he was trying to prevent this from going to the electorate. So that's personal. It's not presidential in nature. But you never know.

They've come -- overcome differences in the past to try to put both countries on stronger footing together. This visit comes as the U.S. has really sought to bolster these alliances and relationships in the Indo- Pacific with an eye on trying to blunt China's military and economic influence in the region. Japan, as the president noted, has really been at the cornerstone, the center of the Biden administration's policy in the Indo-Pacific region. At a time when Japanese Prime Minister Kishida has shifted and increased the country's defense policy, as well as offering a longstanding support to Ukraine amid its Russia's invasion of the country. The Biden administration really has seen a willing partner in Kishida across a range of areas with the president really saying that this isn't just about the Indo-Pacific but a global partnership. But these two leaders are expected in the coming hours to roll out a host of announcements relating to defense, security, people to people ties. All as they are trying to showcase the strength of this relationship, especially as they're trying to counter some of China's influence in the region.",

I think what it does mean is that it is less likely that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates as quickly as either it had hoped or it had predicted, or the general public and markets had hoped.And that's what you see in the markets today. If you look at where investors are expecting rates to be later this year, they have severely reduced the chances of a rate cut by June, and they're expecting only a couple more rate cuts later this year. And that's because the Fed doesn't want to take -- well, the intuition is that the Fed will not be willing to take its foot off the brakes because that risk of inflation is still there.",

We don't know what's going to happen with oil and energy prices, which also affect or can push through to other forms of inflation.So, you know, I think it is a concerning potential scenario, particularly since we haven't seen eight percent rates in a few decades since the '90s.
