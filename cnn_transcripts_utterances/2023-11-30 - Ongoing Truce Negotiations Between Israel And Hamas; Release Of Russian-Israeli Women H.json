Two major stories we're following right now, one overseas and the other here at home on Capitol Hill. Any moment now, we expect to hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken after a series of key meetings during his high-stakes trip to Israel.And soon, the House is set to debate an expulsion resolution for Republican Congressman George Santos. The New York freshman remains defiant ahead of an expected vote to kick him out of Congress. Santos lashed out at his colleagues during a Capitol Hill news conference, accusing them of bullying in the wake of that scathing House Ethics Committee report. That report says that Santos spent thousands of dollars on things like Botox, personal vacations, paying off personal credit cards, and a pile of luxury goods. CNN's Lauren Fox is live for us on Capitol Hill. So, Lauren, as lawmakers weigh whether to boot Santos from Congress, what are the chances he survives this vote tomorrow, as he's already done on two previous occasions.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that is really the key question and what we are going to be watching in the hours and day ahead. We expect that this expulsion vote will come to the floor tomorrow in the House of Representatives in the morning at some point. We also know, of course, that there are a lot of questions about whether or not some Republicans will be too uncomfortable with the fact that Santos has not been convicted of a crime at this point to actually vote to expel him.Now, momentum has grown since the House Ethics Report has come out with these allegations that he misused campaign funds on some of the items that you laid out there on OnlyFans, as well as other luxury goods. But so far, despite the fact that reporters have pressed him repeatedly on if these allegations in the committee report are true, he says he doesn't want to go line by line. He says there will be a time for that, but he's not going to get into the specifics at this moment. He also just wrapped up a pen and pad meeting with reporters behind closed doors, so this was not on camera. But he answered additional questions about his future, about whether if he is kicked out of Congress tomorrow, he would continue to show up using floor privileges that members of the House of Representatives have as a member or former member of the House if indeed he is expelled. But again, the key question is, are the votes going to be there? And right now, despite the fact that there was growing momentum after the Ethics Report came out, it's just not clear. You heard yesterday from House Speaker Mike Johnson that he was concerned and had some reservations about moving forward with expelling a member who has not been convicted. Obviously, a lot of members are looking to their new speaker as to whether or not they're going to be willing to move forward with that either. Boris.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's exactly right, Brianna. So far, we have seen two of the eight Israeli hostages who we expect to be released today come out of the Gaza Strip and now on their way to hospitals. Those first two are Mia Shem, that 21-year- old who you just referenced having that emotional reunion with her mother and her brother. She was also the first hostage that Hamas released a video of early in this conflict. The second hostage is 40- year-old Amit Susanna, who was also freed alongside Mia Shem. But there are six others who we are expecting to see emerge from the Gaza Strip tonight. The reason why these releases are happening separately is because it's believed that they are held in different locations within the Gaza Strip.But amid all of this, Brianna, there is still a question about what comes tomorrow. We saw already as today that truce between Israel and Hamas that has allowed for the release of these hostages, that has allowed for the release of Palestinian prisoners, was renewed only minutes before it was set to expire. And we could very well be facing the same situation tomorrow. We know that yesterday, over the course of the day, there was extensive negotiation to try and salvage that truce to ensure that Hamas would release more Israeli hostages, to allow for the Palestinian prisoners to get out, as well as those hundreds of trucks of aid that the people in the Gaza Strip have benefited from, and we are witnessing something very similar brewing right now. Both Hamas and Israel have made clear that if this truce is not extended, they will return to the fighting very soon. In fact, the Israeli prime minister saying that if this once this operational pause is ended, that he will unequivocally return to the fight. We know that Hamas made a series of proposals yesterday that weren't acceptable to the Israelis, and ultimately at the last minute Israel accepted to have eight hostages released today and include those two Russian- Israeli women who were released late last night. But we are now getting to the point where Hamas may be running out of women and children who they can actually find and release as part of this deal. That is something that is certainly brewing. And beyond that, just their ability to actually abide by the terms of the deal, Israel to accept the terms that Hamas is willing to offer, leaving a lot in question and the very real possibility that war could be back on tomorrow.",

Killed on the spot the two attackers.Now, both of these attackers had been in Israeli prison. One of them had just finished in 2020, serving a 10-year term. And very soon after this attack, Hamas put out a statement on its Telegram channel, accepting, in their words, full responsibility for this attack. Obviously, here in Jerusalem, nerves are on edge. Because of the war, but certainly, this is the first major attack of its kind in Jerusalem since the 7th of October. Brianna.",

And our sources are indicating right now that in the conversations with Secretary Blinken, the Israelis have taken a pretty hard line, that their first goal is to destroy Hamas, and that if this process of, getting the hostages out, breaks down, they're going to move forward with that again. I think it puts them in a pretty problematic situation.First of all, they're going to have to start moving the operation to the south. Well, the south, of course, is where they asked everybody to move to a few weeks ago. So, there are a lot of civilians who are sort of stuck down at the bottom end, trapped there, and that the war may follow them there. The second problem is they're going to have a lot of international pressure. You're already seeing that now. Not to be the ones to resume here, even if they're not getting hostages out at the numbers at which they hoped. And so, Secretary Blinken is sort of pressing for time at this moment. He's just hoping that he can, you know, buy some time here to be able to get more hostage releases happening",

We've learned that one option that U.S. and Israeli officials are weighing is whether to move civilians in the south back north, I'm wondering what that process would look like. How would the IDF keep Hamas from moving as well, in theory? LYONSThat is the real solution that that has to be somewhat negotiated at this point, because the fight is eventually going to the south. Israel is going to pursue Hamas right through those tunnels, right to where they are, to the very last one standing. And it's likely that that battle ends up in the southern part of Gaza.",

That he was so weak, both physically and politically, that he wouldn't last.So, he's still there. And, you know, most American officials concede when you get them in private. There's no way that the Palestinian Authority has the heft and the capability to go run Gaza, which is right now the U.S. proposal, because the other alternative would be, have Israel run it.

Some of them said it is absolutely time for George Santos to go amid the laundry list of scandals that he has endured all year long, and some said it's a very difficult decision for them to make. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP REP. DARRELL ISSA (R- CA): I'm in one of those difficult situations that the voters put him here. He said he's not going to run again. But removing him prematurely is a very tough decision, notwithstanding that he certainly is not out on escape.

It was embarrassing. It was scathing. And they think that someone that engaged in that type of behavior has absolutely no business being in the House. And look, he talks today about how he's being bullied and he's a victim. Look, he's claimed so many things in his lifetime, being a financier, saving the animals and being a collegiate athlete. He is not a victim. He did this wrongdoing, and he deserves to suffer the consequences. He talks about due process. Look, the Republicans, rational Republicans I talk with say, look, he will have this due process in the court of law where he's facing 23 indictments.But in Congress, there is a standard of behavior that is set by them and enforced by them. And those that are looking at this as a distraction and an embarrassment are saying he does not deserve this position. And he's engaged in conduct unbecoming a member of Congress.
