Maybe they concur with the motives here if this actually ends up being someone who was essentially railing against the health care industry. And so that is something that requires that both the private sector and law enforcement obviously keep their guards up. As we we're reporting after that initial shooting, that UnitedHealth and other health care CEOs had their security bolstered. The way this works is a lot of these companies have their own private in-house security. Others may contract with private security firms that specialize in executive protection. And so there is this question about, you know, what type of security do these high-profile people have around them, particularly with this threat kind of lingering out there. And of course, as you know, we've been looking online, and so many social media platforms have become unwieldy to begin with as of late, but there have been a lot of vile comments out there. Everything ranging from people saying, yes, you know, I agree, to others, you know, posting images of other people that are in the industry. Just really vile stuff. And so for law enforcement and these security companies, what they're trying to look for, you know, as in any investigation or threat assessment, is two things essentially, intent and capability. You know, there are a lot of people out there who may intend to cause some kind of harm, who don't actually have the capability to do so. But when you have those two aspects married up, that could actually present a potential threat. And to be sure, this is not an easy, you know, investigative operation for any law enforcement agency. There's this mantra in law enforcement that \"action beats reaction.\" The potential suspect acts, and the law enforcement, you know, then has to respond. And you know coupled with the fact that law enforcement in this country, you know, maybe contrary to what people may think, can't just troll social media without some kind of authorized investigative purpose. And so it is a challenge. And this, you know, particularly in this period, where you have this person, who we now are getting some sense of what the potential motive is, could there be people who have that same, you know, mindset and may try to do something of their own? It's a challenge for security industry folks. It's certainly a challenge for law enforcement -- Brianna?",

      "sentences": "Turning our attention now to major news overseas, a new era begins today in Syria with rebel forces now in control of that country.Just moments ago, Syria's prime minister under Bashar Al-Assad agreed to formally hand over power to his rebel counterpart. The ousted president has fled to his longtime ally, Russia, where he and his family have been granted asylum by the Kremlin. While the U.S. is welcoming the end of Assad's brutal regime, there are major concerns about who now fills the vacuum, and whether ISIS or other terror groups will try to exploit a chaotic situation. The U.S. military says it struck 75 ISIS targets in Syria in the hours after the rebels took over. With us now to discuss is CNN military analyst and retired Air Force colonel, Cedric Leighton. Colonel, thank you so much for being with us. What do we know about this rebel group? Their vision for Syria and what they've promised? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, that's actually a great question, Boris. So let's start with the leader of this rebel group, HTS, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. His name is Mohammad Al-Jolani. He was a jihadist in Iraq starting in 2003. And during the period from 2006 to 2011, he was actually imprisoned by the U.S. in several different places. One of them, Abu Ghraib prison. He moved back to Syria in 2011 upon his release, set up an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Then he split from al Qaeda to form HTS. And then by the time we get into 2023, he'd been organizing this group for quite some time. He conducted some operations, first, against al Qaeda and then against ISIS. And he killed one of the former leaders of ISIS during this period.",

This is a naval base. The idea here, control the eastern Mediterranean or at least have the facilities to do that. The other thing is that Syria, including these bases, plus bases that the Syrians operate around Damascus and several other places, were used as logistics hubs for the Russians to move stuff into Africa. Same thing for the Iranians to influence other areas in the Middle East, including over here in Lebanon. So this becomes a huge deal. Both Iran and Russia are now impeded in terms of their operations and their ability to control events, not only in the Middle East, but beyond that in Africa and other places as well.",

We should note that the current FBI director, Christopher Wray, who would have to be pushed out of the job before his 10-year term is up in order to be replaced by Patel, still has that job. CNN's Manu Raju is with us now from Capitol Hill. A lot going on where you are there, Manu. We're going to get to Patel here in just a minute. But you also just spoke with Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick for secretary of defense. What did you learn? MANU RAJU, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was after a critical meeting with Senator Joni Ernst. She is considered a swing vote on the GOP side. She's a member of the Senate Armed Services committee. And she is someone who's getting a ton of attention from the Trump team and from Hegseth himself. In fact, Hegseth met with Ernst last week and spoke to Ernst over the weekend. And today was back in her office here meeting with her for about half an hour. And that meeting just wrapped up. I mean, Ernst, remember, is -- she is a combat veteran. She is someone who has experienced sexual assault herself and pushed to reform how sexual assault claims are dealt with within the Pentagon. And Pete Hegseth, as we know, has been accused of sexual assault. He has denied those claims. But that was supposed to be a topic, sexual assault and women in the military, were expected to come up in this meeting. Hegseth has previously espoused opposition to women serving in combat. So how that was resolved is an open question. I did ask Hegseth, as he was coming out, just to provide the lay of the land on this meeting, and he indicated that it went well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now that case has been amended to actually name Jay-Z in the suit. Jay-Z has come out swinging, denying these claims in a lengthy statement, which is very rare coming from Jay-Z, who is an incredibly private star. I obtained this statement from his team last night, and he wrote this himself. I want to read you part of it. He says, \"These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one. Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away. Would you not agree?\" He goes on to say that \"these alleged victims would deserve real justice if that we're the case.\" Now, that part of the statement is actually directed towards the plaintiff's attorney, whose name is Tony Buzbee. Jay-Z is saying that he is being extorted and he is being blackmailed by Buzbee, who he says was just trying to settle privately to get money. Now, I reached out to Buzbee and he has denied these extortion claims ever since Jay-Z sued him back in November, claiming extortion. Now, last night, Buzbee told me, \"The pleading speaks for itself. This is a very serious matter that will be litigated in court.\" Now much more to come on this matter. But I have also reached out to a representative for Beyonce, of course, Jay-Zs wife. No comment there yet. But in his statement, where he denied the sexual assault allegations from a then-minor, Jay-Z did say that he is heartbroken for his family. And said that he and his wife, of course, Beyonce, are going to have to talk to their kids who are now going to see these allegations in the press. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is a civil lawsuit that's been resurrected under a New York City law that allows for cases of sexual assault to be brought into the court, even though they would have normally been barred by the statute of limitations. So we saw this with another statewide statute called the AdultSurvivor Act. This is the New York City gender-motivated violence act. So civil suits of this nature, that would have been time barred, are now being brought into the forefront. So that's why we see this coming into the courtroom as a civil lawsuit.",

That's where these cases are settled before they're publicly filed. Now, we know, and Elizabeth laid it out there, was a filing made by Jay-Z under a pseudonym of John Doe. That's before this publicly filed complaint, adding Jay-Zs name was out there in the ether. And so he proceeded on that John Doe motion trying to stop this from ever making its way into the courtroom. That was obviously not successful. And now it's going to proceed in the court of law. He's been publicly identified. So this case is pretty much on the fast track to litigation. And we'll learn more about it as discovery, depositions and all of those aspects unfold.",
