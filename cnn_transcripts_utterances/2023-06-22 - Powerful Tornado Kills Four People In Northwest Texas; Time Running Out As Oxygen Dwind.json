These major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.Happening right now, the extensive search in the North Atlantic Ocean is growing even more urgent as experts believe the missing Titan submersible is nearly or maybe even already out of oxygen. Several vessels are now playing a major role in the search including Coast Guard and research vessels. A Canadian Navy defense ship and underwater remote-operated vehicles. One of those ROVs has now reached the seafloor. CNN has now learned that there were several safety concerns with the OceanGate sub. They include concerns about the thickness of the submersibles haul and previous battery issues. Industry leaders previously expressed unease about the company's experimental approach. One travel firm accused OceanGate of not having a seaworthy vessel. All of this comes as a former subcontractor who worked with OceanGate says the Titans low-tech features were by design. He claims the company used off the shelf items to cut down on research and development as well as cost. And says the construction materials and design choices were considered controversial at the time it was built. CNN has also learned that OceanGate CEO and Titan pilot Stockton Rush said, \"I've broken some rules but to build the now missing submersible.\" CNN Senior National Correspondent Miguel Marquez is in St. John's Newfoundland. Miguel, what are you learning about the search this morning? We know there is now a vessel on the sea floor.",

And use as little oxygen as possible and therefore extend the potential timeline as much as possible.If you are stuck down, you're going to be stuck with somebody who knows how the whole thing operates, et cetera. So having Stockton as a pilot, knowing the ins and outs of how this submersible works is a good thing in this context. Both Hamish and Stockton are very accomplished adventures. Hamish has got three Guinness World Records to his name. He is a very accomplished aviator. He has been diving a lot before and he's just a really nice guy. And therefore, he's -- and he's also a very accomplished businessman. So, he would know to keep his cool. I know. But you can only imagine how stressful and difficult and mentally challenging it must be to sit there in a -- in that can stock, have a fire down underneath the water, must be very terrifying. This particular submersible has done a lot of dive down into the Caribbean. And also, during the other seasons, it has been up and down to the Titanic. And if these banging sounds that we've been hearing recently come from the submersible, which I believe is the case, then that means it hasn't imploded, and therefore there hasn't been a structural fault with it. But it must have been some sort of mechanical fault that just makes them unable to come back up to the surface. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's on a friendship and what we've learned about them, what I've been reading about the Magellan it's it is unique in many regards. But in one regard, specifically, this is the ROV that was used to map the entire Titanic site.Does that make a significant difference in what they're dealing with here? TAYLOR: Well, of course. There are different classes of ROVs. There are working class and there are inspection class. Inspections are basically cameras, maybe a little bit of manipulator arm, but a working class can actually go down a twist cut, turn it. They have different payloads they can attach to the -- to the system that can function. They're used extensively in deep water oil and gas. They go down and they actually weld and twist wrenches and valves and things of that nature. So, it's a much heavier machine, probably run off a dynamic positioning ship, basically a ship that can stay right over the site with thrusters and not move, allow the vehicle to be lowered down to the -- to the bottom on a giant steel cable and a winch. And then from there, it drives around on its own tether to search with sonar and with video imagery, et cetera. But it's a working-class vehicle. It has the muscle to actually perform some tasks down there. And that may be needed in this case.",

This little submersible is only five percent size of that.

At this point, it's the unclassified evidence.So not the classified stuff that's charged in these retention counts against Donald Trump. Those serious charges of the mishandling of national security records. But it's things like recorded interviews, plural, that Trump gave to different people, non-government entities, interviews he was giving with his own consent that we're being recorded. Including that moment in Bedminster in July of 2021 when he had that Iran document and was talking about it to others in the room. We also are knowing from this court filing that the things that his team is getting will show who the witnesses are in this case. Who has testified to the grand jury? They're going to get grand jury transcripts. Eventually, potentially they'll be getting information about who has immunity deals, who's been cooperating. They also now have a full extent of his codefendant Walt Nauta's interview with the FBI. His grand jury testimony as well as surveillance footage, CCTV footage. So that all went to the Trump defense team yesterday, and the court -- and the Justice Department is certifying they've handed that over, there's going to be more evidence that Trump's team is going to have and they're just going to have to assess how strong this evidence is, as they prepare for trial. And Kate, all of this information that's being handed over. Remember, there's already a court order that says Donald Trump can't share it publicly or on social media or with any others.",
