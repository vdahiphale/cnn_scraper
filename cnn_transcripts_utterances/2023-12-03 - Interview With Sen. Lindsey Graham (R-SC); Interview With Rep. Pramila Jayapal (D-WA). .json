I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is six weeks from the Iowa caucuses, but this election cycle already feels a long time coming.In Iowa this weekend, former President Donald Trump is trying to turn to the general election with a brazen, yet not surprising new claim, that, actually, President Biden is the threat to American democracy, not him, even as Trump faces charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 election. President Biden's general election campaign was complicated again this week by the resumption of the Israel-Hamas war. Overseas yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris offered words of caution for Israel as it picked up its bombing campaign in an already devastated Gaza, where Israel is warning Palestinians who have already evacuated to the south to move again, after the U.S. says Hamas reneged on its deal with Israel to release the women they are still holding hostage.

The secretary of defense said it'd be a strategic failure for Israel to have killed too many Palestinians. I don't want any innocent Palestinian to die, but how do you do this? Vice President Harris, tell Israel how to destroy Hamas in a way not to hurt innocent Palestinians, and I will pass it along. I don't know how to do this, because Hamas is integrated into the apartments, the schools, and the hospitals. They have tunnels all over the place. The reason so many Palestinians are dying, I think, is because Hamas wants them to die. So if you have got ideas about lessening civilian casualties, let me know. I will tell Israel, or you tell them directly. But the idea of Hamas still standing when this is over would be the ultimate strategic failure.",
