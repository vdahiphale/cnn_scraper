I'm Paula Newton in New York.Just to head for us, an uneasy peace settles over La Paz after a failed coup attempt that saw armed forces take over the Bolivian capital's main square only to withdraw within a matter of hours. After days of deadly protests, Kenya's president makes a U-turn on the controversial finance bill. But will the announcement actually calm the country simmering unrest? And we're just hours away now, America's first presidential debate of 2024. We'll walk through what to expect when Joe Biden and Donald Trump take to the stage at CNN World headquarters in Atlanta.",

Now, Juan Jose Zuniga had lost his job on Tuesday for reportedly threatening to block a presidential bid by former Bolivian President Evo Morales. Before his arrest, Zuniga claimed the people have no future and it's the army that's looking out for their wellbeing. Now, earlier, armored vehicles were seen trying to break down the doors of the presidential palace. President Luis Arce called on Bolivians to organize and mobilize in defense of their democracy. Crowds flooded into the main plaza in support of the government and to demonstrate against the attempted coup. We want to bring in CNN's Julia Vargas Jones now live from Los Angeles for us, and you've been following all of the developments now. Political turmoil, of course not new for Bolivia.

There will not be a live audience and the candidates microphones will be muted when they're speaking time expires. The podiums are just eight feet apart. Now, that's closer than in previous Biden Trump debates. CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will be asking the questions and moderating. The latest CNN poll, the poll shows there was no clear leader in the presidential race and both candidates have struggled with negative approval ratings. Now we're expecting close scrutiny of course of both men's age and mental fitness as they take the debate stage. President Biden a reminder is 81-year-old -- 81 years old, Donald Trump recently turned 78. The economy, immigration and crime are among the most important issues for voters and those all played Trump's strengths. His advisors are urging him to be less aggressive than in the past debates, keep his focus, stay on message. Aids say President Biden will defend his economic record and highlight his support for democracy and abortion rights. One advisor says looking directly into the camera is a technique that tested off the charts with focus groups. Now, Mr. Biden has spent the week preparing for the debate at Camp David, that presidential retreat in Maryland. CNN's MJ Lee has a look at one specific line of attack he's expecting from Trump.

And while this advisor wouldn't elaborate, of course, still fresh for President Biden is the news from earlier this month that his son, Hunter, was convicted on three felony gun charges. This was a legal saga that was extremely painful for the entire Biden family. And of course, what's incredible is that the president has already experienced his son Hunter of being attacked by the former president on the debate stage. And that was back in 2020, when President Trump said that Hunter Biden had been dishonorably discharged from the military for cocaine use. To be clear, he had been administratively discharged, which is different. He also mocked Hunter Biden for not getting a job, he said until his father had become vice president. And the moment where President Biden defended Hunter Biden in response ended up being a moment that aide said afterwards really resonated with American voters, it was a moment where the president at the time was able to really connect with different American families who have had experience with family members dealing with addiction issues. So, all of this just goes to show the level to which the Biden team has really been trying to prepare the president for anything and everything that the former president might throw his way on Thursday night.

I think, for Joe Biden, he's got to look for opportunities to alter the nature of the race, to alter the trajectory of the race. And this debate presents an opportunity now how long that impact lasts, I think Caroline's point about public opinion. You know, it's not clear that there will be a long lasting impact. But there will be an impact probably on the race, at least in the short to intermediate term. And Joe Biden is looking for every break he can get at this point, I think. So, there is an opportunity for Biden, certainly. There is an opportunity as well for Trump.

The -- he's behind in five out of six swing states. He's especially behind if you look at the polling right now in Arizona. He's behind even in Michigan by big digits and in Nevada. And in fact, in the last week, we saw polling that Biden -- that Trump is now competitive in the states of Minnesota and Virginia, which are Democratic stronghold.

That is something that will work to his advantage. And I know that the Trump team has instilled this sort of ethos in him to say, listen, the more you stick to the issues, the better this debate is going to be. But this is really two humans debating at the end of the day, and that's why there's some unpredictability about where this goes, and whether in fact, they both stick to the issues or not, we'll have to see.
