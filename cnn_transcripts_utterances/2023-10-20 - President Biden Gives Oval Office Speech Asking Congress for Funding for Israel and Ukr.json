We are also following several big developments in Israel's war with Hamas. Today President Biden is back from the warzone and calling on Congress to approve a new wartime aid package for Israel and Ukraine. In a primetime Oval Office speech he called it vital for America's national security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I know these conflicts can seem far away. And it's natural to ask, why does this matter to America? When terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going.

Reporters are right to ask about it because we shouldn't ignore it.But look, I think that the point you're asking is, why did he do this today and what was he trying to accomplish? I heard a couple of different things in his remarks. One, he's trying to underscore to two conservatives that he is with them and that they should continue to approach this the way that they have been, which is they have been opposed to the idea that Patrick McHenry, who has been the temporary speaker of the House, should be empowered with the help of Democrats, right. They have been trying to underscore, that we need to vote against that. We don't want that. And there are conservatives who are very angry at the possibility of that happening. He's talking to them. Those are his people. He said he wants to focus on oversight. What does oversight mean? Impeachment inquiry into President Biden, inquiries into Hunter Biden's activities, et cetera. The pitch that he was making to those who had been voting against him was that the quickest way to get what they wanted was to vote for me. He kept saying over and over, that the fastest way to get the House open is to elect a speaker. He's saying, the only person available for that job right now is me. He wouldn't answer how many times he was going to be doing this, but that was the push. And this was a different venue, as Phil noted, that we have seen from him, he is trying a different strategy, the version that he has of the bully pulpit strategy that we would see come out of the White House. The big question, obviously is, will it work? Or do the concerns about issues like the election that you mentioned, like, quite frankly, his legislative terrorist tendencies that John Boehner talked about are going to allow the government to continue at mean that's I think the concern that those appropriators have.

People came after the Friday prayers, they came to march in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza who are dealing with a humanitarian crisis with no food, no water, and no fuel.But also, with a crisis of just getting the air strikes over and over and over again, which has killed so many civilians who are not part of the government not part of the government that runs that place, that strip Hamas.

They do not like all right, that CNN has been reporting the story. You hear that, but we're fine. But what you are seeing is heightened fear, anger, and frustration with what's happening in general, whether it is us, or the general anger. People feel that Israel is getting more support than the Palestinians, and the Palestinians feel they're getting bombed and losing a lot of lives. I mean, we're talking upwards of 3000 people now killed, 10,000 or plus who have been injured in Gaza. Here in the West Bank, by the way, there have been 67 people who have been killed. Watch out, there's an ambulance coming. And every now and then you have tensions flare. This is what happens in this region. But this is different in that there is a full-scale official war that has been declared by Israel and they may, going forward, go into Gaza on the ground. And there is a huge fear, huge fear from people here that that is going to turn into an unbelievable massacre, much worse than what has already occurred from the airstrikes. That's the situation here in Ramallah. There are very few, actually, comparatively, protesters compared to other places. Jordan has a huge number of protesters.

We are hearing this expressed by Arab leaders as well, King Abdullah of Jordan has been vocal in condemning the violence and calling for an end to the siege, as has President Abdul Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt. This has been reflected across the board. We are seeing that particularly focused on the Rafah Border Crossing and attempts to get but as the death toll continues to mount in the Gaza Strip, these protests are only going to intensify.

It is about 3Erin, we just had Rula Jebreal, who is a Foreign Policy Analyst speaking, who said even though President Biden last night spoke again about U.S. support for a two-state solution, the Palestinians that she spoke with after the President's address last night believe that they are empty words and they do not see action. I think you saw that playing out in the encounter Sarah had.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, absolutely. And I think it is important you know, as Rula said, there is just this groundswell and what you see in Ramallah, we are going to see a lot more of it because we do know Israel is going to do something, it's going to be something notable.They say they're going to see the inside of Gaza. That's unacceptable on the Arab street, just the other night, right so I'm not even talking about now, but after that Gaza hospital bombing news Phil and Poppy. There were 80,000 people demonstrating on the streets in Adana, Turkey, a place that most Americans have never even heard of, Adana, Turkey. There's a U.S. Consulate there. There were 80,000 people reportedly outside of it in that consulate. My understanding was certainly closed at that time. I don't know if it's reopened but had been closed because of that. And that is where we are right now. And it is an escalating cycle, there's absolutely no doubt about that. But we'll see what happens here in the evening, right? People have gotten out of the mosque, that's what you're seeing in Ramallah. We will see what happens in Jordan and in Egypt where, you know, President Al-Sisi had today said there will be millions of Egyptians on the streets if they are allowed to go out and voice their opinion about people from Gaza, refugees from Gaza coming to Egypt right. That specific angle on this could motivate millions of Egyptians. Protests in Egypt have been banned since we were all there in Tahrir Square. They have been banned by Sisi. He is allowing them back out in light of this. So, we have all of these places to watch. And as I should say, the Middle East is a region where a lot of things happen at night. People stay up very late. It is a very nocturnal society in many ways. So, when you see protests, they often continue well into the evening and we'll see what happens tonight.",
