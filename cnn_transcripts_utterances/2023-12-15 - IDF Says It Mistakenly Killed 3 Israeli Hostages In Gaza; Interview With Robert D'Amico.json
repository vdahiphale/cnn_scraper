I'm wondering, do you anticipate that this might change the approach, whether it is described as rules of engagement or just as something else? Do you think this changes the approach for Israel? D'AMICO: I think it may. I think, especially with our visit over there at the time, telling them to strengthen up some things. But it's one of those, they really have to uncover what happened, how it transpired to see that, was it something that maybe got through? And there's rumors out there, too. It could have been that the IDF did not pass anything on it, but some rumors came down that, oh, yes, we have lessened the rules of engagement. Rumors throughout the military during war can get crazy. I mean, that's where commanders and leaders come in. And it could have been something that was triggered from that or it could have been truly where they thought they were being engaged by something running at them. Did they have night vision on? Were they allowed to see into the area that they are looking? All of those things come into play. It's a complex situation. Again, it goes back to people taking hostages when they shouldn't be. Israel has to get critical and say, hey, what really caused this? Was it the fault of a soldier or passing information on rules of engagement that were not understood? That is why the FBI never changes the rules of engagement. There were some talks a few years ago with Ruby Ridge. It never came down. But people got in trouble over that. That is why it's so critical to understand what you're allowed to engage with in a situation like this.",

But as we just heard from the IDF spokesperson, they're going back,they're scrutinizing this, making sure that it can be prevented in the future. The IDF says, quote, \"Immediate lessons from the event have been learned, which have all been passed on to the IDF troops in the field.\" What do you think the troops are being told right now? D'AMICO: They're being told that any good unit in law enforcement has to be very self-critical. Even when we did offsets that went well, the good operators would admit, I didn't do well, and when I took that turn, I was exposing you, and you get very down to it. Those are the ones that go well. So the ones that don't go well, they really have to look at it and think -- I really think they're going to talk about positive identification of what a threat is. Though it could have been, hey, he was reaching into his coat, I thought it was a hand grenade, and you look at it that way, and then it's hard to decipher. But I think they're going to sit down and talk to the soldiers and say, what did you -- why did you engage him? What do you see as a threat? Was it just their -- were they running at you? When you do a delivered hostage rescue, you also know there is hostages there. So was this even briefed that there was a possibility of hostages in this area? That can put a spin on it, too. Where if you are doing a delivered hostage rescue and you know there's four hostages in there or that you're looking for that when you start engaging people, you are a little more critical in what you're looking for. So was not even briefed as a possibility that hostages were in the area that they were operating?",

I want to get straight to Capitol Hill and Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois who joins me now.Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. I know you've been tracking the breaking news into CNN. The IDF acknowledging that three Israeli hostages were killed by IDF soldiers mistakenly identified as members of Hamas. Congressman, I'm wondering what your reaction to that news is. REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): Yes, I'm reminded this week, I met with one of the former hostages who traveled to Washington, D.C., to hear her account of the horrors of her captivity. Obviously, with any conflict, there is the tragedy of friendly fire deaths. We've already heard about the fog of war causing these in this conflict. Obviously, today is a great tragedy as well. And understanding, of course, that corrections have to be made, greater scrutiny and more protections put in place to prevent against such things. But ultimately, Hamas is responsible for having hostages in the first place.",

First, it is the right thing to do. Humanitarian aid has to get in. There has to be humanitarian corridors. And they have to be much more protective of civilians in the area. It is the right thing to do. But it is also the smart thing to do. I fully appreciate their absolute right to try to dismantle and destroy Hamas. They never will completely. But while you are attempting to dismantle Hamas, you don't want to recruit future Hamas soldiers. It is not just the military force. It is a movement. So the manner in which they do this will impact a great deal the challenges they face in the coming years.",

We originally invited you on to talk about the stalled status of negotiations over sending aid to eastern Europe.CNN has also learned that there are serious concerns among not just U.S. officials but officials in Europe as well, that without significant aid, Ukraine could quickly fall to Russian forces. Given that your Republican colleagues have been calling for a more well-defined end game in Ukraine, they want the White House to define victory, how would you define victory for Ukraine? Is it President Zelenskyy's call that Ukraine must retake Crimea?",

I think that is part of victory. I think guaranteed security provisions in the future, a rebuilt Ukraine is part of that victory. And holding those accountable for the horrors of war that I witnessed firsthand. I've been in Ukraine twice since the conflict and I saw evidence of Putin's atrocities, including the mass graves at Bucha. So I think that is the ultimate victory. For someone to suggest that some other countries should sacrifice because we aren't willing to back up the fight for the reasons we fought the Second World War, why we fought and formed the United Nations and the E.U. and NATO. Ukraine is doing our dirty work. And finally, if any of them imagined that Putin would be satisfied with Ukraine, they would not form a federation with public governments and Belarus, Ukraine. Move on Moldova, Georgia, a land bridge to Kaliningrad and beyond. Look, Secretary Austin, General Milley said it best, if we don't halt Putin's aggression now, there will be more money to be spent with double our defense budget and there will be more bloodshed in the future.",

Then, on up across Cape Hatteras and then on up toward the northeast where the winds are going to be blowing 60 miles per hour. A lot of events across parts of Florida are actually getting canceled because of this, even maritime events, because of the wind and the rain. And you know, you don't have boats on a parade when you're talking about winds of 40 miles an hour. We're also going to see two to four inches of rainfall all the way up the east coast. But not significant snow. Highest elevations, sure, in the Appalachians. But really, this is a rain event, not a snow event.
