One of the charges against Kouri Richins has actually been downgraded. Plus, we're getting new information about the couple's financial troubles. The new revelations have caused the delay in the upcoming detention hearing. CNN's Jean Casarez joins us now live. So, Jean, what did their finances reveal?",

      "sentences": "This is an amended information which is a complaint. And there is a lot here. And of course, prosecutors are alleging motive. Right? This is what they're going for with all the financials.But first of all, 2015 to 2017 it's alleged she got four different life insurance policies out for her husband in the amount of $2 million. And then she started spending money. $30,000 on credit cards, $100,000 out of his bank account, $150,000 out of home equity funds. Let's look at some totals here. According to the complaint, they say that at the end she owed her husband $514,000 that she owed the lender $1.847 million. And she owed federal and state tax liability in the amount of $189,000. Now here's one more thing. In January of 2022 -- so we're talking 2 months before he passed -- he had a life insurance policy -- another one -- for $2 million with his business partner. The business partner was the beneficiary. Prosecutors in this complaint say she changed it to her known name. But of course, there are things here that I think the defense will work with. You know, the fentanyl, they said it was orally ingested fennel. And so, the question is -- you can see where the defense could have a defense here because, you know, anybody can take fentanyl, right? And another thing, you talk about that downgraded charge. It's one of the drug charges that she possessed fentanyl but they took away with intent to distribute because it was after he died. She went and she got more. She bought more fentanyl from her supplier -- according to this complaint -- after he died. [15:35:03] SANCHEZ: Four separate life insurance policies. The case gets weirder and weirder the deeper you look. Jean Casarez, thank you so much for breaking it down for us -- Brianna.",

Cleanup efforts began this morning following days of extreme flooding and dangerous land slides. Officials say at least 14 people were killed. Meantime auto makers Kia and Hyundai have agreed to pay a $200 million settlement in a class action lawsuit alleging the company's cars are easy to steal. These rapid thefts took over social media with thieves posting themselves stealing the cars when it was discovered one of their vehicles could simply be started by using a USB cable. The settlement covers about 9 million owners. And a U.S. photo agency that took pictures of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during an alleged car chase in New York is now refusing to hand over the photos to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex claiming copyright law. The agency saying quite smartly, quote, English rules of royal prerogative to demand that the citizenry hand over their property to the Crown were rejected by this country long ago. We stand by our founding fathers. The photo agency has launched their own private investigation into the alleged car chase but says that they disagree with -- that the Duke and Duchess were in any danger.

So, Lieutenant Shane Lamon is not just a metropolitan police officer, he was supervisor of the intelligence branch of the Metro Metropolitan Police Department's homeland security bureau. So, he had access to a lot of important information. And the indictment suggests that he had been sharing this information -- privileged information with the leader of the Proud Boys, this far right militia. And Enrique Tarrio has been indicted for seditious conspiracy -- I'm sorry, convicted of seditious conspiracy. And this guy was not literally, but he was in bed with him. He was giving him information.Here is a Telegram exchange between the two men two days after the insurrection. Lamond: Looks like the feds are locking people up for rioting at the Capitol. I hope none of your guys were among them. Remember, he's talking about a far-right militia. Tarrio: So far from what I'm seeing and hearing we're good. Lamond: Great to hear. Of course, I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name or reputation dragged through the mud. Again, this far right military group. Tarrio: Thanks, but I think for past that -- he misspelled past -- the brunt will come down on us. Lamond: It's not going to matter. Simply entering the building will be enough to get charged. Being up on the upper terrace past the police lines may even be enough. Tarrio: Yeah, I know, will those be felonies? Lamond: Yes, 100 percent. So, I mean, it's very, very shocking and good for law enforcement for going after one of their own.",

This is history.And so, look, it was a huge moment. It was a huge moment. And then I think what happened was he got caught in the crossfire of a country trying to adapt. Trying to come to terms with its past and now its present and its future. And he was a symbol of so much to so many people. So literally, you're correct, every word, every syllable he said, if it bumped against the issue of race, it was going to get the attention of every human being on earth. He said something very gentle about our African American professor Skip Gates being unjustly arrested in his home. And it was a two-week news story. So, but happened in that time though was a new generation, a younger generation of African Americans come on the scene. And they are as delicate. They didn't have to navigate the mine fields. That he had to navigate at Harvard and other places. And they are \"Black Lives Matter.\" And they are saying, hey, we see bad stuff happening and we want something done. You're our president too.
