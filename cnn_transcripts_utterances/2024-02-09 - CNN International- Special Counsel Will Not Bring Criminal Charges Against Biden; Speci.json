If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with some of today's top stories.Donald Trump is another step closer to securing the Republican nomination for the presidency. CNN is projecting that Trump will win the Nevada caucuses, taking all 26 delegates. Meanwhile, Trump appears poised for a big win at the U.S. Supreme Court. Based on their questioning, the justices seem inclined to overturn the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to disqualify him from running for office due to his role in the insurrection. Plus, no charges for the U.S. president over his mishandling of classified documents. During an abruptly scheduled news conference at the White House are fired up. Joe Biden praised the special counsel for deciding not to pursue charges, but it also tore into him for including remarks in the report about his age and mental acuity. More now on the special counsel's decision and President Biden's reaction from CNN's senior White House reporter, Kevin Liptak. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their damn business.Let me tell you something. Some of you have commented, I aware since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from Our Lady of -- every Memorial Day we hold a service remembering him, attending by friends and family and the people who loved him.

On Thursday, it voted to advance a new bill that would send $60 billion of aid to Ukraine, plus money for Israel and other priorities. The move came after a larger bill that also contained a bipartisan border deal hit a Republican roadblock. The new legislation could still be days away from a final vote, and it still faces an uncertain future in the House.Meanwhile, the Biden administration is spelling out what standards foreign countries have to meet to get U.S. military aid. They include abiding by international humanitarian and human rights law. A senior administration official says the announcement is not motivated by Israel's operations in Gaza. Five U.S. Marines are confirmed dead after their helicopter crashed on Tuesday. A military official says the focus is now on recovering their remains. The crash occurred in a remote area in Southern California, and early attempts to access the site were hindered by heavy snow and high winds. The helicopter went down during a training flight, but the cause of the crash still is under investigation. The Federal Aviation Administration and JetBlue Airlines are both investigating a collision between two planes at Boston Logan International Airport. The FAA says the left winglet of one Airbus A321 hit the right horizontal stabilizer of a similar plane while they were on the tarmac. They were in a de-icing area controlled by the airline, not air traffic controllers. JetBlue says no one was hurt, but both aircraft suffered minor damage. A passenger posted these pictures of the damage and a piece of debris on the ground that he said came from one of the jets. There it is. And if the very thought of weighing your checked bags at the airport gives you anxiety, this may not be for you. European carrier Finnair is weighing volunteer passengers and their carry-on bags at their departure gates. It's an effort to better determine weight estimates for planes before they take off, which is not uncommon in the industry. For example, Korean Air and New Zealand conducted similar programs just last year. Volcanic eruptions in Iceland appear to be slowing down. Just ahead, scientists say the lava flow may be decreasing slightly, but the danger is not over. Plus, winter is fading fast across parts of the U.S. -- Chad.",

That includes the one captured in this video in Evansville, Wisconsin. This is the first tornado ever reported in February in that state.There were no injuries reported, thankfully, but power was knocked out in the area. There were also reports of large hail and high wind gusts across the Midwest. Survey teams from the National Weather Service will be out in the morning to assess the number, strength and path of the tornadoes. And after that rough weather, the forecast across most of the U.S. appears to be a lot smoother as we head into the weekend. CNN's Chad Myers has the forecast for you.",

There are the famous commercials and the legendary halftime performances, like Michael Jackson's epic live show back in 1993, which, honestly, I don't remember, but I'm told it's epic, so I'm sure it was. Some simply argue the Super Bowl has evolved into a national holiday and is bigger than any one star. We're getting a look at some of those commercials for the first time, which are going for $7 million for a 30-second ad. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
