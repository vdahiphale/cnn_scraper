But the reality is this area, northwest area, which was bombed and is being bombed by the forces and the regime since new year's and made the situation more worse for them by bombing the hospital and bombing every medical facility, all of that made the situation worse for us and for the civilians. The number of trapped people under the rubble, it's countless up to now. We don't have exact number of the people who are trapped. Maybe our operations, our operations can continue for a week, maybe two weeks, because of that large scale of destruction, devastation, mountain of troubles in many, in many cities and villages. In one village, in the west countryside, 60 people were killed just in one village. And other villages, still the teams working on it to pull the dead bodies and to recover and save the others who are trapped. All this misery, all these tragic conditions, it comes to people who were originally from many parts of Syria. Most of them now under the rubble from other parts of Syria by Assad's forces and the regime. And now they are under the rubble.

Dianne, I think this is probably the most fascinating live shot we're going to have in this show today. But you're there.

And then out on the horizon is where we can start to see some of what appears to be those Navy vessels. Now, look, when that suspected Chinese spy balloon was shot down on Saturday, we were told that they already had ships, they had vessels from the Navy and the Coast Guard that were in the vicinity, that were able to come and sort of set up a perimeter.Now, where we are right now, we're in the ocean, but it's actually not that deep. In fact, where that balloon came down, according to a U.S. military official, it's only about 47 feet. And so, they say that should make the recovery process fairly easy. Essentially, what they have to do is they can use Navy divers and they can also use these unmanned vessels that can essentially go under the water. They can pick up the structure and put it on to these salvage vessels that have been in route coming here to get it. Now, I will tell you that we haven't been told that we cannot go any further, but we are anticipating being told pretty soon that we're not going to be able to go much further, closer to where this recovery area is. Our captain of the boat, we kind of hopped on to a shrimp boat here, and our captain told us that there's usually far more boats and ships that are out right now.

It would be a shame if something were to happen to one of your surveillance aircraft here, and let's be clear, the US does fly surveillance aircraft, both crewed and uncrewed around Chinese airspace. I think we could put up a map here, but those include the Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle, the P8 Poseidon, which is crewed. I've actually been on one of those over the South China Sea when we were confronted by the Chinese Navy.The concern being, does China retaliate? It certainly saying it reserves the right to retaliate. Now, I spoke to a Pentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder -- General Patrick Ryder over the weekend to ask him if he wanted to respond to those -- that veiled Chinese threat and he did respond, and in quite clear terms, he says, \"Let's be clear the PRC surveillance balloon was in US territorial airspace, a violation of our sovereignty. We do not conduct such operations in Chinese airspace, so there is no similar situation. The United States will continue to sail, fly, and operate anywhere international law allows, we always take the safety and security of our service members seriously.\" Point being there, the US making a distinction saying the Chinese balloon came over US territory that US aircraft both crewed and uncrewed go around Chinese territory, but also in those words there, Poppy, you heard him saying, we're not stopping these flights, right, in effect, the US not going to be intimidated by those Chinese comments, but it's a real danger here because retaliation is a possibility, and therefore, escalation is a responsibility, and that is something we have to be watching closely.",

Were we confident it wasn't carrying biological weapons, pathogens, or toxins that could have been dumped into a reservoir or spread across crop lands? Why were they so sure?

We've had bomb shelters before, people can be prepared for this, the government can pay compensation for property damage. There are a lot of things that just are unanswered about what the government do. But there's another possibility here, too. We've talked about this as if shooting it down means destroying it. Back in the day before there was electronic transmission of photographs from space, we used to dump film that our satellites had taken into canisters that came back to Earth, and they were caught by airplanes. Now, I don't know the technology if we still have it, or if we've junked it, or if it was possible here. But you know, as the saying goes, where there's a will, there's a way. Capturing that payload is going to be very important, whatever we can get off the bottom of the sea, if there were some other way to have brought it down more slowly resulting in less destruction, so we could prove this was Chinese Intelligence gathering or whatever is in that payload, we should have taken a closer look at.",

That's a serious problem.That's not what the Biden administration is saying. I wrote these words down, I was so stunned by them. One official told FOX News that the balloons went undetected -- undetected -- and then said, \"Two things can be true at once. This happened and it wasn't detected.\" Well, if it wasn't detected when it happened, how did we detect it more recently? Did the Biden administration invent a time machine? What is the basis of this new detection? Now, I understand that the administration has offered to brief former National Security officials from the Trump administration. They haven't called me, I'm not waiting by the phone for it, although I'd take the briefing if they offered it. I think Congress has got a lot of questions here. This was a botched effort from the beginning. And by the way, the fact that there were earlier transits of part of the United States territory, which I think the administration made public to say, it is nothing new, don't worry about it proves exactly the opposite.
