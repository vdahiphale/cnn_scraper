Now some of it was played on CNN earlier today, but what you'll hear tonight has never aired. From 2016 through 2020, Woodward taped his conversations with the former President, some of which went into a second bestseller on the subject, \"Rage.\" He'll be releasing all 20 of these conversations on the 25th of this month as an audio book titled: \"The Trump Tapes,\" which runs for more than eight hours. CNN has obtained a copy and what you'll hear tonight is striking. It speaks to who he was as President, who he is as a person, and how completely intertwined the personal and presidential were for him and probably still are. Something that's not just apparent in what he says, but even more so in how he says it, something the printed word just can't fully convey. The conversations also speak directly to some of what the former President is now being investigated for, namely, how he views classified material and a President's responsibility for safeguarding some of the country's deepest secrets and that is why these conversations, which have never been heard before, are so significant. CNN's special correspondent, Jamie Gangel has the CNN exclusive on this tonight. She joins us now with some of the audio. What stands out to you the most?",
