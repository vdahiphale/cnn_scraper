As you can see, it's all about earnings today. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events: In a series of strikes Russia takes aim at Ukraine's grain supply. Netflix shares tank after the streaming giant disappoints in revenue. And an exciting first day of action in the Women's World Cup. We'll take a look at the fight to close the pay gap for female players. Live from Abu Dhabi, it is Thursday, July 20th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest. And this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, tonight, Ukraine says Russia is targeting its grain supply after three straight nights of attacks on its silos. At least three people were killed and dozens hurt during the latest airstrikes on Ukraine's two biggest ports, Odesa and Mykolaiv. Moscow says it will now consider any ship heading for Ukrainian waters as a potential arms shipment and Kyiv has responded by threatening vessels bound for Russia. Ukraine's Foreign minister just accused the Kremlin of racketeering by exiting the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The price of wheat has risen more than 10 percent since Russia withdrew on Monday, and you can see that it is slightly lower today, but overall, on an upward trajectory. Fred Pleitgen is in Berlin for us. Fred, great to see you. Look, after Russia withdrawing from that grain deal, a lot of messaging coming through, whether it's Russia saying look, any vessel in the Black Sea, we will consider that as an arms shipment, and then another strong message in terms of striking grain infrastructure in Odesa and Mykolaiv. Tell me, what kind of level of damage are we talking about here?",

And you know, for all of us who have been on the ground near those ports an in that area, we know how many trucks full of grain were going into those ports every single day. So this is definitely something that is extremely damaging to Ukraine, to its exports, and of course, the Ukrainians also say to the entire world, especially to the most vulnerable people in the world, those that are dependent on the grain that is coming from Ukraine. Now, of course, one of the other things that we know is that it is already 10:00 PM right now in Odesa, in that part of Ukraine, the sun has set there and the people there and the authorities there are bracing for another possible wave of Russian aerial attacks.

So really what we've seen isjust a wipe out of that value on the actual earnings report itself. The six million added subscribers for Q2 is good. This is a gamble really that has paid off. The crackdown on password sharing, lots of people were concerned that that might mean people would simply cancel their subscriptions. It appears they've gained far more than they lost in this period, so that's the good news. That's sort of where the good news maybe ends with this earnings report. In terms of revenue, it was a bit of a disappointment, a bit of a minor undershoot though, I wouldn't say that's necessarily responsible for the share price reaction we're seeing today. I think really for investors, the big question is for Netflix and for all of this big streamers, is where is the big revenue stream going to come from next? Because it's all very well, once you've grown in lots of mature markets, and you're growing in developing markets, they want to see more. The years of subsidizing online streaming are over. Now one key strategy from Netflix, which is what they unveiled last year was ad-supported subscriptions. Now, on the earnings call, we were hearing lots of questions about this, but very few specifics in terms of the numbers, how many people are actually signing up to pay for ads at this stage. But interestingly, Netflix has announced it is removing the lowest priced ad-free subscription model in the UK and the US. So it is going to push you either towards a cheaper subscription, but you're going to get lots of eyeballs for the advertisers, which is what they want or you're going to pay a lot more for a subscription, which will now be $15.49 a month if you don't want those ads. It is not alone. NBC Universal's Peacock has done this, Disney+ are already doing it. There are rumors that Amazon might launch this for Prime Video in the coming months. I think for viewers at the moment, for investors, well, they want to see content. They want more content. And the actors and writers strike certainly doesn't help with that. Netflix maybe has an edge though, given it's got all of that foreign content from around the world, foreign language content it can draw upon if content is lacking. But I think it was just a bit underwhelming for investors today -- Eleni.",

And I think that just absolutely could not be underscored enough, going into this World Cup, when we're seeing the most competitive field we've ever seen in women's soccer.",
