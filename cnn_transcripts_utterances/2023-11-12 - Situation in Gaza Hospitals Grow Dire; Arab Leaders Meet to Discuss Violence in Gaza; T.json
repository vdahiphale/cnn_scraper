The Hamas- controlled health ministry in Gaza said three newborn babies have died since Friday night at al-Shifa hospital after a nearby shelling knocked out a generator. A hospital director said 36 infants are still in the neonatal unit, and evacuations have been impossible because of the fighting.Like other hospitals across Gaza, Al-Shifa is nearly out of food, medicine, and fuel. The IDF says it's been engaged in heavy fighting with Hamas nearby, but denies the hospital is under siege. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  We are also trying to coordinate the safe removal and transport of the remaining patients that are still inside the hospital. I want to emphasize, we haven't struck the hospital, and we are not surrounding it, or applying any pressure on it.

Now, when it comes to the artillery, which at times has become quite frequent and at times more intermittent, we haven't really seen where the strikes have landed. And we haven't seen the telltale explosions of the artillery shells landing and that perhaps the suggestion that many of the strikes are lending farther south than our position here again on the northeast corner of Gaza.Much of the intense fighting in northern Gaza has focused on the area in and around Shifa Hospital. Intense fighting according to both Palestinians there as well as to the IDF which says it is focusing there. According to officials from the Hamas-controlled ministry of health, Shifa Hospital, the largest in the Gaza Strip is surrounded with IDF troops in the area and on the troops surrounding the hospital, and that has made it very difficult, if not impossible, they say, to evacuate patients to bring people in and out. This, at the hospital already faces a dire shortage of electricity, food and water, turning what is already a humanitarian crisis in the strip into a medical crisis as well. Doctors Without Borders says the medical system in Gaza is on the break of collapse and pass the point of no return. At the same time, for Shifa Hospital, they say bodies are piling up because it is impossible to evacuate them and move them out of there, and that has made the situation there so difficult. The hospital itself, according to officials, not struck. But Israeli strikes have damaged some of the surrounding buildings there, including, they say, the maternity ward and external clinics. The fighting there also down and damaged the generator and that stop the incubators in the neonatal intensive care unit, and according to the ministry of health there, three babies in the neonatal intensive care unit have died. Israel says there is no siege of Shifa Hospital, and that the east wing is opened for those who want to come in and out. The IDF says it's helped with evacuations from Al Nasr Hospital and Rantisi Hospital, and that on Sunday, they will assist from evacuations from the pediatric unit there. They also say they are in touch with officials from al Shifa hospital and continue to work with them for anybody who wants to evacuate. They say they will make those accommodations. The IDF says it's taken over 11 different Hamas military posts in northern Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising that the fight in northern Gaza will continue until Hamas is destroyed. So, despite international calls for a cease-fire, that simply seems to be, at this point at least, completely off the table. Meanwhile, Jordan has sent another airdrop of shipment in humanitarian supplies to its field hospital in a statement, they think the United Arab Emirates and Qatar persisting in sending in those supplies. Interesting they don't mention Israel in the second time they have airdrop supplies. But sending a flight over Gaza, to be able to carry that out, that would certainly require coordination with the Israeli military, again, as the Gaza Strip faces a humanitarian crisis.

They're calling his two-stage government funding proposal a recipe for more Republican chaos. The White House press secretary says Republicans are wasting precious time with an unserious proposal. It has been criticized on both sides of the aisle.Government funding will run out Friday when the stopgap measure that Congress passed last month expires. And, with aid for Ukraine and Israel stalled, a top Democratic congressman says he doesn't know where Johnson goes from here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GLENN IVEY (D-MD):  Well, we think all of the supplemental pieces should move forward. That would include humanitarian aid as well. The issue is going to be, for some reason, many Republicans have decided that they don't necessarily want to continue to provide support for Ukraine, and I think that is part of why the speaker broke that out, you know, before the Israel supplemental vote that he took a few weeks ago. So, I'm not sure what he is going to do at this point. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams made his scheduled appearance at a Veterans Day parade, here in Manhattan over the weekend. However, he did not add to his previous statements in response to the seizure of his electronic devices, according to several sources speaking to CNN.The mayor had just wrapped his speaking engagements last Monday evening when he was approached by federal agents with a search warrant in hand. Those agents asked that he had over his two phones and also his iPad. According to an Adams spokesperson, the mayor quickly complied. A spokesperson for the mayor, maintaining that the mayor has not been accused of any wrongdoing and that they are fully cooperating with the investigation. The FBI has not released any comment regarding this particular and very significant development. However, a campaign attorney, Boyd Johnson, did say that, after hearing of this investigation by federal authorities into campaign funding, that it was discovered that an individual within the campaign had recently acted improperly and that behavior was immediately and proactively reported to investigators, though, the spokesperson declined to say exactly who that person was. As Adams maintains that he has nothing to hide, but certainly underscores the seriousness of this investigation, now that Adams is, in some way, shape or form, a stakeholder in this, after he was approached by federal agents.
