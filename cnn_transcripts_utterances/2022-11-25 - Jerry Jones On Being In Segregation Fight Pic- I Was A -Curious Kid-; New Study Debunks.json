At the time, President Eisenhower had dispatched federal troops to help escort the nine black students past those resisting them entering the school. It became a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement.So joining us now to talk about this is a member of the Little Rock Nine, Ernest Green. And Ernest, good morning, and thank you for being with us. And I think first off, we just want to get your reaction to what Jerry Jones said, as he's explaining his presence in that photo. ERNEST GREEN, MEMBER, \"LITTLE ROCK NINE\": Well, good morning to both of you and to the audience. Well, my view is Jerry Jones as an opportunity to make that picture, have a different ending, by pursuing diversity and inclusion and involvement of the African American community, people of color, all throughout this country. Dallas Cowboys is an institution that most Americans know something about it. Professional Football is an entity that everybody has some interest in. And I think that rather than talk to Jerry about what happened in 1957, let's go forward and see what we can do in this year.",

But if you look at that picture, in the faces in that crowd, you faces -- you faced similar faces, you saw those people, those people grew up to be adults, many of them still alive today, functioning in this society.

And that Jerry Jones is somehow, he has more attention on him than many of the other owners.He's a pacemaker, he can set the tone. And I hope he will, I hope he'll use this as a stepping stone and not a rock to throw at somebody. But I applaud you done for raising this because the NFL sets a tone for more than just a sports, it really is sets a tone for the country as a whole and going forward as what we need. We need more involvement of the business community. We need to be able to show that there's a relationship between education and success.

They say, if your pee is the color of like pale straw, you're a winner. That's it. That's what you're aiming for. If it's Amber or honey colored, you're mildly dehydrated. If it's syrupy or like brown ale, kind of like a dark beer, that's bad. That's dehydration. You should rehydrate. Drink as much water as you, you know, feel like you can and see it. If it doesn't change, you maybe should go to the doctor. This is so well known in hot weather countries that in Israel, for example, they've made up a song that every school child knows to look at their pee. I'll sing you just the first line.
