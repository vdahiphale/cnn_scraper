Now, Daniels left out, by the way, the most salacious details, but not much else. She chronicled how that night in Lake Tahoe in 2006 escalated from chatter to a dinner invitations at his hotel suite, to silk pajamas, to posing in his boxers on the bed, to sex.Trump listened, a scowl etched across his face for much of the nearly five hours that she spent on that witness stand. Trump nudged, and I say nudged lightly, nudged his lawyers as repeatedly to object as prosecutors prompted Daniels to explain how Cohen, allegedly in Trump's direction, engineered the deal to keep her quiet. Now, the defense, they got their bite at the apple as well and landed some notable dents in her story, suggesting that she was an opportunist who's been making money for years off of whispers of this tryst who's inventing this story from thin air. At one point, Trump attorney Susan Necheles elicited this answer question. Am I correct that you hate President Trump? Daniels, yes.",

The judge sustained.Prosecutor, without describing the position, do you remember how your clothes got off? Answer by Stormy Daniels, no. Prosecutor, is that a memory that has not come back to you? Objection again, defense counsel. The judge sustained. Prosecutor, you don't at this point remember, is that correct? Stormy Daniels, correct. Prosecutor, and did you end up having sex with him on the bed? Stormy Daniels, yes. Prosecutor, and did you know, withdrawn, do you have a recollection of feeling something unusual that you have a memory of? Objection, the judge again, sustained. Prosecutor, what if anything, do you remember anything other than the fact that you had sex with him on the bed. Stormy Daniels, I was staring at the ceiling. I didn't know how I got there.

When I last spoke to her about this on the record in 2023, she began to feel not just about this situation and not saying that the sex itself was not consensual, but that, in general, she felt victimized by the entire thing.She felt victimized by the way that Donald Trump's supporters had gone after her, had threatened her. She felt victimized by the way that her family had been affected by all of this, how her life was being defined, as you said, by this. And she began to feel like, you know, she was no longer just tough as nails and sort of gritting her way through it, and it really has taken a toll on her. But when it comes to the sex itself and whether or not it was consensual, she's never claimed that it was outright rape, but she is operating now in this sort of nuanced place where she's saying that there is a sort of gray area where their power dynamic was made things sort of unclear.

We know it's subjectively sexy, but that's what this case is actually coming down to.But the idea that she is talking about how she might feel afterwards or the victimization by others or the threat by somebody in a parking lot, I think it was in Las Vegas, the prosecution has to focus her on a very narrow window, right, just what happened to secure the NDA.

So it has to be very, very strategic. But that testimony that came in and the fact that the prosecutor is pushing those edges so much farther and then the allegation that it may not have been consensual, that's super problematic for the prosecutor.
