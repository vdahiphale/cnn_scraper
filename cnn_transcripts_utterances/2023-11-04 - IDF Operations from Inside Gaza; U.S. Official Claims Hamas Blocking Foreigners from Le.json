      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening.We are following a number of new developments in the Israel-Hamas war. We've been watching some pictures of multiple explosions lighting up the night sky around Gaza City. CNN's Nic Robertson in Sderot, Israel, witnessed some big secondary explosions and a huge fire in Gaza. You're looking at some of those images right there. That's what his crew witnessed. They witnessed eight rockets as well being fired from Gaza into Israel. The IDF tells CNN that six of the eight rockets were intercepted by that country's Iron Dome defense system and Israeli police say there are no reports of casualties just yet. But the night is young. On the diplomatic front, U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken has wrapped up his meeting with Arab leaders in Jordan. Blinken stressed support for Israel to implement humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza while short of a ceasefire demanded by Arab countries and international aid agencies. In Tel Aviv, the family of Hamas hostages held a rally in front of Israel's military headquarters. Organizers say it was not an antigovernment protest but rather a call for Israel to do more to secure the hostages' released. And CNN was part of the first group of foreign press granted access to Israeli forces inside Gaza. Journalists embedded with the IDF in Gaza operate under the observation, we should note, of Israel commanders in the field and may not move around unaccompanied within the Gaza Strip, and to get this kind of access, news outlets must submit all materials and footage to the Israeli military before it can be published. CNN, we should note, has agreed to these terms in order to provide a limited window into Israel's operations in Gaza. And CNN's Jeremy Diamond was there. Jeremy, some of the footage that you have obtained is extraordinary. It really shows what is happening on the ground. Something we haven't really had a window into up until the point. Tell us what you're seeing. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Jim. We were the first foreign journalists to get into Gaza since this war began and it comes a week after Israel launched this ground offensive. Israeli forces, we joined up with them on the Israeli side of the border, went into an armored personnel carrier. And about 20 minutes later, we found ourselves at an Israeli military position about one kilometer inside the Gaza Strip. This position was overlooking Gaza City. And there was active fighting happening between Hamas militants and Israeli forces, about 100 meters away from our position. We could hear small arms fire, rockets, as well as antimissile systems being deployed. All of this as Israeli forces in the area were trying to work to divide the northern part of Gaza from the southern part. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (voice-over): At this Israeli military post on the outskirts of Gaza City, the fighting is fierce.",

His meeting with the Arab leaders in Jordan earlier today, he stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. That's what they want. He's been calling for a humanitarian pauses.

And the reality is that in this war, there are competing objectives obviously. Israel does want to neutralize Hamas. Israel does want to get hostages out. The United States wants to get hostages out. What are the tools for doing that? Hamas is not coming to the table providing names.They're not allowing the Red Cross in to provide review and sharing information with the families. What are the tools available to get these hostages out? And so I think the leverage point that the question of a humanitarian pause for getting people out, that's the kind of leverage that needs to be enacted. Now Secretary Blinken can lean on that and engage with Qatar and Egypt and our allies in the Arab world, who have access into Hamas, all the better. But right now there's a question of getting the hostages out and not having and be harmed while an ongoing offensive is underway to neutralize Hamas. It's incredibly difficult. So I think that's why we're seeing the delay in an agreement. But that said, it's not as if Israel is not allowing goods in.

It's called allowing the Palestinians to have political self-determination. And that is crucial. And those are the kinds of messages behind the scenes that the secretary can push while also saying we have your back militarily, supporting you, and to the Israeli public, the United States has your back and that, of course, gives President Biden a lot of leverage as he pushes.

And how does this -- I mean, how does somebody get away with something like this?O'TOOLE:  Well, there are a couple of things we know anecdotally, with people that engage in this behavior at health facilities, and one of the things that they do is they do their best to cover their tracks. So you have someone in this case that was working the night shift, when there weren't a lot of other nurses, and other people around, so they were able to get away with it. Once the patient got sick or died, and they were taken to the hospital, and in the majority of the cases, they were not able to really determine the cause of death, and she also participated in the resuscitation of some of her patients. So her own behavior was a behavior that allowed her to not be suspected by everybody that she worked with. But nonetheless, I think one of the most important things is that she worked in facilities where it is hard to hire people. And so to let somebody go, they had to replace her, and I think she realized that and was able to be hired over and over again in spite of previous behavior.",

Anybody who has been in a hospital, been in the care of an amazing nurse, you take your hat off to them, no question about it, sometimes a thankless job.What do you think triggers somebody to get into this kind of insanely homicidal behavior? O'TOOLE:  Sure, I think the choice of an occupation, certainly in these kinds of cases is important. And so we know that we have crimes like this all over the world. They are predominantly women. But before they go into these professions, it looks like there are other issues in their lives that draw them to this kind of behavior. And one of the things particularly present in this individual's life was a preoccupation with death and dying, according to evidence that was uncovered in her text phones or texts on her telephone. She had communicated with her mom and other people that she would get angry at people at restaurants and other locations and her response was, \"Well, I just want to kill them. I just want to give them -- I'm going to give them pillow therapy.\" So that preoccupation with hurting people, because of maybe a perceived injustice or something that they said to her or the way that they looked at her didn't just start five years ago. So I think that preoccupation with wanting to annihilate people is really pretty significant, and when you choose a profession that allows you to be around vulnerable people, you can live that out.",

Microsoft then published an AI-generated poll next to the story asking readers, what do you think is the reason behind the woman's death? \"The Guardian\" CEO wrote in the letter: \"Not only is this sort of application potentially distressing for the family of the individual who is the subject of the story, it is also deeply damaging to 'The Guardian's' hard-won reputation for trusted sensitive journalism.\"  A day later, Microsoft said it had launched an investigation and shut off its AI polling feature. A spokesperson told CNN that in 2021, the company shifted to a system that picks stories by an algorithm.
