This comes after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their release to the committee and the Treasury Department says it will comply and turn over those documents.Joining me now to discuss, Paul Rosenzweig, former senior counsel for the Whitewater investigation, and Ron Brownstein, senior editor for \"The Atlantic.\" Good to have you both, sir, gentlemen. Paul, so, finally, six years later, the committee has access by a court, but the Democrats are going to lose their majority next month. What happens with this stuff? You know, Paul, I mean, do they get it in time to do anything with these returns?",

I'm guessing, though, that they may release some or all of it as part of a final report.The real story here, of course, is that Donald Trump has weaponized the judicial system in a way that allows for six years of delay to be effective and to frustrate legitimate interests of Congress, as well as political interests of Congress, and I think it's going to be really interesting to see how that plays out in the coming Congress as the Democrats run the same playbook against the Republican investigators.",

But in the longer term, medium to long term, I think it speeds it up. It involves dedicated resources, a single-focus investigation. You know, we all multitask in our lives. A special counsel doesn't have to. Sometimes that makes him monomaniacal but often it also makes him more receptive and responsive and quicker to the end of the game.",

      "sentences": "Right. And my answer would be both, I think, simultaneously. I mean, there's no question that at the elite level of the Republican Party, the conclusion about the election is that Trump is a toxic brand outside of the core conservative state. I mean, we really saw a bifurcated results where Republicans in the red states that voted for Trump, did find, you know, the backlash against abortion did not materialize, abortion restrictions did not materialize in places like Texas and Florida, and some of the other states that restricted it.But when you go beyond that, when you look at blue-leaning or even purple states, there was an emphatic rejection of candidates kind of cut in the mold of Trump or with his imprimatur, and, you know, with three quarters of voters think the economy was in bad shape, that is an unequivocal I think message from the electorate and it has been heard by Republican donors and other elected officials. Now whether the base has heard it is another question. And in particular, what we saw in 2016 was that Donald Trump's hold on non- college Republicans was enormous. And no one was really able to dent that. Meanwhile, the other half of the party, the college Republicans, college-educated Republicans splintered among multiple candidates, and there remains the risk to the elites who don't want him as the nominee that exactly that kind of scenario can unfold again. SCIUTTO: Yes. Paul Rosenzweig, Ron Brownstein, thanks so much to both of you.",

Prices between two states drastically different.Shop around, take the 20 seconds, use an app like GasBuddy or Google or Waze, and don't be in a rush to fill your tank. Prices will continue coming down at a pretty brisk pace. So if you're staying closer to home, don't feel the need to go pounce on gas prices falling. It's going to get better yet. SCIUTTO: Yes. I always wait until I'm out of D.C. until I find gas when I'm going on a road trip. Just quickly, you know, there is more travel this year.

It doesn't really compare to 2019 when we had a combination of low prices and of course pre-COVID, but we're starting to get back to normal and see those holiday travels and lower prices may mean more holiday spending as well.",

The woman who was in labor and a doctor were wounded. CNN's Matthew Chance joins us now from Odessa, in the south. Matthew, there were earlier reports the entire Odessa region was without power?

It's -- when we've lit up some of the building here, but basically there's no power in the city. People have generators, of course diesel generators and they're using those to put on their lights and to do some cooking. But, you know, it is pitch black in the streets as you walk around Odessa, one of the biggest cities in Ukraine. And so that's just astonishing and it's of course causing enormoushardship for the people who live here. And that hardship, you can see it across the country. I mean, with Russia continuing to barrage infrastructure facilities across the country. We saw it in Kyiv region earlier today, around the capital with a number of people killed, I think it was three people that were killed in that attack as various installations were targeted. We saw it in Zaporizhzhia as well, in central Ukraine, with that horrific attack which hit a maternity clinic, and that newborn baby, a couple days old, killed outright. The mother of the child, the doctor as well in the clinic were pulled alive form the rubble, but that horrific incident, you know, by no means isolated, I don't think. Yes, there are so many people that have been killed, tens of thousands of people killed in this conflict. But it is yet another poignant reminder of just how brutal this war continues to be -- Jim.",
