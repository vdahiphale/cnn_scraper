This comes as a major Israeli operation in the Jenin refugee camp is now in its second day. Israeli forces say no non-combatants have been killed during their ongoing counterterrorism raid. CNN's Hadas Gold is tracking both stories for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A car ramming attack on the streets of Tel Aviv, the attacker shot by an armed civilian militant group Hamas taking credit for the attack, calling it a response to Israel's ongoing military raid in the occupied West Bank City of Jenin an operation already in its second day, the largest incursion into the West Bank since the days of the Second Intifada more than 20 years ago.

Peace should be based on international law on what has been agreed upon with Israel itself and Oslo 30 years ago, two states living side by each other. If they are ready for this kind of peace, peace will prevail otherwise, Israel the whole region will be at risk all the time. Israeli army's attacking all the Palestinian cities in Jerusalem, Hebron, Nablus and Jenin. But what happened yesterday was completely dangerous, because they killed 10 people and injured more than hundred persons all of them are refugees. None of them was carrying weapons, or none of them was going to Tel Aviv to do anything. So what is happening is completely dangerous for them, for the Israelis, for the Palestinians, for everybody in the region. These attacks should stop immediately. They should withdraw from the Palestinian areas immediately. Otherwise, the reaction will be horrible for us and for them. And we don't want to go to war again. This Israeli aggression, which is continuing for the last several months, should stop immediately.

Now everything is on hold with Israelis and maybe it will be the same with the American administration as well. If you remember when the Former President said Jerusalem is united, we boycotted the American Administration for three years. So they should understand very well, that without reaching peace with the Palestinians, not with other Arabs here or there, they are living with us peace with us, the peace which we agree upon, and the peace we are looking for, is agreed by the whole world community by the Security Council, peace for the Palestinians and Israelis if they abide the international law and the agreements signed between us and them.

And as I say, since then, we really haven't heard much from him. But I had 30 minutes with him more or less to talk about everything. And he told me that he was slowly adjusting to life after tennis that he didn't really miss his old life, because he knew that given the state his body was in, he could no longer really compete on the tour. He said instead, what he was relishing was being able to plan ahead for special moments with his family, with his friends. He took a really special trip to Lesotho in southern Africa just last month to show his children, his four children the charitable work that the Rafael Nadal Foundation has been working on for the past 20 years.

I really only have to look at his Instagram account to see that he has been at multiple sporting events. He has hosted the Met Gala and just on Sunday night he was out on stage alongside Coldplay performing alongside them. I think one of the sort of favorite things that he said to me though, the thing that really made me chuckle is he said that while he is adjusting to life away from the tennis court, some of his fans are having a hard time placing him away from that scene.

I mean, if he does, of course go on and win this fortnight, he will tie RogerFederer's record of eight Grand Slam titles at the All England Club. And that is something I also had a chance to speak to Roger about and he spoke very frankly about it. In fact, he gave me a very interesting answer, which you can watch tomorrow when we released that segment, just to hear what he has to say. We also spoke about the up and coming 20 year old Carlos Alcaraz you know, whether he thinks he's going to be the next Roger or Rafael. We talked about Rafael Nadal's retirement, of course, that might be on the cards for next year. But interestingly, I also had a chance to talk to him about what was next for him in tennis. You know, there's a lot of conversation going on that he might be commentating this week at Wimbledon. That is not the case. So where are we going to see him next? He gave his thoughts on that as well. And that will release tomorrow. So stay tuned.",
