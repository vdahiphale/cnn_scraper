There is new CNN reporting laying out how the fallout from President Biden's debate performance could actually force Donald Trump and his team to rethink their planned rollout of Trump's VP nominee and maybe even impacting who the pick will be.Three men appear to be the most likely candidates still -- Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance, Doug Burgum -- you see there. CNN's Steve Contorno has all of this new reporting for us and he's joining us now. So, Steve, all the focus on President Biden right now. How is it impacting Donald Trump?",

      "sentences": "Kate, Trump's campaign is entering a very critical stretch. As you mentioned, he has to name his running mate in the coming days. He has a convention that's starting in just one week. He has a planned rally in Doral on Tuesday; another one for Pennsylvania this weekend.And they had been planning these events under the assumption that they would be the focal point of this stretch. And instead, they are no longer operating under that assumption. The expectation is that they will continue to have to compete with Biden for the country's attention, and that is affecting how they are announcing this rollout. You know, even if they wanted to announce it this week, it would be quite difficult knowing that at any moment Biden could drop some news about his political future. There could be another twist in that ongoing saga that would steal attention from what is supposed to be one of a candidate's most important choices. And when it comes to the VP search itself, we are told that Donald Trump may not have even come to a decision yet. Several of his allies don't think he has made a choice. And if that's the case, the expectation there is that what's happened over the past couple of weeks most certainly is affecting the calculus for making a decision -- and how could it not? The political reality has changed drastically. They have been planning for someone who could go up against Vice President Harris in a debate. Well, what happens if she is suddenly the presidential nominee? And this has also re-brought into the spotlight the fact that whoever is the pick must be able to step into that job right away. Can all three of the people that you mentioned -- the frontrunners in this -- in this race do that? That's part of the calculus that they're going to have to consider going forward.",

Trying to target more small-dollar individuals so that you have a larger pool there. You're focusing on the battleground states, potentially lining up radio ads and television ads. Opening up more field offices. Hiring more state directors in some of those very crucial states where the differences in Georgia were 11,000; or Arizona, 10,000; Wisconsin, 22,000. So you're using this opportunity to further strengthen your operations. Now, the question becomes for the Trump campaign at what point do you announce your VP running mate? Do you run the risk of taking attention away from your opponent who is definitely struggling right now? And I think that's going to be a part of -- a problem to see.

I'm looking at Carson because you're looking at potentially a 15- to 16-point increase among Black men from 12 percent in 2020. I think that's mathematically possible.
