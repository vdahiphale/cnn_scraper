      "sentences": "Well, this is a hearing essentially exposing some really big skeletons in the closet of Boeing that have been under wraps for months.The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations just published, for the first time, the results of an FAA audit of Boeing, along with a company survey of workers at its plant in Renton, Washington. That is the same factory where a brand new 737 Max-9 was delivered without the critical door plug bolts installed, leading to that terrifying blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. The subcommittee says Boeing surveyed 2,100 workers on the 737 line and about half said that schedule pressure is still significant, essentially putting speed over quality, which is huge since it was a quality control failure that led to the door plug incident. One more big finding in the audit, workers said they felt inadequately trained by Boeing to do their jobs. Some said that Boeing was not providing them with the proper tools. The FAA audit found one worker was using a tool he made himself to check the gaps between certain parts of the airplane. The report says the tool is \"mechanic made, unauthorized, uncalibrated, unmarked.\" And when asked how other door mechanics take this measurement, the mechanic stated, \"They all do the same thing.\" And these findings were released as the subcommittee is about the grill FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker. I want you to listen now to Senator Richard Blumenthal, who just said the FAA has not stayed on top of Boeing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): The findings about actual practices show that Boeing continues to prioritize the speed of production and profits over safety and quality. And the Department of Justice has taken action, which reflect the potential criminality of those practices. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Actually, not come back until after the election. That the House took it six-week August recess, came back and figured it out they needed to pass something to keep the government open, decided to essentially kick the can down the road up until December 20th. This bill would keep the -- avoid a government shutdown by months end. But it does not have any of the spending cuts a lot of conservatives wanted, or this provision that Trump himself was demanding, demanding proof of people's citizenship before voting, trying to go after undocumented immigrants who could be participating in the elections. Of course, it's illegal for undocumented immigrants to vote in federal elections, but that's what Trump wanted this provision. They didn't have the votes. It was because of Republican and Democratic opposition. They had to drop that provision. Now, this measure that does not have anything that Republicans have wanted will now pass the House with Democratic support.

I asked him, are you denying everything in that \"New York Times\" report? He said, quote, \"I am.\" But just as you heard moments ago, he did indicate that they were hired to work in his office. And he just simply said that they did not violate any ethics violations. So it sounded like a different answer than yesterday.
