I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Putin targets Ukraine's power plants and energy system in one of Russia's biggest ever missile and drone attacks. Moscow is finally calling this a state of war as well. At least 10 regions were hit, leaving over 1 million households without electricity, and more than 1,000 miners were stranded underground during a blackout. Reports of blasts near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant act as a clear reminder of the stakes at play. E.U. leaders have agreed in principle to send Kyiv the profits on frozen Russian assets, that's around $3 billion this year, but $60 billion is still caught up in U.S. Congress. Meantime, NATO has sent its first official military delegation to Kyiv since Russia's invasion in 2022. Evelyn Farkas is a former U.S. Defense Department official and the head of the McCain Institute. She joins me now from Kyiv, which yesterday was hit by Russian missile strikes for the first time in six weeks. Evelyn Farkas, welcome to the program. I know you're there at the Kyiv Security Forum. The country continues to be attacked, at war here. What is the reaction on the ground there? What is the mood? EVELYN FARKAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MCLAIN INSTITUTE AND FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Yes, Bianna, I think people are feeling really frustrated and subdued, first of all, because this attack comes at a time when the Ukrainians are just counting the days until they can get the assistance, you mentioned, from the U.S. Congress. They're mostly focused on, of course, the military assistance because troops on the front have been sealing the impact of not having the ammunition. And then, of course, you know, here in Kyiv, they haven't been under attack. I was here in October with the McCain Institute delegation that I led, and, you know, there were no attacks. The Russians were basically hoarding their UAVs, their attack capability. But they are attacking now, probably in retaliation for Ukrainian attacks against their oil refineries.",

So, the injury to buildings and to people, and nobody died, was because of debris, because the air defense systems here worked. But you're right, the air defense systems across Ukraine, there aren't air defense systems that cover the entire country, which is why the electric grid was attacked, unfortunately, successfully here in Ukraine. And so, people are now having problems with electricity disruptions. Clearly, they're frustrated. Now, the Ukrainians are grateful because USAID, the United States government, has helped them fortify their electricity and other installations that protect civilian infrastructure. But there's only so much you can do. And really, what they need are these strong air defense systems, the Patriots, and they need to be able to retaliate against the Russians. You know, the Ukrainians likely know where these cruise missiles are coming from, and they could actually address the problem at the source if we gave them longer range munitions.",

Obviously, it's hometo the largest nuclear power facility in all of Europe, and there's a lot of concern about potential damage there. To my earlier point, with the U.S. now telling Ukraine that they don't think that it's effective, and they're urging Ukrainians to halt their attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, there's reports that that's largely because they don't want to see a spike in energy prices and oil prices, perhaps leading up to the U.S. election.

It is disconcerting because we know that the U.S. government has issued kind of warnings or directives likethis to the Ukrainian government with a fear of escalation or -- and perhaps in this case, a fear of something happening to the oil prices. Although, I will say, that when we raised this with experts, they said, well, it's not clear that oil prices would rise necessarily because of attacks on these refineries. You have to look at which refineries. Are they for domestic production? But the export probably will be impacted. I would say to this, we know that the U.S. government -- well, it's reported that the U.S. government wasn't very happy when the Ukrainians started clearing the Black Sea Corridor. So, using their weaponry to essentially take out Russian naval ships. And they did this with great effect. Initially, there is reporting that the U.S. government wasn't happy about that. But the Ukrainians proceeded, and it's been a spectacular success. They are now looking at billions of dollars every year coming in through that corridor because they're trading grain, iron, ore, steel like normal, like during peacetime. So, it's possible that the United States government may be unhappy or uncomfortable, but the Ukrainians essentially can continue, because this is a way to impact the money flow to the Russian government, undoubtedly.",

Security Council once again, who failed to pass a U.S. resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. It was a major tonal shift for the White House after months of vetoing other resolutions, suggesting a departure from previous policy towards Israel. This, while U.S. military aid to Ukraine continues to hang in the balance in Congress as a prospect of another Trump presidency, casts a shadow over Ukraine's future on the battlefield as we've just been discussing.

If Congress does act, they have the wherewithal to get through this year to try and make as many gains as they can on the battlefield, and very importantly, to avoid problems on the battlefield, prevent Russia from making gains on the battlefield. Then there's at least some hope that when the parties decide that negotiations are appropriate, that there'll be a decent outcome.

It's hard to imagine Russia giving up territory thatit has gained, and it's hard to imagine the Ukrainians accepting that as a long-term proposition. I think one idea that has been put out there is something not unlike what happened in the Korean peninsula at the end of the Korean War, where there was a truce but not a final peace settlement, and there was a series of compromises and security guarantees that allowed both sides to find it acceptable. The Ukrainians will not be happy about that. Giving up both the Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, even in the short run, is not something that will be prepared to do. But I think what will be determining this is how much progress there is on the ground and how much the Russians feel the need to make a compromise. I think one thing that could change the dynamic, Walter, is that if -- I think President Putin believes that time is on his side, both because Russia has dug into very strong defensive positions in Eastern Ukraine, and because, frankly, he's waiting to see what the outcome of the U.S. election is and whether the support will be there from Congress in the meantime. I think one thing that could change that is if President Putin felt he was losing some control over Crimea, which is of course extremely important to him and to Russia and his image of Russia. And if the wherewithal that we provide Ukraine gives them the capability of shaking some of that security around Crimea, then that could potentially bring the support to the table earlier.",

I think what we've seen is that the trucksthat have come to the border, to the Rafah Crossing, have been turned away sometimes for having reports of surgical scissors or other things that were deemed to be potentially dangerous. Part of this operation, part of the near-term focus, needs to be working with Egypt to ensure that whatever comes into Gaza at this point is not strengthening Hamas, not giving Hamas tools and weapons to be used against the Israelis, not allowing them to replenish their strength. And there needs to be a process for doing that, but doing it efficiently so we can get humanitarian aid back into Gaza. But there needs to be a real plan, Walter. And I think one of the things that Israel has been criticized for is as they've gone into Gaza, and certainly as they prepare to go into Rafah specifically, that there hasn't been enough attention for how to ensure that the Palestinians there will be cared for as they have to displace themselves again to get out of harm's way.

Israel isnot going to live with a Gaza that is a source of insecurity for it going forward. There's no interest in allowing or encouraging the Palestinians in Gaza to move elsewhere. So, there's going to be an enormous rebuilding effort that needs to happen, a security effort that needs to happen. And then, you know, making Gaza a livable, sustainable place over time. That's going to require the involvement of not just the United States and Israel, but of Saudi Arabia, other Arab nations, Egypt, who can play a role in helping to secure Gaza and ensure that it's got the investment necessary to survive. The other big issue, Walter, is who's going to rule Gaza? What are the -- what's the political situation in Gaza? And the Palestinian Authority has very little credibility among Palestinians. Hamas will not be permitted to govern Gaza by Israel. And there's not been the kind of investment, particularly by the surrounding Arab nations over the years, in supporting and cultivating a strong Palestinian administrative state to be able to take control both of Gaza and the West Bank. And so, that is the next step. I think that it may take years for that to happen, but there's no time like the present to begin to invest in that.",

It's lifted hundreds of millions if not billions out of abject poverty. It's allowed really all the human development indicators to be improved, it has brought nations closer together in a number of respects. I think what was clear though is that the benefits of that integration have not been broadly and equally shared. And so that, between nations and within nations, there were winners and losers. And the impact on those who were left behind were not fully addressed. Just take the United States as an example. I think this -- by the way, it cuts across both Democratic and Republican administrations. We never paired our focus on integrating the global economy with sufficient domestic policy to take care of those who would be adversely affected in the short or the medium-term. And we saw the impact of this on communities as factories close, as manufacturing shrunk. And as there were no -- there wasn't sufficient social safety net and programs to help people really develop and transition to new industries and those new industries to be invested in their communities to take up the slack. And that, I think, has led to populism and protectionism, some nativism and nationalism as well.

The ratio, we're told, between the Russians and the Ukrainians in terms of firepower is 10 to 1. Another analysis says 7 to 1, meaning -- and that usually focuses on the artillery. But it doesn't matter. It means they have to hold their ammunition and they're being shot at and hold their artillery before they can react. And it's obviously very dangerous for them. So, they are waiting. They don't care what shape it comes in. And they're quite concerned that it might drag out. You know, we don't know exactly when it'll happen. And those of us Americans here meeting with the Ukrainians and at the conference -- there was a panel on the United States -- we have not been able to give them any firm assurances. My hope is that it will be done before the next congressional recess, because I have some experience working in Congress and I know how they tend to operate and that there is a tendency to put hard votes right before a recess, take the vote, and leave town.

But it hasn't come without controversy. \"Until August\" was written when the Nobel laureate had dementia and in his final years of life. Just before his death, he asked his sons to destroy the manuscript, believing it unworthy of his body of work. Well, instead, they saw the beauty in it and defying his wishes, have shared it with the world. One of those sons, Rodrigo Garcia, joins me from Mexico City. Rodrigo, thank you for joining us. It's really good to see you again. So, this book was first published on March 6th in Spanish and then released about a week later in English. Just walk us through the process of you and your brother choosing to defy your father's wishes and say, no, this is a book that's worthy for the world to see written by your beloved father.",

And Shakespeare is very, very interested in people who have power and he wants to tell you what they're really like and what a dangerous thing it is to have too much power. And King Lear is such a man. He's a very foolish man. He says it of himself. He does make some silly mistakes. He's not a cruel man. I mean, he hasn't killed people as far as we can see. But he doesn't know how to deal with his daughters, his son. We don't hear about Mrs. Lear. But, you know, people come and see, listen, and say you're exactly like my granddad when he was dying. He went a bit dotty too. Or someone came along in America and said, well, it's all about Trump, isn't it? I don't get that at all. But an audience brings to it their own life and they measure their own experience, a family experience, or politics, whatever it happens to be, whatever their interest is, and match it against the experience of the characters that they're seeing act out their story. That's the way in which you're engaged. And Shakespeare remains a persistently modern, contemporary, and that was his genius. That he knew more about us than any other person who ever lived.
