It is 04:00 p.m. in Beirut. It's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for my colleague, Becky Anderson. Also coming up this hour, the United Nations warns Israel may be destroying the Palestinian population in Northern Gaza through death and displacement. Plus, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin makes an unannounced visit to Kyiv. And with just over two weeks to go until the U.S. election, Elon Musk is offering a million dollars each day to registered voters in battleground states, but is it legal? All right, welcome to the show. And let's check in on the stock markets in New York. It will open in around 30 minutes from now, and as you can see, the DOW futures all pointing to a negative start, S&amp;P 500 also in the negative, so too is the NASDAQ. Keep in mind, this is after six weeks of gains, and in fact, the S&amp;P and the DOW hit record highs on Friday. We'll check in on those numbers in about 30 minutes. Now, Israel is expanding its war against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. All right, launched a series of strikes on a financial association linked to Hezbollah. Until now, Israel had been focusing on military targets. The country's foreign minister vowing to hit Hezbollah until it collapses. Meantime, the U.N. warns Israel may be destroying the Palestinian population in Northern Gaza, where its renewed operation against Hamas is now in its third week. CNN's Matthew Chance has the latest from the ground, and we must warn you that some of the images in this report may be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israeli forces patrolling the labyrinth of narrow streets in the Central Gaza Strip. These the latest images from the Israeli military. What they say is their continued activity amid the devastation to dismantle Hamas. To the south in Rafah, where the Hamas Leader was recently killed, drone footage of strikes and what Israel says are more Hamas fighters and infrastructure. While across Gaza, civilians are paying a heavy price. At this hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip an influx of casualties from a new Israeli strike at Beit Lahiya, where Palestinian health officials say dozens of people, including women and children, were killed. Among the shrouded bodies of her family, this woman calls her father to grieve their loss. I swear, dad, nobody is left, she sobs. Israel says the casualty figures are exaggerated, and that they operate against Hamas in a precise and targeted manner. But eye witnesses at the scene say the Israeli air strikes felt like an earthquake. It was just Wednesday when an Israeli drone captured the final moments of the Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar's life. His killing, fueling hopes of a hostage release, even a cease fire in Gaza and beyond. In fact, the region seems to be plunging further into chaos, with Israel stepping up strikes. Pressing deeper into neighboring Lebanon, hitting what it says are strongholds of Iranian backed Hezbollah like here the town of Nabatieh in Southern Lebanon. Back in Israel, Hezbollah rockets have been striking the country's north. One drone even hitting near the Israeli Prime Minister's private house in the coastal town of Caesarea. He called it an assassination attempt by agents of Iran, vowing to press ahead with military action. Iran denies involvement, and Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility.",

And that includes also the moment when they first realized that Thomas Crooks had a gun that's before shots were fired. One officer describes popping his head up onto that roof and shouting, an AR! an AR! He has an AR-15, referring to that automatic rifle. And yet it's shocking, because this report concludes that no evidence has been found by this bipartisan task force that that message ever reached Trump's detail before the shots were fired. I mean, speaks to the broader communication breakdown right that occurred at this rally. And what Secret Service has been tasked with trying to fix at a time when we are in the peak election part of the election cycle, it's really raising questions about the Secret Service is ability to continue to protect not only Donald Trump, but also Kamala Harris, as they are on the campaign throughout these large events, large outdoor events, in a lot of cases, that present similar challenges to what Donald Trump's rally and Butler did. But it's also increasing pressure on Secret Service. There was an independent panel convened by the Department of Homeland Security that recommended a complete overhaul of the Secret Service leadership in the wake of their investigation into the security failures at Trump's Butler rally, that's more of a long-term recommendation. But here in the next two weeks, as Election Day approaches, Secret Service is under immense pressure to ramp up security, and has ramped up security around Donald Trump. Ultimately, though, these failures, like the ones detailed in this report, still raise lingering questions about their ability to appropriately protect Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.",

Thepackage will include more ammunition, as well as rockets. His announcement visit now comes with barely two weeks to go before Americans go to the polls. And the future of U.S. Aid to Ukraine is widely thought to be hanging on their choice. Last month, Donald Trump declining to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.

It's the third package in the last month, andof a similar size, and all of those were bigger than we seen in the months prior to that, the Biden Administration seems to be, in the words of one State Department official. Emptying out all the congressionally approved funding for Ukraine in an effort to secure a sort of long-term package of aid ahead of the election, not only funding, but also drawdowns from the Pentagon's own stocks, which is what we see here, will include ammunition 155 millimeter, which has been the lifeblood of this war, anti-tank weapons, armored vehicles, the things, the kinds of things that Ukraine desperately needs on the front lines. But I think this visit is about much more than a single aid package. This is very likely the last time a senior U.S. official will be in Ukraine ahead of the U.S. election. An election that really is existential for Ukraine, given the concern around the rhetoric that they've heard from Former President Trump, not willing to say that he wants Ukraine to win, calling Zelenskyy repeatedly the best salesman on earth. All of that extremely concerning to Ukraine. So, I think they will be looking for sort of long-term reassurances, an idea of the level of bipartisan support in Congress and will continue to lobby for more aid. Air defenses will be very high on the agenda. It's now more newsworthy in Ukraine when Russia does not fire a barrage of drones overnight than when it does. And we saw 116 attack drones fired Ukraine overnight into this morning as Lloyd Austin was on his way in. That of course, in addition to the question of whether the U.S. and several of Ukraine's other allies will relax restrictions on using western long-range missiles on Russian soil. So, there is a lot up for debate. And then, of course, you get on to the issue of whether NATO might be willing to extend an invitation. So far, we're not seeing any sign of that, but it is a key tenet of Ukraine's victory plan, Eleni.",

Parts of Northern Italy are worst impacted, with many people trapped in their homes and others missing in Bologna. More than 2000 people have been evacuated, and 15 rivers have exceeded their maximum threshold. In Havana, people banned pots and pans in the dark early Monday, protesting the Cuban government's failure to restore power.

What I am saying is that some respected scholars who study election law for a living saw what he did and immediately raised legal objections. So, you just played that clip of Musk saying that the prize will be given to people who sign his petition which affirms their support for the First and Second Amendment, the right to free speech and the right to bear arms. But honestly, that's not all you need to do to possibly win the money. If you look at the fine print on Musk's super PAC website, it says that you must be a registered voter in order to sign the petition, and you can only win that million dollars if you live in one of the critical battle ground states. That's the problem. And the experts that we spoke to said that U.S. Federal Law makes it a crime to pay people to register. You can't give them money or a chance to win money through a lottery in exchange for their registration. I'll read for you what U.S. Federal Law says, quote, whoever knowingly or willfully pays or offers to pay, or accepts payment, either for registration to vote, or to vote, could face up to five years in prison. That's the law, Eleni, and the legal experts say that Musk could be crossing that line, especially for anybody who hears about the cash prize and then registered. We reached out for comments to Elon Musk super PAC, they did not respond. Like I said, this does not mean that Musk is getting indicted if the Justice Department has a problem with what he's doing, the logical next step would probably be something like a cease-and-desist letter. But as you mentioned, there's at least one prominent former prosecutor who is calling this out, and that's Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. He's a Democrat. He was the state attorney general before becoming the governor, and he blasted Musk yesterday on \"Meet the Press\". Listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): I think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians.

And at theend of the day, nearly 10 percent of the active generals of the Turkish Armed Forces, a NATO member country, were put in jail. KARADSHEH (voice-over): In 2013, prosecutors launched a corruption probe targeting Erdogan's inner circle.
