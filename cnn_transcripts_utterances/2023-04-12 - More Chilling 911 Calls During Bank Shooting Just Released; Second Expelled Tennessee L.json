Michael Cohen clearly is one of the key witness is there. A lot of it is about checks that Donald Trump wrote to Michael Cohen, things that prosecutors say our legal behavior. And what Trump is doing in this suit is he's trying to claim that that sort of behavior that prosecutors are trying to prosecute him about should be kept secret or should have been kept secret because there were contracts he had with Michael Cohen, essentially. Two things he's trying to say about Cohen's work for him that Cohen was his attorney, and so things should have been kept confidential, attorney/client privilege, that should have been observed by Michael Cohen, and also he's trying to enforce contracts they would have had, as Michael Cohen would have been an employee of the Trump Organization at that time.Now, whether the suit goes anywhere in court is a really big question. We know that Michael Cohen has tried to recoup legal fees in the past from Donald Trump for his work during this time having to testify about it as a witness. Trump is filing it in federal court in Florida, one of his favorite venues right now, he's asking for a lot of money. But we know that even on the attorney/client part of this, where he's saying Michael Cohen shouldn't have divulged this sort of behavior, we know that this has been through court before, and Michael Cohen actually wasn't behaving as an attorney on very many things. And we know that the federal courts have found that. So, it's a case we're going to have to watch to see if it goes anywhere at all.",

They really can't say, and that's largely because they don't want to open themselves up as being criticized as being critical of Trump. And that's going to be -- make it very difficult for them to really establish themselves to voters in the minds of voters in this critical period.One other thing that I think Senator Scott has to kind of cope with is that unlike some of the other people who have announced or are on the verge of announcing, he is not an executive of a state, not a former executive. He doesn't have foreign policy experience, so there's some resume issues here that I think he may have to grapple with later in this process.",

You do -- you have had black handed to be taken seriously, if briefly from Ben Carson, Herman Cain in primaries past. There's these moments where they're sort of like a rush to the black candidate, and they sort of fade.If that happens with Tim Scott, he might be able to hold on to more support. I think, you know, his record in terms of getting support for Black colleges, for getting support for opportunity zones, for getting support for criminal justice, I think makes him unusual in terms of his ability to appeal to Democrats, possibly. But first, he's got to get through this primary. And I think -- you know, I remember when you had Nikki Haley on stage with Marco Rubio and Tim Scott. And you know, 5, 6 years ago and I was looking at that would be a very, very tough Republican Party for Democrats. If you had, you know, if that's the face of the Republican Party. Right now, Trump is in the way. It's hard to imagine anybody getting him out of the way. But the Nikki Haleys and the Tim Scotts and even the Marco Rubios, they could -- if they ever broke through, post some challenge to Democrats.",
