That has to do with this judge also overseeing the case of Allen Weisselberg who worked for Trump at the Trump Organization just to give context to that.But I was really struck by how yesterday the judge's warning was not just to Trump about the attacks that he had been making; he was also telling counsel on both sides -- you know, also talking about witnesses who have been very vocal, i.e. Michael Cohen. But what do you make of Trump getting on stage right after -- going after the judge the way he did? BROWNSTEIN:  Yes. Well look, I mean, it's hard to keep Trump within the bounds of any kind of norms that we saw throughout his presidency, whether they're political norms, legal norms, or in this case, norms of the courtroom. Look, he's flirting with danger. He is behaving in a way that is both possible to draw the ire of the judge but also to reinforce many of the doubts about him among Independent and swing voters. I mean, that, Kaitlan, is the kind of conundrum Republicans are in as this proceeds. I mean, there's no question that this indictment and the prospect of further indictments is strengthening inside the Republican primary. But simultaneously it may be weakening him as a general election candidate if he wins that nomination. It's kind of the worst of all worlds for the Republicans who want the party to move on beyond Trump. They are watching a kind of a rally around the flag effect, but they are also seeing both in these underlying charges and in his response to them the exact kind of behavior that has made it so hard for the party among swing voters -- even many of those attracted to his policies. By the way, what you saw again last night in Wisconsin with the devastating reform court performance for Republicans in those key suburban areas that have already been trending away for the party under Trump.",

Is he the leader of a kind of legitimate political movement or is he a closet authoritarian figure who is a genuine threat to American democracy? I mean, those cases are more at the heart of the core issue really that surrounds Trump than this. And if any of those other indictments materialize between now and November, I think this case will obviously be remembered as the answer to kind of a trivia contest -- you know, what was the first criminal indictment brought against a sitting president?

But over my right shoulder with that black rooftop -- that's actually the al-Aqsa Mosque and that's where these events took place.As you were noting, we saw dramatic video of Israeli police essentially raiding the mosque. They say that they had to go in there because youths were barricading themselves in there and that they threw firecrackers at them. I want to read you part of the Israeli police statement. They say, \"Several law-breaking youths and masked agitators brought into the mosque fireworks, sticks, and stones. When the police entered, stones were thrown at them, and fireworks were fired from inside the mosque by a large group of agitators.\" Now, police say they detained 350 people. That's a massive amount of people. The Palestinian Red Crescent says 12 were injured, three of them transferred to the hospital. Police say at least one of their officers were injured as well. Now, condemnations have been raining in because while it has been a tense time, as you have noted, clashes were somewhat expected. I think the aggressive nature of what we saw overnight -- that was a bit unexpected. We're hearing condemnations from the Jordanians, from Saudi Arabia, from the Egyptians, all condemning this because just Israeli police entering the mosque is considered as very provocative and offensive. But then to see them engage in the way that they did, making arrests -- arresting people on the floor of the mosque -- that raises it to a new level. Now, the Palestinian authorities also condemning what happened. I'll read to you from the prime minister saying, \"What is happening in Jerusalem is a major crime against worshippers. Israel does not want to learn from history, that al-Aqsa is for the Palestinians and for all Arabs and Muslims, and that storming it sparked a revolution against the occupation.\" Now, overnight, after this took place, it seems as though Hamas -- the militant group that runs Gaza -- responded with nine rockets fired toward Israel. No injuries caused. The Israeli military responding with airstrikes against what it says were Hamas targets.
