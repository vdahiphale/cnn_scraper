      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Dana. Last spring, a trial was held and that jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll and defamed her, and awarded her $5 million. Now, Carroll testified at that trial as well but Trump did not attend a single minute of that trial. So, this is the first time that she is testifying with him just a few feet away, and testifying in front of someone in this manner in a case like this is a daunting task for any survivor of sexual abuse.But in her testimony today, Dana, she came out swinging. She started by saying, so previously, I was known simply as a journalist and now I'm known as a liar. So, she's talking about the impact that her statements have had on her career. He has continued to lie. He lied last month, he lied on Sunday, he lied yesterday. And I'm here to get my reputation back and to stop him from telling lies about me. Now, our colleagues in the courtroom -- there are no cameras in this courthouse, but our colleagues reported that Trump is both physically and verbally responding to much of her testimony. The judge even asked him to take care, that anything that he's saying to his lawyers in response to the testimony, that it can be heard by the jury. And even just a few minutes ago, our colleagues reported that he continues to respond in one way or another to almost everything that she is saying. Now, she went on and talked about the impact that Trump's denials had on her life and the deluge of threats that she faced. She said, \"I was attacked on Twitter; I was attacked on Facebook; I was attacked in news blogs; I was attacked in messages. As I said, it was a new world. I had left the world of facts, a lovely world, and was living in a new universe.\" And just about a moment ago, she talked about the precautions she then started taking, including sleeping with a gun near her. Now, this case like you said is about damages. She's asking for up to $10 million for the impact that his statements had on her and her career. Now, Trump's lawyer Alina Habba will have the opportunity to cross-examine her. Alina Habba argued yesterday that in fact Carroll's career prospered and benefited from her allegations against Trump. Dana, it is a delicate task to cross-examine someone in a case like this that deals with sexual abuse. Habba has been reprimanded a few times by the judge in this case for her decorum in the courtroom. So, we'll be watching to see how she handles this and whether scoring a few political points by attacking Carroll is worth what that might do in terms of the jury and the ultimate damages.",

Look, Roger Stone is saying that's not him, his voice is not on that recording and he says that it is actually an AI manipulated piece of audio. So, he has really making clear (ph) that no, he doesn't believe that that is him on the audio recording. But, we've heard similar things from Stone before. He has accused documentary filmmakers of fabricating footage in the past, footage that has come under scrutiny from House investigators and federal authorities in that sense. It's important to remember too how far back Donald Trump and Roger Stone go. He was obviously indicted as a result of the Mueller investigation, ultimately pardoned by Donald Trump in late 2020 before he left office. He was instrumental in promoting the Stop The Steal\" movement that was really the underlying source of frustration and something that stoked the fire in the lead-up to January 6th and got the attention of the House January 6th Committee. This clip, I want to play for you right now, is similar in tone of Roger Stone talking about using violence against his political opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You can see there are some softness in terms of his support, you see those folks are saying that they are ultimately going to vote for Biden, maybe they voted for Haley in the contest. But yeah, I mean he is a wounded candidate I think in so many ways. And I think if you are Biden, you can look at what Chris Christie said, those comments, that is an ad in and of itself, the idea that this is a battle for the soul of America, something that Joe Biden said back in 2029.
