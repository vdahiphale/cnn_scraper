In just a few moments, I'm going to speak with the reporter who just talked with the former president. But first, here is what we know at this hour. President Biden using the backdrop of the Oval Office to deliver a prime time speech, calling for unity and calling on all Americans to abandon the escalating rhetoric that nearly ended with Donald Trump's assassination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: We debate and disagree, we compare and contrast the character of the candidates, the records, the issues, the agenda, the vision for America. But in America, we resolve our differences at the ballot box. That's how we do it, at the ballot box not with bullets. The power to change America should always rest in the hands of the people, not in the hands of would-be assassin. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In a campaign season that has been marked by twists and turns, this is the darkest one yet.Not for the first time, we have descended toward violence and it could have ended with one of the two major party presumptive nominees dead. The investigation is all very much ongoing. Audio analysis has confirmed that the suspect, the gunman, was perched about 130 yards from the podium where Trump was speaking in Butler. The other ongoing effort tonight is to assess just how the Secret Service failed to, so dramatically in this moment, to stop this threat. The President already says he's directed an independent review of what went wrong on Saturday's rally. But we're going to get to the latest on that investigation in just a few moments. But first, just in to CNN tonight, we are learning that the former president has now given his very first interview since surviving this attempt on his life to Salena Zito of the Washington Examiner. She just spoke with Trump and she was at this event just feet away. Salena, thank you very much for joining us. We're really glad and grateful that you're OK. Tell us about this interview.

This is a rust belt area. This is a blue collar, white -- working class mostly crowd, and he wanted to project to the -- he thought it was important to project to the country in that moment, that everything was OK. That he was OK and the country was OK. And I thought that was really fascinating. And he was in a very good mood. He was -- he sounded incredibly upbeat. These moments have a way of changing people.

I mean, I can't speak for what's inside his head, but based on conversations that I've had with him, I think that he believes that that's very important.

They are investigating this as potential domestic terrorism.But as they go through and they are trying to access the shooter's cell phone, because they really believe that that is going to be pretty critical, and understandably so into understanding the shooters mindset. So right now they have the device, they're working to try to get into it. But as far as a motive that captures the totality of why this person did this, that is still unclear. What the FBI is saying is that, at this moment, they are working to determine the sequence of events and the shooter's movements prior to this incident. And they have again obtained the cell phone, they have searched the residence, they have searched his vehicle. Upon those searches, they found that there were suspicious devices. We have previously reported that there was explosive material found at the shooter's home as well as in his vehicle. Those devices are now being analyzed at the FBI lab at Quantico. But all of this comes, Abby, as there are very serious questions for the Secret Service about how this happened. And what we know is that the building where the shooter was able to get his shot was outside the security perimeter. It was around 150 yards from the former president's podium. And several law enforcement sources I have spoken with have expressed a real concern that a building that close was outside the hard perimeter. So the question here, Abby, becomes was a member of law enforcement supposed to be stationed at that building or did the Secret Service determine through a site assessment that that building didn't pose a risk? Either way, this was a major failure. And there are serious questions for the Secret Service. We have not seen anybody go on camera to take those questions from the press so that we haven't gone back and forth with spokespeople from that agency, and we've gotten a little bit out of them. There are still major questions that they need to answer for, Abby.",

That's less than 500 feet away from the former president.Also according to the sheriff of Butler County, Michael Slupe, law enforcement officers saw him on the roof shortly before the shooting. One law enforcement officer hoisted himself up to the ledge of the rooftop, saw the gunman. The gunman saw him, according to the sheriff, pointed his weapon at the officer. And at that point, the officer had to a drop down here for his own safety. The shooter then started opening fire on those positions. Also we're told from a witness, according to witness Ben Macer, who talk to CNN affiliate KDKA, the shooter was seen moving -- he saw the shooter moving from roof to roof, to roof. It had to have been these roofs right here, these buildings all attached. So one witness seeing him moving from roof to roof, to roof before we finally took a position right about there. Abby?",

Local law enforcement is trained to seek cover during gunfire. Secret Services agents are trained that they are the cover, which is why you saw the agents respond immediately to the stage and shield the former president's bodies with their own, behind the steel on the stage.I believe that that officer's actions spurred the shooter potentially to move more quickly than he wished, which put him into the view of the counter snipers. And when he was identified as a threat by that technician, he was neutralized. There are questions as to why the Secret Service did not move the former president off the stage more quickly. And I would simply say that what you saw was a peaceful, even joyous event. I've been in them. They're chaotic, they're loud. People are enjoying themselves. And it went to an active shooter situation, within milliseconds, within a second the gun was fired. But those agents have to assess the situation and they have to decide whether it is safe to evacuate the president into that environment. One shooter is down but you don't want to be flushed from one dangerous situation into another. So further assessments were done, I've seen a transcript of the radio operations, and it appeared that it was a textbook response and brilliant work by those men and women of the Secret Service on the ground yesterday.",

They don't love the options in front of them. But they're going to have to make a choice in November. They're paying attention and they want to see can Donald Trump be someone who I can credibly see back in the White House, who will bring some form of stability to my life. In 2016, Donald Trump was elected because people wanted a wrecking ball. And then they got some taste of it and they said, maybe there was a little too much wrecking ball. And he ran against Joe Biden, who ran on a campaign of I'm going to be a unifier, you're not going to have to worry about me as president. The trouble Biden is running into is that as president, people do not feel like things have stabilized. They do not feel like we have unified.
