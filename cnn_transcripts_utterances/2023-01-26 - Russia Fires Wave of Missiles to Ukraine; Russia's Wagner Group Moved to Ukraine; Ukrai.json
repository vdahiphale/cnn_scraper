And hear from one of the greatest winter athletes in history, American skier, Mikaela Shiffrin, after her record-setting World Cup win. And we began this hour in Ukraine where the president's chief of staff says the country's air defense system has been activated and Russian missiles shot down. At least two rockets were reported in the Mykolaiv region. This news after we learned of the emergency power outages in Kyiv and several regions because of a threat of a missile attack. Meantime, we are seeing united front from the Ukraine's western allies as the United States and Germany announced plans to send dozens of sophisticated tanks to the battlefield. The U.S. will be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine with President Joe Biden saying the move will help enhance Kyiv's ability to defend its territory and counter Russia's evolving tactics. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says his country will be sending 14 Leopard 2 tanks with training expected to begin quickly. He said western allies will continue to support Ukraine but warned against escalating the war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translation):  In everything we do, we must always make it very clear that we are doing what is necessary and what is possible to support Ukraine. But at the same time, we are preventing the war from escalating into a war between Russia and NATO, and we will always continue to observe this principle. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

About a year ago, when this conflict started, it was unthinkable that the west would provide tanks to Ukraine. And that's because there was a very fine balancing act that was being played in capitals across the west.How do we support Ukraine, provide it with the weaponry, and then materials it needs to fight Russian forces? But at the same time, not aggravate Moscow so much that it widens and deepens this conflict. And that balancing act, that calculation, Rosemary, it's changing. And it's because Moscow is a weaker than ever. Remember, they lost tens of thousands on the battlefield. They are very far from accomplishing any of President Putin's goals. And this has emboldened the United States and its partners. Take a listen to what John Kirby, a senior U.S. official said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATOR: There is no reason for an overreaction by Moscow here. These tanks pose no offensive threat to Russian homeland. They do, however, pose a significant threat, not just the Abrams, but the Leopards, to Russian forces that are inside Ukraine illegally and committing atrocities. So, if Mr. Putin was worried about tanks, the best thing that he could do would be to take his troops and move them out of Ukraine and stop this war. (END VIDEO CLIP) ABDELAZIZ:  You hear there Mr. Kirby simply dismissing those threats. Again, something that kind of was unthinkable a year ago when Russia was threatening the use of nuclear weapons if the west escalated its support for Ukraine. So, a major, major shift as I said here. And one that really shows and sends a message to the Kremlin, that western allies will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to help Ukraine win this fight.",

PLEITGHEN (voice-over):  And the Ukrainians continue probing in other areas far from Bakhmut, the military releasing this video of a daring raid across the Dnipro River in south Ukraine, taking out a Russian command facility there. But to go on the offensive, Ukraine needs hundreds of main battle tanks, so far western partners have pledged about 100. Moscow has vowed to hit those tanks when they enter Ukraine and is conducting a show of force of its own, sending the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, Moscow says carries hypersonic missiles to ocean drills with the Chinese and South African navies. But for now, Bakhmut is the epicenter of this conflict, and Ukrainian soldiers here say they will fight for every inch. UNKNOWN (through translation):  One day there are artillery works and the next day the infantry assaults. It's a difficult time now, but our boys keep standing their ground. PLEITGHEN (on camera):  Ukrainian soldiers fighting on the front lines in and around Bakhmut who are contacted by CNN say they are absolutely elated to hear that western made battle tanks could be coming to Ukraine in the not-too-distant future. They say tanks are a huge part of the equation here and have been helping the front line troops a lot. Of course, they understand it's going to be awhile before any western made battle tanks get here, but right now the Ukrainians say they need all the help they can get as the Russians are making a big push to try and go towards the west and take Bakhmut.
