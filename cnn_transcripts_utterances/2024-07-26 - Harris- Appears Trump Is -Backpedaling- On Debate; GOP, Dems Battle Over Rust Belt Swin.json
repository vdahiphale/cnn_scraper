They tried to leave the door open that Vice President Harris wouldn't be the nominee. Of course, that aged well and that is exactly what happened.It has much less steam now that it's pretty clear that she has the delegates. She has the support. She has major endorsements from pretty much every party leader and she's doing to pretty easily slide into that spot. So I think, really, the question is how are they going to pivot? They have built their career -- or they have built this campaign off of defeating Joe Biden who was very unpopular. Who was -- obviously, had many concerns about his age. Harris is almost the opposite of that. And so they're really trying to come up with new attack lines. They're trying to attack here on the border, calling her a weak prosecutor.

No. But to Akayla's point -- I mean, it's like they're falling into their own trap when we know that this is not going to be the most effective thing as we lead to -- as you're trying to really court those center and moderate voters heading into the election.
