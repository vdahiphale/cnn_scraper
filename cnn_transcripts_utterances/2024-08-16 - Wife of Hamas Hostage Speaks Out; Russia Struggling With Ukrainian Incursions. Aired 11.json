Ukraine claims to control nearly 400 square miles of Russian territory following last week's surprise cross-border assault into Russia. And perhaps the most surprising part of this is just how easily Ukrainian forces were able to cross into enemy territory, specifically Russia. Here's what our Nick Paton Walsh witnessed at a border crossing. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

To show the Russian people that it would not be cost-free for Russia to be attacking Ukraine, for certain. But this is territory that I think everybody agrees he probably can't hold over the long term. Eventually, the Russians will gather the force to go deal with them on their own -- on Russian territory. So if he can hold it for now and force a real negotiation, then he's got a bargaining chip to be able to say, no, you're not going to hold 18 percent of Ukraine, you're going to pull back, and Ukraine would pull back. I'm not sure, though, that Putin would be in a mood to enter that negotiation.",

They called it actually a bridging proposal. We know that they havemade a few suggestions to the Israelis about areas where they may give ground. Presumably, they did the same with Hamas. The statement says that the meeting next week is to come to a final conclusion. Well, that puts everybody out on a limb a little bit, because we have had many moments where we thought we were going to get a hostage and cease-fire deal, and it didn't happen.
