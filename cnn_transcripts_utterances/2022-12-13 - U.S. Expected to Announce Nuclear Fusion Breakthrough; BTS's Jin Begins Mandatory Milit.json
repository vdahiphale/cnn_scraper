FTX filed for bankruptcy over a month ago and many are surprised at the speed the U.S. authorities have brought charges against him, who likely faces extradition back to the U.S. He was living in the island nation which had become the base of operations for the company he founded.

That's how we get nuclear waste, and we split atoms.Fusion is combining the two atoms together, which we have the ability to do right now. But the reaction has never created more energy than what was needed to cause the reaction in the first place. I think this is right. So is that the breakthrough that we're talking about here now? Is that the big picture?",

It's the most energetic lasers in the world.And they all basically correspond and inject energy at the exact same time, armed at the target. And there are many different types of fusion technologies that could induce fusion. Like talk about reactors, and spherical, and many others. But this is called an initial confinement, which is the laser version. And what's exciting is that, after we've been trying to have controlled fusion in which we get energy out than we put in, that's been the big physics challenge. And we have -- you know, humanity has finally achieved the ability to have contained fusion and produce more energy than we put in to -- to induce the fusion reaction.",

There's Dr. Peter Gleick, who's a cofounder of the research group the Pacific Institute, who tweeted, \"The latest breathless news about fusion misses the point that the single shot that took weeks to prepare would have to be repeated 100,000 to a million times faster, 1,000 to 10,000 times higher laser efficiency, a cost a millionth cheaper.\"But apart from that, he's a pretty big fan of it all.

I think people are very right to say that there are still many, many steps to get from here to there to make it commercial power. There's several steps associated with that. But -- but the reality is this inertial confinement, this laser design, which has certainly turned out well here for this kind of first accomplishment for humanity, is that there's many other designs that have actually a very good odds of outperforming what NIF has just done. There are several that could easily be five times net out, so not just 1.2 that are in design. And some are actually under construction and will be in operation in a few years, give or take about three or four years. So I think three or four years out, we'll have something, potentially, materially even better than what we're doing. And what's great is that we have a lot of competition of designs and types of fusion reactors. And the likelihood that one or more, you know, continues to significantly improve on what's happened here today is reasonably good odds.",

So they're planning to come back as a unified group at some point in the future. They have, though, taken a hiatus, as I said, earlier this year. And they're all working on solo careers. But as you say, Jin is now inside the military base behind me here in Yeoncheon. This is where he will do five weeks' basic military service. It's about ten miles, 16 kilometers from the DMZ, the De- Militarized Zone between North and South Korea. It is a fairly tough place to be during winter. We spoke to one conscript who had been there just last year. And he said he could go to minus 30 degrees Celsius during the winter months. And everybody who is in that camp learned to hate the snow. It is a particularly tough, frontline basic training camp. Now, there weren't that many fans here, maybe a few dozen, because Jim had actually asked that they stay away, because there are others that are going in today, as well, other conscripts. All able-bodied men before the age of 28 have to go and serve between 18 and 21 months in military service here. Jin was able to push it back to 30, because they passed a law saying that anyone who excels in public and popular culture and art can defer it for a couple of years. In fact some sporting stars who have either won Olympic medals or an Asian Games gold were exempted completely and just had to do some kind of community service. The same with -- with classical musicians. And so this is why it's almost surprising that this day has come. It has been debated in this country for months, lawmakers getting involved. The parliament getting involved, deciding whether or not BTS should be exempt because of what they do for the country. And certainly, the soft power of BTS helping Korea around the world is something quite significant -- John.",
