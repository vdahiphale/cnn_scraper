      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.We start today with some breaking news. The fifth group of hostages released by Hamas in exchange for some prisoners, some Palestinian prisoners, is now back in Israel, and headed to be reunited with their families. Newly-released video shows the terrorist group handing the hostages over to the Red Cross earlier today inside Gaza. Twelve hostages total, 10 Israelis were freed today, mainly older women, today. In the first released since the temporary pause was extended. The Israeli hostages released today are 84-year-old Ditza Hayman, 78 year old Tamar Metzger, 77-year-old Ophelia Roitman, 75-year-old Ada Sagi, 63-year-old Clara Marman, 60-year-old Norlin Natalie Babdila, 59-year-old Gabriella Leimberg, and her 17-year-old daughter Mia, 53- year-old Merav Tal, and 36-year-old Rimon Kirsht. As the hostages freed over the last few days make their way home to their families, we are starting to hear some of the heartbreaking, and frankly brutal stories of what some of them have experienced while in the custody of the group, Hamas, which the United States considers to be a terrorist group. For example, the aunt of 12-year-old Eitan Yahalomi says that he says Hamas forced him to watch videos of the October 7th attacks, murders, and such. She told CNN affiliate BFMTV that Eitan was beaten after he was kidnapped and taken to Gaza. That every time a child cried, Hamas threatened the child with a weapon, to quote, shut them up. His aunt also says that Eitan was forced to spend some of his days as a captive completely alone, solitary confinement for a 12-year-old. Freed hostage Keren Munder and her family endured days of very little food, according to her cousin, who says Keren and her mother, Ruth, each lost somewhere between 13 and 18 pounds while in captivity. Some days the only four they were given was pita bread. And young Emily Hand, who turned nine while in captivity, also lost weight, her dad Thomas told CNN. He's never seen her so pale. When they were reunited, Emily spoke to her dad in only whispers, he said it's because she had been conditioned by Hamas to not make any noise. We're going to have more of Emily story ahead on THE LEAD. Clarissa Ward bringing us that story. But we're going to start today with CNN's Jeremy Diamond who's at the Kerem Shalom border crossing, that's where Israel, Gaza and Egypt all meet. Jeremy, what's -- what's happening there on the ground right now, and what happens next for this latest batch of newly-freed hostages?",

They said that multiple IDF soldiers were injured in that incident and that they returned fire towards Hamas.Hamas says that Israel was the one that opened fire first, but clearly either way, this is the most significant break in this truce that we've seen so far. But for now at least, Jake, it does not appear to be a significant enough to call off this deal entirely. For now, we are still expecting ten more Israeli civilian hostages to be released tomorrow, and one additional day of that pause in the fighting -- Jake.",

I think both sides have great interest that this pause will continue, at least for now, at least for several more days. That was, I think, one of the main issues on the table in this spy chief summit in Doha, Qatar, today, trying to see if we can, you know, continue this pause for another day, another two days, another three days. The maximum amount of days possible, according to the Israeli cabinet decision, is overall nine-day pause. We are now at the end of the fifth day, so I think there's still some way to go.",

And second, I think what Hamas is banking on is the fact that, you know, we'll get to maybe nine days of Paul's and then they say, well, after nine days, could Israel really resume the operation the same way it did before the pause? It's an open question.If you ask the Israelis, they will tell you, of course, we're going to resume the operation. If you ask the Biden administration, you'll hear some more nuanced answers. But one very interesting thing is that during the spy chief summit in Doha today, the Israelis came with a very clear message because the Qataris came and said Hamas wants a new deal on more hostages, and maybe on soldiers, and men that they took hostage. And the Israelis said we are not going to discuss anything with you about the future deals, before you finish releasing all of the women and children that you still have in your custody. And this is between 30 to 40 women and children. So this means at least between 3 to 4 days of pause.",

And to operate within such a dense area, it's almost impossible for military to operate there without causing great damage and civilian casualties.So I think this is going to be a main issue of contention between Israel and the U.S. going forward.",

Now, she is in good physical condition, there's no indication that she was physically abused in any way. She lost a lot of weight. She was very, very pale. She said that they didn't have enough to eat. But obviously, there is the psychological component here. The very fact that she was only able to whisper, because she was so frightened of raising her voice. He said that the only word she appeared to learn in Arabic was the word for be quiet, which gives you an indication of the fear that she was living through. He also talked about how she has very bad head lice, but all things considered, she is in reasonably good health, physically. One other important thing, when he talks about bringing the hostages back, he was very focused at the moment on the mother of Emily's very good friend. This is a girl he had gone to the play date with, she had gone to the plate with, was kidnapped with, was held with, along with Hila's mother, Raya Rotem, who acted like a second mother to her. And then, inexplicably, at the last minute, two days before they were due to be released, Raya was separated from Emily and Hila. You can imagine, Hila was released with Emily, and the anguish that she is going through now, being separated from her mother. This is a very important point for Thomas, he says, going forward.

And I agree with something you said earlier, which is you cannot overstate the January 28th meeting at Mar-a-Lago, because there was a real question at that point, is was the Republican establishment that is led by Donald Trump or not. And remember, this is before the impeachment, and people like Mitch McConnell are saying, I don't know what I'm going to do, but, you know, this is unacceptable.

We have seen you use closed-door sessions to manipulate, even distort the facts and misinform the public. We therefore propose opening the door, if you claim your efforts are important and involve issues that Americans should know about, then let the -- let the light shine on these proceedings. Now, the House Republicans are not going for this. Both House Oversight Chairman James Comer, as well as the House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan say that, first, Hunter Biden must come before closed doors, and then they will consider having an open, public hearing. This is what James Comer says. He says Hunter Biden is trying to play by his own rules. Instead of following the rules required of everyone else. That won't stand with House Republicans. Our lawfully issued subpoena, to Hunter Biden, requires him to appear for a deposition on December 13th. We expect full cooperation with our subpoena for a deposition, but also agree that Hunter Biden should have the opportunity to testify in a public setting at a future date, and Jake, as you, know this is all part of the Republican impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, trying to draw a link between Hunter Biden's business activities and Joe Biden's actions as vice president. They don't have proof, but they are trying the two together, but they are hoping that they can reveal some in this closed-door and also potentially public testimony.
