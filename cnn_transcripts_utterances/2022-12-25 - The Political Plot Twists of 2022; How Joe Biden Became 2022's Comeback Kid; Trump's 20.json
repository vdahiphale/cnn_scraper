I'm Abby Phillip. And thank you for spending your Christmas morning with us. 2022, it was the year of the political plot twist -- ups and downs, twists and turns, surprises, unexpected reveals and upended expectations. How did a year that began with President Biden's agenda seemingly in shambles and with a record number of bipartisan accomplishments? How did a year that started with Donald Trump firmly in control of the GOP finish with more rivals than ever, ready to challenge him in 2024? And the biggest twist of all, how did the party in power overcome raging inflation and unpopular president and an angry electorate to notch a historically good midterm performance? Here is how 2022 is closing out from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Republicans that did well were races that Trump did not touch. Like Georgia, for example, the governor's race with Brian Kemp.So, I think writ large, all of these things certainly added together. But as you're saying, in Pennsylvania, I remember talking to voters there. They were very concerned abortion was front and center, because of the state legislature. Michigan, where abortion literally was on the ballot, no one expected, I think one of the biggest surprises, no one expected the legislature to go Democratic for the first time in some four decades. Not even Democrats, because of abortion. So, there were voters out there, who may have told pollsters one thing, they won in the ballot box, this was a central issue to them because a lot of the candidates were unacceptable. They were Trump endorsed candidates who are pushing abortion. So, all of these things can affect together, they're all interrelated.

And here is what his longtime adviser Mike Donilon has to say about the president's trajectory. He says there is a pattern where, when it comes to Biden, and that is for the longest time, he is underestimated, and for the longest time, people say how he is wrong, and that when the results come in, they say he wasn't wrong.

The reality is it was a surprise. The outcome of the midterm election was a surprise to the president as well. It's so interesting as history is, it was the 50th anniversary of his first election, the midterm day was, when he was first elected as a senator. And how many election -- midterms elections and presidentials has Joe Biden seen in the Senate, in the vice presidency, in the presidency. So he knows what history shows. But he defied it. Not necessarily because of his own doing, but there is no doubt that voters certainly can see some of the accomplishments he was making. So regardless of whether or not he is responsible for it or not, he does own these victories and it sends him into the second half of his first term in a much stronger position that he had hoped. So I think there -- now the challenge of the White House is to make sure that the country is feeling all of these things. Because they still aren't necessarily, he didn't exactly get inflation right he, said it was transitory, but the reality is they have done a much shattered job than they expected. Now, it's implementation of transportation and the Inflation Reduction Act, et cetera. But for sure, he should take a victory lap over this holiday season.

And then obviously, I think what happened with the gas prices is key. And also he did something that I think a lot of Democrats questioned whether he should do, that was labeling MAGA as extremist and talking about democracy being on the ballot of some Democrats, particularly the moderates, felt like, oh, is he going too far?
