We are under pressure today, over 100 points down. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events: Russia announces the death of Alexey Navalny and the US president points the finger squarely at Vladimir Putin. In Georgia, prosecutors make their case to keep the district attorney in place and move forward with election interference charges against Donald Trump. And OpenAI unveils a new AI model that lets users create videos from texts. Live from Dubai. It is Friday, February 16th. I'm Eleni Giokos, I'm in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, a very good evening to you. We are of course waiting for the verdict coming through from the civil fraud trial for Donald Trump, we will be bringing you that update as it happens. In the meantime, outspoken Kremlin critic, Alexey Navalny has died in prison and that's according to Russian Prison Service. The 47-year-old opposition figure was being held at a brutal Arctic Circle penal colony. Circumstances surrounding his death are unclear, but world leaders, including US President Joe Biden are blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin. And in Moscow, the prosecutor's office has warned that any demonstrations in the Russian capital over Navalny's death have not been authorized and could result in arrest. CNN's Clarissa Ward has covered Navalny extensively through the years from his anti-corruption efforts to his recovery from novichok poisoning. And she joins us now, live from London for more on today's developments. Clarissa, thank you so much for joining us. We saw Alexey Navalny in court yesterday. He seemed in good spirits from what we could ascertain, so this news comes as a shock okay, but again, not really a surprise given his decision to go back to Russia despite being poisoned, knowing very well the risks that he faced.",

He was joking with the judge and the prison guard was laughing along with him. His mother, Lyudmila, told \"Novaya Gazeta,\" the Russian publication that she wouldn't be accepting condolences because she couldn't quite believe essentially that he could be dead because she had visited him on February 14th in prison, and she said that he had been in good health and that he had seemed happy. He had written a post on Telegram, the social media messaging app that his wife -- into his wife, Yulia, for Valentine's Day. And so there is this kind of disbelief. How did this happen at the same  time, he had been held for three years in various penal colonies. His lawyers had talked before about the devastating impact that the brutal conditions he was being held in had had on his mentality, he was held in solitary confinement, but also on his health. He had gone on hunger strike a number of times. And so while the exact details of what happened today and how Navalny actually died are still in question, and a lot remains to be learned on that front, the question of responsibility for his death in the eyes of his family, in the eyes of his followers, in the eyes of many western leaders, is not an open question. It lies clearly as President Biden said, with President Vladimir Putin, with the Russian state. He was in the custody of the Russian state when he died so suddenly, so young -- Eleni.",

That's a lot of money, especially when you consider that the attorney general in New York, Letitia James was asking for $370 million. So it looks like she got a lot of what she wanted. Remember, this is the decision after a trial was held 11 weeks long. Donald Trump took the stand. It was highly contentious. And that trial came after the judge had already decided that Donald Trump, his company and his two sons had committed persistent and repeated fraud by inflating the value of their properties and lying to banks to get better loans. So the news right now, the top line figure out of this is more than $350 million fine for Trump and the Trump organization.",

So I think the number itself is sort of where a lot of people thought it might come in, maybe a little higher than I thought might come in. The other thing that is sort of significant is that the one issue that the judge went back and peeled back what he had done in September of 2023 was the cancellation of the business certificates, that -- a lot of people have referred to that as sort of the corporate death penalty. That's been removed. But in its place has been put what appears to be multi-year suspensions for Donald Trump and his adult children from serving as officers and directors of New York companies.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is -- my assessment is, is that, it is certainly was not unanticipated. Remember, just resetting this isthat the attorney general investigated for a three-year period prior to even moving forward. That three-year investigation allowed the attorney general to gather voluminous information with respect to the workings of the Trump organization with regard to who was doing what, the chain of command, how things were proceeding. That is unique because the New York State law that they relied upon gives the New York State attorney general that investigative ability. The whole essence of the law is to determine whether or not there is fraud. The nature of the fraud, how the fraud is committed, et cetera and so predicated upon that three-year investigation, the lawsuit went forward, and that's distinguishable from a general lawsuit where you sue and then what is called discovery begins. Why is that relevant to my analysis? It is relevant because it was a lot of information gathered even before initially bringing forward the suit. The other thing that is important is that we should remember that prior to even having the trial, the judge made an initial determination that there was persistent fraud. There is this broad law in that New York State has, the executive law that permits the attorney general in instances of business violations to really protect consumers and protect the business environment, protect the marketplace, and so it is not unanticipated that the ruling would be as such, right? And so as I look at this and as it comes in, as we continue need to review specifically what the judge said. The reality is, is that we know that the persistent and ongoing fraud has been sustained. We know that the penalty is very significant. We know that is predicated upon gains that the Trump organization and Mr. Trump got because of the false valuations and I would anticipate certainly there would be an appeal and we will see what the appeals court does, if anything, relating to when the appeals is done.",

That's something that obviously Donald Trump isn't going to like having somebody essentially supervising Trump Org and Trump Org entities. So that's important, too. The other part of this is what exactly are the rules and this is something we are trying to figure out going through here for Don, Jr. and Eric Trump in terms of doing business in New York, that will be very critical here. There had been some talk about Trump Org moving all of its operations to Florida in some ways. That was not something that the Trump family wanted to do.

She said that there is confidence that this decision will be overturned on appeal. She called it a manifest injustice, plain and simple: \"It's the culmination of a multi-year, politically-fueled witch hunt that was designed to take down Donald Trump before Letitia James ever stepped foot into the Attorney General's Office.\" Now, look, that is somewhat true in the sense that Letitia James, the attorney general, did campaign on a promise to the voters to investigate Donald Trump. But this was litigated during this case, whether or not it was a politically motivated prosecution, well not prosecution, but case because it is not criminal to be clear, it is civil. And look, the judge said this is legit. There is enough here to move forward, and ultimately, the judge has cited that there was enough there to determine that the Trump Organization, Donald Trump and his sons had committed repeated and persistent fraud. So in addition to everything that Kristen just laid out, I also do want to add, there are restrictions in here about the ability of Donald Trump and his company to get loans for any institutions that are based in New York. It is obviously a tremendous number of banks and financial institution. So the screws tightening on Donald Trump's ability to do business in his home city, it is getting tougher.",

The issue to me is notwithstanding whatever politicalmotivation there would have been, any case turns on its facts and so ultimately, any appellate court is going to look and render a factual assessment as to whether the judge concluded that there was persistent fraud and what if any, penalty there should be. And so even if someone did say as the attorney general of New York State did, that they would investigate the Trump Organization. They would make determinations as to whether the marketplace really was a victim here. Whether or not that is true, the motivation aside, did this happen? Were there false statements made? Were there evaluations made that were not in keeping with reality? Did those valuations lead to better interest rates? Was this inflation of the values proper and appropriate? Were there financial misstatements? Were those misstatements really relevant and material? All of those things are going to be important. And so, there is a political environment here we have to make mention of. There is an election, of course. But the realities are, how did you run your business? I think the Trump Organization will come back to the notion that they had all these disclaimers and the disclaimers indicated essentially buyers beware. We are not giving an indication of these values. We are simply saying that that's the best of our ability. You do your own due diligence. They had an expert that is the Trump team testifying their case that these misstatements didn't mean a thing, right? And they certainly weren't intentional at all and that there were no victims here. Whether that carries the day of course, is another question because at the end of the day, the law itself, the  executive law doesn't require that people lose money, doesn't require you have to show a victim, does not require, in essence, right that ultimately, that would occur is that you establish if you're the attorney general that massive amounts of money were lost.

Of course, we know this is probably going to be appealed. We know what we are looking at going forward here, but again, this is just really showing how serious this case actually is.",

Now, having said that, there are a lot of states out there, Delaware is one of them, Texas is another, Nevada is another. You can incorporate in those states, you can be an officer and director and you can hold property of other -- that is located potentially in other states as well. So there is, I think a lot to that remains to be seen about how large of an encumbrance this order will place on Donald Trump and his adult sons actually being in some sort of a stewardship or management capacity, but not in a New York corporation. But the very least, this is probably going to cause some disruption in exactly what those ownership space look like. Now, remember when Donald Trump was entering his first term as president, there was a very, I guess, a  paperwork heavy press conference in which he purported to be basically signing off in a blind trust, that he was no longer going to be serving in a directorial are officer capacity for his businesses. So he has done this as part of -- at least, ostensibly done this as part of becoming president the first time, but the people that he handed it off to were his adult sons. And so that's going to be different even if he were to prevail in the fall election. And so this is the type of sanction that you do see fairly frequently in big federal securities fraud cases. This is an odd case for this particular executive statute because it usually has been directed at somewhat smaller bore types of frauds like Ponzi schemes and boiler room schemes and so forth, but not multi -- you now, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars' worth companies.",

He had some recent influxes over the last couple of years that brought him perhaps $400 million before taxes. But again, his businesses burn through cash. And no matter how you slice that, he does not have this kind of money on hand to pay these two judgments without having to either sell some of his assets, or alternatively, to refinance some. But that's a problem too, because this order bans him from seeking loans from any, any bank that's registered in New York State, that's almost every bank.

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, this is a significant ruling against the Trump Organization. It is a big number. 300 -- nearly $355million that Donald Trump and his company will need to pay. That as the amount of money that the judge said they had gained in properly through this alleged -- through the fraud that he found that they were liable for that's inflating the value of their properties, including his triplex apartment in Mar-a-Lago in getting better rates on loans and insurance. So, a real significant number. He's also finding Trump's two adult sons who run the business, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, $4 million each. And he is imposing some other steps around the Trump Organization, including keeping a monitor in place for three years, asking them to appoint an independent compliance officer that the company will have to pay for. But the judge is walking back on what was a real significant ruling earlier several months ago in this case. At that point, the judge have canceled their business certificates in New York, and no one really understood what that meant. But it was viewed as potentially, you know, a death knell for the corporation. It was unclear if they would be able to operate, if they would be able to own any properties. The judge is now taking that off the table, saying it's not necessary because of the monitor and what will be this independence compliance officer. And the judge is saying that he is also going to ban Trump from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York State for three years. He's also imposing a ban for two years on Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as also, saying that the company can apply for loans in New York from any company -- from any bank or financial institution. That has New York state oversight, which is almost every financial institution that's global in any way. So, really putting in place a lot of these restrictions and oversight over the company. And one of the reasons, I just want to read a line from this judge's ruling, he says is because of their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological. That is one of the reasons why the judge says that it is important that he is putting all of these things in place in addition to this big fine just shy of what the New York Attorney General's Office speak seeking. We do expect to hear from the New York Attorney General in just about two hours. (CROSSTALK)",
