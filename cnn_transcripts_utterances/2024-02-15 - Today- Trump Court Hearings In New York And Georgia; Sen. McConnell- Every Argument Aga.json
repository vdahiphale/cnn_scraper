      "sentences": "Good morning. Thanks for being up early with us. I'm Kasie Hunt. Just after 5Dueling hearings today for Donald Trump. He's got to decide where to be. In New York, a judge is going to hear the former president's bid to throw out his porn star hush money case. There he is with Stormy Daniels. That's the indictment that made Trump the first former or current president to ever be criminally charged. He plans to attend that one in person. In Georgia, Trump's lawyers will be seeking to disqualify D.A. Fani Willis and her top prosecutor over what they say is an improper relationship. Trump is charged there with election interference. And there's a possibility Willis will be testifying herself. Let's bring in Lis Wiehl. She is a former federal prosecutor and the author of \"A Spy in Plain Sight.\" Lis, good morning. It's great to have you here. I want to start with the Georgia election subversion case. Fani Willis has admitted that there -- that she did have a relationship with the special prosecutor Nathan Wade. How damaging is this, and is it enough to disqualify them? LIS WIEHL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, AUTHOR, \"A SPY IN PLAIN SIGHT: THE INSIDE STORY OF THE FBI AND ROBERT HANSSEN -- AMERICA'S MOST DAMAGING RUSSIAN SPY (via Skype):  Well, it's damaging in the sense that it shows poor judgment. I mean, it's a big high-profile case and to start an affair with Wade is not in good judgment, let's say. And she's admitted that. She's said she's human, she's flawed. She's said this in public. OK, so poor judgment on the one hand. Is it enough to disqualify her from the case? No. They'll have a hearing today. The judge wants to her perhaps even from her and certainly from Wade about when the affair started and what financial gain that she might have had. But that is all -- those are all issues for maybe disciplinary action at some point. I mean, I'm really pulling at straws here, but maybe. But certainly not disqualification. Because in Georgia, as in most states, to have a conflict, whether it's a real conflict or an appearance of a conflict, you have to have something that's going to damage the defendant, right? It's going to prejudice the defendant. What's an example of that, Kasie? If Willis, for example, was having an affair with the judge or having an affair with somebody who was going to testify. You know, a big -- a big witness in the -- in the trial. That potentially could be a conflict of interest and could be a prejudicial effect on a defendant -- i.e., Trump and his cohorts here. But I don't see that here. I don't see their having an affair having a prejudicial impact on the defendant -- no. It's kind of their business and wrong judgment, but it doesn't fit the conflict of interest statute in Georgia and many other states.",

But it really does represent a fundamental change in sort of the perception of what the role of the United States should be in a post-World World II -- you know, the way that the West has been fundamentally conceived.Tia, there are some other efforts to kind of drop a version of this bill that could get through the House of Representatives. I think it's important to underscore that the issue here is that Mike Johnson, the House Speaker, won't put it on the floor. Like, if it were to get a straight vote on the floor of the House there's enough support in the Congress for this to pass between Democrats and the Republicans who still believe that this is an important thing for the United States to be doing.

To me, Green's decision -- some of these Republicans who are retiring are kind of part of that old guard that we mentioned, and so it kind of makes sense as we see the rightward shift of the party. We see the influence of Donald Trump.Whereas, Green is pretty conservative. Again, he just talked about their border security bill, which is beloved in conservative circles. The impeachment of Mayorkas. We know that's something that Donald Trump wanted and people like Marjorie Taylor Greene backed. And he says he got that over the finish line. So, to me, it's not as clear why he's retiring. He's not someone who's been around for decades and is getting kind of up there in age. So I think it remains to be seen. There could perhaps be other reasons behind it. I don't know but I'm thinking is there another -- maybe a local office that he wants to run for, or maybe a job in the private sector that he's eyeing? Those are what come to mind. But I think in a more global sense, it is interesting that of all -- we all -- I mean, Congress is a big body. There are always lots of retirements going into each cycle. But among Republicans, there does seem to be some panic and concern about their inability to govern, the influence of Donald Trump, and how that makes it --",
