Is it 2003 law passed in the wake of 9/11 called the HEROES Act, that allows the secretary of education to wave or modify federal student loans in national emergencies.And several of the justices led by the chief, John Roberts, said, you know, you're talking about nearly half a trillion dollars here, more than 43 million borrowers. How does that just involve modifying loans? And he said the statute he suggested, and other conservatives did, that the statute just wouldn't allow it. Now, Elena Kagan on the liberal side said, this statute is clear in terms of giving the secretary of education authority for emergencies. Of course, Congress couldn't spell out all emergencies. That's what emergencies are all about. But then the other issue was fairness, Kaitlan. The chief and others and Neil Gorsuch, who you will hear from in a second, talked about how is it fair that someone who borrowed from the federal government to go to college is then going to be able to take advantage of taxpayer money to pay it back when someone who was not even able to have the opportunity for college, it will be without and essentially have not the same kind of earning power. Let's listen to Neil Gorsich on that topic right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  What I think they argue that is missing is cost to other persons in terms of fairness, for example, people who've paid their loans, people who don't plan their lives around not seeking laons, and people who are not eligible for loans in the first place, and that half a trillion dollars is being diverted to one group of favored persons over others.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think if Jacqui Heinrich, a very serious reporter at Fox who is just trying to do her job, fact-checking the election lies, and Tucker Carlson just texting executive she should she be fired.

I suppose if he says anything honest, straight and critical of them, that then goes into brief of Dominion, as even the Fox's own ex has said that and acknowledged that. That means that they're in a situation now where almost any commentary and, God knows, emails or the like, which surely they must have learned by now that they are turned over in litigation. I mean, they're suffering as much from what they said to each other in writing as anything else because there's one embarrassment after another. There is one statement after another, which is harmful to them in the litigation.And it's not -- I said this and then someone else said, I don't remember it that way, here it is.

So, there was the sense of fear within Fox that they were going to lose market share to those outlets.The reality is that they never even picked up enough that in major way affected the very high viewership that Fox News had, but you can just see sort of the fear he instilled in the big time hosts, the primetime hosts. And I just want to say, there is a lot of really good journalists at Fox. Dayside programming, I don't have really any major problems with, but primetime is where they make their money. And it has descended into conspiracy mongering, it is basically anything to get people to tune in and drive viewership and not risk losing to the fringier outlets.",
