And they say it will focus on a message of unity.Trump 2024 Adviser Jason Miller told me this yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON MILLER, Trump 2024 SENIOR ADVISER: Well, when somebody tries to kill you, you have an assassination attempt, of course it's going to change your life. It's going to change your outlook. And I think that's even what you're going to see with the president's speech tomorrow. I think he's going to talk about his firsthand experience, but also how this applies to what's going on in society today. President Trump, I think, is going to have a very powerful message.

There's not a day that I go by that I don't wake up and - and think about that morning, that terrifying experience.

It's very hard for a seasoned elected official to show a second act. I think tonight you're going to see a second act from Donald Trump. I think you're going to see more reflective, more unifying Donald Trump. That might be the thing he needs to focus this election on the future. And that's always the challenge.

Biden facing growing pressure to leave the race for the White House, and that has been coming privately from Democratic leaders, including the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi and, according to ABC, from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Pelosi and Schumer, it seems, have been convinced by bad polling. \"The New York Times\" reports that according to a poll from Blue Rose Research, a firm that formed from but no longer affiliated with Future Forward, a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden, just 18 percent of voters and only 36 percent of people who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 believe he's mentally fit and up to the job of being president. Mr. Schumer, according to the Democrat close to him, was also given data from a leading Democratic super PAC showing Mr. Biden's deficit growing to five percentage points or more in the must-win states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. And his deficit in three other key states, Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona, outside the margin of sampling error.

Obviously, it was also very political in that they had this message against President Biden. I remember this withdrawal from Afghanistan as well as being a turning point for the president in terms of public sentiment. It happened in the - in the late summer of 2021, not that long into the beginning of his term. How do - how does the Biden team explain what these families were there to try to say, that they don't feel the president has acknowledged their sacrifices? THOMPSON: I mean you're right that his polling has never, ever recovered. If you look at his approval, disapproval rating, it crosses in at that time of the Afghanistan withdrawal and has never recovered. In terms of what happened last night, this is a completely self- inflicted error on the president's part. And the reason has nothing to do with his advisers. This goes to the president himself. The president is incredibly defensive about his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and the criticism that came after. And the fact is that Joe Biden, who is known and has plenty of evidence of having, you know, have great empathy for people in grief, it was clear at the moment that that happened that he did not meet the moment. He looked at his watch while people came off - like while the bodies came off that plane. Afterward, the families complained that he was talking too much about his own son, not about their sons. And in response to the criticism from those families, he did not reach back out. And Joe - and Donald Trump to quick advantage. Starting in September of 2021, Donald Trump was on the phone with these families, meeting with them, spending time with them, and that's why they were on that stage last night is because Joe Biden, who is supposed to be - this is supposed to be the thing he is greatest at.",

And there's a lot of instances, and you've heard it a couple times over the last few days where he has reached out not wanting the attention of him reaching out and taking care of people. He wanted to do this. And that's what these families wanted.
