Today, both presidential candidates are on the campaign trail in battleground states and both are getting ready for their Tuesday debate showdown in their own unique ways. This afternoon, Vice President Kamala Harris took a break from debate prep at a nearby hotel by making a surprise campaign appearance at a small business in Pittsburgh. And former president Donald Trump is holding a rally right now in the battleground state of Wisconsin. We've got team coverage of the race for the White House. CNN's Eva McKend is in Pittsburgh with the vice president. But let's begin with Alayna Treene at that Trump rally in Wisconsin. So, Alayna, has it gotten underway?",

And look, this speech was really supposed to be focused on the economy about what they're calling \"drain the swamp,\" quote- unquote, drain the swamp, something we know they have referred to before, but really trying to hammer Kamala Harris and tie her to Joe Biden's policies.However, Donald Trump actually has spent the majority of his speech so far railing against his criminal cases, even though his prepared remarks that were shared by his advisers prior to his speech with reporters actually didn't talk at all about his criminal cases. It did talk about a bit more generally how he wanted to, if elected, he would stop the weaponization of the government. Of course a claim that Donald Trump has made repeatedly in reference to the legal battles that he is facing with no evidence of whether the actual Justice Department has been targeting him. But all to say that he went onto a long rant about his legal cases. And of course this comes just one day after Donald Trump was in court for a hearing on his appeals court case with E. Jean Carroll, but also a day after the judge in his New York hush money case had delayed his sentencing even further. Now this is something Donald Trump himself actually addressed on stage. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know why they don't do something. They ought to drop it. They shouldn't delay it. They should drop it. Drop all of it, drop all of it. I've been indicted more than Alphonse Capone. I say it all the time. He sort of the ultimate, you know, he is the ultimate criminal. I got indicted more than him. My parents are up there. They're great people. They're looking down on me right now. I can't believe this has happened to my son. He's been indicted more than Al Capone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he said he thinks it should be completely thrown out, not delayed. Of course, we know that he was indicted in that case back in the spring and he was supposed to face sentencing this month.However, the judge initially had pushed it back after the Supreme Court had ruled that presidents have immunity for official acts. So they are still waiting to determine whether or not this case could potentially be dismissed. That is also going to be decided after the election. But just to take a step back and get back to the politics of all of this, Fred. Of course, Wisconsin is a very important battleground to Donald Trump. That is why he is here today. It's one of those states that helped propel him to the White House in 2016. He won this state in 2016, but then he lost it to Joe Biden in 2020. And it is going to be very close in this state come November. Recent polls have shown Kamala Harris gaining ground in Wisconsin after taking over the top of the Democratic ticket. But again, it's very close and that's why you're going to hear Donald Trump also later in this speech talk about the economy, an issue that his team really has been pushing him to focus on noting that the majority of Americans see that as their number one issue and it's also an issue where he is currently polling higher -- Fred.",

We of course saw Hamas murder six hostages just last week. That has reverberated throughout this country and the grief and the anger are palpable.I would say that we are actually perhaps inching closer. I wonder to what extent the prime minister's comments are actually something of a negotiating tactic to sort of ensure that there's some kind Israeli presence. But he himself seems to express some kind of flexibility even in his remarks just the other day, saying, you know, I'm not envisaging a single Israeli soldier every three feet.

Israelis are so frustrated and so outraged by the sight of those six hostages being brought back for burial in Israel.

And the other is to just start using it as a brand name for stuff that you sell. So for goods or for services, you have to do more than kind of use it in a TikTok.
