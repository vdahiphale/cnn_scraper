I mean, we have heard Donald Trump say that he wants to be a protector of women before. One thing to point out here is that this, like almost everything that we see politically now, really the interpretation falls on whether or not you like Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. I mean, we were hearing women in the crowd, I was there when he said this, cheering, saying they want to be protected by former President Donald Trump. We have also heard from a number of women outside of that bubble who say that this kind of rhetoric is offensive. One thing is clear. Donald Trump has a woman problem. He has acknowledged he has a woman problem. Comments like this don't help that. What we saw today was the exact same thing that we had seen yesterday. Yesterday, Donald Trump did a speech from a garbage truck because he wanted to highlight Joe Biden's comments calling his supporters garbage, or at least that interpretation of those comments. Today, what we saw was Kamala Harris taking Donald Trump's comments and putting them on blast, making sure that people were paying attention. That's the point of the campaign that we're at because, right now, they are fighting for this candidacy. They are fighting every single day for every single vote, and they need to make sure that everything that is happening is amplified, because both sides know that this is coming down to the wire.",

We have not seen anything that indicates that he would take a blue state like Virginia or New Mexico. One thing is clear, though, when I'm talking to Donald Trump's advisers. They are feeling cautiously optimistic. There was a long stretch of time after Kamala Harris ascended to the top of the ticket, where they were not feeling that way. They now feel like they have a little bit of momentum going into November 5. Now, is it New Mexico and Virginia momentum? We will wait and see, but nothing we're seeing indicates that.",

My goodness gracious, you have to go all the way back to 1956, when you had that solid Democratic South. Dwight Eisenhower, of course, beat Adlai Stevenson back then.

And the basic tenet of the rule of law is that you respect elections. And the former president had an election, he lost, and then he sought to overturn that election. That's not conservative.

And it's not normal. It should never be normal. And the more we indulge that, the further we are from where we ought to be as true conservatives. So I really take Kamala Harris at her word when she says -- and I know because I have served with her -- that she will reach across the aisle and she will actually -- for people that she doesn't agree with, she won't seek to jail them. She will give them the seat at the table. That's what we need going forward.",
