      "sentences": "Yes, guys, multiple Secret Service personnel from the Pittsburgh field office for the Secret Service, as well as one member of Trump's security detail, reassigned to administrative duties, told to work from home, and that's a direct result of these investigations, these internal investigations into the assassination attempt of Donald Trump and the security failures that led to that.This is really just a first step, though, and it's, you know, it is the first step towards potential accountability for those security failures, but we still have more questions and answers really about, one, what led to those lapses, and two, who is ultimately responsible? We don't have the names beyond just the handful of titles, and these are not very senior officials as well, but at the same time, new information continues to come out. Our new reporting today is really focused on the communication failures. That's been something that members of Congress, in particular, have been raising questions about for the last month, and we're learning today from the Butler County district attorney that there were actually radios set aside by local officers with the intent to directly communicate with Secret Service on the day of the rally, but those radios were never picked up by Secret Service. Ultimately, at the rally, three minutes before the shooting, a local officer radioed a warning that there was a man on that roof. That warning was not heard by Secret Service because they didn't have those radios in hand. Ultimately, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has said they only needed about 15 seconds of a heads-up to do something about the shooter. Ultimately, they didn't hear a warning, and they didn't have any heads-up, and so what happened happened. They were only able to neutralize him after he fired eight rounds at the former president and killed a rally-goer. But this really underscores a broader communication problem that is really at the center of both the internal review and the congressional investigations. You can see the frustration as you go through this body camera footage that we've obtained hours and hours of body camera footage, the frustration on the part of local officers on the ground immediately after the shooting. Take a look at this particular moment just minutes after the shooter was neutralized. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, look, those are not going to stop anytime soon.House Republicans in particular are really adamant that accountability needs to happen.

The father and daughter, both of them among those seven who died after the yacht went down in a violent storm on Monday. The CEO of the firm that owns the boat's manufacturer says that this type of superyacht was, quote, unsinkable, which of course is a haunting description.Joining us now is Sal Mercogliano, who's a maritime historian at Campbell University. Sal, there's been a lot of speculation about what might have happened here, people looking at the design of this superyacht. What are the possibilities for what is possibly a water spout that hit this superyacht? What are the possibilities for what could have happened here?",

And even though it didn't have sails set, that is enough surface area to catch the wind and put this ship on its beams. In other words, knock it over.And if the crew had not properly secured hatches and doorways, the ship could have flooded very quickly, and that could have led it to it sinking into that 50 meter of water.",

It is standard procedure to shut those hatches during evenings. We'll also find out if the keel had been lowered.However, you know, this was hit by almost like a tornado, and as you well know, tornadoes can go through, you know, communities and hit one house and not hit another. So while the crew may have expected maybe bad weather or a thunderstorm, it's really hard to prepare for a sea spout, basically a water tornado coming at your vessel.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and talk a little bit more about that keel because I've read about how the design of this particular superyacht had a retractable keel, which is very heavy, meaning that if it were underway out on the ocean, you would actually have that keel dropped. It would give it a lot of stability, but if it's closer into shore as it might've been here, that keel could've been up, although it seemed like it was still pretty deep water. Why would that keel have been up?",

      "speaker": "MERCOGLIANO",
      "sentences": "Yes, you would almost always have the keel up. The only time you really lower the keel on a vessel this size of a sailing vessel is when you're under sail. That keel is meant so that when the vessel heels over in wind with sail set, you would maintain the proper stability of the vessel.Normally, you keep it up because it creates less drag. This is an extremely stable vessel without it, but that microburst, that sea tornado hitting it would send this ship onto its beam ends. And it's not exactly clear that even if the keel was down, it would have prevented this vessel going on its side. It has a very low freeboard, a distance from the water to the ship, and sinking on its side or getting on its side like that, water's going to come in through doorways and hatches that are not designed to be watertight.",
