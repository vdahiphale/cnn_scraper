Everyone can watch it on your show Sunday morning, 10But before we go, I do want to push ahead to today, the meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu on the sidelines of UNGA and that in the context also of this \"New York Times\" reporting about a potential agreement - a mutual defense agreement between Saudi and the United States. Tom Friedman put it this way in his column talking about Bibi. \"He has formed the most extreme government in Israel's history, and yet your administration\" - this is speaking to Biden - \"is considering forging a complex partnership with his coalition and Saudi Arabia. There are enormous potential benefits and risks for the United States. Can you - can you lay out those benefits and risks?",

The United States would be able to broker something that actually diffuses one of the central points of tension in the Middle East, and that is the rivalry and the hostility between Israel and the Arab states. If Saudi Arabia normalizes, it is, you know, really the - the -- at this point the leading Arab state in the - in the world. It is the richest Arab state in the world. It is custodian of the two great holy sites of Islam.So, for all those reasons, it would be a huge symbolic deal and it would also be, in many practical ways, a big deal because Saudi Arabia is vast and the -- if trade between Saudi Arabia and Israel started to boom, that completely changes the dynamic of what's going on in the Middle East. So, that -- it also puts Saudi Arabia in the camp, along with the UAE and Qatar and Israel as a kind of anti-Iranian bloc in the Middle East. The dangers of this is, the United States would be committing itself to the defense of a country that is not a liberal democracy, that is not in Europe or Asia, which it regards as its two principal areas of interest and influence in what, for the last 25 years, has been regarded as an unstable, troubled part of the world where the United States is actually trying to withdraw its military presence. You know, if you remember, Obama began the pivot to Asia. But the truth is, almost all administrations for the last four have been trying this pivot to Asia. And it puts the United States more deeply and commits it more deeply. And I think what Tom Friedmann was saying is, look, if you're going to do something like that, make sure you're getting something big. And he points out the issue that still remains completely unresolved and that Bibi Netanyahu seems to show no desire to solve is the Palestinian issue.",

We're artists, you know, we're vulnerable and we give so much breath and life to the world and all we're asking is for a wage that people can take care of their families and their likeness to be protected. That's not -- it's not uncommon. It's not -- we're not asking for the world, you know.And I feel for actors who haven't seen the success that I have, and a lot of my friends, because, you know, we're fine during the strike, but we're striking as a whole because we're a family, you know. And if one artist is struggling, we're all struggling.",

You know what I mean? And I don't want it to go to artificial intelligence. That's weird to me. I don't think society is ready for that just yet.

They've been going for years. They have tools. They know how to work out their issues.A lot of people, especially underserved communities, they're new to the notion of seeking help. You heard me say in the black community, we don't -- we've never been told to talk about or be vulnerable. That was a weakness for us, you know. And so this is new. This whole notion of talking about needing help and getting help in that matter is very new to the African American community. And, like I said, it's about meeting people where they are. Some people -- it's very still stigmatized. You know, I had someone ask me yesterday, what would you say to a person who is trying to seek therapy for the first time and they may feel uncomfortable? I said the great thing and the blessing that came out of the pandemic was, start with a Zoom with a therapist. You're in the comforts of your own home, you know. That's a great way to start. That's a good tippy toe into getting your mental wellness. And so that's the thing, we try to meet people where they are and we make it warm and welcoming. I think when people think about therapy, they think of a sterile room and it's all white and it's, you know, it's daunting to some people. So, with these pods, it's very welcoming. You don't have to seek a therapist right away. You can just convene and talk about mental wellness. Maybe sometimes it's somebody's first conversation ever about the subject matter. But it's in a warm, safe place. We do -- you don't have to do yoga. It can be African dance. It's just ways to -- because what's happening is we don't have enough therapists.",
