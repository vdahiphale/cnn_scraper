And legal experts, and apparently the folks at the Justice Department as well, immediately drew some concerns, raised some objections.We reported on Wednesday that the Justice Department had sent that warning letter to the Musk super PAC. Musk's group did not name a winner on Wednesday, and that sort of raised a lot of eyebrows. Maybe they were shutting it down. But late last night they announced two more winners. $1 million to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin. So, it looks like they are moving forward with if this program, even though they have been warned by federal law enforcement that it might be illegal.",

That's actually right in the middle of the spectrum when we're talking about recent polling data. You don't have to look very far to find Donald Trump ahead nationally. He was up by two points in the CNBC poll, up by three in \"The Wall Street Journal\" poll. Very close races within the margin of error. But then the same thing on the other side, right? You have Harris up by three points according to Ipsos. The Say 24/YouGov poll, that's a bunch of academics, also has Harris up by three. But the bottom line is, with the popular vote, which we really haven't focused upon, a very, very tight race, John.

Look, Harris in the average poll right now is up by one, well within the margin of error. You go back four years ago, Joe Biden was well ahead of Donald Trump in the national popular vote polls. He was up by nine. Even Hillary Clinton was up by six points. So now Donald Trump's in a position he really hasn't been before at this point in the campaign where he could truly compete and we can truly say that the popular vote at this point is way too close to call. Of course, this is only going back eight years. I wanted to jump even further back in my time machine to get an understanding, hey, I haven't heard about a Republican potentially winning the popular vote in a while. And it turns out a Republican winning the popular vote, it hasn't happened since 2004 and George W. Bush defeating John Kerry. And that's only the one time and that it has happened. In fact, you have to go all the way back - all the way back to 1988 to find another one when it was George W. Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, winning the popular vote over Michael Dukakis. So, the fact that the polls right now are so close, John, the fact that Donald Trump has a legitimate shot of winning the popular vote is something I think a lot of folks, including in my line of work, really didn't think could possibly happen when Donald Trump was running last time around.

They include these conversational cues that are kind of human-like, like, I furrowed my brow, I said this to you. And it sort of creates this fantasy world for users.And in this lawsuit that this mother has now filed, and in her conversation with me, she said that as her son's school started using this platform, he started to withdraw from his family. He had behavioral issues, school issues. But she thought at the time it was just kind of teenage blues. He was 14. She says it wasn't until after his death that he - she realized the extensive conversations he was having. Some of them were really sexual. And some of them where he's expressing these thoughts of self-harm and suicide. And she said the bot did not respond appropriately. In his last conversation with the bot, which was moments before he died, I want to bring it up for you on the screen. The bott is asking him to come home to me.
