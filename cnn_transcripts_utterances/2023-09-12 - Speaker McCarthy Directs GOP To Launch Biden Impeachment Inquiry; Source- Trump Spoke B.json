Under threat of being ousted himself, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy directs GOP-led committees to investigate the president and his connections to his son's business dealings. But even some House Republicans say they're not convinced evidence exists. Plus, the Pennsylvania manhunt escalates dramatically. The escaped inmate who's eluded capture for almost two weeks is now armed as citizens in the area sit on their porches with guns ready to protect themselves from the convicted killer. And moments ago, the NFL made it official, that Achilles injury has put long time NFL star quarterback Aaron Rodgers out for the entire season. Just four plays into his New York Jets career. Legendary NFL QB Joe Theismann, no stranger to devastating injury himself, will join us to discuss. (MUSIC)",

He said that's how you would know it was serious business but since then, several Republicans insinuated they might not back the move, they might not vote for it, given the lack of evidence to support such a drastic action. So, McCarthy opted instead to skip a floor vote. He instead is sending the inquiry straight to the House committees. Then, of course, there's the question as to why do it today? Well, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz has been threatening to force a vote on the floor on whether to remove McCarthy as speaker if McCarthy stood in the way of impeachment inquiry. Remember, Gaetz was one of the thorns in Speaker McCarthy's side when McCarthy was trying to secure the speakership through 15 rounds of balloting back in January. This moment was after Gaetz had voted present on McCarthy's 14th ballot vote for speaker. After this exchange, Gaetz swapped his present vote to yes, securing the speakership for McCarthy. Our coverage of this issue starts with CNN's Melanie Zanona who's been on the Hill all day capturing the House reaction to McCarthy's controversial move.

So, Garrett, McCarthy -- Speaker McCarthy told Breitbart less than two weeks ago, quote, to open an impeachment inquiry is a serious matter and House Republicans would not take it lightly or use it for political purposes. That's why if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People's House, and not through a declaration by one person. Obviously, he's changed his minds, since then. What does it signal you to that he's doing it the opposite of the way he said he would do it two weeks ago that in his view, signal that it was serious?",

The timing I get that with the politics of it. But this is something House Republicans have talked about since July, August, going into September now.I think it signals here that they really have kind of uncovered everything they can here through the normal procedure, right, through subpoena power, they've gotten stonewalled on the National Archives with the pseudonym e-mails, they've gotten stonewalls on letters -- a letter to the White House counsel. So I think what they need to do here is the impeachment inquiry gives them the expansive powers essentially here. Now, there is a debate on procedure-wise. Typically, there would be a vote for this. I still would say the House speaker, the Constitution is pretty vague in terms of whether or not you actually have to vote on the inquiry. So I think they'll have the apex of power here have to go to court to battle these things out. But I think they have essentially done everything they could so an inquiry is necessary.",

Now, only four in 10 said they thought he had done something illegal. It's that interesting gap between 60-some percent and 40-some percent that's going to be crucial here.Everybody else is already in their camps. They've decided that they think Biden did something super illegal or no, he's probably innocent. This is just nonsense. But this impeachment inquiry as it moves forward, it could have potential benefits to Republicans politically if they do uncover something that puts a further stamp on, hey, look we said something was wrong here and now we have proof. But if it backfires, if they don't actually find anything, there are risks to the party in power. Just like at House Republicans during the Bill Clinton impeachment.

So, we need to start at zero and work our way back up. That's what I would encourage Congress and the president do. I'm sure they won't. So when I'm president in January, 2025, I'm going to have the chance to do that. By the way, Jake, I did that in New Jersey. When we have an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget that was left to me by Jon Corzine, and we eliminated 683 individual programs on the poor (ph), doing zero-based budgeting.

(END VIDEOTAPE) FREEMAN (on camera): And, Jake, another fascinating piece of information that we learned today police believe that Cavalcante actually knows where he is and believe that he's been in this area before, all the more reason why police are pleading with residents to keep your homes locked, keep your cars locked and remain vigilant -- Jake.",

It tells about his personal life, his motivations as a businessman and the book includes an explosive claim about Musk's satellite operations in Ukraine, a claim that had to be tweaked. The author of that new book will join us next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:37:38]",

He now owns X, once called Twitter, which is capturing the data of its users. He owns Tesla which captures enormous amounts of data, including video of its drivers and is reinventing the electric vehicle. Tesla now also owns Solar City, trying to be the largest supplier of solar energy in the world. He also owns SpaceX, which is the first private woman to send people and supplies into space, and he gets billions of U.S. tax dollars from NASA. Should we be scared? Should we be grateful? Here with us to describe it all, Walter Isaacson, the former head of CNN. He has written biographies on a number of geniuses who have changed the world, from Leonardo da Vinci, to Albert Einstein, to Steve Jobs, and now, Elon Musk, in a brand new book out today, 615 pages, after trailing, shadowing Elon Musk for two years. And I have to say, just for anybody who is afraid of the size, you write it in kind of like bite sized little stories so nobody should be afraid that they can't read this. It's very digestible. WALTER ISAACSON, AUTHOR, \"ELON MUSK\": Thank you very much, Jake. It's a rollicking tale and he's doing, as you just said, six or seven things at once. So, you got to interweave the tapestry with some of these stories.",

He said, maybe it is, maybe if it gets us electric vehicles, but then John McNeil also said, I wouldn't want to be that way.So I tell the story in the book, obviously, readers are going to have to decide, anything a biographer does, whether it's of Thomas Jefferson or James Watson or Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, you will see the driven and dark strands.

It's a really good read and shockingly easy breezy read.Walter, authors, journalists generally do not like to be part of the story but have you now acknowledged that you're going to have to correct one portion of the book that over the weekend I asked some public figures about. So, let's just dive into this. You write in the book that Ukraine last fall was going to attack the Russian navy near Crimea and it was going to use Musk's Starlink to help guide its sea drones and you wrote, quote, throughout the evening and into the night, Musk personally took charge of the situation, allowing the use of Starlink for the attack he concluded could be a disaster for the world, so he secretly told his engineers to turn off coverage within 100 kilometers of the Crimean coast, unquote. And then, obviously, the sea drones didn't work. Tell us what exactly is going to be corrected and what the reality -- what the accurate story is?",

And later, he said to me, no, it was already turned off, I just reaffirmed our policy. And so, instead of turning it off that night, he just reaffirmed that it had been turned off. It's called geofencing. And what they had done is within 100 kilometers of the Crimean coast, geofence so that Starlink would not work, it would not enable this. But the Ukrainians didn't know. And I made the mistake of thinking that decision had been made that night, in fact, the decision the geofence had been made before. He just reaffirmed it that night. But it does get to the question of, should he allow, should he have allowed Starlink to be used for the sneak attack on the Russian fleet in Crimea?

And I think he finally come to that conclusion. I asked him that night, have you talked to Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor? Have you talked to General Mark Milley, the head of the joint chiefs? He said, yes, I'm in communications with them. And the way they finally resolved it because even he feels this is too much of an onus on him is that he will sell some of the Starlink services, some of the dishes, he been donating them all to Ukraine but he would sell some to the U.S. military intelligence services and even create a military model called a Star Shield and now, the U.S. government gets to make those decisions.

And finally, he says he wants to defend speak from what he calls woke culture.And you write in the book, quote, there was an oddness too his new found anti-woke fervor and occasional endorsements of alt right conspiracy theories.
