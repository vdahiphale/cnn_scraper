Amid growing law enforcement concern that more than 24 hours after the Manhattan murder, the suspect could be anywhere.Plus, refusing to retreat. Donald Trump's embattled Pentagon pick says, he has the full support of the president-elect. As we speak, Pete Hegseth is trying to convince skeptical Republicans to stand by his nomination. And one case senator is dropping some not so subtle, not so positive hints about him. And the do's duo. It's heading to Capitol Hill to push their new cost cutting plans. I'll talk to a powerful Republican committee chair who will meet with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy today. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with breaking news. It is an image, a new one, that police want the public to focus on. It shows the suspected gunman unmasked inside a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. And it's not just a clearer picture of the suspect. Investigators are also learning more about his movements before the shooting and clues about a potential motive. CNN's John Miller is, of course, working all of his sources. John?",

He almost never took it down, even in the room with his two roommates that he was bunking with two strangers.But there was this one capture of an image where the mask is down. It was a video canvas that led police to the area. And when they went into that hostel and asked like, have you seen an individual like this, they remembered that person. So, he's a person of interest, and they want to get him identified to determine if he is their suspect or he can be eliminated.",

Investigators were saying, OK, what do these terms mean in the context of a victim from a major, you know, health insurance carrier? And you know, their analysts said, look, there's a nomenclature out there called deny, delay and defend, the three Ds of insurance. But those things are -- there are variations on those three words that appear in other parts of the internet. So, they are operating on the theory that the bullets had a message and that the message was against insurance companies who, when you know, hit with claims, will delay or go to court and take depositions. The question is, where's the third D? Now, if that was what he was doing, that that round could still be in the gun and didn't get fired, or it could be one of the other shell casings where the writing was burned off. You know, when you look at it, this is a nine-millimeter round. OK. This is very small. It would be very hard to write, you know, on this.

We truly believe that there's numerous areas that we can make government more efficient, especially in my will of jurisdiction, the IRS. I think that it would be a great service to the American people, if we figure out ways to make it much more efficient when people are paying their taxes, filing their taxes.

She's echoing all of the things that I keep hearing in my conversations with Trump advisers, which is, you know, you have to -- if you support Donald Trump, you're going to support who he is putting forward. And if you don't support him, it's a sign of not supporting Donald Trump and his agenda, if you do not back his nominees.And with Kristen's reporting, I've heard some of this as well. The thing, when it comes down to Hegseth in particular, is they are feeling more confident than they were with Matt Gaetz. I think that's a huge thing right now, and why we're not seeing, you know, more concern. I think that's a right now situation. I mean, this could change very quickly. We know that he's meeting with all of these senators and that's going to be a key indicator. But the one thing they keep saying privately is that, with Matt Gaetz, senators were very direct with Donald Trump personally, that they were not going to be able to move forward and confirm it. They were hardnosed. Right now, they think that they can still get enough people, including Joni Ernst, to maybe say, yes. And that's also why we're seeing a ton of people in Trump world are going very hard after Joni Ernst. They're almost kind of making her the symbol of, you know, not rejection quite yet about Hegseth, but they're going out to her heart to be like, this is not supporting Donald Trump. It's not even about her concerns about Hegseth in particular, they're making it a problem about Trump overall. And so, there's going to be, I think a lot more conversations behind the scenes with Ernst specifically, but all of these members to really rally them around and say, if you're not supporting our picks, then you're not supporting the soon to be president.",

Number one, even with Gaetz, there was not a potential replacement that was floated beforehand. And two nights ago, the Wall Street Journal broke that there was a potential, you know, Ron DeSantis could be secretary of defense. And two, and this is what we reported last night.
