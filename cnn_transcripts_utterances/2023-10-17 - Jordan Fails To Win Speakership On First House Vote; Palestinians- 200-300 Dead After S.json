The Israeli Defense Forces today just a few minutes ago said that it was actually a misfired missile by Islamic Jihad, a group in Gaza that is the reason why 200 at least were killed in a hospital strike in Gaza. In the hospital doctors and nurses were treating hundreds of already wounded Palestinians. CNN reports thousands of others were taking shelter at the hospital at the center of Gaza City. The Palestinian Health Ministry which is controlled by Hamas blamed the incident on an Israeli air strike and just seconds ago on its Telegram channel announced that the strike was caused by this misfired missile from Islamic jihad. CNN has not independently confirmed this. We're going to have much more on all of that in a moment. But first, here in Washington, D.C., weeks of Republican dysfunction, House Republican dysfunction crippling the legislative branch of the U.S. government. Today we saw a new chapter in this chaos here in D.C. as House Republicans tried and failed to elect Republican Representative Jim Jordan speaker of the house. That is the position second in line, third in line goes president and vice president and then speaker of the House for the presidency, includes Oval Office meetings and photo-ops with world leaders and real power. You should know who Congressman Jim Jordan is, according to the January 6th Select Committee. He was a significant player in then president Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. He met repeatedly with Trump staffers, with Rudy Giuliani and others to create, quote, strategies for challenging the election. Chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud. Four days before the January 6th insurrection, Congressman Jordan led a call with Trump and others about ways to delay the legal certification of the election and discussed how to use social media to encourage Trump supporters to come to the Capitol that fateful day. On January 5th, Jordan texted then White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to push him to say that Vice President Pence should, quote, call out all of the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional and say that there are no electoral votes at all which, of course, is not in the power of the vice presidency. Jim Jordan according to the January 6th committee also spoke with Donald Trump at least twice on January 6th as the deadly insurrection was unfolding. We do not know what they discussed because Congressman Jim Jordan refused to comply with a subpoena and Congressman Jordan has not offered up any clear answers publicly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I spoke to him on January 6th. I mean, I talk with President Trump all of the time.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY (R-WY), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: If the Republicans decide that Jim Jordan should be the speaker of the house, there would no longer be any possible way to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the Constitution.

We're going to have much more on the war, including more personal stories in the hours ahead.Let's go to CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill.

Before this first vote today, there was an expectation from Jordan allies that he would do better than Levin McCarthy did when he failed on the first ballot and he ultimately became speaker on the 15th ballot back in January. But in that first ballot, McCarthy lost 19 votes. Today, Jordan lost 20 Republican votes. That is a major concern. They tried to close the gap. I talked to McCarthy about this earlier and given the fact that some of those Republicans voted for McCarthy on the floor and whether he believes Jordan should drop out. He is giving advice to Jordan and he's urging him stay in the race potentially for multiple more rounds of balloting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Jordan has just as many votes as I had on the first round. I think the difference is we have rules and we can sit down, talk to the other members and be able to move forward.

We need to get House moving because in the aftermath of that historic and unprecedented ouster of Kevin McCarthy, two weeks ago, nothing could get done here in the U.S.But it was that very reason that the ouster of McCarthy that has led to several of those people who voted against Jordan to not support him here. They simply do not want to reward, in their view, the hardliners who oust McCarthy and are now trying to elevate Jordan, which really speaks to the tension that still persists within the House GOP, unclear who can actually put this badly divided conference back together and leave this House and bring it out of the state of paralysis. But at the moment, Jim Jordan is not able to get there. The question is, how much longer will he continue on with multiple rounds, will any of those Republicans flip to his side, or will he decide it's time to bow out -- Jake.",

MJ Lee at the White House, thank you so much.Let's go now to CNN's Clarissa Ward who was on the ground in Ashkelon, Israel, which is a few miles north of the Gaza border on the Mediterranean Sea. Clarissa, what do we know for sure about this hospital strike? CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we know for sure that there is been an astonishing loss of life here. Just horrific scenes and the videos that are starting to come in. We've been hearing from Palestinian Authorities 200 to 300 killed. But Hamas is now saying on their official Telegram channel that they believe 500 people were killed. Obviously, it's very difficult to know exactly those numbers, as they will be going through the rubble, through the night, trying to find how many people were killed in the attack. We do know that thousands of people were taking shelter in the al-Ahli Baptist hospital. This is a hospital in Gaza City. This is in the northern part of Gaza. That is part of the enclave that IDF had asked people to evacuate, back on Friday, but many people, Jake, including many who we've spoken to, simply were not able to evacuate. Either because they could not find somewhere to go, or they didn't have a proper means of transportation. There was also heavy Israeli strikes along the border, the southern border this morning, which then of course makes people afraid to leave their homes. So, for the moment, what we know is that there is a huge amount of anguish and rage on behalf of people living in Gaza, and in the West Bank, and frankly, all across the region, a sense of just disbelief that a hospital could be targeted, the IDF as you mentioned saying that they were not responsible. That it was potentially on misfired rockets from a group known as the Islamic jihad inside Gaza. Palestinian officials categorically denying that, saying that this was an Israeli strike. But what we certainly know, Jake, is that this is a hideous and very bloody inflection point in this conflict. It raises the specter of much more violence, not just in Gaza, but potentially in other flash points as well, and indeed, throughout the region. Israel has already come out and urged its citizens to leave Turkey, and all of this happening, as you just heard from MJ, as President Biden appears to make his visit here, Jake.",

Clearly, that call has been met by many, even those who don't necessarily support Hamas but to feel that this is a completely unjustifiable act of hideous violence.And so, you saw those clashes taking place in the West Bank. You saw as well Mahmoud Abbas saying that he will not meet with President Joe Biden, canceling that meeting. They have declared a state of mourning for three days. Flags are to be flown at half mast.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This city should be the way out of the war zone. But it too is caught in the crosshairs of Israel's relentless air assault. You are looking at the aftermath of airstrikes on Rafah. Thousands have flocked here in recent days, seeking safe passage, only to find more death. My children, oh, God, please find my children. This man pleads. They are under the rubble. Please pull them out. It is unclear if his children survived. Israeli bombardment has killed dozens here in recent days, according to Palestinian officials. The city, which sits on the Egyptian border, is home to Gaza's only possible humanitarian corridor. A corridor that is now in operable and unsafe, the WHO says, because of Israeli bombardment. And at the border crossing, footage shows smoke billowing from multiple airstrikes nearby on Tuesday. Desperate families gathered here for hours a day, praying authorities will allow their exit. So far, a diplomatic standoff keeping this crucial quarter shots. Cairo is reluctant to take in refugees, and says it wants to see aid allowed into the enclave.
