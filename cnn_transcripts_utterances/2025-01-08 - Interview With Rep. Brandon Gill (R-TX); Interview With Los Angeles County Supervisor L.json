At least two people have died and officials say there are high numbers of injuries as the flames are destroying homes and buildings. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate. Ferocious tornado-like winds are battering the area, and that is making an extremely difficult battle even worse for crews who are already stretched to the limit. We have dramatic video now from a passenger on a plane arriving at LAX who said that people gasped in shock as they looked down at the fire below. The FAA has now banned flights near these wildfires here, and we're also seeing the terrifying moment that a resident and a friend tried to evacuate a home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was a healthy, normal tree, the billboard, businesses to the left and to the right. This house going completely up in flames in a matter of just minutes as we have been waiting here. We have witnessed the destruction, the ferocity of this fire, how quickly things spread. We are parked just a block away from this. It is quite destructive and moving so fast. And one thing I will say, we're seeing all these resources in this area being pulled into this one spot. We know this means this is a hot spot, and they want to stop it to avoid further damage. This is just like the Palisades. It is a very densely populated area. Every street we have been down, we have seen damage on both sides of the street, not just damage. I'm going to correct myself. I mean active fires, homes, people's homes where their children grow up in both sides of the street. This fire is jumping so quickly. And, in part, it's because of this wind that I'm sure you can see behind me this wall of smoke. Over this way, this is Angeles National Forest. This is the foothill of these mountains. And this is the community of Altadena. That is where the fire is coming from. But we are at least about 15 blocks from that. It is not close. And just like Stephanie, I also smelled the fire this morning when I woke up inside my house. And, also, I live at least, like, 30 minutes from this location. It's everywhere. And it feels apocalyptic. It's the sense that Los Angeles is now just surrounded by the fire on these three or four different locations, 30,000 people here under evacuation orders. And it doesn't feel like there's any end in sight, Brianna. This is the desperation of this thing. We talked to folks in this three-, four-block radius. But they said they left last night thinking that they would come back today and be able to check on their homes and get their things, get their affairs in order. And the regret that we heard from them, the regret of coming back home this morning and realizing that everything that they left in there will go up in flames, and it's not anyone's -- it's anyone's best guess what will happen next. And another thing I will say is, we have also seen a lot of volunteers trying their best to douse homes in water with water from their hoses, trying to keep it from spreading any further. But, at this point, firefighters are saying, turn around, leave. It's too late. You might not be able to save this. Go home. Stay safe, because the priority here, it is to preserve life, Brianna.",

And so there's a lot that's at stake in an area like the Palisades, which are densely populated and in the hills, as opposed to some of the more spread-out or sparsely populated areas in the Santa Monica Mountains, where perhaps we have seen some of these other fires. So there's a challenge also with the Topanga Canyon area, which is densely populated in this canyon that is very difficult to access. So we had to evacuate the entire canyon last night. Last year at this time, we also were facing a road closure of the Topanga Canyon because of landslides because of wet weather. So we know these extreme weather conditions are contributing to these crises, and we are grateful to those who are on the front lines working hard to keep everybody safe at a time like this.",

And so we are still working hard to get this thing contained. Overnight, the winds picked up between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. -- 5:00 a.m. this morning. They were hurricane-like conditions. So we had to ground all of our aerial vehicles, which are typically tools that we can use to move faster at getting this fire under control. Unfortunately, we couldn't use those tools last night because it was too dangerous. So we're hoping that we will be able to get to a situation where we can deploy them later on this afternoon. But we are still in red flag conditions through the end of day tomorrow. And this is an ongoing, challenging event. So we're asking everyone to follow evacuation orders and to support our first responders by doing this. It's not only about keeping our residents safe, but the longer people wait when an evacuation order has been issued, the more we're putting our first responders at stake. So we have to make sure that we're all working together. This kind of partnership is what's going to ultimately lead to success. But, right now, it is an incredibly complex set of circumstances.",

So, keep in mind, even if we cut these numbers, say, in half by the time we get to the evening hours, you're still talking 40-to-50 mile-per-hour gusts. That is plenty to continue moving these fires along. And it's not just one fire. It's Ford. You have got the Eaton, the Hurst, the Woodley and the Palisades. Now, for people who are not familiar with this area, we have put some points on here that maybe you would understand where they are, say, for example, the Hollywood sign, Dodger Stadium, the Rose Bowl Stadium, to kind of put this in perspective. Now, the Palisades Fires specifically, again, having some of those areas that zoom down, where you could see where that fire was, one of the concerns is going to be the wind gusts here. Again, you're still looking at 30-, 40-, 50 mile-per-hour wind gusts even as we go through the afternoon as well as the evening hours. We really don't start to see the improvements in a lot of these wind speeds until we get to overnight tonight and into tomorrow.",

Greenland is part of Denmark. A Danish lawmaker being clear, saying in an interview with CNN -- quote -- \"Greenland is not MAGA.\" With us now, Congressman Brandon Gill, who is a freshman Republican from Texas. Welcome to Washington, Congressman. You are going to love it or hate it, I am confident. And we appreciate you being with us. I do want to ask you. In this press conference yesterday, Trump was asked if he'd rule out using military force to get control of Greenland and the Panama Canal, and Trump would not rule that out. How would acquiring that land help everyday Americans better afford their day-to-day expenses? REP. BRANDON GILL (R-TX):  Well, first of all, Brianna, thanks for having me. Really appreciate it. Listen, President Trump is bringing us into a golden age of America. This is the new manifest destiny. Acquiring -- reacquiring the Panama Canal, acquiring Greenland, renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, this is the light of America expanding. We have a very clear strategic interest geopolitically both in Greenland and in the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal, as you know, was created with the blood, toil, tears, and sweat of American citizens. We put an enormous amount of money into it. I don't think we ever should have relinquished control of the Panama Canal. So President Trump is really just undoing some terrible decisions that have been made in past administrations. And that's going to be a key theme of his presidency. The biggest job for Republicans coming in this election cycle, after this election cycle, is cleaning up the chaos and destruction that Democrats have unleashed on this country over the past four years.
