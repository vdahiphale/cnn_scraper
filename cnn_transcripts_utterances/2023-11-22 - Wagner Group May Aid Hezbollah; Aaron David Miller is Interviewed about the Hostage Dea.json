All of this coming at the direction of the Russian government.CNN's Alex Marquardt has much more on this. He's joining us now. Alex, what more did -- does the White House releasing in terms of this intel assessment, and what could it mean if the Wagner Group does start getting involved in (inaudible) right now?",

The talks, at times, seemed to move painfully slow as each step of the communication moved from Doha, Qatar, or to Cairo, Egypt, to Hamas in Gaza, then back again before being relayed to Israel and the United States. One official saying every step of this is like pulling teeth.And few people understand how difficult negotiations can be, as well as our next guest. Aaron David Miller, former Middle East negotiator for the U.S. State Department. So, look, we've got a four day truce, hostages swapped for Palestinian prisoners, Red Cross access to the remaining Hamas hostages. My question here is, I mean you've helped negotiate deals in this region. What's your immediate reaction to what we ended up with here? And do you see this as a one off or just the beginning?",

This took three weeks to do and it resulted also in - their reporting in a six- page, detailed agreement, which specifies terms and conditions.I'm reminded of Samuel Goldwyn (inaudible), the Hollywood mogul's famous quip that an oral agreement isn't worth the paper it's written on. There's no trust. There's no confidence. The U.S. is not negotiating directly with Hamas. It puts a lot of stock in the Qatari intermediary or he cutout. I suspect this deal will hold. Whether it holds in the next 24 hours or not is another matter. But I think, frankly, there are key interests for both Israel and Hamas advanced by this - by this deal. Whether it's a headline or a trend line is another matter.",

Now he's politically leading Hamas and the Israeli government believes he helped mastermind the October 7th attacks. So now one government official said he believes Israel is making a mistake in this prisoner swap for that very reason. Do you agree with that?",

But also to constrain, delay and even hopefully prevent the Israeli ground campaign from going forward. And I suspect that there will be growing doubts within the Biden administration and the - and the government of Benjamin Netanyahu as to whether or not Israeli military activities need to be continued as intensively as they can.So, if I had to pick a winner, the winner, obviously, the hostages who are being released and their families.

And, number three, you have a trusted or at least semi-trusted interlocutor to make the deal.I think in all three of those -- all three requirements, frankly, were present. Whether or not that holds for the next round - and, remember, the next round after that, Hamas will still have 100 hostages. And they'll hold them in order to trade for additional bargains or respites and/or cease-fires down the road. We're weeks or months away from any sort of resolution of the hostages.",

Good news, the storms should taper off tonight. Let's get over to CNN's Jason Carroll, who's at New York's LaGuardia Airport. This is important for asking for a friend, the man sitting next to me, how's it looking - how's it looking there today? JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's looking good. I mean you guys have been to this airport countless numbers of times. I mean looking behind me here, you guys can see this. This is what it looks like on a normal day, forget a holiday weekend. And also consider, as you were talking about, the weather, that a weather system moved through here this morning. Despite all of that, despite the predictions from TSA saying it's going to be probably one of the busiest Thanksgiving holiday weekends they've had on record, we're seeing few delays, we're seeing even fewer cancellations. We just took a look, a roundup, of LGA, LaGuardia, Newark and JFK. And at LaGuardia, just 24 delays, Newark, 31, JFK just 63 delays. This despite the fact that the TSA says on one day alone they're expecting today to screen some 2.7 million people coming through the airports. But, guys, it looks pretty clear. And the folks that we talked to this morning, one of them said she was shocked to walk inside. She said, where are all the people? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
