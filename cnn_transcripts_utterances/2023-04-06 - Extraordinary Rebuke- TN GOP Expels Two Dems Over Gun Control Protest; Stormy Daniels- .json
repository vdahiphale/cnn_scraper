State Republicans, in Tennessee, have just ousted two Black Democrats, from office, while sparing the third, a White woman, after they led a protest, on the House floor, calling for lawmakers, to do something, in the wake of last week's Nashville school shooting that left three 9-year-old children dead. State Representative, Gloria Johnson, who survived her vote, underscored that she saw race playing a role in that.

Now, I saw some really big idiots that I hope are punished to the full extent of the law, come and break into the Capitol, and act foolish, on January 6. But I didn't see a congressman act this way. What we saw here in Tennessee is three elected State Representatives, who know the rules, who understand that this place belongs to everybody?

You know what I mean? Because I have nothing to hide. I'm the only one that has been telling the truth.\" I should note here that Trump has denied that affair with Daniels. He's weighed in on it many times. She also weighed in on a potential punishment, for Trump, telling Piers Morgan, \"Specific to my case, I don't think that his crimes against me are worthy of incarceration. I feel like the other things that he has done, if he is found guilty - absolutely.\" Only a handful of people were inside the courtroom this week, to witness Trump's historic arraignment, including the sketch artist, Jane Rosenberg, whose work, you're seeing here, will be featured on the cover of \"The New Yorker.\" Jane is here at the table, with us now. We will talk more about what it was like, to be, Jane, in that courtroom, in a moment, because what a remarkable, remarkable moment for you. But Sara, I want to start with you, on what we're hearing, from Stormy Daniels. What do you make of her speaking out publicly now?",
