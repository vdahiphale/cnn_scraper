And two baseball fans injured during a Chicago White Sox game on Friday, though it's unclear where the shots actually came from, either from inside or outside the ballpark. Two people sustained non-life- threatening injuries there.We're going down this list to remind viewers of just the far-reaching impact of gun violence and how it has affected many aspects of life for Americans, either folks at a store, folks enjoying a sporting event. And it is changing the way some Americans are living their lives. That's according to research conducted by KFF, a health policy organization that shows one in three adults surveyed said that they have recently avoided large crowds, spaces like crowded bars, music festivals saying their concern is the potential for gun violence to break out. And yet another sobering statistic, in July the U.S. surpassed 400 mass shootings for the year. We haven't seen such a staggering number so early in the year, since 2013, since the gun archives started compiling these statistics. Just some perspective here, in 2019 it took 356 days to reach that 400 mark. Yet here we are, still several more months left to go in 2023 and we've already surpassed that 400 number.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo made those remarks during a meeting in Beijing with her Chinese counterpart and other officials as well.Raimondo's visit comes amid heightened tensions between China and the U.S. and as China faces mounting economical problems ranging from a real estate crisis to slumping exports. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins us now live from Hong Kong to discuss this. And Kristie, that is what context because obviously, it's in both America's and China's economic interests to have an optimal trading relationship here.

But this is critical to just keep the relationship and the trade relationship between these two superpowers stable. You know, the U.S. Commerce Secretary is in China for a four-day visit. She arrived in Beijing on Sunday. And earlier today in Beijing she met with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Wentao.After that meeting, Raimondo said that stable relations between these two countries are, quote, profoundly important. He pointed out, look, these two countries share more than $700 billion a year in annual trade. But she also added that the U.S. would not compromise on matters related to national security. Which was also the message that we heard earlier in July when Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Wang Wentao, who said, quote: I'm ready to work with you, together to foster a more favorable policy environment stronger cooperation between our businesses bolster bilateral trade and investment in a stable and predictable manner. Now this visit comes at a time of deep economic troubles for China. Because China is dealing with slumping exports. It is dealing with an ongoing and deepening property crisis. It's dealing with sky high youth unemployment data. Data that has been deemed so bad that the government has suspended releasing that data. Raimondo, who is currently in Beijing, she also traveled to Shanghai, her visit follows a flurry of visits from other senior Biden administration officials. Again, as U.S. tries to steady the boat, as it tries to stabilize this relationship because tensions have flared. Not only over geopolitical issues, but also over trade, over target sanctions, over access to sensitive technology like chips and over ways of U.S. consultancy firms operating in China like Bain, like Mintz. China has welcomed this visit. Last week we heard from the Chinese Commerce Department, the ministry, it praised the U.S. Commerce Department's decision to lift export control measures on 27 Chinese entities. China saying that measure paves the way to more normal trade. Back to you -- Bianca and Max.",

They say that in one case that the complaints are ridiculous. The fact that many international vote casters are not able to go into their country because they were not given accreditation, speaks to the overall -- according to multiple diplomats -- overall aim of Zanu-PF to keep prying eyes or the focus of the world's media and the world on this election.

And the Spanish women's teams -- women's team instead of being able to celebrate their World Cup victory has actually said will not play, they refuse to play, until the head of the Football Federation here in Spain, Rubiales, is either removed or he resigns. So this is becoming a huge headache, not just for football, but for the country as well. So it's not clear how exactly this can be resolved.
