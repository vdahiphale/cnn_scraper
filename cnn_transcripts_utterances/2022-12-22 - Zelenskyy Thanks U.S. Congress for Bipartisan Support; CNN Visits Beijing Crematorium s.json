President Biden just invited President Zelenskyy to Washington10 days ago, and so certainly both men were highly cognizant of those political dynamics in the Congress, when Zelenskyy was speaking to them last night. And he had so many constituencies that he was trying to address. Of course, there were the lawmakers in the room, Republicans and Democrats alike. But also the general American public to which he was speaking, who may be wondering why the United States continues to send tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine when there's so many problems in the United States. And that's a concern that you've heard from Republicans in Congress, particularly the most conservative Republicans who are wary of this amount of aid to Ukraine and aren't necessarily going to rubber stamp President Biden's requests going forward. But there is a sense this morning that President Zelenskyy was able to accomplish what he came here to accomplish, which was to rally American support, a demonstrate this unity between the United States and Ukraine sort of come as a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance. And of course, yesterday was full of symbols, whether it was Zelenskyy's a draft military uniform, or President Biden's blue and yellow striped tie. But underneath that, I think there are some lingering concerns about what comes next in Ukraine. And you heard that in both men's remarks yesterday, President Biden saying that the United States will continue to support Ukraine through 2023 indicating that he doesn't see a quick end to this war. And President Zelenskyy, also acknowledging that there are some tough days ahead as winter sets in as Russia regroups. On the battlefield, he came and said that the support, of course, he's thankful for it now, but that he does need more, he says, is it enough? Honestly, not really and that was kind of indication of where things stand right now President Zelenskyy's constant demands for more and more armaments has been a source of tension with the Biden Administration. And I think in inviting him here in person, there was a sense that meeting face to face talking eye to eye. They would be able to sort of de-conflict some of these things and that isn't necessarily what happens. Zelenskyy came out afterwards, still very much saying that he wanted more weapons, including more of the Patriot missile batteries that President Biden announced yesterday. Now, this morning, what U.S. officials said that they weren't necessarily surprised by those requests that they would be surprised in fact, if you didn't make those demands known to the American public. But certainly we are emerging from these historic meetings with a new sense of unity with American lawmakers, but certainly no more clarity on what the end of this war might look like, Rahel.",

He isinside the courthouse behind me where later today hopefully this morning he will face the judge and face these eight criminal counts of fraud and conspiracy. In one the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York has called one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas, where he has spent the past week there were several false starts in the courts there but he did agree to not challenge his extradition. And the Bahaman Ministry of Foreign Affairs signed off on that yesterday that put him on a flight back to the U.S. Now while he was in the air, the U.S. Attorney's office announced that they had charged two of his top executives. That was Gary Wang, who was the Co-founder of FTX, as well as Caroline Ellison she was the Co-CEO of the hedge fund Alameda research. Those two entities intertwined in this alleged fraud. As you said they are both cooperating with prosecutors. That places significant pressure on Bankman-Fried having two insiders, two people close to him now working with authority. So when he appears in court today, it's possible the judge will arraign him on the indictment where he will enter a plea in this likely not guilty. He's shown no inclination to plead guilty at this point in this fast moving investigation, and then they will discuss bail. And our sources tell me that his lawyers are in talks with federal prosecutors are working to arrange some kind of bail agreement that would allow him to avoid detention in the U.S. Now that is not unusual for financial fraud cases. A lot of people compare him to Ponzi scheme or Bernie Madoff. As you may remember, he was also released on bail, Rahel.",

The first point is we haven't had 18 months ofhigh inflation, while we've had three separate, totally distinct waves of inflation, very different causes and very different remedies. Now, the current wave of inflation is mainly driven by profit margin expansion, not a wage driven inflation. And that's important, because profits can get squeezed a lot more quickly than a wage driven inflation is likely to be. So its wage driven, the inflation is likely to be stickier, whereas its profit driven as it is at the moment, that's more likely to come down quickly. And in fact, you've only got to look at the complete collapse, in fact, unprecedented collapse in U.S. durable goods price inflation over the course of this year, to see just how quickly price changes can come down when circumstances change.",

In fact, he's probably done a bit too much damage, in my opinion. But you've certainly seen a slowdown in demand. We've seen this in the U.K. where disinflationary forces are coming through the starting to see it in continental Europe. But the second thing you can do is just change consumers attitudes, because consumers are being sold a story that these price increases are justified, or they start pushing back against that saying, no, actually, we don't believe this, then the companies will actually start to curtail the margin expansion, for fear of losing customers. And I think that's why we're starting to see a lot of central narrative, talking about profit margin expansion as a driver of inflation. We've had the upgrade out of the Fed we've had Elaine of the ECB talking about this. The problem is, generally ordinary people don't pay that much attention to Central Bank speeches. So it's something that I think if we start to see complaints about margin expansion are trending on social media, that's probably a good disinflation indicator.

The ECB will be lagging behind remember, hasn't even begun to Biden quantitative policy yet. But probably second quarter is the peak of European rates.

Will Ripley, great to have you. Thank you. And for more on this, the former U.S. Ambassador now to Ukraine, William Taylor joins us. Ambassador, wonderful to have you, so, do you think this visit for Zelenskyy was a success? Does he go back home with what he wanted? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Well, there's no doubt that this was a success. President Zelenskyy came here, not obviously, not in triumph, but he came here to thank the American people to thank the congress, to thank President Biden for the amazing support the incredible support, politically humanitarian, financial, but in particular military support. And he made that point over and over; he thanked people over and over. So that was his first point. It was a brilliant move. And then he asked for additional support. Of course, he's going to ask for additional support. He is facing Russia, Russia has attacked. So he needs additional support. He'd laid out pretty clearly what kinds of support he still needs. And if he gets that support, he can prevail. He definitely believes and the Ukrainian people believe they can win. So in that sense, Rahel, he came away, having done what it needed to do without boasting, being very appreciative, but being very frank, that he needs more.",

The Russians have lost in every field that they have bought. They've lost in Kyiv, they lost in Kharkiv, they lost in Israel, they lost in Kherson. There fighting to a draw there may be losing Bakhmut. President Zelenskyy was just in Bakhmut, two, three days ago now. And he then came directly to the United States. So the Kremlin is losing.

So they're attacking civilian targets, unarmed civilian targets that are causing Ukrainians to freeze in the dark, without light, without heat, without water that is affecting the decisions.

And the morale on the Ukrainian side is high because they know what they're fighting for. President Zelenskyy is able to tell everyone, Ukrainians, Russians, the International Committee, why they're fighting, they're fighting for their land, and they're fighting for their freedom. They're fighting for their independence; they're fighting not to be subordinated to Russia. That's a morale booster. And the Russians don't have that. President Putin can't tell his soldiers, anything about why they're there. Why are they there? He cannot explain this.

And then you look at the coalition that Benjamin Netanyahu has built. And that's where you see and that's where you're getting a lot of the experts, the people who study this, who are saying this is likely going to be the most right wing government in Israeli history. Now, last night, just minutes before the deadline he had at midnight in order to be able to announce that he had formed the government, Benjamin Netanyahu really took it down to the wire, something like 15 minutes before the deadline that he actually called the Israeli president notified him that he had managed to form this government. And it's not necessarily a surprise that he's managed to form the government. That's because from the November 1 election, he and his allies actually did much better than the polls were expecting. And it was quite a win for these extreme right wing parties that are now seeing themselves in position of power. That honestly a year ago, for many people in Israel, it would have been unfathomable that they would be in them. Now, there are still a few hurdles that they have to pass before they can be officially sworn in. Namely, they actually have to pass a few bills that would even allow some of these ministers to take on their roles or even serve as ministers. For example, one of the ministers that has been suggested he's been convicted of tax offenses in the past. And so there needs to be a bill that will be passable essentially, work around the law to allow him to become a minister. But all things are pointing towards this new government is expected to be sworn in within a week or so. And because of the makeup of its ministers, it's causing several of Israel's allies even around the world to brace themselves for the next few months. Here's why. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (voice over): The new Israeli government setting off alarm bells around the world. Even allies are warily eyeing Benjamin Netanyahu's new ministers who will make up the most right wing government in Israeli history. A stark change from the last coalition now made up all of men and all Orthodox except for Netanyahu himself. Most recognizable is Itamar Ben Gvir once convicted of anti-Arab racism and supporting a Jewish terrorist group. Now National Security Minister in charge of Israeli police eager to allow Jews to pray at Jerusalem's holiest site were only Muslims are now allowed to worship, a place that has sparked intifadas and even wars. Former Israeli ambassador to the United States Danny Ayalon warning Washington will be on high alert. DANNY AYALON, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO U.S: If they will perform what is conceived in Washington as provocations. For instance, change of status in Temple Mount or unchecked enlargement of new settlements. This could be a very, very big problem for Netanyahu and for the government. GOLD (voice over): Then there's Bezalel Smotrich, another far right settler lawyer turned politician has been named Minister of Finance, and has also been given power to appoint the Head of the Israeli body which controls border crossings and permits for Palestinians. Smotrich supports abolishing the Palestinian Authority and annexing U.S. Bank. Israel staunchest ally the United States perhaps hoping the rhetoric won't match the actions. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We will gauge the government by the policies that pursues rather than individual personalities. GOLD (voice over): Other appointments causing uproar include a gay rights opponent who has vowed to ban pride parades to position in the education ministry and proposed changes to the law of return for the restricting who was considered Jewish enough to be permitted to immigrate to Israel. Netanyahu, for his part has repeatedly claimed that the buck will stop with him. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER-DESIGNATE: I've had such partners in the past and they didn't change an iota of my policies. I decide the policy with my party. GOLD (voice over): But as the government has taken shape, his critics like this cartoonist say he's creating a monster he won't be able to control. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
