The excitement here. He was technically responding to a Peggy Noonan column that was at the beginning of August where Noonan says she is beautiful. You can't take a bad picture of her. Her beauty plus the social warmth that all who have known over the years speak of combines to produce radiance. And it's foolish to believe that this doesn't matter.\" But it really kind of put the -- this race into sharp relief. MARK MCKINNON, FORMER ADVISOR TO GEORGE W. BUSH AND JOHN MCCAIN: It's the greatest and latest example of just how unprepared he is to deal with -- with Kamala Harris. And Peggy Noonan, by the way, who's Reagan's speech writer and a terrific columnist, had another great line about what's happening here, when she said it's not so much that Kamala Harris created a movement as a movement created her. To me, I think that really captures what's going on, which is there's this burst of pent-up enthusiasm that's been going on for the last eight years, really, since Trump came on the scene. And by the way, I think this is going to be a night when -- or a week when Kamala Harris is standing not only on (UNINTELLIGIBLE)'s shoulders, but also on Hillary Clinton's shoulders.

There are still some issues I would argue with in the Democratic Party, which is why you're seeing so many protesters here protesting, calling for a ceasefire. What occurs, Kasie, if that doesn't happen, particularly in a state like Michigan, where there's a strong Muslim population, where there are a lot of young Democratic voters, where this is a principal concern for the release in the top five or top ten issues.
