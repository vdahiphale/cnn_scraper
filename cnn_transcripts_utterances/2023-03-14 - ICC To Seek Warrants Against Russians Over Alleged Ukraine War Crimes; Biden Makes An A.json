Putin's war machine has targeted civilian infrastructure, a deliberate effort to deprive Ukrainians of the basic essentials like electricity and running water to try and break their resolve.And now after a year is some of the lowest most despicable crimes allegedly authorized from the highest of levels. Russian officials may be facing charges of war crimes. The Reuters news agency and the New York Times reporting the International Criminal Court is planning to open two cases and issue arrest warrants for a number of people. One case will focus on Russia's unrelenting attacks on civilian infrastructure, including power stations and water supplies. The ICCs chief prosecutor Karim Khan, recently visited Ukraine to meet with President Vladimir Zelenskyy and see the extent of the damage firsthand. The second case will focus on the abduction of hundreds of Ukrainian children take into reeducation camps spread out across Russia. The ICC investigations were open soon after the war began. Around the same time Ukrainian prosecutors began collecting their own evidence of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers. Regional authorities in Ukraine have reportedly registered more than 65,000 Russian war crimes over the past year. Here's CNN's Ivan Watson. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): A senior Ukrainian official tells CNN that the Ukrainian government has been pushing the International Criminal Court for some time to open criminal investigations against Russians accused of committing war crimes in this country since the invasion of Ukraine a bit more than a year ago and that they want the prosecution's to go all the way to the top to no less than Russian President Vladimir Putin who of course ordered that invasion in the first place. The New York Times and Reuters had been reporting that the ICC is on the verge of opening cases issuing arrest warrants on two separate fronts for the alleged abduction of Ukrainian children, and secondly, for the targeting of Ukrainian infrastructure. We saw just last week, an enormous salvo of Russian missiles targeting Ukrainian power plants across the country for example. In the meantime, the fighting along the long and bloody front line between the two militaries continues with much some of the most intense fighting taking place, as it has been for months around the southeastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and that is where Ukrainian commanders say there is close quarters combat between both sides at distances of 10 perhaps 50 meters with Ukrainians trying to flush Russian troops out of trenches. We're hearing from both sides of the conflict, but some of the fighting is now focused around a metallurgical plant in the city called Azom with one Kremlin military blogger claiming that Russian Wagner mercenaries have taken the battle underground into mining tunnels beneath that industrial area. Meanwhile, Ukrainian sources saying insisting claiming that they're still in control of that area. And we're also hearing of daily casualties among civilians due to the incredible amount of artillery flying in both directions, more civilians dying every day on both sides of the front line in a war with no end in sight.
