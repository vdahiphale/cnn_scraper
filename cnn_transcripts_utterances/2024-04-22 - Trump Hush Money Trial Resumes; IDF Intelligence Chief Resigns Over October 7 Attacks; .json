Trump, the first ever criminal trial of a former AmericanPresident who happens to be a current candidate for President as well. Day one proceedings wrapped up just a short time ago. In opening statements, prosecutors argued that Trump committed election fraud, pure and simple in 2016, while Trump's defense attorneys told jurors, there is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election, and there is the core of the case. The first witness, David Pecker; the former publisher of the American tabloid, the \"National Enquirer\", and a long-time friend of Trump's. Prosecutors say that he engineered so-called catch and kill plans to cover up stories of Trump's alleged affairs. CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz joins me now. And Katelyn, the key here to the prosecution's case is that not only was this fraudulent, but it was done to interfere in the 2016 election by hiding a story that Trump wanted hidden, and more broadly, that it was part of a pattern of doing such. Explain their case. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Yes, so, the prosecutors today said to the jury, we've got the goods as far as the documents go. These records were falsified. There's 34 counts here against Donald Trump for falsifying those records about his business expenses, his payments to Michael Cohen. And they're also pulling back and saying it's all about election fraud. It's about how Donald Trump was motivated to keep damaging stories about him quiet when women wanted to allege they had affairs with him. And he used his network, Michael Cohen, his personal attorney, David Pecker; the former chairman of \"American Media' and the \"National --",

DAVID WEINSTEIN, FORMER STATE &amp; FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  I did, Jim. You know, his comments about the credibility of this witness, the fact that he's lying, the fact that he has motivation, all of that are things that his lawyers are going to say to the jury, and it's fine for them to say it to the jury in the courtroom.

It is something that's getting a lot of traction overhere, and a lot of the senior politicians, from the Prime Minister on down, are pushing back vociferously. The Defense Minister spoke about it today, saying that no one should, you know, lecture this country on morality. The Prime Minister has said that, you know, this is -- this is not the time to do this. He's pushed back. His right-wing Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called it, you know, an absolute absurdity to do this while Israel is fighting for what he calls its survival. I will say, on the left-wing side of politics though, again, a lot of commentators are saying what they're recommending for this ultra orthodox unit that's accused or appears to be on the verge by the United States of being accused of these human rights violations, and why this particular battalion wouldn't get weapons and training from the United States. They say that this goes -- doesn't go far enough, that actually these issues go to the top, to the top military command structures, and are not just limited to this unit. We were with a family today of an American -- a Palestinian-American, a 78-year-old man, who was essentially killed by soldiers of this unit. There was an inquiry, the senior officer who we understand might be one of those who quits his post in the near future called it a moral failure. This was a 70-year-old -- 78-year-old man who was blindfolded, had his hands zip-tied behind his back on a freezing cold January night, who was pushed faced down and left on the cold concrete. He had well-documented heart conditions and the medics -- not that, there weren't medics there. The soldiers there at one point seem to realize that he was dead and checked on him, and rather than call a medic, they fled the scene, other people who were detained with him called a doctor. And I spoke to that doctor today, and he said, look, if those soldiers had helped him, he might still be alive. So, these are the failures of the unit that may receive these sanctions.

Just on what Trump's just said there about Michael Cohen, expected to be a witness in this case, given that he is under a gag order, which prosecutors say he's repeatedly violated, and the gag order includes critical statements about witnesses, did that statement violate, potentially, the gag order? AMY LEE COPELAND, CRIMINAL DEFENSE &amp; APPELLATE ATTORNEY: Jim, just throw it on the pile if it did. There have been so many statements that the judge is going to consider tomorrow morning. This struck me as some of the stuff he said. This is a little bit more innocuous than most of his other statements, but he still shouldn't be talking about witnesses in the light of a gag order. It will be interesting what the judge decides to do tomorrow. Of course, he could fine the former president, but that doesn't seem to make much difference.

Trump did not want it out, particularly in an election campaign, particularly in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape. And therefore, he instructed his lawyer to pay off a stormy analyst so she didn't go public. And then prosecutors say that was, therefore, an attempt to influence the election, which, by the way, they say was part of a broader pattern of doing so with other stories that might have hurt him.",

You do have people that even the state said, you know, listen, he's -- Cohen has a mountain of baggage. But they seem to have corroborating evidence. We heard about the possibility of text messages. In fact, they asked David Pecker, the National Enquirer's editor at the time, for his cell phone number. So, there are probably going to be some text messages from him. There are other documents beyond just the bank documents. So I suspect they know what Cohen should say based on these documents, and I expect that he will testify in accordance with those documents.

Of course, you know, we're speculating about what the jury will actually do. Trump, as all defendants are, has an advantage here. He only needs one juror to hold out.

This isbecause those restrictions that were put in place by campus officials last week after the NYPD was called in to assist clearing out a similar encampment, that measure is still in place. However, working through the Columbia School of Journalism, we've been granted temporary access to show you what has been still a very impressive show right now of Palestinian support over my shoulder. This is being referred to as the Gaza Solidarity Encampment. An opportunity to visit here a couple of days ago, I can tell you it has considerably grown. The list of demands, you laid them out perfectly right now. They are steadfast in their persistent call on their university to divest funds from companies with Israeli connections. The question here, though, is certainly, when will Columbia school officials potentially reach out to the NYPD, or will they actually reach out to the NYPD for any potential removal? I can tell you this has been very peaceful in terms of the conversations that I've had with some of the people here and some of these people around this group. But the concern, especially in the last couple of days, especially from Jewish members of the community here, have expressed concern with university officials about simply not feeling safe on campus. Hence, the president of the university issued that statement late last night, calling on virtual classes, at least for now, until they do what she described as a reset moment. Now, what does that mean is yet to be seen. The broader picture here for viewers around the world, it's really important also to remember that this really provides a snapshot of what has been a galvanizing moment for universities throughout the country. We've seen it, certainly, also the potential there at Harvard and some measures that have taken place there overnight. Some news also coming out of Yale. So, this is certainly a moment for universities throughout the United States to grapple with how they would respond to protests and subsequent counter-protests. That really is perhaps one of the big messages right now. But it is still quite the moment here as we see this encampment continue to grow.
