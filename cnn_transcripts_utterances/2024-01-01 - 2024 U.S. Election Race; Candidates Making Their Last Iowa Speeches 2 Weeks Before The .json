John, he's really employed this all in on Iowa strategy, leaning hard on the critical evangelical voters in the state and racking up key endorsements like that of Governor Kim Reynolds. She was with him last night as well.He's also traveled to all of the state's 99 counties, but Governor DeSantis and the rest of the field, they still trail far behind front runner, Former President Donald Trump. Take a listen to what DeSantis's closing pitch to voters will sound like as we approach January 15th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  So, let's get it done. We have 2024 ahead of us. We hold the future in our hands. We have it within our power to put this country on a totally new trajectory. Donald Trump is running on his issues. Nikki Haley is running on her donors' issues.

Trump is way ahead of them in both.The question is, after those first two contests, is one clearly seen as the principal alternative to the front runner? I think the odds are in favor that Haley will do better in New Hampshire than DeSantis does in Iowa, and then she will be seen, kind of, in that -- you know, in that number two position.

But so far, we haven't seen evidence that there is anyone who's going to be able to steal this mantle from Trump. And we're going to see whether that happens, like Ron said, in Iowa for DeSantis and in New Hampshire for Nikki Haley. Now, we have seen her gain some traction, but like Ron said, it's going to have to come down to South Carolina. And that is only if she shows that she's able to push aside some of these other competitors in New Hampshire.

Democrats are really on the offense here. They're defending about two thirds of the seats that are up this cycle. To me, the big question here for Democrats is -- for Republicans is can they keep these problematic candidates like in Montana from winning primaries. Can they keep some of these picks that might be more attractive in a primary but not in a general election from winning?And there you look at Montana, that's the most unknown because you have a candidate there that the Republicans are really trying to clear the field for a Former U.S. Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. But Matt Rosendale, who is one of the freedom caucus members who -- one of the eight members who voted to oust McCarthy, who's agitating to run. Look, Republicans are doing a better job than they did in 2022, trying to nudge out some of these candidates early but Rosendale is making clear just recently that that's not about to happen, and he may actually run. So, Senator Daines, who does run the candidates arm of the party that tries to help candidates get elected is doing a much better job here. They're using a path to try and force Rosendale and send a message to him, hey, don't get this race. But in the end that that may not happen.

I mean, these are initiatives that the drug makers, Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, and Eli Lilly started introducing last year, capping the co- pays, basically the out-of-pocket costs for people who need insulin at $35. Now, you can do this through coupons or various mechanisms for the uninsured. It can be a little bit different, for people with commercial insurance. But basically, this is expected to be good news across the board. And more than 8 million people in the United States rely on insulin to live.And according to the American Diabetes Association, a quarter of those people say that at one point in time, they have had to ration insulin because of how expensive it is. And that can have severe health consequences. In addition to the $35 cap on what patients have to pay out of pocket, the drug companies, starting today, have also dramatically reduced the actual list price of the medications by as much as 70 percent. So, that's the actual price of the medication before insurance kicked in. And the reason they are doing that is this very complex system essentially that's ending up saving them money because of the way they pay rebates back to Medicaid.",
