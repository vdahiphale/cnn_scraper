Donald Trump sets his sights on New Hampshire after a landslide victory in Iowa. But can he do it again? We will hear from voters ahead of the state's primary. The U.S. carries out a third round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and says it won't hesitate to take further action. More in a live report. Plus, Donald Trump attends the first day of his civil defamation trial in New York, as his legal battles intertwine with his race for the White House. Good to have you with us. And we begin this hour in New Hampshire, where voters will go to the polls for the Republican presidential primary in just six days. And after his landslide victory in the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump is hoping another win will cement his position as the party's eventual nominee. The former president visited the Granite State after a brief appearance in a New York courtroom for jury selection in his defamation trial. In New Hampshire, he appeared at a rally with former GOP rival Vivek Ramaswamy who's now backing Trump. The Republican frontrunner focused his harshest attacks on his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They said there was an imminent threat from those launches and they took them out.Now, we have heard from the military as well that they believe that their first strike, this was back on Thursday into Friday overnight last week, they struck more than 60 targets but even then, they believe that they probably destroyed less than a third of the Houthis' military capabilities. So, that really just highlights how difficult it is for the U.S. and U.K. navies and those affiliated to be able to try and neutralize the threat of the Houthis continuing to target vessels in the Red Sea. And that was highlighted once again just a few hours after they targeted those Houthi rebel areas. They actually launched another missile which hit a ship. It did damage, but not enough to stop the ship, so they were able to continue. This was a Greek-owned, multi- flagged ship in the Red Sea. So, it really does point out and highlight just how difficult it is to be able to combat the Houthi rebels trying to target vessels in the Red Sea because their military capabilities are spread out in a large area that they control in Yemen.

He passed the IRA, one of the most significant pieces of legislation in history. It's made a difference already. His leadership globally has helped the United States come back from a place where the previous president pulled out of the agreement, didn't do anything, didn't put money in it. And now American leadership, I think, hope is being respected again on this topic. So, I think that we're behind globally in terms of what we need to do to meet the crisis of climate.

But he did not stay for opening statements when both sides laid out their theory of the case. E. Jean Carroll's lawyers argued that Trump unleashed his followers on her and that she lives in fear and should be entitled to significant damages. Now, Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, said in fact, Carroll's career has prospered since she made these allegations against former President Trump. Now Trump is expected to attend some parts of this case. He is expected back in court on Wednesday. On Thursday, his mother-in-law's funeral is being held. He's not expected to attend court on that day. No court on Friday. And then it's possible Trump could testify next week. But the judge has put some restrictions on what Trump would be able to say if he testifies. They are not relitigating. Allegations of rape and sexual abuse. So he's also not allowed to attack Carroll. The allegations of what happened at a department store in the mid-90s, those were litigated in a trial last spring that Trump did not participate in at all. He chose not to attend. He chose not to testify. And again, he's not required to be at this next phase of the defamation case.

In this next phase she is seeking $10 million in damages and this is the only job that the jury has to hear from witnesses and assess how much she is entitled to in terms of damages.
