The reason they didn't want to was that they were concerned about opening, essentially, a third front in the war. Obviously, Gaza's one; increasingly Lebanon and that -- the Hezbollah attacks there are second. And here they wanted to do something that would basically quiet this problem. And of course it's the Red Sea problem that is going to most affect consumer prices. It's the Red Sea problem that's going to most affect whether shipping resumes.

Are they going to be launching cruise missiles and ballistic missiles against the targets in the Red Sea? And will they also try to go after targets in Saudi Arabia or even Israel as a result of this? And will others join them? Will the Iranians show their hand? I don't think they will at this point in time, but it's definitely something to watch. And will other Iranian proxies also join in this? Those Iranian proxies extending all the way from Iraq to Lebanon to Gaza, they could potentially do something.

And there there were a barrage of 21 missiles and drones that came in the direction of American forces. But I think the president is going to be able to establish a pretty good case for why he took these out on the ground. The fact of the matter is, the lesson we learned from dealing with the Somali pirates and the other cases is you have to actually get at their onshore facilities. And I think the question that Cedric raised, correctly, is have they gotten enough of those now to really hobble the ability of the Houthis to come back? And then there's the bigger question of Iran, which is, you know, obviously that we are not striking inside Iran, but it's Iran that is at least coordinating, if not controlling these groups.",
