We do begin once more in Winder, Georgia, where the father of the 14- year-old suspected of killing four people at his high school is now under arrest. Colin Gray is charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of second-degree murder. Police say he bought his son, Colt, the weapon that was used in the school shooting, an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, for Christmas last year. A gun for Christmas, given just months after the teen was investigated by police in connection with a threat to commit a school shooting that was posted on an online forum. As part of that investigation, police spoke with Colin Gray about his son's access to firearms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, first of all, Georgia has very weak gun laws. It's my understanding that in Georgia, you have to be at least 18 years old to purchase a weapon like that.So, the father buying the gun, if something would have had to have happened, if he was the one that was going to purchase it, the boy wasn't old enough to do it. But it's just common sense, in my opinion, that you've got young people in your home. And even though, in Georgia, it's not illegal to properly secure it, especially after you've been given a warning. I mean, at some point in time, we just have to be logical about what should have taken place under these particular circumstances. Why would you have an assault rifle or any other weapon that was accessible to an individual after you learned that there were threats being made, even though you may not believe that those threats were true? You're around this kid every day. It's hard to believe that you had no indication at all that there was something, that the kid had some issues that needed to be addressed. Now, I may be wrong on that, but personally, I'm glad to see that the father was charged, because I think it sends the right message. Parents do have some responsibility for their children, and they need to take it seriously. And if there are guns in the house, make sure you take steps to keep the guns out of the hands of the kids, even -- even to prevent an accidental shooting between siblings or anyone else. I mean, you know, I've been a policeman a long time, and I know a lot's been made of this fact that this kid is 14 years old. When you deal with crime on the streets of the cities, 14-year-old is not all that unusual for him to be involved in very violent crimes. Here in Philly, we've got a crew that was responsible for numerous carjackings. One of those children was believed to be as young as 10 years old. I mean, this is the kind of stuff that happens every single day. The only time we talk about it in the media is when it's something high profile, like a school shooting. We have got to get serious about dealing with the issue of parental responsibility.",

I mean, if you've got kids in your home, if you have an adult in your home who is showing signs that they're mentally unstable, or have other types of issues secure the weapon. Secure the weapon. As far as schools go, we can't look for Congress to do much of anything when it comes to passing any kind of meaningful legislation. But at least fund all schools to a point where they can get the kind of security in their schools to help keep themselves safe. I mean, they had security in that school. Had it not been for the school resource officers, had it not been for the fact that they were able to lock the doors remotely, we would have had a higher body count than we're talking about right now. So, this stuff does matter. And I think there are ways in which we can better secure and protect our kids beyond just passing laws. Although that's necessary, too.
