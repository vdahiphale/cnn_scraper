That's according to the humanitarian organization where she has worked. The two were reportedly abducted on Thursday. The nurse, Alix Dorsainvil, is shown here in video from the organization. She's married to the head of the group. The U.S. State Department is working with Haitian authorities to try and free the woman and her child.Let's bring CNN's Paula Newton.

And what this usually means is that a lot of those charities or schools operate within a compound. This was close to the capital, Port-au-Prince, and it says they were directly abducted from there.We also -- CNN did receive a statement from the U.S. State Department saying that they were aware of these objections and stating again that they have obviously front and center to try and get them to safety and are working with local agencies. But, Laila, as you know so well, the situation in Haiti continues to be quite grave. It was just in the last week that we had the U.S. say to Americans that it was time to leave urgently and that the situation was becoming too volatile. For many months now, Haitians themselves, all over the country, but especially in Port-au-Prince, have been putting up with the threat of abduction, of kidnapping, as well as absolute lawlessness and violence. It definitely comes at a difficult time for Haiti. And in these situations, Laila, I want to point out that some people are released very quickly. Sometimes a ransom is paid. Sometimes it is not. What is very important right now is that this group and, of course, the authorities trying to help them determine who exactly kidnapped this nurse and her child and why, and that will speed along negotiations As I said, each the situation seems to be different. And whether or not this can be resolved in the coming hours is something that many authorities on the ground and here in the United States are already looking at quite closely. Laila?",

The problem is those gangs and those rival territories have now blocked all arteries in terms of transportation really from one end of the country to the other. And this really seems to hamper so much of what's going on in Haiti and really does complicate and compromise people's livelihoods. The other thing, though, that people have been talking about is a vigilante. Kind of -- it's been inspired by certain people in Port-au- Prince who have decided to take matters into their own hands. They have tried to combat some of those kidnappings we have been talking about with mixed results. There is no way CNN can verify what has been going on, on the ground there. Others that we spoke to believe that these kinds of vigilante uprisings just make things all the more precarious for people on the ground there. But as I said, after for so many months of people wanting to know whether or not a force would actually go into Haiti and what the agreement might be, we do hopefully have some movement on the ground there, something that will be welcomed by many in Haiti, perhaps not all, but certainly good news at least that Haiti is again front and center for the international community.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We are here in New York's Washington Square Park. This is the heart of New York University's campus. And we are dealing right now with a real temperature of 91 degrees. But it feels like temperature approaching 98 degrees. Take a look around this park, though. You would not know from the number of people out and about here that we are approaching the heat index of 100 degrees, but this is one of the areas New Yorkers come to cool off. We talked this week about the urban heat island effect, and that is cities and parts of cities with a lot of concrete, a lot of asphalt, not a lot of water sources, trees or grass, those areas can reach a temperature, or feels like temperature 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the area. This is not one of those areas. A lot of what we have seen throughout the course of the day have been getting in and out of that fountain, looking to cool off and doing a number of other things to make sure they can beat the heat.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  A mother and her young daughter attempt to cross the Rio Grande in broad daylight. Orange buoys four feet in diameter and anchored to the riverbed, as well as concertina wire, stop them at the Eagle Pass border in Texas.

What we have seen is that people have gotten hurt with the razor wire, he says, adding that they're thinking twice before taking any risk. But his wife says the family fled Venezuela for reasons that are much more compelling than floating barriers, including crime, extortion and living under a dictatorship. Others say barriers are not. Returning home is not an option. This migrant father, traveling with his wife and young son says the buoys and razor wire are indeed going to make it more difficult to cross.

And if you were sitting around in Gothenburg, in Sweden or maybe Glasgow, in Scotland, in the depths of winter, then you're going to be wanting to book ahead.However, I think the cumulative impact of these stories and the fact that we've seen families fleeing for their lives with whatever possessions they can grab will make people think maybe it is time to look at cooler temperatures. The obvious places are actually destinations, which Northern Europeans typically went to before the jet age started. So, we're talking here about the coast of Northern France and Belgium, the Netherlands, the Baltic and North Sea coasts of Germany, and in particular, and I think this is where we could see quite a lot of growth, the coast of Poland. There are some lovely resorts there. It's much cooler than the Mediterranean, but still warm enough for most people in the height of summer.

Russian and German scientists say these frisky fellows were dug up in a deep dormant state from 40 meters, about 130 feet below the ice. And after for 46 millennia, just a few drops of water brought them back to life. It's called cryptobiosis.And some plants, viruses and even animals are known to be able to survive in a state between life and death for incredible periods of time. And these worms are a living example. Dr. Teymuras Kurzchalia is a professor emeritus at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics and was closely involved in the research, and he joins us now from Berlin. Professor, so good to have you with us. So intriguing, so many questions. Why revive a worm that has been frozen for 46,000 years?",

But to answer the second part of your question, in the meantime, I don't see any practical -- let's say, I don't know. There're no practical reasons to do this. But I may say that, no, not any important discovery has practical, let's say, consequences very fast. For instance, in 50s, when people discovered the structure of DNA, was it practical? No. Only in 20, 25 years you get this practical attitude. So, therefore, I hear also saying that practical understanding and the consequences will come later.",
