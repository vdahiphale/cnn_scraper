Rare footage of them still inside Russia's Kursk region where British Storm Shadow missiles were claimed to have hit Wednesday. These fragments found by locals. Just hours earlier, American supplied ATACMS missiles also plowed into Russia marking a stark new escalation in the war. Yet it was also in Kyiv that fear grew. The U.S. embassy closing here for the first time since the invasion, citing a threat of air attack. It's a reflection of the heightened tension here felt in the capital Kyiv. It's been under regular bombardment for over two months, but other European allied embassies are also limiting their function today. Perhaps a sense across NATO here that we're entering a new chapter of this conflict.

Anya's father died of his injuries three weeks ago after five months in a coma. She is raw from both the talk of peace and fear of sirens.

A detailed and fake warning of wide scale attacks.This situation should be interpreted, he says, as Russia's attempt to use any elements of psychological influence. They have one instrument, which is to scare. This has always been a classic element of Russian politics, so I'd like our partners to be more careful as to the information coming from Russia. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on-camera): Now being no doubt while the misinformation that the Ukrainian government highlighted fake warnings essentially may have contributed to anxieties today amongst some people in the capital. We don't really know the information behind the U.S. embassy's warning. There is still a severe threat to the Ukrainian capital. There has been since the start of the war, intensifying in the past months. I think there is a concern amongst Ukrainians potentially, and their allies, too, that this escalatory move by the West, American and British missiles, it seems being fired into Russia now by Ukrainians may see some kind of Russian response in the weeks ahead.

Kennedy, Jr. as the chief, you know, the head of HHS, and in effect, the person who will be running the health agencies of the federal government.And this is a test on all of these fronts. I mean, how far are they willing to go? Obviously, a new president gets deference especially from his own party. I believe it's basically been a century since a Senate controlled by the president's own party formally voted down one of his cabinet nominees.

Why was Tulsi Gabbard chosen? Why was Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. chosen? Even Pete Hegseth at the Defense Department? These are all agencies that Trump wants, whose independence and traditions Trump wants to break. Either because he views them as places that have been unfair to him in the past or because he views them as critical to his designs going forward and his language during the campaign about taking on the, quote, \"enemies from within.\"I mean, they are all designed to break the culture of those institutions, to break the independence they have traditionally had from simply executing a president's will. You know, under any circumstances. And so, again, like for Senate -- I mean, I think in all of these cases, Senate Republicans are being asked to do something they could not have imagined ever being asked to do. The vast majority of them will do it. The question will be, assuming David McCormick wins the recount in Pennsylvania, it's a 53-seat majority, are there four who will not? I did note that today there was one of those more moderate, relatively more centrist Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who said he would consider it inappropriate to try to have recess appointments at the cabinet level, maybe sub-cabinet level, he said. But for cabinet, he thought they should have to go through the normal advise and consent confirmation process. We'll see how hardball Trump wants to get because, as you know, there's a constitutional argument where if the House goes along with him trying to recess the Congress and the Senate doesn't, he, by some readings of the Constitution, has the authority to do so himself, which would allow him to push through some of these. you know, clearly controversial and by most conventional metrics unqualified appointees.",

Payne's former One Direction bandmates -- Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson -- all attended the service. One Direction became the first group to have its first four albums debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The 31-year-old singer died last month after falling from a third- floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Officials say Payne had alcohol, cocaine, and a prescription antidepressant in his system at the time of his death. We're going to take a short break. We'll be back in just a moment.

This proposed legislation would effectively ban kids under the age of 16 from accessing some social media platforms, But there are still lots of questions to be answered in terms of how it's going to be regulated, how it's going to be passed. But what we do know from today's Parliament session is that this proposal, essentially, would be a blanket ban. There would be no exemptions, meaning kids who receive parental consent still can't create accounts. And for those who already have accounts, those will be disactivated. Now, the Australian government has also proposed fining these tech companies up to 32.5 million U.S. dollars, if they don't respect the new rules. But kids and parents, on the other hand, who do violate the new rules won't be penalized. Now, we also know that these tech companies have about 12 months before this legislation becomes law to effectively remove under-16- year-olds from their apps. Now Lynda, this proposed legislation is politically quite popular. It's received bipartisan support. And it also comes after several high-profile cases where kids actually ended their own lives, because, their parents say, they were bullied online. So, for those parents and for supporters of this bill, these regulations are a long time coming. They think the Internet could now be a safe place for these kids. And these rules could essentially prevent kids from accessing some of the bad content that is, at times, allowed to fester online. But of course, this bill isn't without its own problems. Critics argue that, actually, it would reduce digital literacy for children, especially at a time when technology is in practically everything that we do. They also argue that social media isn't all bad, that at times kids can find better communities online, as they can connect with more people from different backgrounds and find these safe spaces. Of course, also, Lynda, there's the technical aspect of it, as well, because to verify each Australian's age on these social media platforms is a monumental task. There's also security concerns because, for instance, if these apps now have to ask users for their personal identification documents and, for instance, if that's stored online and that security is breached, those are huge, huge risks for the entire country and for its citizens. So, Lynda, lots of questions that still need to be answered. Lots of really debate around this, as well. But the next step for this legislation is for it to go through the Senate, where it will be deliberated further -- Lynda.",
