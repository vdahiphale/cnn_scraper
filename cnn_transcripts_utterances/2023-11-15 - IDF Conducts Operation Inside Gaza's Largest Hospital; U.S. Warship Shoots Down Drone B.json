It wasn't us.And then today in court, attorneys for another defendant, Misty Hampton, said actually, we are the ones that leaked this information. We believe the public had a right to see this. So, the judge, understandably, has here issued a protective order to prevent the leak of additional, sensitive information. Now, several media organizations, including CNN, are opposed to this kind of protective order, believing there's a public interest in seeing evidence like this. But the judge notes that, look, there are some things that are jury will never see. There is a reason for that. For the protective order is going to stand.

And for Ron DeSantis to say all the support of things that he said about Donald Trump, including, remember, both of them raised their hands on the stage in the first debate and said they would support him even if he is a convicted felon. George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, they are rolling in their graves. If they knew that anyone would have the audacity as a felon, which Donald Trump will become this spring, to run for president? And that other people running for the office would be willing to support someone like that? They would have added you can't be a convicted felon to age 35 and natural born American citizen as requirements for the presidency. And to say that you could be the rightful heir of the legacy of Washington and Adams and Lincoln and FDR? As someone will say I will support a convicted felon, that gives me grave concerns, Jake, about their judgment, and whether it is just nothing more and craven politics. And by the way, one last thing, you can't beat him unless you try to beat him. I mean, they are continuing to come up to the guy. He's up by 30 points. So, I am trying to beat him.
