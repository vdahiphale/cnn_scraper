The D.A.'s office is going forward. They're using a law, a section of the New York criminal law that basically says if you haven't been in the state, they can extend the statute of limitations. It has been used before recently in the Harvey Weinstein case. Do you think this is a stretch by the D.A. or a good strategy?",

And the reason is, what you said, Trump left the State of New York. So, the statute of limitations has told or paused. He moved near me, in Palm Beach County, although I live on the other side of the bridge.But you can't move out of the state and still claim, A, statute of limitations has expired. No pause. And also, there's another reason, Governor Cuomo signed into law another measure that pauses the statute of limitations because of COVID. So, Donald Trump may have some good arguments in defense of this action in New York, but I don't think a statute of limitations is one of them.",

Also, when it comes to trying to get grand jury materials, that's secretive. It's against the law to get it. So, I think maybe if they ever do depose Mark Pomerantz, they won't get what they want.

This federal appeals court could say, like you said, as early as today, whether or not it's going to freeze that controversial lower court opinion. Keep in mind, that lower court opinion blocked, as you said, the government's approval of the drug. It's set to go into effect on Friday unless a court intervenes.And the Biden ministrations here is really reeling from that opinion because millions of women have used that drug since it was allowed to go into effect some 20 years ago. And meanwhile, the opponents here who are doctors who oppose abortion, they filed briefs last night at midnight saying that that opinion should be allowed to go into effect. The appeals court should stay out. And we are hearing from other voices, for instance, doctors they filed briefs in this case, saying how safe it is. And outside of court, John, you're hearing from drug companies. And drug companies are very worried about that opinion because they're worried that it's going to affect all sorts of other job -- drugs. They're worried that this will destabilize the regulation of those drugs too. So, all eyes now on this appeals court, which could rule as early as today.",

The infection is called blastomycosis and it's caused by a fungus, most often found in moist soil and decomposing what it leaves. Infections like this, though, are also quite rare. Normally, there are only one or two cases per every 100,000 Americans per year.So, how can you get it? Well, by breathing in the fungus' microscopic spores, and symptoms may set in weeks or even months later. The symptoms can include fever, cough, chest pains and trouble breathing. And if the infection spreads from the lungs to other organs, it can then become more severe and even life threatening. So, what happened here at this plant and why are so many people there getting sick? Joining me now is Gerald Kell, he's the president of the United Steel Workers Local 21, the union that represents hundreds of workers at this paper mill. Gerald, thank you for coming in. As you and I were just talking really quickly in the break, there are so many unknowns still which is why it's so scary. But first and foremost, how are people doing? GERALD KELL, UNION PRESIDENT FOR 670 WORKERS AT PAPER MILL WITH FUNGAL OUTBREAK AND PRESIDENT, UNITED STEEL WORKERS LOCAL 21 UNION:  You know, people are banding together. We -- we're showing our solidarity by supporting each other. We have several members that are still off of work. They're still ill. Many of them have a long road ahead of them.
