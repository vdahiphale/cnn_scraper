Since 92-year-old Rupert Murdoch stepped aside last week as chairman of the Fox Corporation and New Corps. For decades, he had presided over a massive empire of television, newspapers and tabloids. But attracting most of the attention was the far- right Fox News, which he created nearly 27 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUPERT MURDOCH, CHAIRMAN, FOX AND NEWS CORP.

It made him a ton of money, but he didn't run it. He couldn't get his way in it. He detested a number of anchors like Mr. Hannity, who he described as retarded. He, in the end, grew to loathe the way Fox News had become the publishing arm of Donald Trump and the Trump White House. He couldn't stomach the prospects of Mr. Trump returning to the White House again, yet there was very little he seemed to be able to do about it. He had allowed the creation of a Frankenstein monster in Fox News that he could no longer control. Because that monster had created another monster. That monster is the audience of Fox News, which is basically the cult of Donald Trump. And the moment you try to stop feeding the cult, for example, he wanted the station to get behind Ron DeSantis, Florida governor, he was to be the new Republican great hope, the audience wouldn't allow it. The audience collapsed every time DeSantis was on. DeSantis' campaign has gone nowhere. It's basically crashed and burned. And in the end, Rupert Murdoch, the great creator of populous journalism, became the hostage of populous journalism in the shape of the Fox News audience, and that's where we are today and that's one of the reasons why he's stepping back.",

He should be treated like any other candidate and not like a celebrity, not like a star. He should be subject to the most rigorous examination and fact checking. He should be dealt with strongly. He should be questioned at every turn. He should not be given air time just for the sake of it. He shouldn't be given the oxygen of publicity just because the ratings will peak up.

So, it talks about somebody coming to an awakening. The gospel of Jesus -- Christianity can be very misused. I cringe at what Christianity does when you have someone like ex-attorney general, Jeff Sessions, quote Romans 13, an apostle of St. Paul to justify the separation of children from their parents at the border. Saying, that if something is legal, then it's of God, it has the authority of God. These parents are breaking the law by being illegal and so, we are justified in separating them from their children. They brought it on themselves. And they actually tried to use the divine authority to justify what they're doing. We got to get Christianity right. It's about justice. It's about that everybody should have a chance at a decent life and not using it to hurt people, to put people down, to exclude people, to vilify people.",

Let me just play what William Barr has said about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  We will be proposing legislation providing that in cases of mass murder or in cases of murder of a law enforcement officer, there will be a strict timetable for judicial proceedings that will allow the imposition of the death sentence without undue delay. Punishment must be swift. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In the actual practice of who has been executed and who is sitting on death row, it's always poor people and almost always people who have killed white people. They're not going to do the federal death penalty any better than they're doing it in the States. And while he may think and the attorney general might think just by doing a feat, we're going unleash now all these executions. I've been talking to federal defense attorneys who are going to be working might and main to delay, throw monkey wrenches in that machinery of death, delay it and possibly forestall it all the way through.",

And I said to the pope in theletter, when it's all males making all these decisions, it's not healthy. How are we going to have a healthy church if we don't take seriously that when women are baptized, they are baptized in the image of Christ just like a man. That you can't rely on an accident of biology as to whether or not you can fully image Christ. And it was to move that dialogue along with women just as we have done on the death penalty. So, dialogue takes a long, long time. But when you have been a witness to something as I have with the death penalty, you could bring people there and keep the dialogue going, to wake up the people, first and foremost, but it's the same thing with women in the church, any moral issue that has to do with the inherent dignity of people and treating them with that dignity. So, I knew I was going to be one part of the dialogue by having this letter to the pope. But you have to keep them -- when you love, like I love the Catholic church, you keep the dialogue coming. I love my country. So, I keep the dialogue coming about why we shouldn't take people and strap them down and kill them. When you love people, you stay at the table and you keep talking.",
