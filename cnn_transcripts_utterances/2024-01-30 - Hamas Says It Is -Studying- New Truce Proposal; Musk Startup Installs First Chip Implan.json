But we're -- what we're hearing is that progress has been made in the past few days, notably after that meeting in Paris with the CIA director, his Egyptian and Israeli counterparts, and the Qatari Prime Minister. That took place on Sunday.And so, what we've been told by officials and sources is that there is a broad framework with a general understanding of how another truce, another pause in the fighting, and a -- and a hostage release could take place with warnings at the same time, that there are a lot of details that need to be ironed out. A lot of work needs to be done to get this across the finish line. But what this generally would look like is that there would be a first phase of around six weeks of a pause in the fighting, during which time, some of the -- all of the civilian hostages who remain in Gaza would be released. At the same time, three Palestinian prisoners held by Israel would be released for every civilian hostage. Then, we would move on to another phase. So, that pause in the fighting could be extended. The IDF soldiers, both men and women, they could be released in that pause as well as the bodies of hostages who had been killed since October 7, or some of the bodies who were taken into Gaza on October 7. Now, there are questions about how many Palestinian prisoners Hamas would demand to be released for those IDF soldiers who in Hamas's mind are much more valuable. There are indications that Hamas would want a huge number of Palestinian prisoners to be released. But, John, there are still major questions about humanitarian aid that would go in, governance of Palestinians, the security setup in Gaza, and longer-term questions. But for now, John, there -- it does seem to be momentum. There are those words of caution. But there are -- that there is a lot of optimism. I asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken about this yesterday. He said there is some real hope going forward, John.",

They said today that they are studying it.But this is where there is a fundamental disagreement, John. Hamas wants to see a comprehensive deal to end the war. Israel is not yet agreeing to that. What we heard from Hamas in their statement is they want the brutal attack on Gaza to end. Those are their words. And the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces. We also have to see what the Israeli positioning would be during a pause. Last time, they stayed in Gaza but pulled back a little bit. Here, you've got Hamas demanding that they leave. So, there are still sticking points. The other parties who met in Paris now awaiting a response from Hamas, John.",

It was a change of classes right then, so we went into the math class, and he got the backpack that we knew had a gun in it now. And he took that backpack back into -- give it to Ethan.

There are now several companies that are racing to develop similar brain implants. And the goal is really to help people who are paralyzed to give them back a little bit of independence that they've maybe lost. You know, being able to control a computer or send an e-mail or a text to a friend or colleague. I mean, these are things that most of us take advantage of every day that people who have lost the use of their limbs are not able to do this. So, as you mentioned, yes, there are other players in this space now. There's one company in New York-based Syncron that has implanted a couple of its devices in patients with ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, who are paralyzed. And their grand plan is a little bit different. It's a stent-like implant that actually goes into the jugular vein. And so, there's no actual brain surgery required. It's threaded up through the jugular vein and sets -- It sets against the brain. But what's different here is, you know, Neuralink is -- it's a Musk company, right?",
