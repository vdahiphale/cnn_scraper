      "sentences": "President Joe Biden appeared to sign off on congressional leaders new funding agreements Sunday sayingin the statement that it moves the country one step closer to preventing a government shutdown, but real questions remain whether lawmakers will be able to pass pieces of legislation before January 19th, which is that first fund deadline. Now, this agreement was struck by House Speaker, Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The two men agree on a 1.59 trillion top line spending level. That includes about 886 billion for defense spending and $704 billion for non-defense spending. There is also an additional $70 billion that could be allocated to non- defense spending. That was part of a side deal struck by President Biden and then House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy last spring. These overall figures track very closely to the agreement that had been reached when they came to that debt limit deal last year, a deal that wrinkled a lot of House Republicans and already there has been some opposition expressed to this latest deal that was struck by congressional leaders, the House Freedom Caucus, expressing frustration with the figures that are included, that it does not include more spending cuts. They said in a post that it was, quote, \"a total failure.\" There`s also real questions about whether lawmakers will be able to have the time to write these pieces of legislation, allocate all the funding and actually get these bills passed with that first deadline coming up on January 19th and a second deadline on February 2nd. The supplemental request is still up for debate right now up in the Senate and in the House. Senate negotiators have been working to try to see if they can reach an agreement on border policy changes. That is something that people have been stressing for before they pass aid for Israel and Ukraine. Now, these are two issues are running on separate tracks, but then really speaks to some of the hurdles and the challenges facing lawmakers in the coming weeks, as they are trying to avert that first deadline by January 19th.

Answer is Yale, with a total of 18 championships, according to the NCAA. But their last title was way back in 1927. All right, today is the first day of CES or the Consumer Electronic Show, the largest consumer tech conference of the year where companies get to show off their new gadgets and technologies, right? Well, this year`s show is expected to be all about Artificial Intelligence. Last year on CNN 10, we talked about how AI could impact things like jobs and elections. And now we`re going to look at what it could mean for fashion. That`s right. A team of Hong Kong researchers are developing something called intelligent clothing. Imagine being able to change the color of your shirt with a flick of a wrist. These researchers believe their textiles will help the fashion industry reduce the growing global problem of clothing waste. CNN`s Kristie Lu Stout has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
