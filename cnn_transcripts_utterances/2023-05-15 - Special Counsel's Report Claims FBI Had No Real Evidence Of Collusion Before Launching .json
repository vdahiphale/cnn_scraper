We have Vanessa Yurkevich, Danny Freeman, Omar Jimenez, and Jessica Dean. Also joining us, especially parachuting in for this, is Evan Perez. Evan, thanks so much for being here.Okay, Special Counsel John Durham released his final report tonight, more than 300 pages concluding that the FBI should never have launched a full investigation into connections between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, but no recommendations for any new charges or wholesale changes in how the FBI handles politically- charged investigations. So, Jessica is here with that story but also, as we said, Evan Perez is joining us from Washington. Okay, Evan, just walk us through the bottom line of this report.",

      "sentences": "Well, the bottom line, after four years, Alisyn, this is all we got from John Durham. There's a lot less here than certainly Donald Trump was promising us. For many months, remember, he was out there saying Durham is coming, and he was expecting people to go to prison. And, as you pointed out, Durham does not make any new prosecutions at the end of this report.But, you know, he did find a lot of mistakes by the FBI in the way they conducted this investigation back in 2016, and he believes that a lot of it has to do with confirmation bias, not political bias. Again, a finding that I think the former president would not be very happy with. I will read you just a part of what the report says. It says that based on the review of Crossfire Hurricane and related intelligence activities, we conclude that the Justice Department and FBI failed to uphold their important mission of strict fidelity to the law in connection with certain events and activities described in this report. It goes on -- he goes on to say that, you know, the FBI discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia. A lot of criticism, again, for the FBI, but I'll just, you know, throw some numbers at you. Six million pages is what he said he went through -- there were 480 interviews, 190 grand jury subpoenas. He spent a lot of time on this investigation and there is not much to show for it.",

One of them has to do with Lisa Page who was a former FBI lawyer and Peter Strzok who was leading counterintelligence activities there at the FBI. In the Durham port, he says that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were directly involved in matters relating to opening Crossfire Hurricane.And then, of course, if you compare that to what the Horowitz report says, he says that Lisa Page attended some of the discussions regarding opening of this investigation. She did not play a role in the decision to open Crossfire Hurricane or the four individual investigations. These two became certainly a fixation for the former president, for Republicans, because they were having an affair and a lot the text messages came out in the middle of the Mueller investigation and was used really to discredit the work that was being done to investigate these very, very suspicious ties between people associated with Trump and, of course, the Russians. And so, that is one reason why, you know, highlighting that difference of opinion there, these two investigative teams, Alisyn, looked at all of the same things and they came away with completely different conclusions.",

He had a lower profile in the past few years than perhaps Lori Lightfoot, right, in Chicago. Also, that's not an incumbent at risk of losing their job as well. However, I do think that whoever becomes mayor of this group, especially if it's one of those five of top right there, I think you will hear their names a lot more after tomorrow because there is a lot of different directions the city could go based on a lot of these candidates. There is some intense progressive change of folks. There are some folks who are very intent on holding the past administration accountable for some of the actions in policing, some of the actions in crime.

In particular, one part of this lawsuit says that he explicitly has acknowledged that the racist, antisemitic, and violence promoting material he encountered on social media caused his radicalization, motivated him to commit racial violence, and provided the training, equipment, and expertise to plan and implement the massacre on May 14, 2022. Part of all this and really the crux of their argument is that, look, this content doesn't just exist on social media. It is part of an algorithm in many cases. The lawsuit alleges that some of these things were promoted and/or reacting to his engagement to show him more of that.

To get the stuff to through Senate is a logistical issue. He said that they need a deal in hand by this week to make it to the June 1 deadline.That is Monday night. They are meeting tomorrow. That's just not that much time. It is not to say it can't get done, but it is asking a lot, and they are still pretty far apart. One more thing, I think, that's worth remembering is that Kevin McCarthy has a very small margin in the House, four votes.

The GOP -- it was a GOP-led effort that passed the democratic-controlled Senate, and President Biden let it happen.
