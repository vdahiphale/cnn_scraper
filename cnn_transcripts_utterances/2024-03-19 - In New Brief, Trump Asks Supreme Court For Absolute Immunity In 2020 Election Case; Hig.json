      "sentences": "Tonight on 360, breaking news, in a stunning brief to the Supreme Court, the former president asked to be put beyond the reach of the law for January 6th and his actions leading up to it.Also tonight, good news on crime. New data showing something you wouldn't know from the headlines, violent crime down across the country and murder down sharply. Plus more twists in the royal photo flap. A new video appears and an old photo was likely doctored, more questions about what is going on with the Royals. Good evening. Thanks for joining us today. The former president of the United States asked the Supreme Court for absolute immunity from charges connected to his attempt to overturn the election he lost. Not granting him that he warned would be \"the end of the presidency as we know it.\" Continuing from his brief: \"As the recent history of impeachment demonstrates, once our Nation crosses this Rubicon, every future president will face de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and will be harassed by politically motivated prosecution after leaving office, over his most sensitive and controversial decisions.\" Now we should point out here that this has never happened to a former president before this one and there's no evidence that's happening now to him. Yet that dubious idea, which a lower court unanimously rejected, is now central to a sweeping invitation for the court to set precedent for generations to come, a call for overturning the common sense notion that no president is beyond accountability. Something the founders certainly believed and two centuries later, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell gave as his reason for not holding the former president accountable after January 6th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one.

I'll read you just a part of what the Trump lawyers say in this filing.They say, \"A former president enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts. Criminal immunity arises directly from the Executive Vesting Clause and the separation of powers.\" They go on to say that the Impeachment Judgment Clause reflects the Founders' understanding that only a President 'convicted' by the Senate after impeachment could be criminally prosecuted.\" Of course, obviously, Anderson, that is referring directly to that episode that you just played from Mitch McConnell, which is during the impeachment proceeding, the Trump lawyers argued that you could leave it for the criminal justice system to take care of this issue that the president was being accused of. And of course, now they're arguing the opposite. They're saying that first you have to be impeached and convicted by the Senate before you can actually take any kind of criminal action against the former president. This argument also, Anderson, is designed also to remind Brett Kavanaugh of some of his own writings. They point out that in the past he has pointed out that a president who was concerned with being criminally prosecuted is inevitably going to do a worse job.

We know this is a former president who has talked repeatedly in private about being unhappy with the Supreme Court justices who he appointed because they haven't sided with him in his election lies previously.Brett Kavanaugh is somebody who came under a lot of scrutiny and a lot of attack during his confirmation process. And I don't think that that's a coincidence that they're using this. But look, they are looking toward oral argument and they are looking toward how the justices are going to respond to it. And it is not especially concerning to them that, as Evan noted, they are taking contradictory positions. In one filing they say, well, he wasn't impeached. And then in another they say, well, the criminal justice - during impeachment, they said the criminal justice system is where this should be dealt with. I just - I don't think we can underscore enough how consequential Mitch McConnell's speech was that day, not because he was so hard on Trump, but because of what he chose not to do, which was not to vote to convict and not to whip other Republicans to do the same.",

He can't really make a more nuanced argument about, well, all of these things I did were part of my official duties as president and therefore I should be protected in the way that he could if he say ordered a drone strike and some DA somewhere tried to prosecute him or something.What he did, he did as a candidate for his own personal benefit and his political benefit, not for his job as a president in the country. And that's why he has to go big on this argument for absolute immunity. And he has to raise the specter of, oh, if you do this, everyone's going to be prosecuted after this. Well, no one has been prosecuted before in the history of our country. No one who lives within the bounds of the law while their president will be prosecuted again. This is really about his actions and because those actions are outside of any reasonable scope of what the president is supposed to be doing, I think the court will have to set a standard that is below absolute immunity for sure.",

And the only way he would ever be left out of power is if he failed at his illegal action. If he succeeded, of course, he'd just stay in power at that point.So the logical conclusion of this is, I mean, I don't think there's a chance in the world the Supreme Court finds in favor of Trump. But the other thing I ask is like, let's do what I literally just thought of and created the Biden test, okay? So if you - if Joe Biden could do what Donald Trump is saying he wants to do, would that side believe that immunity would exist. For instance, when they argued that a president could, in theory, have SEAL Team Six go after his political rival, they say Joe Biden could do that. Well, of course, they'd say no to that. And so everybody has to be held to the same standard. If the Biden test doesn't pass and there's no way that the - that Trump should be able to get away with what he tried and did.",

The indictment is taken as these are the facts we're working with and they have the law, the Constitution as they're going to evaluate this immunity argument up against the Constitution. So the lower courts can't do anything more than they can do, in other words. So there's no need to send it back for anything other than the trial itself and that's what his argument is missing.

I don't see how the presidency and frankly how democracy can continue if you have a bad actor in place that literally can get away with anything so long as he or she has the title of president in front of their name.And so this is a very important thing for the Supreme Court to take up. It may be why they decided to take this up after the after the appellate court, but they're going to have to make their stamp and hopefully it comes out 9-0, potentially 8-1.

And this is something that really has emerged in the final days of this race. Gov. DeWine has been urging, in fact, imploring Republicans to look at the policy differences specifically on things like Ukraine, on funding for Ukraine. Ohio has a very large Ukrainian population and this was once a central issue. Now, in this MAGA movement, if you will, the funding for Ukraine is very much uncertain. So the policy differences here also are so stark. Is Ohio going to completely change in the way of the Trump-era like J.D.

You have police stopping - making arrests in certain cases. You've got defund the police. You have a lot of things coming together, and almost a perfect storm that we saw a surge in crime in those two years. Then when you look at 2022, 2023, you see some of those cities have refunded police, rehired officers. The court backlogs are now kind of back to normal. You see some of the laws that were sweeping have been adjusted and fixed so that the criminal justice system works smoother. And you see that crime goes flat, and now we see it starting to go down again.

But now a study presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association says the opposite. That an 8-hour window for eating and 16 hours not eating is not just bad, that it could actually increase risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 91 percent.And if you already have cardiovascular disease, your risk of dying from heart disease and stroke increases by 66 percent. The question is, is that actually true? Joining me now is CNN Medical Analyst, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, director of the Cardiac Catheterization Lab at George Washington University Hospital. Dr. Reiner, good to have you on. So there's a lot of headlines about this study today. I've done intermittent fasting over the last couple of years off and on. What do we know and what do we not know at this point? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Yes. Hi, Anderson. This study is very provocative but really not that convincing. So this is what we know about intermittent fasting or time restricted eating. There are basically three forms of that. Sometimes people will fast two days out of the week. Some people alternate eating one day and fasting another day. And the particular kind of time restricted eating in this study is a form where people basically restrict their eating to a certain number of consecutive hours in a given day. And in this particular study, they used eight hours as the separation point to compare the effects of this strategy. And they looked at a large national database called NHANES, which is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study. They looked at 20,000 patients who self-reported their eating habits. Now, importantly, not all of the people who described limiting their eating to a certain number of consecutive hours in a day, we're doing that as part of a diet. And they, importantly, they follow these people longitudinally for on average, about eight years. And unlike early studies, which were largely short term, that things like blood pressure and cholesterol and wait, this study looked at mortality, looked at cardiovascular mortality. And in this study, the people who restricted their eating to only eight hours out of 24 hours, eight hours eating, 16 hours fasting seem to have almost a double risk of cardiovascular mortality out through eight years. And this runs counter to everything, you know, we've sort of expected and learned about this eating strategy over the last several years when many studies have this.",
