      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Ukraine pushes for NATO membership after more deadlyRussian strikes in the capital, Kyiv. I'll be speaking to the NATO Secretary General in just a moment. Then, a war of words between Kosovo and Serbia's presidents over escalating tensions in the region. We'll have the very latest on the protests there. Plus, a daring rescue on Mount Everest, as a Nepali Sherpa saves a climber from the mountain's death zone. We'll have more on that coming up later this hour. But first, I want to start with the war in Ukraine, both sides are trying to suck morale ahead of Ukraine's expected counteroffensive. Three people were killed during a Russian missile attack overnight when they were locked out of a Kyiv bomb shelter. Among the victims, a nine-year-old girl and her mother. According to the person who took this photo, this is the little girl's grandfather, sitting in a spot for hours watching over her body. The city's mayor is promising to make sure bomb shelters are opened at night to avoid this from happening again. An investigation into negligence is now also opened. Russia is also seeing the effects of Vladimir Putin's war on its own territory about 40 kilometers from its border with Ukraine. The governor of Belgorod is blaming Kyiv for carrying out drone attacks in the region. Well, across this all is Sam Kiley who is in Kharkiv for us this evening, that is in eastern Ukraine. And Sam, I think it's fair to say we have been seeing now an increase in these cross-border incursions including reports today of an explosion in the Russian city of Belgorod. What more can you tell us?",

It has been hit before in raids that have not been claimed by the Ukrainians, particularly occasional helicopter raids, special forces raids, usually directed ammunition dumps. But this seems to have been a strike in the center of the city. This is on top of a number of strikes that the Russians are saying the Ukrainians carried out against a number of board villages to the southeast of Belgorod down towards where I am in Kharkiv, not far from Ukraine's northern border. And with the results as far as the Russians are saying, Isa, that at least, eight people were injured. They say that many hundreds of civilians, women and children in particular have been evacuated. They have -- the media have published pictures of evacuees arriving in evacuation centers being looked after by Russian officials. All scenes reminiscent of what we've seen all too frequently on this side of the frontline in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. I think what's really significant about this though is that the Russian citizens who are fighting under the auspices of the Ukrainian Armed Forces claim again that they have crossed into that self-same area and claim to have had a number of successes against the Russians. The Russians for their part say that they have repelled that raid. Again, we can't really prove the truth of this one way or the other. But I think what is significant here as we've discussed just last night, I think, Isa, is that this is a new phase in --",

I want to get more context really what cameout of this meeting because I heard today the German Foreign Minister say that NATO cannot accept new members while they're in the middle of the war. U.S. said the same I believe in the last month or so. Why then, sir, is Ukraine's accession dominating these meetings if you're all on the same page here? JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO: We all agree that in the middle of the war, we cannot make Ukraine a full member of NATO. But at the same time, we need to prepare for what happens when the war ends because then we need to ensure that history doesn't repeat itself. That President Putin just reconstitutes and arrest the Russian forces, regroup and then attack again. Because he has attacked Ukraine many times. It started not last year, it started in 2014, first with Crimea, then with eastern Donbas, and then with the full-fledged invasion last year. And this vicious circle -- cycle has to be stopped, and therefore, we need to discuss and address what kind of security arrangements can we have in place to ensure that President Putin is not able to continue to chip away at the European and Ukrainian security. And then the issue of also, security arrangements, membership in NATO will be part of that discussion.",

But they also totally underestimated NATO and NATO allies, our resolve to support Ukraine. And I welcome the strong bipartisan support in the United States for supporting Ukraine. And I'm absolutely confident that we will be there to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. It will be a big tragedy for Ukrainians if President Putin wins, but it will also be dangerous for us. Because the message to him and other authoritarian leaders including in Beijing is that when they use force, they get what they want, and that will make also us, NATO allies, United States, Europe, more vulnerable.

An update of a story we've been following closely that kept global financial markets on edge.Right now, U.S. senators are meeting to pass a bill to suspend the debt limit. Lawmakers are racing to avert the default which is just days away by the way. Once the Senate passes the measure, it can be sent to U.S. President Joe Biden for his expected signature. Later Wednesday, House lawmakers voted to raise the debt ceiling by a comfortable bipartisan margin. Now to a CNN exclusive report on the investigation into former U.S. president Donald Trump. Sources say federal prosecutors have obtained an audio recording of Trump's speaking about a classified Pentagon document he held onto. What he said could determine his life of defense that the documents he took were declassified. Let's bring in Katelyn Polantz from Washington for more on this. What exactly is Trump saying in this reporting and how did prosecutors get it?",

One of the things he does is he's reacting to a news story. This news story was about General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, telling Donald Trump that he couldn't start a war with Iran if he wanted to, stopping Trump from launching some sort of military strike. But in this meeting in July 2021 that's captured on audio, Donald Trump is talking about how he has a document for a plan from the Pentagon, from Milley, that would undercut Milley and would be about how they could launch a military strike on Iran. So it's very significant in that the Justice Department was able to get an audiotape of this particular moment in time after Trump leaves the presidency. On that audiotape, it's apparently quite blatant that Donald Trump refers to the document as if it's right there in the room with him. He's referring to a document that's clearly about this Iranian -- this plan of the United States to potentially attack Iran if that is what he had wanted to do as president. Obviously, it didn't happen. But he's also on the audio waving a paper. You can hear on the audio we've been told by our sources that you can hear the paper rustling. There is also laughter in the room. People he's speaking with are not people who have security clearances, that have the ability to have access to secretive national defense information of the United States. It's people working on an autobiography for someone who was in his administration and it's communication aides of Trump after he leaves the White House. The other thing that's so significant about this audio -- and that is not my words. That is words that many of these sources who talk to us about this have said this is an important moment in this part of the investigation, an important piece of evidence. The other thing it captures Trump doing is acknowledging the limitations he has on him after he leaves the White House, that the document is classified, that he can't declassify it, that he wishes he could share it more widely and he is not able to. So all of those things put together make this quite an astonishing piece of potential evidence and evidence that has prompted the Justice Department to get grand jury testimony about this meeting, about the document. And we also know they have taken an interview with General Milley himself, who's obviously his opposition to Donald Trump at the end of the presidency. It is a crucial piece of this as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, everyone was so surprised because Kim Cattrall, came out and said last year that she had put that chapter of herlife behind her. When speaking to \"Variety\" at the Power of Women event, she had said that she had moved on and that that was just not something that she was interested in doing. So it caught fans by surprise -- for many of them a pleasant surprise because she was a fan favorite on the show. And to put things into perspective when \"Sex and the City\" finally ended, after six seasons in 2004, you saw 10.4 million people tune in for that finale, which was a record at the time. It was about 18 months after the end of \"The Sopranos,\" which saw record numbers. So this is a show that has withstood the test of time. They came back for two feature films like you said. And then this reboot on our parent company, on Max. What we do know is that she filmed one scene in March. It was filmed in Queens, New York, in a parking garage where she is reportedly in a town car. We know that her name was not on the call sheet; she didn't interact with the other women on the show. And if you've been paying attention to what's gone on off screen, with the characters you know that Sarah Jessica Parker, the title, the main character of the show, the title character, and Kim Cattrall are not the best of friends. We've seen that play out publicly. We've seen them feud and go back and forth on social media. Perhaps that was the reason why Kim Cattrall didn't want to come back for \"And Just Like That...\" for the first season. But something moved the needle for her but we just don't know what it is. I know I've been reading some of the comments on social media and some fans are disappointed that it's just one scene but perhaps it's one that will lead to more. We're not quite sure, Isa.",
