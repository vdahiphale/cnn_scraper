And now it -- so many questions about what happens next.Juliegrace Brufke, Jackie Kucinich, thank you both very much for being here this morning. All right, let's turn now to this. The ripple effects of that landmark ruling by the Supreme Court on presidential immunity -- they've shown up in New York in that case where Donald Trump was convicted of multiple felonies. The judge, Juan Merchan, agreed to push back the sentencing for former President Trump in that hush money trial until September the 18th, specifically. But he also added these five words to the revised timeline. He said, \"...if such is still necessary.\" Let's bring in CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Joey, good morning. So, of course, the political context of this is that everything seems to be coming up Trump over the course of the last week as Democrats rustle with whether to replace Joe Biden. But also, this ruling throws into question almost all of Donald Trump's legal challenges. Let's focus in on New York to start. I mean, how do you interpret what Merchan said here in terms of saying well, if it's necessary we'll do this? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. So, Kasie, good morning to you. It's something that had to be said, right? You cannot prejudge ultimately what Judge Juan Merchan is going to do. And so, in the event that he rules in the president's favor -- former president -- then, of course, there will be no sentencing and the case will be dismissed, right? They're going to -- that is, the attorneys for Trump -- file a motion to set aside the verdict. And so, having a briefing schedule where you have the attorneys for the president submit motions with regard to the introduction of evidence that should not have been introduced into evidence under the Supreme Court decision, having the prosecutors have an opportunity to respond, having oral argument if necessary, and then rendering a decision is absolutely the right call. What that decision will be is an open question and I wouldn't read into it by the words that were noted there, Kasie -- \"if necessary\" -- that he's made a predetermined decision. He's simply saying based upon his analysis, in the event he falls obviously with the president based upon this decision -- former president -- then, of course, there will be no sentencing. And that's all I take from that.",

      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "sentences": "Yeah. I don't see that plan as viable at all, right? Because remember, Kasie, in the event that he wins -- let's start there -- you can have a situation where the then-President Trump orders the Justice Department to dismiss those cases and there will be nothing to see there.With regard to the merits of the cases themselves, I just don't see based upon the work that the court now needs to do -- remember, what the Supreme Court decision said. Yes, there was specific guidance with regard to what can be used, what's official acts, what's unofficial acts. However, it is going to be largely whether that information could be used a determination by the lower court. What does that mean? You have to have evidentiary hearings and then you have appeals based upon rulings that the district court makes. Then you have a circuit court -- that's the appellate court the federal level -- weigh in. And then guess what, Kasie. It then can go back to the Supreme Court. So there's going to be an inordinate amount of delay. There's going to be litigation. There was so much uncertainty from that Supreme Court decision. Generally, the Supreme Court pronounces a decision. It's clear -- it's a bright-line rule. Here, it just says you guys figure it out. So I do not see this at all about moving forward, in the event that Trump wins, as viable or, really, even in the realm of reality.",

I mean, in your experience and kind of understanding as you have studied these men -- and there's still only, right, a few of them that have ever served kind of in this office -- how do you think the weight of history sits with our current president, Joe Biden, and would you compare it to anything we've seen in the past?",

      "sentences": "The decision not to run again is a very lonely personal decision by a president. The evidence is very clear for both Truman and LBJ that they decided -- they set the timetable.And in the case LBJ, they faced pushback from their own family. LBJ's family -- particularly, his two daughters -- they were not only shocked, they were really upset when they heard their father wasn't going to run again and tried desperately to talk him out of giving the speech in March of 1968. And they were only told hours before the speech. Although the situation is very different, the one president who has resigned in our history, Richard Nixon, also faced pushback from his own family. His daughters did not want him to resign. Indeed, the first lady didn't want him to resign. His decision -- again, the circumstances are different, but his decision was very personal and very lonely. I will add in 1974, one of the arguments that Republican leaders made to Richard Nixon that he should step down -- and again, I'm not comparing Biden to Nixon -- but one of the arguments was the 1974 midterm elections. That Republicans across the country would be pummeled if Richard Nixon were still in office by the time of that election. So this decision by Biden is Biden's to make. Historically, we can expect the first lady to be playing a very significant role in the decision. And the role of Biden's children -- his daughter and his son -- will be important, too. But in the end, the decision is the president's alone. When parties try to force out presidents, generally speaking, they fail. Gerald Ford wanted to run again. Ronald Reagan tried to beat him and lost in 1976. In 1980, Jimmy Carter wanted to run again. Ted Kennedy wanted to be the nominee. Jimmy Carter prevailed as the incumbent president. An incumbent president has an enormous amount of sway and usually wins these kinds of fights. The one difference today is that we're talking about the health and the stamina of a president. That has never been an issue for those incumbent presidents that came under strain.",
