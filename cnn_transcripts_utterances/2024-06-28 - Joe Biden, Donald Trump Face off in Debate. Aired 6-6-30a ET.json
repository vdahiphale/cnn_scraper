Or is the president in a bad way? And I think that's one of the things that they're going to have to convey. If I were them, perhaps this is time for Joe Biden to go out there and give his version of Barack Obama's race speech, right, and talk about his age, and talk about the fact that he's got arthritis in his legs, and talk about the fact that maybe he's moving a little slowly. But he's got to own it in a way that will give people confidence that he understands what's going on. Let them in on it with him. And then he can start to change the narrative to talk more about the other things that it is he wants. KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER: The problem is not that Americans think his legs moving slowly. The problem is that they looked at last night, and they think his mind is moving slowly. And it's too slow to be the president of the United States. This is an election where I agree with you. The choice is clear; the contrast is very clear. And this was an election where voters are looking for someone to give them stability. Donald Trump has always been Mr. Chaos. So this should have been a lay-up for Joe Biden. But he sent the message last night that the control room is empty.

Because I mean, I was talking to dozens of people last night, and the panic was at an all-time high. I woke up this morning to a couple notes about groups of Democratic members of Congress, unlikely to come out and say anything publicly at this point but wondering who else can they put at the top of the ticket? These are some of the quotes from people that I, you know, collected last night as this debate -- that I'd be taking calls tonight. That's about Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom.

And yes, they did, you know, talk about the policy, but very little talk about the performance. So look, today's a new day. The president has to address this when he speaks in North Carolina today. It's -- it would be unthinkable for him not to. But going forward from that, I think we need a few days to settle into what is he personally -- what is his family personally thinking about this? To me, he was over -- he looked over-prepared, completely tired, and he may have had a cold. That's probably the most charitable thing. But Biden advisers know how to reach everyone.

They have not told the truth about the limitations of his age: that he gets up late in the morning, that he does not appear on camera, usually, late at night. That he does not do interviews more than -- he's done less interviews than any president in decades. There are limitations on this present, because he is old.

When I talked to other Democrats crowds, Kasie, I mean, the -- the reactions are wide-ranging.

And he really didn't. He, for the most part, let Biden's performance speak for itself. There was one moment where he said, you know, I don't understand. I don't understand what he just said, and I don't think he does either. But then he kind of let it go.
