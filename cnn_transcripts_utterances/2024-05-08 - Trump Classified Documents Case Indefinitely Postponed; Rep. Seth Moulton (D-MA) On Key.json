The judge, Aileen Cannon, canceling the May trial date yesterday citing issues with classified evidence. The delay makes it unlikely the trial will start before the November election. There are still multiple disputes that the judge has to decide before the case can be heard by a jury. Judge Cannon confirming that it will take until at least late July.

When she says there's a whole bunch of stuff on the docket that she's got to -- that has to be dealt with before this trial can start, it's actually on her to make those decisions, no? CHILDRESS:  That's the point. She claimed there was a logjam, and the logjam is because she hasn't made rulings. And for a lot of these motions that are still outstanding, these are motions that typically, judges just rule on from the bench but she's still holding hearings. For example, holding a hearing on the vindictive prosecution motion that the defense filed. Vindictive prosecution filings are, I don't want to say common or the norm, but it's something that you see in high-profile type cases. And lots of times, judges just rule from the bench on it. I think she wants to have a hearing on that. She wants to have a hearing on the classified documents and what plans to be admitted in trial. She's seen all the classified documents so she should be in a good position to rule on these types of motions but still has not. So I think what Ty Cobb said yesterday is kind of spot on. I think a lot of jurists saw this moving towards not going to trial before the election and she pretty much just kind of confirmed that with her -- with her decision yesterday.",

So, while the hush money case\" -- which, of course, has been unfolding -- \"is widely regarded as the weakest of the bunch facing Trump, it's likely the only one that could create the never-before-seen scenario of a convicted felon asking voters to elect him president.\" Now, of course, Stephen is talking about what we saw yesterday, and he said, \"That makes the testimony of Daniels even more critical.\" Do you expect this is the only criminal trial that we're going to see Trump go through until the election?",

It's an unwelcome issue for him heading back onto the campaign trail. But I also think Stormy Daniels may not be the most important part of this case.

OKC's average age is about 24 years old, and they were already the youngest team ever to win a playoff series. Well now, they're the youngest team ever to win a second-round game. And the Thunder's superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander -- he was just fabulous in game one. The 25-year-old with 29 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists. And OKC just playing stifling defense on Luka Doncic all night long. They held Luka to one for eight shooting from three and he finished with just 19 points, snapping a streak of 24 consecutive playoff games with at least 20. The Thunder would run away with game one 117-95 to remain undefeated in the playoffs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
