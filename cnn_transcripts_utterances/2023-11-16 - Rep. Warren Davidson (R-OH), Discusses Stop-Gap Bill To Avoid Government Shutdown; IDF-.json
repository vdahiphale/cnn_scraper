And the IDF notified her family she has died. What's unclear is how she died, whether she was killed while being held by Hamas or whether she died in Israeli bombardment. The IDF says she was found in a structure near the Shifa Hospital complex. We know there's been tremendous fighting around Al Shifa and that the IDF has been operating in that area for several days before it moved into the hospital complex itself early Wednesday morning. But it's unclear from the IDF's statement if she died as part of the bombardment or and she was killed while held hostage. Let me read to you just a short part of this. \"The body of Yehudit Weiss, who was abducted by the Hamas terrorist organization, was extracted by IDF troops from a structure adjacent to the Al Shifa Hospital in the Gaza Strip and was transferred to Israeli territory. \"In the structure in which Yehudit was located, military equipment, including Kalashnikov rifles and RPGs, were also found.\" As of right now, this is the second Israeli hostage who has died in captivity, the first, Noa Marciano. The IDF notified her family several days ago that she had died while being held by Hamas. In fact, we just heard from her family earlier today, that is Noa Marciano's family, and they demanded that Israel do more, first, to bring back the bodies for a proper burial here in Israel and, second, do more to release all the other hostages who are still being held in Gaza -- Pam?",

We've gotten snippets of how it might look. Although, the exact numbers are hard to pin down because there hasn't been an agreement yet. Fifty, 70, 100 hostages released at first. Women and children in exchange for prolonged or several days for a pause in the fighting, but it hasn't come into sharp focus because there hasn't been an agreement yet. Meanwhile, Israel says it will continue its campaign until the hostages are release released. But you're right, Pam, this certainly complicates that as we learn that a second hostage has been killed in captivity in Gaza has been killed.",

Here's what they found as part of the culture of unsafe practices in their view on the set. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, NEW MEXICO FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set that there were live rounds on set. They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. He didn't check it. He didn't do any of the things that he was supposed to do to make that he was safe or that anyone around him was safe.

He was reported from previous crew members who said that they didn't feel safe. So we'll have to see what the grand jury decides.
