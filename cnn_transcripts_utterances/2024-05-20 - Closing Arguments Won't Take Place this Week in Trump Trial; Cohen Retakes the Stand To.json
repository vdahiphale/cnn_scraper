Todd Blanche, Trump's attorney, will again ask the questions. The Trump attorney landed several notable blows on Cohen, underlining seeming inconsistencies in Cohen's memory. At one point Blanche accused Cohen of inventing, apparently out of thin air, a conversation with Donald Trump about the payment at the heart of the trial, the hush money intended to silence adult film star and director Stormy Daniels. Two critical and unanswered questions this hour, what will the defense presentation look like? Will they call any witnesses? One of the only events remaining that could extend the duration of the trial would bend history and break good legal counsel if Trump takes the stand in his own defense. We're going to start our coverage in New York with Kaitlan.",

He's a name that was introduced to jurors last week. There were emails shown that he sent to Michael Cohen after the FBI searched Michael Cohen's house and his hotel room and his office. And Robert Costello is someone who was never formally retained by Michael Cohen, but he did serve as kind of this informal legal advisor. And he was the person who testified to the grand jury before Trump was actually indicted here, he testified on Capitol Hill as well last week, and can essentially trying to dispute Michael Cohen's testimony, at least parts of it, and paint him as a liar, which, as we know, has been the defense's strategy here all along.It still remains to be seen if they are going to call him. I am told by two people that they have not made a decision as of this morning. So, we are waiting to see what that's going to look like and how it affects the timing of all of this. CNN's Elie Honig is also joining us this morning. And, Elie, this was a big announcement from the judge, who was trying to avoid big breaks in what the jury is hearing and when they get these closing arguments. And, Elie, he just said that he - basically they have to make a big break now or take a big break later over the Memorial Day weekend. So, the jury is not going to hear those closing arguments this week.",

And then the jury is left kind of confused because it's this battle of the experts playing out when we kind of know what it is. And the prosecution is getting up to argued Trump's leaning into Blanche, hitting him on the arm as he is whispering something to his attorney. That's notable. I mean, obviously, defendants interact with their attorneys all the time, but Trump seems to be dictating often a lot of the strategy with his movements in court to his attorneys.",

Look, they landed some serious punches. It took Todd Blanche a while to get there. He was sort of meandering at first.
