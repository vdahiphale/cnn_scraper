      "sentences": "Well, Christine -- I mean, to the wider world, there's none at all. Soledar is a town that pre-war had maybe 10,000 people.But on the battlefield, the Russians need a win. They have tried and failed to capture the strategic town of Bakhmut, which is less than 10 miles away, and they haven't been able to make inroads. And so, Soledar may be their next best hope to capture that win on the battlefield and they are investing an enormous amount of troops and manpower, and it seems that they are making inroads. The Ukrainian deputy defense minister said that overnight, the fighting there was hot and that the Russians maintained a high level of intensity, but she insists that the Ukrainian troops are still holding the line. We spoke with one Ukrainian soldier who was inside the town of Soledar and he said that at least his unit has been abandoned. They are pinned down. They have no food, they have little water. And frankly, the window to actually withdraw from that area is closing fast if it hasn't closed already. He says that judging by the sounds on the battlefield it seems that other Ukrainian units nearby have either been ordered to withdraw or have withdrawn on their own. And this is the same soldier who told us two days ago that Ukrainian withdrawal from Soledar seemed inevitable -- only a matter of time. Now, the Wagner private military group says that they have captured the entire town. That is disputed. But what is really remarkable about that statement is that they insist that they have done it with no help at all from regular Russian forces. Now, the Russian military disputes that. They say that their forces have -- are holding the northern and southern parts of the town and they are fighting within it. But this internal spat really illustrates some of the internal tensions within the Russian forces just as the military has appointed a brand new commander to lead the war effort in Ukraine -- Christine.",

U.S. stocks on a roll Thursday, closing higher after inflation slowed to a 6 1/2 percent rate last month. A six-month trend now of cooling inflation. The Nasdaq now on a five-day winning streak. Investors hope all this means the Federal Reserve will cut the size of interest rate hikes in the future. The next rate decision comes February first. Look inside those inflation numbers, though, and you still see some red-hot spots. Shelter is up 7 1/2 percent. Food at home is up over 10 percent. And eggs, up 60 percent since last year.

DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH, WEDBUSH SECURITIES (via Skype):  Yes. I mean, I've been on the streets and this is the clock's about to strike midnight for the Fed. And despite all the talk -- I mean, I think it's a high game stakes of poker.
