All right, let's meet the person that Donald Trump wants to be the next attorney general, different than it was yesterday. No. Not him. It's not Matt Gaetz. Matt Gaetz is out, one week after resigning his seat in Congress to go after that role in Trump's cabinet. When he announced his withdrawal, Gaetz said his nomination because a, quote, \"needly protracted Washington scuffle,\" end quote. Is that what it was? More importantly, he didn't have the support of enough Republican senators to win confirmation. According to reporting in \"The New York Times,\" Gaetz concluded that at least four Republican senators were not going to support his nomination: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and the newly elected John Curtis of Utah. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): It was made clear that there's not a path, and if there's not a path, you -- you just -- you just spend a lot of political capital for a losing cause.

MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, and although she has those, as you say, more establishment bonafides than a Matt Gaetz, she also is someone who has been a Trump loyalist. Right? She was very early to endorse him in 2016, when a lot of people in Florida were on board with other candidates, when Trump was viewed much more skeptically. And she's been loyal to him throughout. You know, defending him in the impeachment, as you noted before. So, I think she is viewed as someone who can sort of bridge the traditional Republican establishment and sort of MAGA world, because she obviously has been very loyal to Trump. And -- but she has more traditional experience, particularly compared to someone like Matt Gaetz, who had barely practiced law. The fact that she has actually been a state attorney general for two terms, that she has done the more traditional, you know, has prosecutorial experience and that sort of thing, I think is going to really warm the hearts of a lot of Republican senators who were having so much heartburn over Matt Gaetz and who didn't, who frankly didn't know where to start with him.

I mean, there are still fundamental questions about whether somebody being appointed to run the Justice Department should be somebody who's willing to just blatantly lie on behalf of the president.
