They are the people that -- one of the few people that just loves answering poll calls and telling everybody that they don't like Donald Trump and who they love to vote for. And so it over-indexes a lot of these polls and it can warp some of those things. And a couple of tells from Republicans that I talk to why that's the case. Number one, notice there was no recall -- what they call the recall ballot Biden test, right? So there's no, like, hey, in 2020, who did you vote for, Biden or Trump? They anticipate if that was the case it would be about plus-five Biden right now the way the sample was made up. Number two, the issues were totally off. If you look at the Democrats that responded back -- 51 percent, democracy; just seven percent, the economy. Now look, democracy could be obviously an issue on the Democratic side. That's a huge gap.
