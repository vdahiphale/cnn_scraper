I think they feel that responding to Dean Phillips would only evaluate him. And that's how you're going to see them attack this. But I would view Phillips and what's going on here as one data point in a much broader universe of increasing concern about President Biden's ability to win an election that most Democrats think is fundamentally existential. And it's existential to them for all the reasons you guys have been talking about on the show this morning. The vermin comment that Donald Trump made on Veterans Day over the weekend, the plans to manipulate the federal government for mass deportations and other things. And there is serious concern among Democrats that they won't say in public that Dean Phillips is saying in public. So that not only potentially damages the president, but also, you know, if something were to happen in New Hampshire, as we outlined there, it's really, actually, very hard to predict. And you know, I talked to one Democrat this morning who called not being on the ballot there an unforced error. There are risks here, and this is part of the narrative. And, you know, we've also got third-party candidates potentially getting in the race. Look at what Joe Manchin may or may not do.

So, Don Jr. has previously testified that he was not involved in the preparation of these statements. And he said that when he signed off on them, he did so after getting assurance from accountants and lawyers that everything was OK.But when he was called by the state, the state got to decide the questions, and they tried to limit his answers to yes or no. Today, now that he's a defense witness, they will be able to set the table. They will be able to ask him much more expansive questions, and he will be able to answer the questions more fluently. He will be able to expand on them and be able to kind of set their narrative. So, that is the objective in calling him. He is going to be one of many witnesses. The defense saying that this could go for several weeks, all as they're trying to set the tone that the Trumps did not intend to defraud anyone. If there were mistakes, they were mistakes, but that there were no victims in this case. We saw a flash of that when Ivanka Trump was testifying. She, on direct examination by the state, answered their questions, but when asked by the Trump's attorneys, she was able to get in some evidence that the banks were happy with the relationships and that they were continuing to do business with them, even while -- though they had these financial statements.
