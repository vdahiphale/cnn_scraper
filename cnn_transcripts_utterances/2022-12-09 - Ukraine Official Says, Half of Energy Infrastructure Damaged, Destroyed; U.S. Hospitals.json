Many times bigger than ours, many times better financed than ours, but we beat them and we don't have any doubts with our victory because we have two key factors. We have strong motivation of Ukraine soldiers, protecting their land and their families and the global solidarity with Ukraine.The second factor, exactly as you told, we have disastrous Putin attack on the civilians, on the critical energy infrastructure. People of Ukraine live without heating, without electricity, without water. In my house, we have only three hours of electricity during 24 hours. And this is under the temperature minus eight, minus ten and this is definitely humanitarian crisis. But it is extremely important that we in Ukraine do not trade electricity, water, heating, for our freedom, for democracy and better to be without water and without electricity than to be a slave.",

We do not do that. This is a question of trust. We have now this trust that Ukrainian Armed Forces has a trust from American side.And we need these long range artillery and missiles just because if Russia has a big amount of artillery, from the bigger distance not be hit by Russian artillery, we can destroy Russian ammunition storage, Russian commanding points. And this will helping us to protect Ukraine and correspondently this has helped us to protect Europe.

So, talk to us more about this situation, the rise in numbers and what is behind it. DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Erica. So, hospitals were required to report their capacity in the beginning of the pandemic to get an idea of how COVID was tracking, and the numbers looked for past two years about 70 percent. Meaning 70 percent of beds and hospitals were full. That is until this week when the number went up to about 80 percent. The last time we saw an 80 percent was in January of 2022 at the height of omicron. In fact, this number this past week, it jumped about 8 percent over the last two weeks. And there are certain states that actually have even higher numbers. So, Rhode Island, we're talking over 90 percent, places like Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, the numbers are over 85 percent. And there is a lot of things contributing to this. I mean, certainly, we've talked about the tripledemic, RSV, COVID and the flu, while it does seem like RSV numbers seem to be peaking in most places and coming down. The flu cases are still high. We just heard Rochelle Walensky say that hospitalizations for flu at this time are really the highest they've been in almost a decade, 78,000 total hospitalizations this year already. So, that is definitely contributing. But then you have to think about work flow, work staffing shortages. And that is an important part of what is happen right now, not just in the hospital, but we as providers, we try to get patients out of the hospital to skilled nursing facilities, rehabs, and if you don't have staff there and you have shortages, you can't discharge patients. And then, finally, there are patients who delayed care. They didn't have their procedures done. They didn't seek medical career for the last two years, and now they're doing it, and that is taking up space as well. So, it is really the convergence of all of these factors that is contributing.",

People are going to be getting together, and that is why you hear about the push for getting your booster and certainly everyone should be getting their flu vaccine. We know that it's a good match this year.But what's interesting is when you look at the number of hospital beds now being taken up by COVID patients, it is about 6 percent compared to last January when it was 25 percent. So, it's definitely a contributing factor, but I think really the flu and all the other respiratory viruses are making up a large proportion.",
