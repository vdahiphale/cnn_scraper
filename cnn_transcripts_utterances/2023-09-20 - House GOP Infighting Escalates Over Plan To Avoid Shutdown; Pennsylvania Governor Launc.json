They emerged from yesterday's talks about a government shutdown talking not about a compromise that could keep our government open until October but instead, about \"SEINFELD\" -- comparing their meeting to Festivus, which as you heard there and you might remember, is the airing of grievances. Merry, merry? The bottom line, things are not looking good on Capitol Hill. A vote to advance a major defense bill failed on the floor yesterday after five Republicans voted against it, possibly presaging what's to come next week when funding for the government is set to run out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Hopefully, some of my colleagues will see the light of day quickly. But with a September 30th deadline approaching, obviously, that time is quickly dwindling. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I guess what I want to know from you is does this one feel different from the others? JOHN BRESNAHAN, CO-FOUNDER, PUNCHBOWL NEWS (via Skype):  No, it feels like the same thing. It feels like a slow-motion crisis unfolding. It feels kind of like 2015 to be honest, when Republicans shut down the government for 16 days under President Obama. Then speaker John Boehner was -- I remember him sitting in his office and he's puffing cigarettes and he hated the whole thing but he couldn't stop it. It feels somewhat like the same.

So he can try something and just give his guys everything they want and try and pass it. There's no guarantee he can do that. He could reach out to Dems and do it. He could reach out to Dems and try and do -- Democrats and do a bipartisan approach, or conversely, he could do nothing and he could wait for a shutdown to start on October 1, or possibly wait for the Senate to see if the Senate will bail them out.

It is wonderful to be here in the CNN family with you and I really appreciate you getting up early.
