      "sentences": "Good morning, you are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We do begin with the breaking news right now. The outer bands of Hurricane Milton are starting to slam into the Florida Gulf Coast. This is a live look at the Tampa Bay area as the powerful Category 4 storm is barreling toward the state. Officials are warning of life threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall. It's set to make landfall and unleash its fury overnight. We are awaiting a press conference at any moment from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. We'll bring that to you live. In the meantime, we have team coverage of Hurricane Milton. We have CNN's Randi Kaye and Isabel Rosales standing by in Florida. But, first, let's go to CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, this is still a very powerful, monstrous storm. What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Yes, indeed, Jim. In fact, we're getting hourly updates now and we'll continue to do so through landfall, which we anticipate sometime late tonight and into the early morning hours of Thursday.Still, 155 mile-per-hour wind, that is a powerful Category 4. Note that I did not say Category 5. It was earlier this morning. Didn't lose much intensity overnight like we had hoped it would. But let's not split hairs here. The amount of energy that this storm has enacted on the eastern Gulf of Mexico means that the storm surge that will be realized across west central coastline of Florida in the coming hours and into the overnight period will be consistent with a Category 5 hurricane. So, let's talk specifics. In terms of this trajectory, we still have that landfall with a Category 4. That's explicitly noted in the National Hurricane Center's forecast track again late tonight, early tomorrow morning, it will zip across the Florida Peninsula and bring its fury along with it along with hurricane force winds. So, when can you expect the tropical storm force winds to begin? Well, you can see into Tampa this afternoon to this evening. That's when conditions will really start to be felt. And then they go downhill exponentially from there. Remember, tropical storm force winds, they close the bridges in and around Tampa and along the barrier island. So, if you have not evacuated, I implore you, because now is your moment in time to get inland as quick as possible. This is the latest radar and you can see the eye is actually visible on the radar for both Key West and Tampa base radar systems. The winds that are in the outer band impacting the western coastline already gusting over 30 miles per hour. You can see, look at Venice 39 miles per hour currently right now. But it will only get exponentially worse from here. Catastrophic wind damage possible not just on the coast but inland, and that storm surge potential still there even though it's lowered in Tampa Bay. Jim, these numbers will eclipse what we experienced in Helene two weeks ago.",

And I spoke to Sarasota's mayor, Liz Alpert, and she said she's not sure if people evacuated from -- if everyone evacuated from those barrier islands. So, that's a real concern.

So, very blunt languages are trying to persuade with this man as we speak to evacuate. Jim, I'm going to pass it right back to you. We have DeSantis.",

And the town that I live in right on the cusp of Cortez along with AMI, you know, we all suffered catastrophic damages. My husband and I took on over three feet of water in our home along with everybody else. And we've lost almost everything. And we're just picking up the pieces from that trying to carry on.

Much of the debris and what we've all lost in our homes is still on the streets as we prepare for Milton. And so it's just cause of battle fatigue as a veteran and counselors, you know, kind of call it acute stress disorder.
