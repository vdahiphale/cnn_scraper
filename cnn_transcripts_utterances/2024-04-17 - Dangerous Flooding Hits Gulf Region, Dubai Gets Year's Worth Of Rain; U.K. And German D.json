People struggling to even get to the airport amid an historic weather event, which saw the heaviest rainfall in the country's history. Shopping malls were affected and roads turned to rivers as drivers got stuck on superhighways. One 70 year-old man, sadly, he lost his life after his car was swept away in one of the Emirates in the flooding. Derek Van Dam joins me now, live from the Weather Center.

So this is an area that we're looking for a potential for more flooding going forward, just west of Karachi. And we'll show you that in just one moment. I mean, rainfall totals, there are impressive. Keep in mind this part of the Middle East is not normally this wet, especially at this time of year. So to see this amount of rain in a 24 hour period leads to scenes like this. We know authorities are indicating that over 40 people have lost their lives in Pakistan alone, thanks to this torrent of debris, mud and water that is just so fast moving. You cannot traverse that. That is just simply dangerous and that will take down buildings and sweep away vehicles at a moment's notice. Now further south into Amman, the same storm system that rotated through the area brought heavy rainfall to the northern sections of the country as well. Look at that, nearing 300 millimeters of rainfall. (WEATHER REPORT)",

Iran and its allied groups across the region, which are -- which they call themselves the axis of resistance -- have been studying warfare with Israel, have been engaged in a shadow war across the region for the past many years. And so the way that they chose to attack on Saturday, the fact that it came just from Iran and not the other allied members of the axis of resistance, is an attempt for Iran to show that it is willing to engage directly with Israel. However, at the same time, signaling very forthright, both to the United States and neighboring countries, that it does not desire a full-out confrontation or a full-out war. Now the other part of your question is that Iran has developed a entire litany of partners, groups throughout the region, both -- many of them non- state actors, many of them including Hezbollah that have had decades of developments in weaponry and have been engaged very directly what's warfare with Israel from the 1980s onwards. And so part of Iran's deterrence strategy throughout the years -- these are the Israel, the United States -- has been it has these allies across the region.
