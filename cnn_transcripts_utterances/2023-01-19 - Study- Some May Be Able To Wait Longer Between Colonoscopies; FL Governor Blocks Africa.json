It's recommended you get one every 10 years.Now there's a new study that suggests some people may be able to wait longer between screenings. CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, joining us live. What are these findings? For a lot of people who didn't enjoy the prep, for example, they may not mind waiting 10 years in between?

And they decided to put this to the test.So first of all, who should get a colonoscopy? Everyone 45 to 75. They lowered the age a few years ago, you may remember, Erica, from 50 to 45. But that's who should get it. People who are older than that, depending on their history, can talk to their doctor about it. The question was, they say, if you had a negative colonoscopy, how long do you wait then before the next one? And what they did in the study in Germany they looked at 120,000 of repeat colonoscopies and figured out how often did they catch something now. And what they found was interesting. They stratified it women and mean. And said, with women, they did another colonoscopy at 10 years, they're catching 3.6 percent of the people had an abnormality. They waited 14 years, it was 4.9 percent. And higher for men but still pretty small numbers. And also the younger you were, the less likely you were to have something pop up on the next colonoscopy as well. So that's what the data shows now, Erica, which is really interesting. It hasn't translated to any change. Ten years is still the recommendation. But looking at studies like this, they'll ask, should we start thinking about widening that interval?",

That is the underlying fear that has been ginned up, frankly, by politicians and those who intend to make this a political point. This course in particular is -- the college board has reviewed this. They put it out in 60 schools and the schools have all tried this curriculum. Some of them, I'm sure, deciding to adopt it. Now, the college board is no small thing. It's actually the same board which runs the SAT and has been picking A.P. classes, which are advanced classes, for many, many, many years.",

So the issue is this WOKE Act that the governor of Florida has put in place where you cannot teach CRT, which is Critical Race Theory. I want to read something from one of the pre-eminent scholars of African-American history, but also, as he puts it, American history. This is Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr saw this when he saw this came out. Here's what he said: \"Nothing is more dramatic than having the college board launch an A.P. course in a field that signifies ultimate acceptance and ultimate academic legitimacy.\" \"A.P. African-American studies is not CRT. It's not the 1619 Project. It is a mainstream, rigorously vetted academic approach to a vibrant field of study.\" So you have one of the pre-eminent scholars on this who did documentary after documentary, who has said, look, you know, this is not what you are saying it is.",
