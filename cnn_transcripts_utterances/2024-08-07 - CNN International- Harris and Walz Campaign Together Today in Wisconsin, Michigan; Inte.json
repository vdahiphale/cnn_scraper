Vice President Kamala Harris and her newly announced running mate Tim Walz at a lively rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, just three miles from where Donald Trumps running mate, J.D. Vance, made his own pitch to voters. Following it all is CNN senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche. Wisconsin is, of course, like Pennsylvania where they were yesterday, a key swing state in this election what are the vice president's plans, especially with her new running mate?",

And as a governing partner, those were some of the -- the most sought after skills when Vice President Harris was looking for her running mate, they will -- they will engage in this rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, which is in the western part of the state, stronghold of swing voters.And then they'll travel on to Detroit, Michigan for a series of events today and tomorrow, where the pair will essentially continue introducing Governor Walz to the crowd and to those critical voters to try to re-establish his Midwestern, his Midwestern bona fides to these voters who are so crucial to either party in their quest for an electoral victory in November. Of course, there was a very truncated vetting process that led up until this point, but the Harris-Walz campaign feels that at least the Democratic Party views the choice as a success, and just the last 24 hours racing 36 million in grassroots donations since having announced Governor Walz, and now there'll be traversing these battleground states to refine their message and to visit with these crowds of thousands of people who are coming out with new energy in the Democratic Party to see what this pair is all about. Now from here in Michigan, there's going to be a big discussion about some endorsement since from unions, specifically the United Auto Workers, whose leader Shawn Fain had previously endorsed President Biden and just in recent days has reiterated that support for Vice President Harris. That's a critical constituency in the state of Michigan, but, of course, there are questions about whether rank and file auto workers and workers and other unions share that support. Of course, they are going to be taking their message on the road, a message of what the campaign says is one of joy as they are trying to bring a more optimistic message to American voters than the hell fire and brimstone messaging of just a few weeks ago, Jim. We'll see how the crowd in Wisconsin receives it just few miles, as you mentioned, from where J.D. Vance, vice presidential candidate, on the other ticket is holding his own rally.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's some truth in what Vance says and there's a lot that's not true about it.For example, let's start with the first claim. The idea that somehow Walz who spent 24 years in the National Guard suddenly decided to get out of the guard so that he wouldn't have to ploy to Iraq. The truth is that he was in for 24 years. He had filed papers to run for Congress in February of 2005. He retired from the guard unit in May, and the orders to go to deploy didn't come for two more months. Now, could he have known about ahead of time maybe, but not in any official channels. So to suggest that somehow this proves that he was trying to dodge combat, that's simply not the case. We can note that J.D. Vance and his role was in a much more forward position, but also wrote himself that he never saw shooting combat and his time there. Nonetheless, as we move on, we can also look at this question of whether or not when Walz said in this one statement, it came out from the video from the Harris campaign, there was a statement about where he said he talked about carrying weapons in war. He is talking about gun control and he said the kind of weapons I carried in war. Well, the truth is, he was never in combat carrying weapons. You could say that when he was deployed during part of the Afghanistan conflict, when he was deployed to Italy, he was in a war zone, but not the way most of us think about it. He wasn't in a shooting situation where he was using a gun to shoot back at other people while they shot at him. In that sense, the criticism would be fairly well-founded. So as I said, a little truth, a fair amount of false would in this also, I think well see more of it as a campaign goes home though, Jim. Tom Foreman, thanks so much, for fact-checking. Well, it is a new presidential race and according to the latest polls, a closer one. A new Marist poll shows no clear leader between Harris and Trump nationally, but Harris narrowly leading Trump, and that is a change from margin of error polls that showed Biden typically trailing Trump by several points. Is this a honeymoon or is the race shifting and a lasting way and how if at all might Walz help or hurt her chances? Larry Sabato of the UVA Center for Politics is here with me now. Larry, good to have you on. You follow these numbers closely. We noticed that your prediction model made three rating changes just today. Minnesota now likely Democratic, from lean Democratic. Georgia, from leans Republican to toss up as well. But those are notable. That suggests you see this change -- this race is getting more competitive. Shifting towards Harris?",

So it's a critical state and that sense. What it suggests is that since President Biden withdrew, the Democrats have been in a bubble of exhilaration and excitement and we saw that as Walz was announced and that incredible rally that they have in Philadelphia, just amazing the energy there. This is having an impact. How can it continue? Because the Democratic convention is little more than a week away, the major part of it and that's a -- that's a TV commercial for a political party. The Republicans had their TV commercial and they benefited from it. The problem for them, obviously, Biden was still in and they've had to adjust to a completely new on it and ticket.",

It appears to have caught Russian forces off guard. This marks the first incursion of its kind by Ukraine in the now 2-1/2-year-old war. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has covered the conflict extensively from Ukraine. He joins me now from London. It's the first of its kind, a significant incursion across the border.

This is a whole different ball game though, Jim, it does appear that there are about three to four miles inside of Russia possibly deeper towards a town called Sudzha.Now it is entirely clear from what we can see from the videos we're getting what the target of this raid was. Certainly, as you said, huge embarrassment to the Kremlin who've called it a major provocation and claimed that Ukrainian forces are firing indiscriminately towards the civilian and residential areas. A bit rich, given Russia's history of that in the last two years in Ukraine. But the chief of staff of Russia, Valery Gerasimov, had said, look, we've halted this advance, but videos from the ground show a different picture of Ukrainian forces potentially in multiple directions here. Sudzha, it seems have forces inside of it, called very tense by its mayor. And I think a feeling here that Ukraine has a lot of momentum moving inside that border area. We don't know the size of this force or quite what its target was. Distraction, certainly for Russia, that's seeing some success in the Donbas region, incrementally moving come forwards towards Ukrainian military hubs there. But there is a thought they might potentially here, Ukraine have a gas terminal in their sites near Sudzha. It is key for the transit of gas from Russia to Ukraine, to Europe. It seems to still be functioning, but that may be one of the larger infrastructure goals here.

You have to have resupply, and you have to have ways to get food, water, fuel, all -- ammunition, all sorts of things to that force in anticipation of continued engagements with the enemy.I don't think -- I would -- I would say the odds are greater than 50 percent that this raiding force or this faint or demonstration, whatever you want to call it, depending on the mission, is going to be out of there shortly, probably with a few prisoners, probably after causing a little bit of damage and scaring the bejesus out of the Russian forces that are in that area, not expecting this kind of action.

And what that means is they had that big delay of weapons supplies and resupplies from the West, especially the United States that really clogged up their supply lines and delayed a lot of things.At the same time, President Zelenskyy made a lot of changes in his command and control structure. He made some announcements in terms of mobilizations of a large number of forces. The Russians have been trying to do that at the same time. But I would say the Russians are at a disadvantage because they don't have that many forces to push forward. Both sides are very, very fatigued after fighting through the winter, you know, you're now into the summer months and getting ready and preparing for the fall, where Ukraine is going to get more equipment, more ammunition, the F-16s are starting to flow in. They've been training new forces for a awhile. So yeah, right now, I would say it's not so much of a stalemate as it is a limited slugfest in a couple of small areas. Russia has continued to lose a lot of forces. So has Ukraine. And I think what we're waiting for right now is the after effects of mobilization of new forces on both sides, and the re-institution of those supply lines by Ukraine going to the front lines with what Western ammunition.",

This in the U.K. where social media is playing a major role in fueling days of violent riots across the United Kingdom and anti-immigrant misinformation campaign has been stoking outrage over something that took place last week, the stabbing in Southport, England, a stabbing that left three children dead. We could see a repeat of scenes like this from just this past weekend. Right now, far-right protesters and counter-protesters are planning action tonight. They are expected to target locations connected to asylum seekers and immigrants. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now from London. Clare, these scenes have been -- they've been alarming from so many cities in the U.K. And I wonder, do you see -- there's got to be an enormous amount of worry about plans tonight.

There is a heavy police presence.But what you're seeing behind me right now, just to be very clear, this is a counter protest. This is anti-racism groups. This is members of the local community, many of them Muslims, have come out to show and they are by the way standing in front of an immigration lawyers office that was on a list that was spreading online, part of a rumor spread by far right groups that they could turn out and target these officers. They have now effectively barricaded it. They are here to show that their voices are louder than the far right. What we've been hearing from people locally is that they want to be seen as peaceful, but they all very worried, I should say about the disinformation that you've seen. One person told me that she was afraid, not of the kind of violence breaking out here in London that we've seen in other cities. But the fact that disinformation online in itself could provoke that kind of violence. She wants to see more regulation. And, of course, there is a lot of pressure on the government to really come down on this end to make this violence stop. And we're seeing the policing, as I said, step up. But also, we saw three people sentenced today, one of them to three years in prison for the disorder caused initially in Southport and Liverpool. I think that's not just the severity of the sentencing with the speed event that is designed to be an effective deterrent. I think we're going to have to watch this evening to see if that is actually worked.",

Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has not been certified to do that just yet. That's what the debate is happen -- that's the debate that's happening right now at NASA, Jim. And what we learned today during a news conference that NASA held just a few hours ago, was that there is deep internal divisions within NASA about whether Butch and Suni should come home on Starliner and they need to make a decision fast because time is running out for them to make that decision. They say they need to decide by mid-August, which is, you know, just a little over a week away. And so, Jim, to your next point -- what are the options? If they can't come home on Starliner? And the answer to that is SpaceX. SpaceX's crewed Dragon capsule, which is currently attached to the international space station. It's a different vehicle and so what they would do is essentially there's another crew, and other NASA crew that's supposed to launch in mid-August, that was pushed back to September. So, what they would do so there were going to be for astronauts on that mission, they would take two of them off. So that when it launches, there's two empty seats. And then when that vehicle goes home, Jim, Butch and Suni would hitch a ride on that SpaceX crew Dragon capsule. But that would not take place until February of 2025. So, Jim, what started out as an eight-day mission, could extend to eight months.",

Dallas's lifetime of skateboarding has taken a toll on his body, on his mind, he never really made much money in his sport but he had a dream of becoming an Olympian. Again, he finished in the back of the pack at Tokyo Games, but he needed to find some clarity in life in order to become an Olympic Games. So, Jim, he traveled to the Peruvian jungles, met a shaman, did ayahuasca and went on this spiritual journey. He said, I saw dragons. I was flying with dragons. Whether it was that or just good old fashioned passion and hard work, he made it back. He said before these games, he already knew that he would probably come in last. He did in the preliminaries, but with all of his fist pumping and smiles after this ride, you thought he won gold. He said this is all about impressing mom who was cheering him on.
