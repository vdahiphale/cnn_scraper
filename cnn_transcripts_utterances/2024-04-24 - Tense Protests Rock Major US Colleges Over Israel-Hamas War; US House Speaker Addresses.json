Now, at this hour, the US House speaker is expected to call for the resignation of Columbia University's president, that's after meeting with Jewish students there. Mike Johnson is visiting the New York City campus along with some of the state's Republican lawmakers. You'll remember, it has been the site of tents for pro-Palestinian demonstrations for eight straight day it is now. The school told students on Wednesday that they will have the option of taking classes remotely for the rest of the semester, and that includes for all of their final exams. Now, Columbia says it is holding constructive talks with protest organizers about ways to try and ease these tensions. Protests are also going out, breaking out at other US universities. These images are from the University of Southern California, the police have been physically removing demonstrators. Melanie Zanona is on Capitol Hill for us and Isabel Rosales is at Brown University. Melanie, I want to start with you. In terms of the speaker actually being there and insinuating himself into this debate right now, what does he hope to achieve? Because as you can see, things continue to be very tense on the Columbia campus and on other campuses right across the country, really.",

He said he is planningto call and the university president to resign, and he is also going to be flanked by some New York Republicans who are part of this delegation, including some members who are in vulnerable districts up for re-election in 2024, but some Democrats have already pushed back on Johnson's visit and said he is trying to silence the anti-war and pro-Palestinian movement and are worried about a potential escalation here. Now, as you notice, this press conference, it was supposed to start a little bit ago, it has not yet started, so we are watching to see when he comes out, what exactly he all says here, but I would note that right now, calls are growing inside the GOP to restrict federal funding for universities that they feel aren't fighting antisemitism enough. So we could see that take the form of legislation in the coming days and weeks, and there you go, the Speaker starting right now.",

Of course, he wanted to expressed support for the Jewish students. He did meet with them earlier prior to the press conference. He did call on the university president to resign as we had expected, and he delivered a forceful speech, pushing back on antisemitism and condemning how many college campuses have dealt with this issue. Now, I will say that this increasingly has become a focus of the House Republican agenda. There have been multiple congressional hearings here on Capitol Hill focused on that exact issue. There were some university presidents who were grilled by Elise Stefanik, the House Republican conference here, who is also from New York and they ended up resigning in the wake of that hearing because they struggled to answer how they planned to combat antisemitism on their campuses. So I expect to see more of those hearing brings in the coming days. We could also see some legislation trying to restrict federal funding for college campuses that aren't doing enough in the eyes of members here to combat antisemitism, but we should also note the political moment right now for Speaker Johnson. He is delivering this press conference at Columbia University just days after he helps deliver this package of foreign aid bills, which included money, billions of dollars for Israel.",

We have been monitoring, certainly some kind of a confrontation  between campus security, police, and students there. You can see you on the ground the students who appears to be under arrest now. Now, earlier they had also arrested other students and you could hear the chants and you might still be able to see them there in the background. They are students who are basically yelling \"Let them go.\" Again in an effort to try and clear these campuses and obviously make it a safe space for everyone. There does seem to be a good deal of escalation going on there, both at the University of Texas, but also where for our Nick Watt is.

It was pretty chilled, but they were violating campus policies. So campus purity decided to move in to try to clear this area and that's when things got very ugly, very fast. Cussing at these officers, pushing, shoving -- it was physical. One person was then arrested, one protester taken to a squad car. The squad car was surrounded by protesters, chanting, \"Let him go, let him go, let him go.\" After a few minutes of that, an LAPD detective decided to let him go. We spoke to that detective clear that really the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. It was a minor infraction and that arrest was creating so much chaos, so that protester was released. Now the LAPD has been planning to come in to complete lately, clear this area. There are dozens of LAPD vehicles waiting just off campus to do that. Now, if that happens, the temperature may very well rise once again. For now, it is a passionate protest. It is a protest they say is in solidarity with what is happening at Columbia, and elsewhere across this country. Back to you, Paula.",

Thou shall not steal is a regulation against stealing, but it provides more equality, more opportunity for the rest of our society because they are free from the fear of theft.

The thing is the one thing that I think is driving some of the energy here as some of the anger was what the university did last week in ordering the NYPD to come in and clear and arrest those hundred students, those students who were part of the encampment. So I think that's what's driving some of the energy right now. It seems to be a big focus from faculty members to other students along with the fact of their demands concerning the university's divestment from Israel and any sort of relationship that the university has with businesses and companies that may be doing business or earning money from the work with Israel. So it's not entirely clear. But, Paula, I'll show you here. You can see this is where the encampment is. This is where all the tents that you're hearing the distance. There's probably about 50 to 75 tents still remaining in the encampment. The university told students last night that it's against regulations. Last time they did that, they had the NYPD come in and clear the tents. We don't have any indication that that's what's going to happen because certainly I think for the university, if they were to do that again, it would just be another escalation. And I think they're trying to handle in a sort of peaceful and calm way, and to avoid any kind of confrontation. The one thing that's happening here is actually the school was getting ready for graduation. You can see the bleachers here over my shoulder. These blue seats. This is for graduation in just a few weeks, on May 15th is supposed to be graduation. So there's going to come a point where the university is going to have to make a decision about what to do with the encampment because it's obvious that they would interfere in the graduation. The area on that lawn that they're on is supposed to be for graduating students, and the seating, and they've already built out one of the platforms. So that's what's going on. You know, we spent the day talking to more students today here. They don't care about graduation. You know, the students that are in this encampment, they said they're going to stay here as long as they have to until they get their demands met.",

It's worth noting that we have precedent for this, that even under the Trump administration the gay dating app Grindr actually came under ownership by Chinese parent company. The Trump administration demanded that it be sold. There was a concern that having that kind of user data in the hands of the Chinese government could lead to problems. And, you know, also we've, you know, kicked out essentially companies like Huawei from the United States on national security grounds.

But the thing is those apps aren't available in China to begin with. So it's a little bit of a false threat, a little bit of posturing, which only really serves to highlight that America's leading social media networks and content services like Facebook and Instagram and YouTube have been blocked in China forever. The most of those services have never operated, been able to operate in China. And so there's also I think a belief by some in Congress that here in the U.S. we maybe have been chumps a little bit. We've given access to the Chinese our market and they've denied us market access all along. And that's been an undercurrent in the debate as well.",

And so I don't expect this will be a years-long question. I think the legal questions will probably be somewhat expedited as a result of that. And so you'll see federal courts ruling on that. I believe somewhat quickly because of this year-long deadline. Then the question really becomes, if the government succeeds in court and I think they probably will, though I think it'll be close call, then the key question is, does the Chinese government allow TikTok to be sold? They've made a lot of posturing. They will not allow it to be sold. I think there would be potential U.S. owners, potentially other companies, maybe investor groups, but there's a fair argument that the Chinese government might just say, look, we're not going to allow this to be sold. We actually view this as a national security asset in the first place. And if they don't allow it to be sold, candidly, I think it might end up reaffirming the concerns that Congress had in the first place that drove this law.",

And collegeofficials have actually closed the gates of the campus and they're saying, if you're going to come on to campus expect to have to show ID. Of course, the concern is that outside agitators, not college kids, are going to join in and might make things a little more confrontational. We have, of course, seen some confrontation here already today when campus security tried to clear this area where we're now standing. That was diffused after the one arrested protester was released, but the LAPD is standing by. There are dozens of squad cars just off campus and the LAPD has told us that at some point they are planning to come in and clear this area. If that happens, I would expect that things might get little bit confrontational again. Now, the other issue here at USC, Paula, is that last week, the valedictorian, who was a young Muslim woman of Indian extraction, she was told that she will actually not be allowed to speak at the commencement because of a link from her Instagram to some pro-Palestinian literature that was very critical of Israel and seen by many Jews as racist against Israel. So she was told she wasn't likely to speak. So tensions here were already a little bit high. Then these kids here saw what was happening at Columbia and they decided to do this in solidarity with what is happening at Columbia and elsewhere in the country. So we're seeing a lot of kefirs, we're seeing a lot of Palestinian flags, a lot of chanting. For now, it is peaceful right now. It is a peaceful demonstration. It wasn't earlier. But right now peaceful -- Paula.",

It's the first proof that he survived serious injuries he sustained during his capture from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th. The clip is undated, but contains references suggesting it was filmed this week. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem and he's been following all of this for us. Jeremy, first and foremost, and really most importantly, what has been his family's reaction? The parents have been so brave and they've spoken to CNN several times, and yet this must have just been so startling for them.",

He was captured after attending that Nova Music Festival near the border with Gaza on October 7th. A video, the last video that we have seen of him was of him being taken hostage by Hamas militants on October 7th. His left hand severely injured. And in this video, which we are choosing not to air at this moment because hostage videos, these hostages are considered under duress when they are filming these videos, you can see that he is missing much of his left arm seemingly from that injury that he suffered on October 7th. He was actually in a shelter with other Israelis on that day where Hamas militants were tossing grenade after grenade after grenade in there. One of his friends successfully tossing several of those grenades out. But ultimately, he was seriously injured and he was taken hostage along with several others on that day. And now of course, while we -- this is the first proof of life that we have seen, we don't know exactly when this video was filmed, but at least for his family a sign of life and a call to action at the same time -- Paula.",
