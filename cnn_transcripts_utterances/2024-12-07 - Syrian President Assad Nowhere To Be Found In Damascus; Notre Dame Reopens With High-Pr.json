But one senior U.S. official tells our team, quote, \"The emerging consensus is that is an increasingly plausible scenario.\" Now leading the rebel advance in Syria is a group called HTS, a group defined as a terrorist organization by the United States.

So, Nic, what do we know about the whereabouts of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, what we know is that the rebels have been heading towards the capital as we know. And in fact, we just looked at some video, we're trying to verify it, that would show them sort of on the northern perimeter, but we also know they've been coming in from the southern perimeter. This is the very obvious forces that everyone will see on the road. Big convoys, gunmen, clearly troops on the move. What people will have been less well aware of other elements that the rebels have deployed to get an assessment of what's going on inside the capital and the feedback from them has been they are not able to locate Assad at the places that they would normally expect him to be at. They're not getting an indication that he's there. They don't know where he is. They continue to search for him. They have made -- getting to the capital, taking the capital, deposing Assad one of their aims. But at the moment, their forces still seem to be on the outskirts of the capital, although people within the capital are reacting, some residents are worried about the security situation that they're going to get into. Others are lighting fireworks in some of the suburbs of Damascus. Damascus, I have to say, and I spent -- have been there many times, is a very, very large city with major highways that run in and out of the capital. But it's that very central bit that the rebels are going to be focusing on, the old city, the presidential palace. A lot of the key government buildings and ministries right in the center of the city, the principal police stations, all of those locations are where they'll be aiming to get to. The whereabouts of Assad, though, obviously a key goal for them to figure out. Is he in the capital? Is he in the country? Has he fled? If so, who's harboring him?",

Obviously, the test comes when his group, under his leadership, has principal control over principal parts of the country, and how does that work with the other groups and what happens from there. But it does look like there will be a situation where his military has principal sway with the help of others, and there will be a period where a new political dispensation has to be found.

Now to Paris where the long awaited grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral continues at this hour. President-elect Trump is among the global leaders and dignitaries attending this celebratory event. Earlier today, Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the Elysee Palace. Today triumphant -- this triumphant reopening comes more than five years after the iconic cathedral was nearly destroyed by this devastating fire. We have a team of correspondents covering these developments. Alayna Treene is in Washington, D.C. but let's begin with Melissa Bell outside of Notre Dame in Paris. So, Melissa, this Medieval church has stood in Paris for more than 800 years. What does it mean today to France to have it reopen? MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think speaking to what it means to French people are the number of people who are out here tonight braving the elements which are really not in our favor. Thousands of people lining the banks of the River Seine. You can hear there the bells of Notre Dame ringing again. We just watched the Archbishop of Paris leading the procession out of Notre Dame after thanking the dignitaries on the front row including President-elect Donald Trump and President Macron, his wife Brigitte, and a number of others before he made his way out. After this very moving ceremony, moving not just to the world's Catholics, of course, Alisyn, not just to the French and the Parisians who've come out here tonight to pay to be here on this historic occasion. But of course, to people around the world. And what we saw at one point were the words thank you emblazoned in lights on the front of the cathedral in many different languages, because the outpouring of love, support, money that we've seen in the course of that five years is what's allowed for this restoration exactly as it was, only better. One of the main architects involved in this earlier pointed out that it wasn't really taking it back to five years ago before the fire when you look at the restoration and the quality of it, you were really going back to the 19th century when the spire was built. The church, the cathedral had been redone, cleaned and once again the inside is shining as it was. So a really powerful moment here in Paris and for those outside the cathedral braving the elements and inside who've heard not just those bells pealing, but what we just heard a moment ago the organ player furiously accompanying that procession with the sound of that organ once again restored to its former glory -- Alisyn.",

First Lady Jill Biden is there. The president is not. But she is representing the United States from -- and the White House from her point of view.Donald Trump, though, of course, still president-elect, is really, you know, coming back into this and allowing this event to be his return to the global stage and we also saw the pageantry that kind of accompanies that. One, I would argue, especially when we saw him pull up to the Elysee Palace to meet with President Macron, he essentially was greeted in the way that you would almost see a sitting president be greeted. A lot of the pomp and circumstance that comes with that, something I know that Donald Trump and his team was expecting and is very much pleased with, from what the reaction I've been getting in the hours since. But look, I also want to just talk about directly some of the meetings that he's having because, again, this is a big moment for Donald Trump. It's his first overseas trip since winning the election on November 5th, and the first time he is in person meeting with a lot of these foreign leaders who some of whom he had worked with before, including Macron, others that he has not. I've learned, I just recently learned that Donald Trump later today is going to actually be meeting with the prime minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, on the sidelines of this broader reception that Macron is holding for all of the, you know, some 50 heads of state that have gathered there for this reopening of the cathedral. I also am told that, you know, there's going to be a lot of leaders there. He's probably expected to mingle with them, but he is going to have a private meeting directly with Meloni. Interesting because of course she has been the leader of the Conservative Party, kind of stabilize that party over the last couple of years, and many people have almost seen her as someone who could kind of work with Donald Trump, given they have some like-minded views about the broader, you know, state of European affairs. Of course, one of the biggest things that we saw today was that meeting between Donald Trump, Macron and Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine. A lot of questions have really been, you know, circling over what Donald Trump is going to do about the war between Ukraine and Russia. Is he going to withdraw some of the aid that we've seen the United States sending? Is he going to try and end the war swiftly as he said? But what does that mean for what Ukraine may have to give up? So a lot of these questions that we're still waiting to hear some of the answers to -- Alisyn.",

And it's worth noting that especially over the course of the last couple of weeks he has almost been a bit reflective looking back on his four years as Defense secretary as that time comes to a close. And I think very much we can expect some more of the same.And that means highlighting some of the accomplishments we have seen from the Pentagon and from the Biden administration. They have really put a focus on, for example, the Indo-Pacific so I think we can expect to see him talk about the growing partnerships with Japan, South Korea Australia, the Philippines and others. That's been a big focus of his. He actually heads over to the Indo-Pacific right after his stop here. I believe they fly out tonight but that's not all of it. He'll talk about the efforts or is expected, I would think, to talk about the efforts that the Biden administration has made when it comes to not only trying to get to a ceasefire when it comes to Gaza and Lebanon, but the aid that has gone to Israel. But I suspect a big part of his speech will be focusing on Ukraine. First, why Ukraine is so important not only from a U.S. perspective, but also from an international perspective. We saw a lot of his speech last week at West Point talk about the importance of the countries that have come together, NATO and other countries, to support Ukraine. And crucially, why it matters for U.S. national security. It's worth noting that here at the Reagan Forum, the other person receiving that award is senator Mitch McConnell, and although there might be a party difference there, when it comes to Ukraine, there is very much a policy alignment. So we'll see if he references how similarly he and Senator Mitch McConnell think about when it comes to arming and aiding Ukraine against Russia and why that war doesn't simply end within the borders of Ukraine. I mentioned he's also been a bit reflective in terms of what he has done and his priorities. In his last speech at West Point he talked about the importance of women in the military, even sharing sort of a personal story from his own time when he served overseas in Iraq. Now that without naming the Secretary of Defense pick Pete Hegseth seemed to very much get at his questioning the value of women in the military. And there Austin kind of put his foot down and said they are incredibly valuable. They are incredibly important. And it would be foolish not to have them as part of the team. It will be interesting to see if he goes that direction or another direction again. Again, these are his closing weeks as the secretary of Defense, and in doing so he's looking not only at the past four years, but also, I think, trying to make sure there's not only a peaceful transition, but showing what the priorities have been as you look into the future.",

But at the same time, you know, there are still mistakes he made. He made the mistake of going into the Starbucks and leaving his forensic evidence behind there with the DNA, with the fingerprints. He was inside the youth hostel and despite the fact that he had his mask on most of the time, he still had his hands on things there which left more fingerprints.
