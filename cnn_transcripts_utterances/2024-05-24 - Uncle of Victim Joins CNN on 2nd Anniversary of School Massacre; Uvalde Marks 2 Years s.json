As far as like the school board election, you know, the people, the community came out of the supported, they sent a strong message that they wanted a voice there. They wanted somebody that could hopefully bring some kind of understanding and healing in, in sort of men things, its difficult as may be, but it's going to hopefully mend that division is within their community.

You know, I can only imagine what he deals with at night, you know, as he drives home, as he tries to cemetery today and to be with his daughter is going to be very tough. But to answer your question, there has no there has not been any type of accountability. There has been little things, for example, significant things, right. But they're small things as well. It's the changes that are coming, you know, the agreement that they had, the work that they're going to be doing with the community. That's, that's hopeful and it's promising. But ultimately, you would want the people that fill these children and teachers to pay the ultimate price that is to be going through the court system and being held accountable in some way where the public can hear their justification as to why they stood behind their door and didn't even try to open that door.

But I'm very upset with Speaker Johnson because of his snub of President Ruto last night. He's the first African Head of State to be here in almost 18 years or since anyone has had been able to address the full session of Congress. And to have him snubbed in the way that he was just shows disrespect, I think, of an African nation, as you see that all of us that have come have been honored with reference to being at a joint session of Congress. So for the speaker to make this announcement, even while President Ruto is here and snubbed him, just seems to me that speaker Johnson is just playing political games here.",

We've United Democrats and Republicans coming together to make sure because, we have no stronger ally, then in the middle east, then Israel, and we've stood by them all of the way.

She also claims that she was drugged. Now I have obtained a statement from April lampposts. This is what she tells us here at CNN, Kate. She says, quote, I'm confident that justice will prevail, and the veil will be removed, so no other woman will have to wonder what I did. Now I have reached out to Diddy's team. I have not heard back yet. This is the second lawsuit Kate, just to come this week of course, following the exclusive surveillance footage that we released here at CNN last week. So we all know that Diddy release that apology video after the surveillance footage came out. But since then, and since these two new lawsuits have come out, both accusing him of very graphic sexual assault. Now he has been silent, I have followed up with his team many times.
