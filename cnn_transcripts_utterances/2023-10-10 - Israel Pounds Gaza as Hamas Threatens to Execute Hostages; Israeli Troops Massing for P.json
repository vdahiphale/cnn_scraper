Now, take a look at this. We are showing you new drone video of destruction inside of Gaza City. We are told up to 150 hostages, including children and likely Americans, are believed to be held right now in Gaza after being kidnapped by Hamas militants during that invasion of Israel. Hamas is threatening to kill them and to televise it.",

The Israeli military reported it found the bodies of around 1,500 Hamas fighters inside Israel. The death toll continues to rise on both sides of the border. At least 900 people have been killed in Israel. Nearly 800 Palestinians are now reported dead. Clarissa Ward is live on the ground near the Israel/Gaza border.

We have just heard in the last couple of minutes the Iron Dome being activated. We also heard coming from that direction intense gunfire at one point and they have completely, Israeli forces, blocked off the road behind me there, saying it is still not safe for people to cross the road, that they are still engaged in various operations to try to clear it.This is interesting because the IDF had previously said that they do think that they have cleared the entire area along this border. So, it's difficult to know that with 100 percent clarity. But if we move over here a little bit, we will try our luck, because they have been trying to push us back, but we've been seeing -- hopefully, you can run some of that video that we shot. We've been seeing a huge amount of armor coming through. We saw tanks coming through. A lot also of Israeli security personnel coming through. You can probably see as well, I don't know if Clayton Nagel (ph), our photojournalist here -- that's the body of a Hamas fighter. So, this was the scene, one of dozens of breaches along this border where Hamas militants burst through and started creating havoc and mayhem and the bodies of the civilians and Israeli soldiers killed in the battles have been removed. But the Hamas militants, we notice their bodies have been left out. It's been a few days now, obviously. And so, yes, I would say it's still tense here, definitely. Still hearing that gunfire. Still hearing that Iron Dome, and still not clear that this area despite previous statements has been totally cleared -- Phil, Poppy.",

      "sentences": "Well, joining us now to help us understand where exactly this conflict is unfolding, former NATO supreme allied commander, General Wesley Clark.General Clark, we appreciate your time. I want to start with -- we are taking a look at the map of the region itself. And, obviously, we have been talking predominantly about Gaza here. But what I want to talk about right now is where the actual attacks that we saw over the weekend happened. If you give people a sense of the ongoing conflict, where people like Clarissa, Nic Robertson have been, these kibbutzes, what exactly they represent and why this is at a scale that we just simply hadn't seen before? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER:  Well, first of all, this is a large number of people who penetrated a secured border. They used heavy equipment to get through there. And then they shot and killed indiscriminately and took hostages. So, this is -- Gaza is 2 million people. It's 25 miles roughly north to south. And what you are looking at in Gaza at the northeast corner of Gaza is where most of the conflict apparently was. But that doesn't mean that there is not a threat elsewhere. So you try to put an armored force, mechanized force around that spot, 25 miles north to south, six miles or so in depth, that takes a lot of forces 24 hours a day. That's the first thing to do, is to isolate the area. And then while we're -- what we're watching is the IDF aircraft taking out known targets. There are only so many targets. I have run an air campaign. It's difficult to continue to develop targets during something like this. So then that's going to slow down. So, Israel is probably going to have to go in on the ground. And that's going to be the real challenge. How well is Hamas organized on the ground? Can they defend block by block? Are they discombobulated now as a result of the bombing? Have enough of the leadership been taken out so that the Israelis can penetrate and clear quickly, block by block, or is it going to be a terrible fight with snipers in every building and drones and RPGs and so forth? We don't know that yet. Israel has to be prepared for that. So this is going to be a tough fight. At the same time, if you look to the north, you have Hezbollah. You have Syria. You have threats in the north, already some penetration of the border, forces deployed up there. This could be a weeks-long, amongst-long occupation? Gaza. And at the end of it, still have those 2 million civilians to deal with. What's the end result? How is Israel going to handle this now since Hamas has to be eliminated? Some really tough strategic, diplomatic and military issues here.",

      "sentences": "So, the way this would have to be done is to section it off and clear it step by step. And it all depends on what's left standing after the aerial bottom bombardment and artillery and tank fire, so forth. So, where is enemy fire going to come from? You have got to know the street maps. You've got to figure out where you can penetrate, what you can hold, and then you've got to work back to clear it.And what we haven't talked about is the tunnel network. We know there is a tunnel network here, a deep tunnel network and multiple tunnels. So you have to believe that you've got to go into the basements. You've got to really work this. Otherwise, the enemy is going to come up from behind you. So in the middle of all this are the civilians running around, moving around. You can't tell necessarily the civilians from the enemy fighters. They're not going to be in uniform. They're not going to wave their flags at you. They're not going to identify themselves. They're going to wait and they're going to try to attack from the side, from the top with drones. They're going to attack at night if they can. So this is going to be a brutal, tough fight, and that area is big enough -- it's not a day -- this is not like when the United States ran into Baghdad and the Iraqi opposition collapsed. This is an armed populace, maybe 40,000 people with weapons in there, who are waiting for the Israelis to come in. And if you think about it from the Hamas standpoint, this is a 1-2 fight. It's first to provoke the Israelis, do as much damage as you can, throw them off balance, and then draw them in where you can pulverize them in urban combat, which is the toughest kind of combat for an armored force or western armored force trying to protect civilians and not create unnecessary damages, finds its hostages, preserve it's own force from needless casualties. It's a very tough operation the Israelis are moving into. They have got to take it step by step and they have to got toe think through not only the tactics of going block by block, but what's the end game here. And this is something the United States has to be helping with right now.",

Supporters of both the Israeli and Palestinian causes held competing rallies yesterday inciting both in the US and overseas.On the University of Florida campus, at least 30 people were injured last night. A witness says around 1100 people had gathered for this candlelight vigil last night when someone fainted. That startled people and they started shouting and calling 911. The confusion triggered a panic and sent the crowd running for their lives. People fell on top of one another, some were trampled. The injuries treated at the hospital include broken ankles and ribs, concussions, and minor cuts. Thankfully, no life-threatening injuries have been reported. Joining us this morning to talk about what we're seeing around the world and what is happening right now on the ground, are CNN Chief International Anchor, Christiane Amanpour, editor-chief of The Forward, and former New York Times Jerusalem Bureau Chief Jodi Rudoren, and also the host of the Mo News Podcast, Mosheh Oinounou.

The question is, as the Israelis go, know what Christiane laid out there was the short term, which is to get the hostages home and deal with Hamas's capabilities. Long-term, who are you replacing them with? What does Gaza look like?Israel has no interest in reoccupying the place, but who's running the place? Who's running the place and who do they ensure that the residents there feel has legitimacy that wasn't placed there by the US or Israel? So, there are a lot of questions as they deal with the crisis at the moment. But really, what is the strategy long term? They have to focus there because I think if there's mission creep if things evolve, that's where you'll start to see potential support from the US and other allies start to slip.",

      "sentences": "So this is very, very difficult because separate to this and in the weeks and months leading up, particularly as Netanyahu has been really catering to his far-right flank and there has been a lot of violence in the West Bank, a record number of Palestinians have been killed this year in violence that was separate to what we're talking about now.There's a lot of incursions, there's a lot of settler violence, there's a lot of Palestinian violence. It's just a lot of violence in the occupied West Bank. And the question is, I have spoken even in the aftermath of this terrible massacre that we've seen over these last few days, two former Israeli Prime ministers, for instance, to former Israeli officials, to the current leader of the opposition Labour Party and to the current IDF spokespeople. And certainly, former prime ministers are saying that listen, we have to be able to talk to the Palestinian Authority. It is not an option to just leave this, to keep simmering when this is all said and done, when we see what happens after the outcome of this war that's been declared now, it cannot go back to status quo ante. There has to be some kind of political resolution and that has been completely ignored for many years because the wall between Israel and the West Bank has dropped the number, the amount of violence into Israel in the last few years. The United States has not had its eye on this region for a long time. And this idea of trying to get Israel and all the other Arab countries in the region to somehow normalize, well, that hasn't worked in terms of tamping down the actual existential crisis inside the Israeli- Palestinian territories, which is that that is, according to Israeli security people, the existential crisis that faces Israel. So, after this is over, as I've been told by all these former and current officials, including IDF, as to where was the army on the day of Saturday the 7th, all these questions have to be answered. But they're not answering them right now because they have the military objective and the military momentum right now. But these are very important questions, including the fear of a wider conflagration and how that is going to be avoided.",
