      "sentences": "An extraordinary request in an extraordinary case. That's tonight on Newsnight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillips in New York. Tonight, the special counsel bets big on the Supreme Court. How big of a bet? Well, every single check and balance on all presidents just might be at stake. Jack Smith is wagering that the justices will side with him. He's wagering that the high court will see the wisdom in answering this question sooner rather than later, is Donald Trump immune from prosecution? Now, the special counsel writes like he's running out of time, and in a way he is. The normal appeals process would give no guarantee that the high court considers the immunity question before next November. Now, that is, I don't have to remind you, when America chooses its next president. How the court rules may reshape democracy as we know it. The justices have never said yes or no, that a president can be criminally prosecuted for crimes they perpetrated while president. A ruling that the Constitution does not offer a get out of jail free card would put Trump in immediate election altering legal peril. But a ruling that the Constitution puts a legal bubble around presidents would make Trump and anyone who follows him in the Oval Office truly above the law. Joining me in moments are two of Trump's former lawyers. But first, joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. She's a member of the House January 6th Committee and she also worked for Congressman Don Edwards in 1974 when President Nixon was facing impeachment. Congressman Lofgren, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I want to start by just asking are you concerned about this precedent that could be made from the Supreme Court for future presidents if they decide against Special Counsel Jack Smith? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, that would be extraordinary. And really, the precedent is U.S. v. Nixon. I was actually on the staff and in Washington when that case was decided. And the decision was that the president doesn't have absolute immunity. And in that case, of course, Nixon was required to hand over the tapes and then, of course, resign shortly thereafter. You know, this court has occasionally strayed from precedent, but it would be really shocking if they did so in this case.",

But what it did do was show that, in eight weeks from the time that the written (INAUDIBLE) pending before judgment was filed to the time the Supreme Court ruled was eight weeks. And the Supreme Court's no stranger to that, because that's what they did back then. So, they ruled at that point in time in eight weeks on that case.So there's really no downside for Jack Smith taking on this matter and aggressively pursuing it.

District -- the D.C. Court of Appeals, and then go on to the Supreme Court without hearing that -- without having that intermediate appeal.And that is certainly an extraordinary measure. It doesn't happen all the time, but like I said, back in Nixon, it did happen, and it only took eight weeks. So, I think this court is going to take careful judgment on that. I'm not sure whether he's successful or not. It all depends on whether this court really wants to hear from the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit is filled with kind of Supreme Court justices in waiting. A lot of the Supreme Court justices, you know, over the years have come from the D.C. Circuit Court. They may want to respect that process. But in the end, I think a compelling argument is going to be made here for the speedy trial provisions and in the public's interest to get this thing over with, if either he has immunity or he doesn't, and the Supreme Court's going to have a roll on it either way.

You would have to assume that this court, which actually has been quite unhappy and vociferous in some instances, that the way Donald Trump has railed against the judiciary, decided against him, ordered him to turn over his tax returns, has not been very favorable to him. I think we can perhaps expect that this is going to be a judicial consideration based by the justices on their reading of the law and precedent. Maybe an exception might be Clarence Thomas, who probably ought to recuse himself, but probably won't. But, you know, we don't know what's going to happen.If indeed, Trump is upheld in maintaining that he is above the law, that executive privilege holds in this instance, he's not subject to the same laws and the same procedures as other citizens of the United States, then, of course, some of these cases are going to go away. But not only will some of these cases go away, but the majesty of Nixon versus the United States will disappear. PHILLIP: What about if the other thing happens, if he is not found to be immune?

And now we find him engaged with the highest court in the land. He's already engaged with the Congress.So, we have a situation in which we have a country that is fixated, and the media, and social media, which is fixated on Donald Trump to an extent that no former president, even Nixon, has ever been the subject of. And so we have to look at a phenomenon that we don't know what this means for this country. What we know is that this accused criminal, this former president of the United States who was accused of really sedition, the first American president to be accused of sedition, to undermine the very electoral system that he was sworn to uphold, that he could become the next president of the United States. This is a moment unlike anything. Let me just talk about Richard Nixon for one second. Richard Nixon was also an ex-president who dominated his time as an ex-president. Gerald Ford's presidency was held hostage to some extent by the whole issue of him pardoning Nixon.

Because we all know, any of us who have reproductive lives know that these do not fall into very simple boxes. Life is messy, complicated, unexpected, and especially when a pregnancy is involved.

So, obviously we mentioned Michigan, we mentioned Georgia. Take a look at your end, Arizona, perhaps the big one here, Pennsylvania, the Keystone State. The fact is, Abby, you can go building your electoral map. You can build it in many different ways, right?We spoke about it in slide one, building in the South with Georgia, building in the North with Michigan. But if you lose all these states, if you're Joe Biden, look, I like doing a lot of electoral college permutations. There isn't one that I can really think of where if Donald Trump wins these states that Joe Biden could potentially possibly win.",

And that was something that Joe Biden did in 2020 that Hillary Clinton could not do in 2016. So, take a look here.This is an average of independent voters in Georgia, Michigan. In 2020, in those exit polls, look at that. Joe Biden won those voters by eight points. Look at the margin that Donald Trump is putting up here. He is winning them on average by 18 points.",
