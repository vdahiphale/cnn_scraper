They have the maintenance records. They've been recovered by investigators.But let's look at the timeline here in the NTSB preliminary report. On October 31, 2023, this plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines. What is interesting here is that there were a couple pressurization warnings in the cockpit that has to deal with the pressurized air inside the cabin, which came rushing out when the door plug came off. On the 7th of December there was a pressurization warning. Then again on January 3rd, two days before the door plug blowout, and on January 4th, the day before the door plug blowout. Now, the NTSB says these are unrelated to the door plug blowout, which was on January 5th. But the new question to ask here is, would these warnings have triggered a deeper investigation during this maintenance check that was originally scheduled for the night of the door plug blowout on January 5th? Alaska Airlines is disclosing this for the first time after this reporting by \"The New York Times.\" And Alaska says in a statement, \"we remain confident in our maintenance and safety actions leading up to the incident and we look forward to continuing our participation in a robust investigation led by the NTSB so that this does not happen again.\" Only the start of what will be a huge probe by the National Transportation Safety Board.
