So I do believe that we are going to meet this. We have no choice. We have the 2028 Summer Olympics ahead of us in Los Angeles. The Secret Service will be responsible for the security planning of that. That is going to require a tremendous amount of personnel, a tremendous amount of resources, and a tremendous amount of collaboration with state and local and other federal partners. We are going to get there. We are getting there now. We have filled all of our training classes going into this next fiscal year. So we're getting there. We have turned the corner. We're showing those metrics to Congress. And I think that's the question that they've had. And we are going to show them that we can deliver on this.",

What was the plan? And how did it fail?And then also, secondly, you keep talking about a paradigm shift. But what does that mean? Can you kind of detail what you mean by that? ROWE: So with respect to the AGR building -- and that's where you're going for, right? When we construct a site, not only were you worried about what -- who can get into a site, but also who can look into that site. So there should have been clearer direction about what we needed done at the AGR building. That -- that was discussed during the advance, but I think there was a lack of follow-through on -- based on the information I have now and what I'm seeing. There should have been better follow through on -- in some aspects of that about access control to that property, about access control to the collateral property of the AGR building. And so it was about not giving the state and locals clearer direction on what we needed done. With respect to the paradigm shift, this is about looking at the organization holistically. For example, the communications issue. Communications we're problematic. And I think what we're -- I'm looking at is we need to have communications that are more closely aligned to the operations. And so coming out of July 13th, what I've seen and the direction I gave is we have to be very -- we have to be very efficient with where we're putting our security rooms. Recently, I was on a visit where, again, similar to Butler, where there was a unified command post. Just as there was in Butler, there was one at this location, where not only did you have emergency services in so far as fire life safety, but you had emergency management officials. You had the highway patrol and the state police in that room. You had local law enforcement in that room. You had Secret Service agents in that room monitoring frequencies and listening to what was going on in those state and local networks. In addition to that, the locals were flying a drone in proximity to the site. That drone feed was being beamed into that unified command post. And our agents had total domain awareness about what was going on. Also, they had traffic cams. They're able to pipe in those traffic cams into that unified command post. That is the model by which our field -- they have taken this to heart. And those special agents in the field are now having those conversations and they are directing exactly what we need and they're posting are people exactly where we need to be. So that when our protectees or in a sight, we have total awareness of what's going on around us, and we have total aware fairness of what's being communicated on those local networks.",

But what I will tell you is that our model, our protective model, consists of multiple layers and redundancies, the outer, the middle, the inner. Those are the layers.

And also then to communicate both the expectations ahead of time and the follow-up with them before the event. And then, during critical moments, as the situation became a threat. And then it evolved into something that obviously became very much an emergency in that assassination attempt that we saw. He said it wasn't a lack of resources. It was a failure to anticipate a possible threat. And he said that there were line-of-sight issues that were acknowledged, but they just weren't addressed.",

And that's something that I think Rowe alluded to today as well, talking about a paradigm shift that has to happen at the Secret Service.And that's not something that can be motivated simply by more resources or more money. Now he did say that the Secret Service is stretched incredibly thin from a personnel standpoint, that they don't have enough people to carry out the mission at the rate and at the level that they're doing now. He mentioned that both the president, Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, are all receiving that highest level of protection, that presidential level of security. And obviously, the sitting president received some additional resources from other agencies that are unique to president. That's like classified communication systems, that air support when they're flying through restricted airspace. But from a Secret Service level, Acting Director Rowe made very clear that Donald Trump receives exactly the same protection that President Biden does. And look, he didn't have a good answer for what additional resources or what that additional money are funding could have, how that could help resolve the issues that we're raised both on July 13th and also some of the issues that contributed to Sundays incident at Trump's golf course in Florida.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I thought that was an incredible statement.And so then just to sort of drill down on sort of the operational deficiencies that are clear here. I mean, the first is, of course, the advanced team planning. Those of us who are on air or looking at -- in July, we're looking at those pictures and say, how the heck was that building not within the security perimeter. And basically, everyone who had been at that site understood that that building needed to be within the security perimeter so that it would be clear that the state -- that the Secret Service would have to protect it. So I thought -- and that that seemed to be the area where the director said people are now -- Secret Service agents are now under review. And that -- that would have happened, you know, days before. The second is command and control. So people were, I think, surprised during the first assassination attempt, how much the Secret Service works with state and locals. It's quite common. Think about the roads near an area where you have a president, you need state and local assets. The director said too much reliance on them, which seemed clear. You had a lot of state and locals there that -- that the Secret Service might have been the better law enforcement agency. And secondly, it was not -- the Secret Service was not making it clear what the state and locals ought to do. And I think that confusion, who was in charge of that roof became clear as we learn more. Finally, third is just what we call situational awareness, which is, in real time, did the Secret Service and state and locals and everyone else know what was going on. It is clear people were picking up their phones and calling about a guy on a roof. I have to tell you, I've done a lot of mega-event planning. There are platforms that all of us use in which communication is direct, it is simple, it is, there's a guy on the roof and everyone knows. Why people we're picking up their phones may be that complacency that the director was talking about. So that's the three sort of big operational takeaways from -- from the presser.",
