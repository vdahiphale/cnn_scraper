Tomorrow night, President Biden goes on a trip to Poland to deliver that message himself. His visit comes on the heels of the Munich Security Conference where the U.S. staked out some hardnosed positions on several fronts, accusing Russia of crimes against humanity and warning China not to provide lethal aid to Russian troops in Ukraine. Let's go to the White House, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, tell us about the new emergency funds for earthquake relief first before we get to what's been happening on the foreign policy front.",

Let's start with the president's trip to Poland. How high are the stakes, do you think? And you know, I asked Priscilla about this. She said no, the White House is saying no, he's not going to make this trip over to Ukraine. How big of a message would that send if he were to do that? I know we tend to ask these questions and it drives the White House crazy when we asked it. But he's going to be in the neighborhood. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jim. I would suspect there is going to be probably if not a trip into Ukraine, there's going to be a meeting with the Ukrainian leaders. But even just the trip to Poland, because Poland is such a close NATO ally, and it's neighbors with both Russia and Ukraine, and has been a critical supporter of Ukraine over the past year. They have provided I think it's close to $4 billion in military aid and they've taken on 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees into Poland. Jim, when I was in U.S. Army Europe, Poland was the place I went the most, because they are such a critical ally and they are becoming one of the leaders of the European Union, as well as NATO.",

It's time to find someone who will espouse his policies on the Republican Party supports, which is focusing on the economy and inflation and security and education. Focus on those policies but do so in a less toxic tone and a more positive way. And I think what we saw with Nikki Haley and her announcement speech, she has a more positive tone. She wants a generational change for this country, and not just in terms of age, but in tactic. And we're also going to see a similar tone from Tim Scott, a senator also from South Carolina, as he goes out there and connects with the people.
