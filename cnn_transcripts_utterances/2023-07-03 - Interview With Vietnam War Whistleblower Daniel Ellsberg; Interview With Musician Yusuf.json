I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The 20th anniversary of the Iraq War this week reminds us all of the critical importance of holding governments to account. Fast forward to today, and autocrats are waging wars around the world, from Russia's latest yearlong invasion of Ukraine to Iran's battle with its own people, the brave women and men taking to the streets there remind us of the power and value of speaking truth to power. Whistleblowing plays a crucial role in this pursuit. Without it, unjust wars begin and injustices go unchecked. Daniel Ellsberg is probably the patron saint of them all. Anyone who knows anything about America's misguided war in Vietnam knows his name to this day because of one giant leap of courage and conscience, leaking the Pentagon papers in 1971 at great personal risk changed the course of that history by revealing America's secretly knew the war was unwinnable. 50 years later, Ellsberg is still deeply committed to peace and transparency. But this month, at almost 92, he revealed his latest personal battle after being diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer. And so, when he joined me from Berkeley, California, we talked about his life, this farewell moment and above all, how to save lives by speaking out. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

Harm to others, it's being done. Something they wouldn't do on their own, but if their leaders call for virtues of obedience, that we all regard as virtues, virtues, courage, patriotism, loyalty, all can be harnessed to very bad causes. That's true of at least one side, usually both sides, on any war. And you see courage on both sides. And yet, humans can be called on to do things with their group that they know they're wrong, but they can tell themselves, maybe it isn't. Maybe there's some reason that explains all this, and what do I know? It was reading 7,000 pages of top-secret documents in \"The Pentagon Papers.\" I was one of the few who read them all. I had worked on one of the volumes, 1961. But reading them all, I realized that people inside had known year after year that what we were doing was -- at the level we were doing it, was doomed to fail, to result in a stalemate, an escalating stalemate. By the way, I would say Russia, Russian armed forces have to be filled right now, with generals down to corporal who say, this isn't working.

I wanted them to see that in a business-like way, this is one, two days out of 100.

I didn't think it would work, So, it -- in retrospect, when we know what he was doing, he was trying to shut me up because he feared that I had plans, I had documents to document what I was saying about his administration. \"The Pentagon Papers\" ended in a friend, by Roger Morris, had seen the target folders for nuclear attacks in North Vietnam. I didn't have that because none of those aides who knew that did give the documents, even when they resigned later over Cambodia. As usually, they didn't take documents.

From my perspective, the technology of engagement is generally good if you take the guardrails around and you keep the most extreme cases off the platforms. But my point about generative A.I. is these systems are going to soup up engagement and soup up your attention. There's an old phrase about what the currency of the future in economics is attention, and these systems are looking for your attention as a consumer. So, every time you go, oh, my God. I had no idea, remember that it's trying to get you to have that reaction. Now, going back to the generative A.I. combined with large language models, it's going to do some other things that are particularly powerful, it will be able to generate insights and ideas that we as humans have not had. Think of them as existing as savants. If I'm a physicist, I'll have a savant that runs around and suggests physics problems for me to work on and that sort of thing. All of that is very good.

My whole world was we get computers to do things because we tell it what to do, and step by step, and they got better and better, butthat's fundamentally the as built environment that we all use today. With machine learning, which has been, I say in its current version available in one form or another for about a decade, instead of programming it, you learn it. So, the language that you say is, can we learn what the right answer is? It started off with classifiers. Where you'd say, is this is zebra or a giraffe, and that got pretty good. Then, a technology called reinforcement learning came along, which has allowed us to sort of figure out what to do next in a complicated multiplayer game. And now, these large language models have come along with this massive scale. But the way to understand how you would both strengthen large language models and constrain them is to learn how to do it. So, in the normal taxonomy, you would describe, we have this big thing that's doing weird stuff. We want to learn what it's doing so we can stop it doing the bad things. The problem with learning what it's doing is since its behavior is emerging as you have to run it for a while to understand and then, you have to have humans decide, this is bad, right? So, the way chatGPT was so successful is that they invented a technique which ultimately involved humans telling it good, bad, good, bad. So, it wasn't fully done by computers. The problem with good, bad, good, bad with humans is eventually that doesn't scale. But here's the real problem. So, far, that sounds pretty good. But in a situation where all of the software is being released, there are what are called raw models, which are unconstrained. And the people who have played with the raw models say that they are -- these are ones that you and I can't get to as normal users, say they're very frightening. Build me a copy of the 1918 bird flu virus. Show me a way to blow up this building and where to put the bomb. Things that are very, very dangerous appears to have been discovered in the raw versions of the models. Here's the --",

And so, if you give ita strongest -- a strong enough objective function to really surface the most interesting answer that may overwhelm the system that's trying to keep it under control and within appropriate guardrails. These problems are today unsolved. The reason we don't know how this work is there are essentially collections of numbers. People have looked very hard at where -- essentially activation nodes, we're inside the matrix and there are areas that seem to control the outcome. But when you look at it on a microscope, in the computer sense, you get the same sort of confusion if you look at a human brain. In a human brain, you say, where did that thought come from? And you can't find it. It's the same is true in these large language models so far.",

So, China, of course, has efforts in generative A.I. and large languages, morals as well. They also have large efforts in quantum and biology, which are doing well. They're already ahead of us in 5G. They're ahead of us in financial services and in terms of batteries, new energy, all the things that you use in your electric car. So, we should take them as a strong competitor. In the case of large language models, they have not been as advanced as the American companies have, American and U.K. companies, for reasons I don't fully understand. One idea that I would offer is that the large language models, because they are unpredictable today, cannot be offered to the public in China because the Chinese government does not want unfettered access to information. In other words, how do the Chinese government know that these systems are not going to talk about Tiananmen Square or something, which is not possible to talk in an area of lack of free speech. So, we will see. But at the moment, they're trying to catch up but they are behind. We recently put in some restrictions on hardware, which will slow them down, but not by much.",

If you are an author or authoritarian dictatorship, you know, let's say a really bad one, you would use thesetechnologies to both surveil your citizens but also manipulate them, lie to them, misinformed them, tell them things which are falsehoods, cause them to be motivated against national fears, all of the things that governments and ideologues do in that case. If you're a democracy, you're going to use it, first, to try to improve your business situation and also because you believe in free speech, you're going to allow people to say what they think. The dangers to both are obvious. For their autocracy, it will so compound their control that it could lead to a revolution inside the autocracy. People don't want this kind of restrictions that are possible. In a democracy, as we've discussed, the concept of being able to flood the zone, right, the ability for a single individual to define the narrative who shouldn't otherwise have that kind of power is very palpable in these technologies. And it's really important that we understand that human nature has not changed. If you show someone a video, and you say to them, this video is false. At some basic level, there's evidence that they still believe it to be true. And you tell them upset -- upfront, pictures that have been seen cannot be unseen. Videos that have been seen cannot be unseen. We have to confront the fact that humans are manipulable by these technologies and we need to put the appropriate safeguards in place to make sure that we as a body of populists are not so manipulated to the wrong outcome.",
