      "sentences": "Welcome to our continuing coverage Israel at War. I'm Anderson Cooper in Tel Aviv tonight alongside John Berman in New York, or short time ago, we received this new video showing Israeli tanks and military personnel near the border with Gaza. The IDF said today its increasing his airstrikes on Gaza and its top commander told his forces quote, \"will enter the Gaza Strip\". Last hour the international spokesman for the IDF told me that quote, their general spirit is one of combat readiness and a very clear resolve and what needs to be done, obviously no mention of timing of any kind of ground operation.That scene is similar to what CNN's ground team saw with its own eyes earlier today. They witnessed dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers and bulldozers, the kind of vehicles you would expect to see in any possible ground operation headed into Gaza. We should point out our team saw other locations just like this one. All in all, CNN saw hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles. When President Biden was asked today whether he was encouraging Israelis to delay a possible invasion, he would only say and I quote, \"I'm talking to the Israelis.\" Now this comes as trucks carrying food, water and medicine were finally allowed to cross into Gaza from Egypt, Palestinian officials as well as the World Health Organization saying it is not nearly enough. Moments ago, we heard Clarissa Ward reported that negotiations are ongoing to try to allow at least as 100 trucks a day to cross that that southern border into southern Gaza. That would be five times as many as we're allowed in today. Lot to get to in the next hour. Nic -- Nic Robertson is on the ground in Stuart Israel. What has been happening tonight where you are Nick?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Cup of -- cup -- another couple of huge explosions just now coming from the direction of Northern Gaza. Hard to tell what is precisely being head. But we do know the tempo of those strikes has been up tonight compared to yesterday compared to the day before. And that certainly accurately reflects what the IDF is telling us that they are going to increase that their airstrikes into Gaza. And this is to make their troops safer on the ground.So where are those troops on the ground at the moment, and it does seem that they are poised just on this side, the Israeli side of the Gaza border fence. It's very hard to get access to them, at least on the eastern edge of Gaza, because we took a big long tour down there today to try to compare and contrast what we'd seen a week and a week or so ago. You know, I think what we saw the very early phases after the 7th of October was a real rush of heavy equipment and armor and you could see it on the trucks coming in and a lot of reservists. You could go outside some of the military bases down there, not far from Gaza, and see hundreds, probably thousands of vehicles, civilian vehicles belonging to reservists who showed up at bases to, you know, to come and join the army and be ready for an incursion. That sort of sense of momentum isn't there. But in places, for example, where we saw tank units at the side of the road not far from Gaza, doing last minute repairs on tanks just a couple of days ago, they're gone. It's impossible to say, have they gone forward closer to the border or are they on pause and gone back to bases. But that sense of what Israel requires to have an incursion and having it in place and ready to go? It definitely feels as if we're at that moment. But it's but it's very hard to make that assessment. And it -- and by all accounts, it does seem very hard for Israeli politicians to make the best judgment of when -- of when the military who will make their best judgment in military terms of when it's right to good politicians with the background of hostage release over, you know, the past 24 hours of some humanitarian aid discussion of more aid going in. That does seem to sort of be a factor in perhaps why the ground incursion hasn't happened yet, Anderson.",

The IDF has indicated that there were a couple of operatives there in Jenin who they were aware of that were planning some kind of operation. And with that real time intelligence, it appears that they chose to strike that loss.Now we've seen in this past year, and I went into Jenin after one of the ground incursions that the Israeli military do, those ground incursions take up to hundreds of troops. They cannot act as fast as an airstrike can on active timely intelligence. And we have seen the IDF really try to narrow down and pinpoint what they believe are Hamas and Islamic Jihad cells in Janine and go after them, because they have felt that the security in the West Bank, as far as Israel is concerned, is deteriorating at a detriment to the safety of Israeli citizens. So this seems to fit in with that context. But what we've seen in the past when, when the IDF goes into Jenin that is a big level of anger in Jenin and other towns in the West Bank about these types of incursions. And it does seem likely that this strike will continue to keep tensions in the West Bank and a very high level, Anderson. COOPER: And do we know because the U.N. just put out a statement a short time ago, INRA saying that there was an operation that had been going on for many hours in a refugee camp and that I think as many as 10 people had had been killed.

Originally, Abigail's family thought that she had been killed alongside her father only now are they discovering that she wandered to the home of another family, who took her in, but was later taken hostage.Joining me now is Liz Naftali (ph). She's Abigail is great aunt. Liz, I'm so sorry for your family is going through this is unthinkable. Can you -- do you know what happened that morning on October 7th to Abigail? LIZ NAFTALI, ABIGAIL MARIE DAWN'S GREAT AUNT: Oh, I just want to say one thing, because there was so much miscommunication, so many stories. And originally that morning, we actually thought that the mother locked her kids in the closet. Those kids actually saw their mother be killed by Hamas terrorists in their home. They ran out to their father. He was then holding with Abigail, and he was murdered. They then thought Abigail died. They ran back to the house. They actually locked themselves in this closet. This only we found out after they were freed and they were able to explain what happened. They stayed in that closet until almost until dark so they were in that closet for over 12 hours. Abigail survived the shooting and talked to her neighbors the neighbors took her in and husband wife with three kids. They put her in the bomb shelter as they went out to defend a kibbutz he was injured. And then the next thing they understood was that an eyewitness saw Hamas terrorists taking the mother and the little children away from the kibbutz.

They were visiting a family -- they visiting family in the (inaudible) a kibbutz in southern Israel when they were captured. Joining us now is the rabbi to the Raanan family. Rabbi Mayer Hecht.Rabbi, thank you so much for being with us. Have you had a chance to speak to them yet? RABBI MAYER HECHT, FRIEND OF RELEASED AMERICAN HOSTAGES: John, thank you so much for having me. This is been such an overwhelming and incredible past Shabbat. We just concluded the Shabbat I have not had a chance to reach out to anybody yet. All I know is that we've been so -- so incredibly overwhelmed with this beyond-amazing news. And our community members have been coming together throughout the Shabbat. And last night, Friday night, we had a candle-lighting event and the whole community got together. Today we had the community together and people were sharing their emotions and sharing their elated joy. And everyone had a chance to share their feelings. It was just a really, really special special day. The Shabbat today was -- was beyond belief. At the same time, of course, you know, our hearts are still pained and deeply concerned because we know that there's -- yes, we are our close friends. People who to us are like family have been released. But we still have over 200 plus hostages who are to us like brothers and sisters as well in Israel -- in Gaza, and we continue to pray for them. And we continue to hope for their release. But again, we our hearts are filled with joy and gratitude to the Almighty God for this incredible miracle.",

She wasn't the regular by our congregation. But Natalie is -- has been with us from time to time. And Natalie is so kind and generous and also such a giving and kind hearted soul.

But it will also take an enormous amount of diplomacy in action to get more of these hostages back.A key player in all of this is Qatar, the nation of Qatar, which is where the Hamas political leadership lives by the way. In Qatar, yet the United States has a good relationship with them. How is this going to work? JULIETTE KAYYEM, FORMER U.S. ASST. SECY. FOR HOMELAND SECURITY: Right. So Qatar has long believed that having a political relationship with Hamas is actually beneficial in Hamas was the sort of governing authority of Gaza. So there was no one else really to talk to at the time. And believes its continuing role now is helpful in the hostages. So releasing hostages does take prayer, as a rabbi said, but it's not done. Because like Hamas, all of a sudden got nice. It's done because Hamas sees an interest in releasing Americans. That's all they've released so far. And the -- and the reason why the two interests are, Qatar is telling them you better do this. Because -- because we need a narrative, essentially, because people are angry at Hamas for what they did. The Palestinians and Arabs are not united about around Hamas at all there is what was the strategy for Hamas doing it. There's a second interest for why you would release the Americans and that is because Hamas and Qatar also listened to the news. They know that there is growing concern across all communities about the humanitarian issues in Gaza right now and is trying to create everything is about storytelling. It's to create a narrative that Hamas are the good people who released the American hostages and ---- and that -- that they're willing to release hostages makes it more imperative that Biden try to delay Netanyahu from going in because we don't know what the what the number is, but anywhere between 100 and 200 hostages. So that -- so everyone, this is not -- this is not done because of prayer. And it's not done because Hamas is all of a sudden, like, yeah, that's a good idea. It's -- they're trying to figure out their interest as well.",

This is not a question the moral quandary is, does Israel go in knowing that they will lose their hostages? Because I don't think we know I don't think Israel knows where they are as well as -- as other country hostages. So that's basically the first. The second isn't it -- what is Hamas want?Hamas wants to create a narrative that that brings people back to them and everyone talks about the Arabs as if they're unified. There is a lot of anger about obviously what Hamas did not just by the United States and the Israelis but -- but by Palestinians and Arab countries. They're now trying to show that they can be reached that there was a reason for it. That they -- that they can have a that they can be rational in this -- in the madness and horror that they unleashed against the Israelis over a week or two weeks ago now. So that's basically what this is. So I do not think Israelis will be released.
