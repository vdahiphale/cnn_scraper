They have wanted him to get out there to get exposure to a wider audience. But, that being said, the campaign has had some hesitation because of the fact that he really is allowed to exist in kind of a vacuum on TRUTH Socials, saying these conspiracy theories, as you noted, and not getting a lot of coverage around it. So, as we noted, over the weekend, Donald Trump posted about this conspiracy theory that we had already seen circulating on conservative media about the crowd sizes. He talked about the fact that he said that Kamala Harris was manufacturing the whole thing, she was cheating, if she would cheat on one thing, she would cheat at an election. This is what some of his allies are now saying about that post. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  You have got to make this race not on personalities. Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her position when it comes to what did she do as attorney general on crime. Question what did she do when she was supposed to take care of the border as a czar. Question that they brought inflation. And she was the tie-breaking vote when it came to inflation, when it came to IRS agents. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance who was going to Michigan, to Wisconsin, to Pennsylvania to kind of paint that contrast with them. And it's exactly what I have been hearing from Donald Trump's team, but as well as Vance's team, that his goal on the campaign right now is to be the disciplined messenger that Donald Trump cannot always be. We know -- I saw this in Friday when I was in Montana with Donald Trump. He goes off-script. He riffs. He -- they want him to focus on policy, but sometimes his attacks go more personal and they're more nasty, whereas J.D. Vance, they want him to be the one who is really focusing on those key issues that we always talk about that the Trump campaign wants them to prioritize, which is immigration, crime, and the economy. Now, he did do several interviews yesterday, including with our own Dana Bash, and she asked him directly about, what do you make of this weird label that Democrats are giving you? I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  So, I think that what it is, is two people, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who aren't comfortable in their own skin because they aren't comfortable with their policy positions for the American people. And so they're name-calling, instead of actually telling the American people how they're going to make their lives better. I think that's weird, Dana.

You could tell very clearly throughout the interviews that he did yesterday that he was trying to be more disciplined, to be the one to kind of have a tighter leash on what they were saying. And I think -- I talked to Donald Trump's team. I talked to Vance's team this morning. They were saying they were very happy with how he did. They want him to be doing more of this.

Oddly enough, one of her first policy visions that she announced on Saturday in Nevada before the culinary union, which endorsed her, a major player in that state, was to eliminate tips -- eliminate taxes on tips for hospitality workers. And, of course, the former president has been talking about that for weeks, so that's getting a lot of attention. But she's also been talking about other economic policies as well that we are going to hear her expand on this week, like tackling high prices, taking on price gouging and banning hidden fees and surprise late charges, as well as pledging to take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases.

So you have got to be cautious, but registered voters, at least some of them, turn into likely voters, the ones who've been excluded in the likely voter count, as we approach Election Day. So you look at both categories. I'm at the point where I look a little bit more at likely voters than I do registered voters, since we are, as you keep stressing correctly, only 85 days, thank God, away from the Election Day.

You have the Israeli prime minister and the defense minister publicly spatting at a time when we are hearing that an Iranian attack, an attack by Iran or its proxies could be effectively imminent now. And so it certainly doesn't show a united front. But the Israeli government, the Israeli military are certainly on heightened alert for a potential Iranian attack. We have been hearing increasingly about that, those readiness levels, not only preparing defensive scenarios, but also rapidly being able to switch into offensive mode if a counterstrike becomes necessary. And late last week, we were having these discussions about a potential diplomatic off-ramp, with the U.S., Egypt and Qatar pushing for a new round of cease-fire negotiations, Iran indicating that perhaps it was willing to take that diplomatic off-ramp instead of carrying out this retaliatory strike against Israel. But now it appears that both the U.S. and Israel's intelligence assessments indicate that an Iranian strike, potentially one in coordination with Hezbollah, could be coming in a matter of hours or a matter of days. And, obviously, that is putting those cease-fire negotiations very, very much at risk. And it appears that that off-ramp is now very far away, if not off the table altogether -- Brianna.",

COL. PETER MANSOOR (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Well, if you recall, back in April when they retaliated for the killing of their operatives in Damascus, it was 12 days after that event that the missile strike occurred. So this is not unusual that they're taking their time to plan the strike. They are walking a fine line between wanting to damage Israel and make it clear that killing guests on their soil is not welcome and sparking a wider war in the region, which they absolutely don't want.
