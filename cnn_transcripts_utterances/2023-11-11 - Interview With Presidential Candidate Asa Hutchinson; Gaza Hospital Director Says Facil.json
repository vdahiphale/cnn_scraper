Good evening.Tonight, former President Donald Trump back on the campaign trail in New Hampshire and once again Trump is praising dictators around the world. Listen to how he characterized Chinese leader Xi Jinping earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: President Xi is like central casting. There is nobody in Hollywood that can play the role of President Xi. The look, the strength, the voice. It's good to have a good relationship with Putin and Xi, and all these people that like a nuclear weapon. And Kim Jong-un, I have a good relationship with. These are tough, smart guys.

He's joining us now. Governor Hutchinson, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it. You know, this was the Republican frontrunner out on the campaign trail earlier today. I hate to start an interview with you talking about Donald Trump. But do all of these comments make you nervous about the prospect of him being your party's nominee in 2024? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Absolutely. And that's why I'm working so hard. I'll be in 19 different cities in Iowa this week. But he clearly has an affection for dictators, and that is problematic in and of itself. And then secondly, he's wanting to assume more powers when he becomes president, that it's like he envies those that have that kind of power in dictatorial countries. And so it's all problematic. And we want to win. Here in Iowa, the latest polls has, what, 57 percent of the people ready to move away from Donald Trump. We just need to expand that and make our case for the right steady kind of leadership based upon experience that I offer, and that's the case that we make.",

Charlie, great to see you. What do you think? Is this dead on arrival? CHARLIE DENT (R), FORMER REPRESENTATIVE FROM PENNSYLVANIA: Well, it probably is dead on arrival in the form that he intends to send it over to the Senate. I suspect the Senate will reject it as sent.

He funds the government at current levels until the middle of January and he also funds the military construction and energy and water appropriations bills, and he does the rest a few weeks later, the other 10 bills. So I don't think it's irresponsible. I would do it in one step, not two. But it's not reckless. There aren't any crazy cuts. There are not any wild policy riders added. But as I said, the Senate is probably going to insist that it be done in one step and they'll probably also want to add some of the emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and the border.

And a temporary funding. But remember, this spending bill, is this going to fund the government until only about January 18th or so. It's two months so it is going to fund it at current levels. So if you want to propose cuts, it would only be for a couple of months but again this is something that the Senate would reject out of hand.

Now having written the military construction appropriations bill, that was my job. I saw Trump divert money for a border wall which frankly I thought was an egregious violation of Congress's Article One authorities. And I think Congress should stand up for itself, and if Congress wants to appropriate money for some of these immigration policies, they may. But right now what I'm seeing Trump proposing is just seems to be rather nativist.

But when you add Kennedy in the equation, look at how different it is.Look at Arizona, Pennsylvania, these were five point Trump leads. You add Kennedy in the mix, all of a sudden those states are tied. Nevada, which we noted last week was an outlier, perhaps with an 11-point Trump lead, you add Kennedy to the equation, all of a sudden that lead gets cut in six. What it does is it takes those polls that look like an abject disaster for Joe Biden and makes it one where you're kind of going, wait a minute, wait a minute, this race is too close to call. So it could be that RFK, Jr. could be a savior for Joe Biden, at least according to this polling data.",

The school asked the judge a temporarily halt of the suspension, but the court won't take up the case until next Friday. \"Bleacher Report\" college football reporter, Morgan Moriarty joins us now. Morgan. I guess they didn't need Jim Harbaugh on the sideline today. They still won, but what about winning in court? MORGAN MORIARTY, \"BLEACHER REPORT\" COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORTER: Yes, I mean, what an incredibly crazy kind of 24 to 36 last hours for Michigan. Starting yesterday afternoon, Michigan was mid plane ride to Happy Valley when the Big 10 laid down this three-game suspension. There were reports that Michigan had no idea this came down until they hit the tarmac. Obviously, as you mentioned, Michigan did try to fight this in court. They were meeting with some judges late last night, but ultimately they were unable to get a hearing or a ruling on that. As you mentioned, that is next Friday. So as a result, Jim Harbaugh although he traveled to Happy Valley on that plane, was not able to be with Michigan on the sidelines. Obviously, you know, it didn't affect them too much. They won 24 to 15 over Penn State, a huge win for the Wolverines. They are ten and oh now, and in the driver's seat for the Big 10 East. A huge credit to Sherrone Moore, Michigan's offensive coordinator, who was the interim acting head coach for this game.",
