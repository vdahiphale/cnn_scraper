Developing right now, more than 100 people feared dead after a landslide hit a remote area in Papua New Guinea. Rescue efforts are slow-going. That's according to the Red Cross. The landslide burying a main highway leading to the community. And CNN's Anna Coren is following this for us. Anna, what more are you learning? ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Jessica. Emergency crews in Pangaea trying to access this remote village in Enga Province. It's in the north of the country where more than 100 people are expected to have died. The landslide happened around 3:00 a.m. this morning in Kaokalam Village. It's situated in the Highlands. And it was hit by this enormous landslide, flattening houses. One eyewitness said that the entire village was gone. And look, the pictures on social media -- really, they show villagers trying to find any survivors in this earth and rubble. But the reality is this is now a recovery operation. Large boulders, tree trunks, collapsed buildings scattering the earth. And residents say the debris is making it really hard to find the bodies. The highway, as you say, has been cut off, making it inaccessible for rescue workers to get to the scene. And a Red Cross official, Jessica, told us that a recent earthquake and heavy rainfall in the area may have been responsible for triggering this deadly landslide. We've heard from the prime minister of Papua New Guinea, James Marape. He issued a statement. Let me read it to you. He said, \"We are sending in disaster officials, PNG Defense Force, and the Department of Work &amp; Highways to meet provincial and district officials in Enga and also start relief work, recovery of bodies, and reconstruction of infrastructure. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the landslide disaster.\" Jessica, the scale of this disaster is enormous.

You're talking about a large number of aircraft -- not the largest we've ever seen, but dozens of aircraft. And dozens of ships in the seas around Taiwan as well.

They had lost in the previous two rounds in game two to the Heat and the Cavs, but they came ready last night. Boston trailing in the first, but then they went on a big 20-0 run in that second quarter. And Jaylen Brown scoring 10 points in that span. He would match his playoff career high of 40 in this one. And after that run, the Celtics -- they would never trail in this game. Bad news, though, for the Pacers. Their star, Tyrese Haliburton -- he left this game in the third quarter with an injury -- a hamstring. The team says they're going to know more about his status later today. The Celtics win big 126-110 and take a 2-0 lead in the series. And here was Brown on his big performance coming just days after being left off the All-NBA team. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Tipoff set for 8And busy nights for Dallas sports fans these days as the Stars are also in the Western Conference Finals. Game one against the Oilers, a classic. Down 2-1 late in the third, Tyler Seguin scores to tie the game with just over three minutes left. We would go to overtime. Dallas on the power play. Jason Robertson's shot -- look at this -- goes off the post. All the fans thought they had won. They just couldn't believe it. Later, in OT, Connor McDavid, a great chance to end it. But Jake Oettinger -- the save here. We would go to double overtime. With just 32 seconds into double OT, McDavid would get redemption, scoring there to end the game. Oilers win 3-2 to take game one.
