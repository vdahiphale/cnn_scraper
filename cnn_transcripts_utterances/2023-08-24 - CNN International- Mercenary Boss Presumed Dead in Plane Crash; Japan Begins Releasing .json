      "sentences": "Hello, welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\", I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, questions are swirling of Yevgeny Prigozhin's plane crash. Was it truly an accident? Russian authorities are investigating, a new era for the so called BRICS nations.Six other countries will become members next year. And in the coming hours Donald Trump is expected to be booked and then release. We're live outside George's Fulton County Jail. The final facts are still unclear. The speculation is soaring around the presumed death of Wagner lead Yevgeny Prigozhin. And so far the Kremlin hasn't commented. Russian officials say Prigozhin was on board a plane that crashed northeast of the capital on Wednesday, but not many other details were provided. Russian state media reports 10 people were on board the flight traveling from St. Petersburg to Moscow but so far, only eight bodies have been found. And those vans as well are carrying the dead are now arriving at the forensics bureau. State media also reports the debris field stretches across an area spanning two kilometers. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins me now live in Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine, you surprised, Nick that the Russians haven't said anything yet or confirmed the death.",

      "sentences": "I think to some degree this is keeping perhaps and how Putin tried to respond after he got a grip of the situation a little more after the failed armed rebellion in a sort of casting Yevgeny Prigozhin has a bit of a non-person now, within the Russian elite.And so that may explain why we've heard nothing maybe the Kremlin trying to impose their own narrative showing Putin at a World War Two Memorial site perhaps suggesting his proximity to the fallen in Russia's wars. We've just had some news though, in terms of the room -- now swirling around this extraordinary event. A catastrophic plane crash in which entirety it seems Wagner's top elite were on the same private jet that fell out of the sky unexpectedly a wing falling off and it's spiraling down to the ground. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, remember Ukrainians will take the death frankly of Prigozhin with some degree of wry delight. In that he and his group Wagner were part of some of the most brutal fighting on the frontlines against Ukraine around Wagner. Zelenskyy has said first we have nothing to do with this situation. That's for sure. But I think everyone realizes who has. Now that is, I think clearly a reference contributing to the debate about whether or not this was something the Kremlin indeed performed and sanctions. Zelenskyy, saying, look, even though Ukraine with every desire potentially to kill someone by Prigozhin, we didn't do that and pointing the finger instead towards the Kremlin. And Max, that's essentially where we are right now. We don't have copper bottoms proof that Prigozhin did indeed die on that aircraft. We know that Russian state officials have said that he was on board that plane along with his top Wagner lieutenants, including a man called Dmitry Utkin, essentially one of the key founders of that original organization. But we still are awaiting forensic expertise with the knowledge too. That investigative work will be being done by the Kremlin's investigators and essentially potentially tainted towards whatever outcome Vladimir Putin wants the public to hear from this. So some doubts as to exactly what indeed occurred here. But I think increasingly less doubt in the minds of Russians and Ukrainians of where the finger may end up getting pointed. And that's towards Vladimir Putin, who staying silent and clearly decided that Prigozhin was still too much of a threat that his continued survival, show Putin to be so weak. He preferred potentially, to have taken this ultimate sanction and move rather than allowing Prigozhin to remain in freedom going forward, Max.",

This could become a very powerful political bloc of the so called Global South. And as you say, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and some other countries bring substantial financial might to BRICS, and could be very important. Going forward, I think there's something in this for all of the founding members, South Africa will be happy that African nations were added. The Brazilian President said they were extremely pleased that Argentina was in there and for China. And I think this really is the best news for the Chinese President. It shows that potentially there diplomacy between Saudi Arabia and Iran, strange bedfellows to bring them together into BRICS, starting in January. So it could become an alternative to the G7, but they all have to co-operate for that to happen, Max.",

There's really no expectation that the dollar is going to realistically be abandoned when it comes to world trade and financial transactions, because the dollar, of course, is the background and the backbone of the world financial markets and trade.However, it's an important political statement in terms of de- dollarization. They say that they are going to explore during trade in local currencies of the BRICS members. I think more important on the economic side, is whether the financial clout of countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE in particular, can help bolster the New Development Bank, the so called BRICS Bank, which is looking to be an alternative to the World Bank and IMF.
