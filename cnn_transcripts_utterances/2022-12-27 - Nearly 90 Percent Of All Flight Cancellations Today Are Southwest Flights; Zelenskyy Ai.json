Its pride point was that it had the youngest fleet, the most modern equipment, the most modern aircraft, and consistently won awards for what we call the Triple Crown of Aviation, best customer reported satisfaction, on time performance and safety records and newest planes.How far Southwest has fallen, that statement is quite an understatement. But airlines have been through this before. It makes you wonder if they don't recall any storms in the past, there was a huge weather meltdown back in 1999 in Detroit. That airline had to pay millions of dollars in its passengers who sued because of that. But ordinarily what happens is they get fined by the government and the fines go to the government, not the people afflicted. So usually airlines can skate by and say, oh, what's the weather. We didn't know it's going to get cold in the United States, shockingly.",

For example, it depends upon the hours you're stuck on the tarmac, it depend - it gives things like the right to have a refund.Well, if you're stranded in an airport, a refund isn't going to help you. Oh, by the way, they don't have to make it right on the spot. And for airlines that don't have a lot of contracts and alliances with other airlines, they can't rebook you on other airlines, so you're very much stranded, if you're not on the mainline carrier that can - could shuttle you off to another carrier. So Congress and the Senate actually bears some responsibility for this because the American public believe them when they said there was going to be passengers' Bill of Rights and you would have rights in these situations. Rights mean rebooking and a cash payment and the law doesn't give you the second, so - or the first. The airline is allowed to walk away and just issue you a refund on your credit card or in X number of days if they blame it on whether. They always blame it on whether but in this case, it's modernization. Modernization that they failed to do.",

They call customer service agents, the number, and they're literally placed on hold or they get in line for the automatic callback queue and there's no callback.So what has happened, they have moved to the do it yourself travel system, which is usually great, because you rather do it yourself. But then when something happens, there's no backup. There's no one there and then, of course, now what do they blame it on? Then you saw the Southwest release, they say COVID, the flu and another virus and it's making a lot of people out sick. But the fact of the matter is, we've gone so much to computerization that when those systems fail, there is no backup. And so just having someone to help them would have gone a long way. I think what's going to happen here is Congress will have hearings, they'll promise more rights and laws but they don't ever materialize because the airlines are so powerful.
