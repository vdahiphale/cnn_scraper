Then since he bought it, what he's been doing. Could you back up for a second on this most recent move? Because when we talked about him claiming there was, you know, violation of doxing. He claimed this was about safety for his own family. Right? Was there any merit to those claims that they were posting anything that could have been putting his family at risk?",

      "sentences": "It gets very confusing. There was an account that posted the location -- used public information to post the location of where his jet was.So if it took off from California and went to Texas to the SpaceX plant or whatever or Tesla plant, it would post that his jet was in the air. He did not like this account. It got under his skin for years. And eventually, he just changed the Twitter rules this week to ban that account. And what these reporters did is they reported on him banning this account. And then that seemed to trigger Musk and so he banned them as well. And I think it's interesting to note, he put up a poll on Twitter saying, should I restore these accounts, and if so, when? And last night, the people who said they should be restored immediately won on that poll and he said, basically, I'm going to redo this poll. Which is interesting because this is the exact same kind of poll that he had done before to bring back Trump, to bring back -- to grant general amnesty, which brought back white nationalists, anti-Semites onto Twitter. It was OK then but, in this case, he says he wants to redo the poll. And now it's rerunning on Twitter. We'll see what happens. But just not a good development.",

Winter storm warning, you see right there, those areas in pink. And then here is the forecast radar. You can see the rain wrapping up this afternoon, ending in Boston tonight. And then the snow will finally leave by the time we get into tomorrow as well. So we have one final push of this for today.

But as you say, FIFA continued to sidestep issues if they're not on their agenda. And they've said today, in a press conference, the president here, that when the players take to the field they are players. They are not heads of state. The trouble is, Ana, that's at odds with what he did himself on November 15th when he addressed members of the G-20, calling for them to push for a cease-fire in Ukraine. So it does appear to be an inconsistency in his message. And lots of people don't understand why the Grammys could accommodate President Zelenskyy and the G-20 could accommodate him and that message. And yet, the president of the world football governing body doesn't see fit to include that in the messaging ahead of the biggest match on the planet on Sunday afternoon.
