But they also discussed, of course, this major policy shift by the United States to finally allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons to strike inside Russia itself, something that the Ukrainians had been pushing the U.S. to allow for quite some time now, and which the U.S. finally decided to give the green light for just last week. And the -- President Zelenskyy repeated many times today how thankful he was for that decision that was made by President Biden. But really, one of the big reasons that Zelenskyy came to this forum to Singapore was to send a message to the Chinese who have been accused of helping Russia and supporting their defense sector and essentially fueling this war in Ukraine by selling and transporting dual use items to the Russians that can be used to build military equipment and overall bolster Russia's defense sector. And he was not able, according to comments that he made to reporters earlier today to actually meet with any Chinese officials here today. The Chinese apparently rebuffed his requests for several meetings here over the weekend. But he did reveal that the Chinese, according to his information are actively working alongside the Russians to try to undermine support for a peace summit that Ukraine is aiming to hold in the next two weeks in Switzerland. And so the bottom line here was that while he made an effort, according to, you know, officials to try to meet with the Chinese to try to get them to stop their support for the Russians. He was not necessarily successful, but the biggest reason he came here today and over the weekend was try to rally other Asian leaders around Ukraine in its fight against the Russians and, of course, to meet with Secretary Austin in the wake of that very major decision to allow Ukraine to use American weapons to strike inside Russian territory.",

This is not just an election to select the next president. It's really a referendum as to whether they want to continue the policies of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.And in public safety, in particular, he had a hands off approach. He basically declined to utilize the army and the police forces to actively pursue the cartels, the organized crime, and many have criticized him for that. They believe that is the reason Mexico has fallen into this lawless in which we saw more than 30 candidates killed during this political process, and there is this feeling among citizens that the country is not safe. And, in fact, the Mexico is considered one of the more dangerous countries in the world. So beyond that, they also, the Mexicans, have this choice to make between continuing those policies, social programs that he either created or expanded the relationship with the United States and other nations versus perhaps the more traditional way of doing business in Mexico with the opposition who had to nominate a unified candidate because they saw how powerful Lopez Obrador and his Morena party had become. So Claudia Sheinbaum, who is the candidate for Morena, is seen as the favorite to continue these policies. But the opposition in the last few weeks, apparently, they have gained some momentum. The assassination of more candidates might be affecting the vote today. So it's going to be very interesting to see, not only if Mexico go and select a woman to be their president, something they have given -- it's a fact for them because the two top candidates are women. They are really looking forward to decide the future of their country.",

What happens in federal court? If you submit to the federal judge, and there are certain questions to elicit bias.Certainly, those questions will center around whether or not people could be fair and reasonable, objective and impartial, whether they believe this to be, you know, smacking of politics, whether they can move politic to the side, whatever they may be, not asking them specifically what side they're on. But the essence of any question that's developed and presented to the jury, Victor, is to discern whether or not someone's inclinations would prevent them or preclude them from sitting on this jury. The big question for me, really, we could get into is, why we're here. I mean, the reality is, is that, you know, it's a shame that there is this sort of political weaponization. You're dealing with a case that a year ago, Victor, a year ago, he was offered a plea on the misdemeanor charges that Marshall spoke to coming into this, right? We just heard the piece there. And that's in California. And the plea was a misdemeanor to that. And the diversion program as to the charges you and I are speaking about jury selection for diversion means stay out of trouble for two years. You know, be a good person and the case is dismissed. And now we're here on a trial with a gun that was never used before, with a gun you own for 11 days. Things have to make sense. And even though potentially you've done something wrong, equitability needs to factor into the equation. And this is just we've gone into a different space and that's unfortunate.",

Hunter Biden has written about his drug use and drug abuse. He says he's been sober since 2019. But if they put these witnesses forward, they submit the text messages, they bring the memoir into evidence there, and they have this -- the form that he signed, is that it, or do they need to do more?",

They'll ultimately impound jurors who say and could be, right, subject to both parties raising objections. And then they'll have to prove unanimously like any case, proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to the offenses here.Here, you're looking at three specific offenses. Did you lie to a federal arms dealer? Did you lie on the federal form? Did you possess the weapon? And so to the extent that they could establish that there was this drug addiction and you did lie on a federal form and that's established beyond the reasonable doubt that carries a day. Now, getting there, of course, there'll be witnesses, there'll be documentary evidence. We'll see the form itself. We'll see the text messages as it relates to the text that he sent, right, to the person he was romantically involved in, his brother's widow, Hallie. Are you kidding me? Did you throw it out? Why did you throw it in a dumpster? What are you doing? Go retrieve it. And so there'll be a lot of compelling evidence. But I think the defense's play here maybe a couple of things. They could either contest the underlying issue as to the addiction itself, even though there's admissions as to that. Was it at the time that he purchased the gun? Well, they could look for jury nullification in this case, saying, look, this is a guy who's been through a lot. What are we doing here? He possessed, as I noted, this gun for 11 days. How do we know? You know, he was going through a tough time. He lost his brother to brain cancer. Because of the brain cancer that his brother had, Beau, a rising star in Delaware, he was in a really dark place at the particular time. He lost his mom and his sister when he was a young kid, what are we doing? The gun was never used in terms of any type of crime at all. Things have to make sense. And so if that's sympathetic to a jury, they could nullify. [07:25:07] So it'll be interesting to me, Victor, to see what the play here, is it to confront the facts head on, or is it to garner sympathy, which would mitigate the charges? And even if they're proven, the jury says, hey, you know what? This doesn't make sense. Let's throw the case out. Let's see.",

On one side, there is some sympathy for this man who has struggled. He's been transparent about it. He's been sober now for five years, he says.On the other hand, you could know just how dangerous that weapon could be in the hands of a person who's dealing with that addiction. Where do you fall on that line of the profile of jury you want as it relates to that?",

Ultimately, you have to take the risk that you think in order to your benefit. And I think it's much more important to me to have someone who's sympathetic, who understands that someone who's in that place in their life.And there are many people out there that, you know, you lose a measure of control. And yes, you can be dangerous with the weapon, but we're talking about the lead up to its purchase, the state of mind with respect to its purchase, what you were thinking at the time, what faculties you will control of at the time. Did you have a grip on your life at the time? So someone who is sympathetic and empathetic to that, I think, to me, would outweigh someone who says, oh, they can be dangerous and therefore he's guilty. Again, that's where I fall. And if I was on that defense team, that's what I'd be speaking to. And certainly there'll be divergent opinions. But I want someone who understands my plight to judge me.
