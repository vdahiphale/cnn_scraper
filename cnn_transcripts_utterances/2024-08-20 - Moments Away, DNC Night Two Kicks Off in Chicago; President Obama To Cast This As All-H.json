We're told that the former president will deliver a forceful affirmation that Harris is the right leader for this moment.

M.J., I understand you're learning more about tonight's appearance by the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf. CNN has just received the first excerpts of Doug Emhoff's speech tonight, so let me just get straight to it. The second gentleman will describe tonight his wife, the vice president, as a happy, joyful warrior. It's doing for her country, he'll say, what she has always done for the people she loves. Her passion will benefit all of us when she's our president. And he'll say, here's the thing about joyful warriors. They're still warriors and Kamala is as tough as it comes. Now, when the second gentleman takes the stage, Wolf, the song that we are going to hear in this arena is, You Get What You Give by New Radicals. This is a song, we are told that he handpicked, one of his favorite songs, for this big moment, the biggest speech that he will give of his career so far. Most Americans, of course, know very little about the second gentleman, let alone about his music taste. But he is certainly hoping that is going to change soon if Kamala Harris wins the presidency come November. I just want to make a quick note about that song that we were talking about before. This is a song that has meaning for President Joe Biden as well, who, of course, passed that proverbial torch to his vice president last night. He wrote in his memoir that when his late son, Beau, was going through cancer chemotherapy treatments, it is a song that he asked that they listen to together. So, this is a song that is going to be meaningful, not just for the second gentleman but for the Biden family as well. Wolf?",

She, of course, famously had the line, when they go low, we go high. I don't get the sense there's a ton of appetite for that from Democrats here. They're kind of -- the attitude seems to be we need to get down in the mud if we're actually going to win this thing against Donald Trump. So, I'm interested to see how she threads that needle.",

Back in 2012, when Barack Obama was running for re-election, the night before he spoke, Bill Clinton spoke and gave -- but I think Obama later admitted it was a better rationale for why you should re-elect Barack Obama than Barack Obama gave in his acceptance speech. And, in fact, afterwards Obama called Clinton the secretary of explaining things.I think the hope is that tonight Barack Obama can give that kind of a testimonial for Kamala Harris and explain in a way that she hasn't had an opportunity. Obviously, she hopes to accede it on Thursday night why America should vote for her and trust her. You know, it's a very interesting thing. Joe Biden dropped out of this race 30 days ago, and that has played very much to Kamala Harris' advantage. She's had this kind of speed dating relationship with voters, and so far it's a love affair. But having said that, most Americans don't know very much about Kamala Harris. They need validation. They need background. They need anecdotes. She hasn't gone through, you know, the year-long campaign that people normally get before they come to a convention and are nominated as their party's standard bearer. So, I think it's going to be very interesting what you hear from Doug Emhoff, and from Barack Obama, and from Michelle Obama tonight in terms of validating Kamala Harris.",

I am told that the former first lady is going to say she would like to sit on the sidelines, but this campaign is too important to do so.Of course, we all remember eight years ago when she addressed the Democratic convention back in 2016 in Philadelphia, she addressed the Trump campaign and Republicans specifically saying, when they go low, we go high. I am told tonight she will deliver an updated version of that. We don't know exactly what that will be, but she is going to make the case that she knows this race is incredibly important and incredibly tight, and Democrats cannot afford to sit on the sidelines.

My grandfather, President Carter, will have his 100th birthday in October. I call him Papa, and I can tell you that he wishes he could be here tonight. He and my grandmother led their lives with an unwavering faith in God, a respect for human dignity, honesty, and a commitment to loving their neighbors as themselves. Those principles guided them throughout their lives, including during their four years in the White House and the four decades since. For my grandfather, it was never about fame, recognition, accolades, or awards. His legacy is measured by the lives he has touched. And the good he has done. Kamala Harris carries my grandfather's legacy. She knows what is right and she fights for it. She understands that leadership is about service, not selfishness, that you can show strength and demonstrate decency, and that you can get a whole lot more done with a smile than with a scowl. Papa is holding on. He is hopeful. And though his body may be weak tonight, his spirit is as strong as ever. My grandfather can't wait to vote for Kamala Harris. She reminds us all that the promise of America remains unchanged. We are one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And my grandfather knows that with her as our next president, we will keep that promise. Thank you.",

That is what they are going to be looking ahead to, Jake, focusing on that and saying that as we are seeing quite lifestyle. I'll note, we've been focusing on Delaware, the delegation I'm standing to a lot, obviously, given its President Biden's home state.
