But what you have done gives you the legitimacy to say, this is what I will do.And the president has said, we have more work to be done and let's have a debate on who's there for the American people, to save the Affordable Care Act, to save the pensions that Joe Biden enabled to happen when people go talking to Trump, labor guys talking to Trump. They have to remember he refused to pass the pension bill, to support the pension bill. So again, the elections have ramifications. Let's talk about that. Let's not talk about what happened last July. Let's talk about what's happening now as we go forward. I just got off a call with organizers for the Affordable Care Act. We are so excited for what it means to our veterans when we pass the PACT Act. What it means for women when you see the Supreme Court ruling against them and the Congress, not one Republican vote to help women in that regard. When women are anti-jobs, they are pro-democracy. When we are talking about good paying jobs, we're talking about freedom for people to live their lives. I am very excited about what Biden has done. We were a part of that. But more importantly, what he will do. And that's the message people want to hear. Again, none of us deserves it. All of us has to prove what we will do as we go forward.
