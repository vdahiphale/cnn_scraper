Six construction workers are still missing, now presumed dead. As divers attempt to recover their bodies, the National Transportation Safety Board has recovered the ship's data recorder and news today of a possible electrical problem on board the ship in port days before its departure. In the last hour, U.S. secretary of transportation said the accident could have been much worse if not for the quick response by emergency personnel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: If not for several factors, including those responders' efforts, the mayday call, the maintenance closure that was already underway, and the time of day of this impact, the loss of life might have been in the dozens. But tragically, six people did lose their lives. And the seventh was badly injured. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, CNN's UK affiliate, ITN, they get some details from a port worker in the port of Baltimore who says that that container ship, the Dali, two days before this incident was suffering from severe power failures. And let me just read you a direct quote.This is from Julie Mitchell who was co-administrator of Container Royalty. It's a company that kind of keeps tracks of the tonnage on these types of container ships. She said during those two days, they were having serious power outages. They had a severe electrical problem. It was total power failure, loss of engine power, everything. Now, we know so that there was that mayday call from the crew on the ship to officials on or near the Key Bridge in which they said, we have had a power issue shortly before that collision took place and that's why they were able to stop so many of those cars from crossing the bridge. But when you talk to NTSB investigators, they say were aware of these reports from the crew and others that this was an electrical issue, but we still need to independently verify that. And so, Jim, that's where that black box comes into play that you were just talking about and NTSB investigators were really only able to get their hands on it last night when they were finally able to board the ship because they had to wait to let the Coast Guard take the lead because it was an ongoing active search and rescue operation. As we know now, that is now shifted sadly, to a recovery operation as those divers now try to navigate those treacherous waters and find what is likely going to be the bodies of those six are construction workers -- Jim.",

We're going to play the video again here, and you can see as it's drifting there, the lights flickering indicating that apparent powder -- power outage during which time the crew communicated this and they were able to stop traffic on the bridge according to transportation secretary.You have crewed very large submarines I'm sure in crowded waters before, what's your view of the crew's reactions and communications here? MARQUET: Yeah. Well, it's great that they got the word out and the bridge operators were very able to react so quickly. I'm sure every night, goes by, nothing happens as 1:30 in the morning and all sudden you get this call. Hey, you need to shut down the bridge so you can see the typical reaction. What? Really? Are you sure? But that's not what happened in this case. They acted quickly, responded that the bridge shut down, so that tremendously job well done. So I want to talk a minute about power versus propulsion. A ship like this has to power systems. One is they have a very, very big diesel engine which drives the propeller, just one propeller, one big propeller. Then they have four in this case a diesel generators, which make electricity Now, to get communications from the bridge to the rudder or to the bow thruster, or down to the engine room to tell them what speed drive the ship, you need electricity. Likely its going to have UPS supplies for those critical systems and the communication systems but what you see is when the lights go out on the ship and especially now with the reports that there were electrical problems for the ship going underway, to me, that's a bit of a smoking gun that we would need to look at the electrical system. The other thing is when the ship is in port, they have a certain electrical lineup as they're going through this maneuvering time, whether maneuvering out of the harbor, they generally try to have the most redundant, resilient electrical line of possible. But then when you get out to see, you kind of shut down all your electric equipment. So if it's a crew were making that transition prematurely, and there was somehow a mistake, then you can see cascading problem and that lights go out.",

If you have your electrical, if you've been testing regularly, your backup system sounds like we would do in the Navy, it just takes a second for that backup generator, come up to speed, then you start powered the ship from the backup, or if its from a battery that's even that's just second.

So that ship was one- fifth the size.So since then -- so one of the things you can do is around those pillars that you see that the ship hit. If you could put a lot of shallow water, you could put a lot of mud so that the ship actually runs a ground, stops before it actually just drives into that pillar at full speed get whatever speed it was going. But those standards Key Bridge since it was built in '77 and Tampa happened in 1980. So the standards didn't come into place until after the Key Bridge. So, any bridge built earlier, and I'd say probably about 2000, isn't going to have as reliable. They didn't build these 100,000 tons ships until just the last two decades.",

They've attacked this indictment from every direction. Their most aggressive line of attack centers on what they believe is a political prosecution. They are arguing that special counsel Weiss only brought this case because of pressure from Donald Trump and Republicans who were outraged when Weiss was proposing a plea deal last year. Weiss is Republican and he is a Trump appointee, but he vehemently denies the allegations at this case is tainted by politics. He said it was a conspiracy theory and in court filings, they said very clearly that they only brought this case because they think Hunter Biden is guilty not because of any politics.

Meanwhile, ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have reached another stalemate, according to the latest reports. Those sources tell CNN talks do continues. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is following all this. First, Natasha, what do we know about this latest round of negotiations? I mean, they've been off and on and off and on again. Where do they stand right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, according to reporting from my colleague, Alex Marquardt and Jeremy Diamond, those talks are essentially stalled, but they're not over. The two sides continue to kind of trade proposals back and forth. However, proposal put forward by Israel that was proposed by the United States originally to Hamas, in which Israel had agreed to release about 700 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for 40 hostages being released from Hamas's captivity. That has been rejected by Hamas as of this morning.And so, now, they're kind of going back to the drawing board here. Of course, the key sticking points remain in that Hamas is really demanding some maximalist objectives, including the withdrawal of Israeli troops, talks about a ceasefire and ultimately discussions about ending the war completely, as well as the ability of Palestinians in the south of Gaza to move back home in the north at that is where they originally came from. And so, these are the main sticking points, right? It now and it does not appear that officials are overly pessimistic about the trajectory of talks however, there has not been any momentous kind of movement on this in the last couple of days, including last night when Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met with CIA Director Bill Burns, who has been leading the U.S. side of this, Jim.",

And so, it is incredibly inefficient and aid doesn't always make it to the right people. You have Hamas taking some of it. It is so, so complicated.

BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, the answer to this is twofold. First, unfortunately, and I know it might be amazing to hear, most Israelis are not exposed to what we just saw. The Israeli press is not really covering humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which is extremely unfortunate and problematic. And this is why Israeli public opinion even if people, let's say, say, okay, I don't care, at least they can know what is going on. But a lot of people just don't know what is going on in Gaza. And second is that Netanyahu and many members of his security cabinet and security chiefs, the IDF chief of staff, and others knew many, many months ago that this will -- the issue of humanitarian aid is key to continuing the war. [15:40:13] They said it publicly, and this is why this failure is so huge, because it was clear to everybody that this will be a key issue and still this is not functioning and we see what the result is on the ground",

And it's unclear where Netanyahu stands or he shifts his position from one day to another.But what I hear from people that are intimately involved in negotiations is that the last ten days I think made it clear that on many issues, Hamas has its positions and its not going to move from this positions. For example, the return of Palestinian civilians to the north. And many Israeli officials are saying that the Israeli government needs to take a strategic decision on whether it says, you know what, we're willing to give up on this because we want the hostages back, or they say, you know what, the hostages are not such a priority, and the issue of the norm what is more important to us. This is the key thing, the return of Palestinian civilians to the north, all the other issues that are still undecided can be bridged. This is the only thing that I hear from many Israeli officials. It's a yes-no question.",

They're now back on again.But let's be frank, it's been very public and private criticism from the U.S. to the Israeli side. I'm curious, is this bat largely between Biden and Bibi or is it part of a broader deterioration in the U.S.- Israeli relationship?

So it's very hard, quote, to flood the zone if you don't have the ceasefire and that's why -- one of the reasons why this is so key.Now, in terms of the U.S.-Israeli relationship, there's always been strains between Bibi and Biden, but what I'm concerned about, I think a lot of people are concerned about is that yes, this is spreading, this is becoming more of a populations not understanding each other. And I think that Americans have a lot of trouble understanding what Barak is talking about, which is that 70 percent of Israelis don't want any aid to go into Gaza unless the hostages are released and part of that is because they don't see what's going on, but also because of the trauma that their societies have. But a new poll really shows to me that this is a lot -- you can't separate politics right now from these issues. You can't separate Israeli politics and where Netanyahu stands and the fact that he needs this war to keep going, and the fact that, you know, support for the war in the United States is dropping like a rock, 10 percent down in terms of disapproval ratings. And that is really high in Democratic Party. Only 18 percent of Democrats say they support what Israel is doing.",

Does that -- first of all, is that getting through to the Israeli public and does it concern that does the deterioration that relationship -- particularly given that the bear hug that Joe Biden delivered to Israel in the days right after October 7.

It wasn't easy for the Ukrainians. They had to go to a knockout stage where they defeated Iceland in the match last night. It wasn't looking good for the Ukrainians there either in the beginning. The Icelanders actually scored first, but the Ukrainians then made a second half comeback and just a few minutes before the end of the match managed to score the go ahead goal and with that, will be making their way here to Germany. Now, Iceland is actually a pretty good team in international soccer. They threw England out of the Euro 2016 competition, so definitely a team to be reckoned with. For the Ukrainians, it's fourth time in a row that they are able to participate in the Euro tournament. And, of course, it is also the first major soccer tournament that Ukraine will participate in since Russia started its very brutal, full-on invasion of Ukraine. Obviously, a huge deal for the country. But one of the things that also happened is that because, of course, the war is raging there in Ukraine, the Ukrainians weren't able to play their home matches inside of Ukraine, of the match last night actually happened in Poland, the Ukrainians, of course, very happy about all this. Their first match will be on June 17th against Romania. And, of course, right now for them, everything is possible on the European stage, Jim. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
