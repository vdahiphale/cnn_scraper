The old-fashioned mortar is sort of a close infantry tool. You can use it close to the front line or a little further back. It fires really high in the air. It goes right up and comes right down.Now, typically, in the past, if you're using the old-fashioned version you need a forward spotter who can see where it's hitting, and it takes maybe three rounds for a good mortar team to put around precisely on a target. This new system apparently does away with that entirely. It is computer-controlled. You dial in the designated location of the target and this mortar fires and hits that target with pinpoint accuracy. That's what the IDF is saying. So what does this mean? It means when they see a small Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad unit out in the field with a -- with an anti-tank weapon -- the sort of thing that was used yesterday to kill an IDF soldier -- they can pinpoint them precisely and hit them quickly and readily. Now, we weren't aware of this being operational in the region and we've become used to hear -- the explosions, the detonations, missiles, and artillery. But this had a whole new sound. And when we first heard this weapon firing off we ducked for cover because it literally made this huge whoosh and went right over us and we didn't know what it was. We did hear it impact and --",

My brother was a Marine assigned in Beirut. His battalion shipped out 10 days before that attack. It was the worst single-day loss of Marines since Iwo Jima.And sadly, the Reagan administration made the decision after that terrorist attack to withdraw American forces. Osama bin Laden would write later that American retreat emboldened him to believe that violence against Americans could drive American forces out of the region. It literally set the stage for 9/11. We can't signal restraint. We can't signal retreat in this moment. We've got to make it clear that America stands with Israel, and we're going to stand strong for our interests in the region.",
