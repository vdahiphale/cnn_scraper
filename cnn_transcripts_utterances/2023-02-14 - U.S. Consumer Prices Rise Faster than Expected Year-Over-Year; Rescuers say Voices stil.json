And ahead on today's program, miraculousrescues in Turkey and Syria more than one week after the region's devastating earthquake officials, they fear that time to save trapped victims is running out and yet voices still being heard in the rubble. We are live in Turkey with the latest. Ukrainian troops began training on advanced Leopard 2 tanks in Poland amid fears of an upcoming Russian military offensive. NATO Secretary General saying that Ukraine must get the weapons it needs to, \"win this war\". Plus, the U.S. just out with new important economic numbers the first look at the state of consumer inflation in 2023. Consumer prices easing now for the seventh straight month, year over year up by 6.4 percent that is the smallest annual rise since October 2021. Those numbers however, were a bit higher than expected on a month over month basis. However, prices rose an expected half a percent. Take a look at U.S. stocks you can see they're volatile pre market as Investors really tried to get their heads around this data Wall Street coming off a strong day of trade on Monday with all the major averages up by more than 1 percent. Let's take a look at Europe; Europe also appears higher across the board as well. It's a busy show. As always, let's begin with today's inflation number. Paul La Monica is here with me now. So Paul, when you look at this report, I have it here. What are you seeing in terms of where inflation is cooling? And perhaps more importantly, where it isn't? PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: Yes, what's very interesting Rahel, is it doesn't seem as of yet that inflation is cooling all that much in the housing market. If you look at the shelter component of CPI, that definitely contributed a big portion of that increase. So I think that there may be some Investors that will take a little bit of heart from that fact. And notice that other areas of the economy, we are starting to see, disinflation kick in a slowdown in the level of price increases. But make no mistake, this is still a high enough number, that it will likely justify the Fed raising rates, again, by a quarter of a point, at least one time, and maybe a couple of more times. I think a lot of people are going to look very closely now, at the retail sales numbers that come out tomorrow, if the consumer still looks strong, then it's another example of this economy continuing to be hot, and the Fed is going to try and pull that off.",

It's categories that aren't necessities, shelter, as you mentioned, food, electricity, apparel, vehicle insurance, and all of those things.

Thousands of people left homeless as a result and we've been visiting some of the donation centers here in Istanbul. Volunteer that one center, working around the clock to sort through these aid donations including blankets, clothes, toiletries, medication and electric heaters because of course it is so cold in the Southeastern part of the country. But the message that we're hearing from coordinators is that they need more support, more donations, more aid, not only for the Turkish government but also from the international community. But it has to be said that the aid program here in Southeastern Turkey and across the country has proven far more robust than the aid entering Northwest Syria. The U.N., according to a statement has now reached an agreement with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to open a further two crossings from Turkey into Northwestern Syria in order to allow aid to get across. But there is still the question of cross line aid transfers that is aid that has been sent to Damascus which is under government control being transferred onwards to the Northwest rebel-held territories of Syria. Now, the government says and claims that they will allow aid to be transferred through this route. However, that hasn't happened yet in aid group say they haven't been offered a timeline or any routes that they may be able to use and they are in desperate need of this aid. More than 4 million people in Northwest Syria were already heavily dependent on humanitarian assistance as a result of years and years of war at the hands of President Bashar al-Assad. And now their lives have been completely devastated once again, but the message from the White Helmets who have been leading on that search and rescue effort is that this is simply too little, too late Nada Bashir in Istanbul.",

So you can find work if you want it and with a job report with an inflation report like this, where inflation numbers are coming down, that clearly does not signal stagflation. So you're a Fed official, you're thinking that, hey, you know what, we may be sticking the landing here on a soft landing and in terms of engineering, a soft landing.

This time, last year, the Federal Reserve were still at 0 percent interest rates and the Fed funds rate, and now they're at 5 percent. So, you know, you've had this massive, really sharp rise in interest rates, and that still is just taking hold into the broader economy.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over): After just a week of training, Ukrainian tank crew show off their new skills on a Polish gun range. The first time their Leopard 2 training has been put on display. The crews pulled direct from Ukraine's Eastern battlefront. Too soon to say what's best about the Leopard 2 Ukraine's tank trainer says but the machine is good quality. And what is most important my soldiers like it a lot. Their training fast tracked 12 hours a day six days a week compared to the Polish standard. Eight hours a day five days a week. Polish instructors say the Ukrainians will be ready in a month. Most of them have some tank skills already the Polish Brigadier in charge says they're so keen to learn. We have to hold them back. ROBERTSON (on camera): Increased time is rare if ever that tank crew's race through their training like this. It's a sign of how much they needed at the frontlines that they're being accelerated through their Leopard 2 apprenticeships. ROBERTSON (voice over): Poland's President who has been at the vanguard of pushing NATO allies to give Ukraine modern battle tanks and it is sending 14 of Poland's came to meet the Ukrainian crews and see their progress.

So the real threat here posed by Russia and its war in Ukraine is felt very strongly here. And that's something that the President Duda certainly plays upon in his narrative. But just look at today for example, two Dutch fighter jets, F-35s based here for NATO inside Poland for NATO was scrambled to intercept or fly close to three Russian planes that were flying close to Poland's border in the north.

CNN's David McKenzie has the details, and a warning his report does contain some disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTENATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russian units pushing forward again and again, only to be obliterated by Ukrainian artillery mines and drones. CNN analysis of multiple videos taken over the past fortnight show the Russians lost at least 30 tanks and armored personnel carriers in this area alone. And it seems several hundred soldiers. These units seem without leadership or tactics, as Russian soldiers scrambled to take cover they are mercilessly cut down. Russian tanks and fighting vehicles Korean straight into well placed minefields. At one point, the lifeless body of a Russian soldier gets entangled in tank tracks. These satellite images provided to CNN show the intense bombardment of the tree lines where Russian army tried and failed to take cover and the landscape littered with destroyed machines. President Putin's earlier comment on the fighting here, the Marine infantry I'm intending the operation just fine he says. This very moment they are fighting heroically. The UK says that Russians are losing soldiers at their highest rate since the start of the war. Even Russian military bloggers are venting their anger at the tactics and commanders. Only morons attack head on the same heavily fortified place writes one, another demanding the general in charge are put on trial.
