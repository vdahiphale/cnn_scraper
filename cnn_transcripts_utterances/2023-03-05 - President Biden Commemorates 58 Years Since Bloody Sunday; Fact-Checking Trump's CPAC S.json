President Joe Biden was in Selma, Alabama, today for the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, and a speech before some of the country's most prominent civil rights leaders. While outside Washington, a very different scene in a very different speech, as former President Donald Trump spoke to the Conservative Political Action Conference, vowing retribution in his words. And earlier today in California, the politician who could be Trump's biggest rival for the GOP nomination in 2024, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, speaking at the Ronald Reagan Library.

A tornado ripped through Selma, Alabama, back in January. If you drive through town, you can see the devastation that was wrought on businesses and buildings. Both the president and the city's mayor talked about the need for the community to continue to come together to recover in the wake of that incident.

Kevin, let me go to you first. I'll put aside the fact-challenged speech from the former president for a moment, but President Biden referenced the need to teach all of this nation's history in Selma earlier today. It had kind of a campaign theme to it, I think. Let's listen to it and talk about it on the other side.

It's a direct contrast with some leaders on the right who are increasingly wading in and trying to make a feature or a centerpiece of many of their arguments about their candidacies or the challenges to the Biden presidency on cultural issues. And, you know, I think what Biden is doing is signaling that he's ready to have that fight and wants to have that fight and believes it's a contrast he can win. I think he does get into some dangerous territory or some problematic political rhetoric when he starts talking about teams. Because one of the things that helped Biden win in 2020 was that he was seen as a uniter, somebody who could appeal to the big middle of the electorate.

I think it's very likely we see him announce in the next few months.What's most striking to me, though, when I see him speak on the trail is really the Trumpification of his rhetoric. I mean, when I worked with DeSantis, when he was a member of the House and I was a staffer, he was a very different guy back then. A much more moderate guy, moderate in tone and policy positions. And what you see from him or Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo or these other presidential aspirants is much more Trumpian rhetoric out there. Those words could easily have come out of the ex-president's mouth and they come out of, you know, Ron DeSantis' mouth. I also think it's noteworthy that at CPAC, you had one of the aspirants, Nikki Haley, heckled out of the event by Trump supporters.

I mean, we heard a lot of talk about, you know, the Trump version of the party versus the Reagan version of the party at CPAC. And if Ronald Reagan ran inside a Republican primary today, you know, he'd finish in the middle of the pack. That's the reality of where this party has gone and where really a lot of the base enthusiasm is.So, you know, one of the big openings right now in the party for somebody who's not Trump is that if we look at Trump's speech, it was a lot of revisionism, it was a lot of talk about vengeance, but it was all a re-litigation of the past. And as we all know, anybody who's worked on a campaign, particularly presidential campaigns, they are always a contest for the future. And so if one of these candidates wants to go in and win the big middle and wants to win the sort of more optimistic vision for the future of the party, there is an opening. Trump has left an opening. But right now, he still has a very, very tight hold on the most active base voters that matter in these primaries.",

But they've done everything they can during that administration and afterwards to portray themselves as loyal lieutenants of the ex-president. So that's probably going to be the biggest challenge for they and other aspirants during this campaign is drawing that distinction. And I want to echo what Kevin said, I really think this is not Ronald Reagan's party anymore. And Donald Trump for years -- I used to think it was narcissistic, that he would make fun of Ronald Reagan and say he was greater than Reagan or Abraham Lincoln, but I've come to the conclusion that he's right. Neither of those ex-presidents, well, perhaps Lincoln, but Reagan didn't have people who literally worshiped him, were willing to die for him, were willing to overturn a free and fair election for him.
