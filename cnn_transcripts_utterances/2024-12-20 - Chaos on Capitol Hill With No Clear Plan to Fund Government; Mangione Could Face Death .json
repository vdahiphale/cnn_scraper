This morning, you can see this on your screen right now, President- elect Donald Trump calling on Congress to let the shutdown happen now before he takes office next month. But House Speaker Mike Johnson is holding critical meetings with GOP members at this hour trying to get an agreement passed before the deadline. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. I am standing outside of the Democratic Caucus meeting that is set to begin in just a couple of minutes. We are still waiting on Leader Jeffries to arrive this morning.But this is why this meeting is so critical. Right now, House Republicans are debating amongst themselves whether or not to drop Donald Trump's demand to include an increase in the debt ceiling as part of these spending negotiations. Now, it's not clear whether Republicans would ultimately go that route. But if they do, Democrats are going to have to make a decision about whether or not they would be willing to accept something that is perhaps too different than the agreement that they locked in on Tuesday night, but still is a clean spending bill that includes perhaps some disaster aid. We don't know exactly what Republicans would settle on, but obviously whether or not Democrats are going to back this is a huge question right now. And the reason for that is you saw last night more than 30 Republicans voting against a GOP plan to fund the government until March 14th. The reality is when it comes to spending bills, Democrats and Republicans have to work together. That is the way that this coalition has always worked. So, if Democrats decide to dig in, that they're only accepting the Tuesday deal and nothing else, that would give us a lot of indication that we're likely headed toward a shutdown. Now, if that's the case, Democrats seem more flexible to potentially any plan that doesn't include a debt ceiling, perhaps that gives them some wiggle room. Now, again, all of this is extremely fluid this morning, but this meeting that Democrats are having right now where they're huddling behind closed doors, it's going to be really important and key to what happens today.

I mean, last time, Johnson was trying to give his members some room to read this legislation, and as members read it, they didn't like it. I mean, one of the challenges of these massive end of year spending bills is that there are a lot of things in there that people love and there are a lot of things in there that people like. And the longer that legislative text hangs out there, sometimes the more defections you get.Now, again, the deadline right now is midnight tonight. That really doesn't give Johnson the room to give members time to read this bill over 72 hours. Now, can members read a 100-page bill in a couple of hours? Probably.",

And he doesn't want that associated with the trillions of dollars of new debt that it will create, causing even some Republicans this week for the first time to say, we cannot afford that kind of tax scam again.If the debt limit change is removed from the bill, we need to look at it closely, but it's against an experience this week of having a complete agreement, ready to vote on it, and then having Republicans back down on their word.

Those are the kind of programs that some want to cut in order to finance these tax cuts for those at the top.The other big concern I have, because we have a terrible shortage of air traffic controllers in Austin, my hometown, is the impact that the shutdown could have on air traffic. With holiday traffic at its peak right now, we really faced with a shutdown that impacts these air traffic controllers. They have to go to work, but they're not being paid.

Heavily armed officers in bulletproof vests surrounded him, whipped him off to federal court, where he had new charges filed against him.Mangione now faces four federal charges with the one count of murder carrying the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. We're also learning more about the notebook found with him and how it helped prosecutors build the federal case against him.

So, it makes clear beyond any possible doubt that he was in fact the shooter.But more than that, Jim, that notebook provided the hook that the feds needed to come in and bring federal charges. Because the feds, and I was a federal prosecutor, you can't just charge someone with murder. You need to have some interstate element. You need to have some element of planning for some of the charges that were brought. And I think that notebook enabled the feds to say, well, he intentionally planned this out. He stalked, to use the legal term there, and he crossed state lines in order to commit this murder. So, that's devastating evidence.",

You have to show the person didn't even understand what they were doing.

So, it may be that the two sides, the feds and the state, get together and come to some sort of uneasy agreement as to who will go first, but if they don't and they're racing, I would probably say the federal case is more likely.",
