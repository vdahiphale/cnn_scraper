Erica Hill, thanks for joining me on \"Connect the World\". I'm in for Becky Anderson today. Just ahead over the next two hours, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Wisconsin today. Both campaigns, of course, hoping to shore up last minute votes and get their supporters out to the polls in that key state. Also, new jobs report just out minutes ago is the final key economic indicator prior to Election Day. What could it mean for the candidates. And the death toll now rising in Valencia, after those flash floods in Spain brought a year's worth of rain to the region in just a day. Well, the stock market here in New York about 30 minutes from its open. Of course, we just got these latest jobs report. As you can see, little bit of green. Never hurts to start your Friday when we're looking at futures there. So, we'll keep an eye on those markets for you throughout the morning. Meantime, the focus here in the United States obviously squarely on Election Day, four days away now. And the fight for female voters really in the spotlight today. Women, as we know, could make or break this race for either candidate in key battle ground states. Important to note too, women typically outperform men in U.S. elections, and there are more female registered voters in this country than male. Well, Trump does remain ahead overall. When it does look at male fame, male voters, more women are leaning toward Harris, and recent polling shows women outpacing men, not just in those registrations, but also when it comes to early voting in those key swing states. Could that be good news for the Harris camp? We don't know. All we know is the women were there. We cannot tell you exactly how they voted. On the trail, Harris zeroing in, though, on Trump's comments earlier this week about how he would protect women. Here's some of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: About four weeks ago, I was saying, no, I want to protect the people. I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women, sir, please don't say that. Why they said we think it's very inappropriate for you to say so why. I'm president. I want to protect the women of our country. Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He said that he will do what he wants. Now I'm about to quote whether the women like it or not. We know the man simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to be able to make decisions about their own lives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The fact that both candidates will be in Wisconsin today really does, once again, underscore how important the state is? How much wiggle room is there? Or is this simply about getting supporters to the polls at this point, ZELENY (on camera): Erica, there is no wiggle room for either side or very little, we should say. The candidates have basically been chasing one another. They were out west yesterday, in Arizona and Nevada. They will be here in Wisconsin today, following a similar path. What that tells us is that neither side sees a clear leader. Neither side is overly confident that they are, at this moment, in the position to win. They are still in the early voting period, so both of the rallies that Vice President Harris is making three stops today in Wisconsin. Former President Donald Trump only making one. They're trying to get their supporters out, yes, but also trying to get their message out. But in terms of the strategy for winning 270 electoral votes, that, of course, is the name of the game here, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. We say it a lot, but that so called blue wall, if you will, is likely to determine who wins the presidency. Donald Trump won the three states in 16. He went to the White House. He lost the three states in 2020, and he was defeated. So that is how sort of close this is. And all our indications and polling suggest, it is a margin of error knife edge race here. So that is why the comments at the end of the campaign the former president has made about Liz Cheney and other things could impact the race, or perhaps things are already baked in.

The Trump campaign has largely outsourced this grass roots ground game. Perhaps it will be as strong as ever. It's un-clustered and unclear, but again, in the final days here, every single vote that does matter. It's obvious, of course. But what we don't know, Erica, for all of the polling of things we don't know, the makeup of the electorate. Will there be record setting turnout this year, in the first presidential year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe Versus Wade.

It does mean that they believe that now is indeed the right time to pursue that agreement, given the series of military accomplishments that they believe they have reached. But as one Israeli official told me, they are only going to negotiate, quote under fire, meaning that they are going to continue to ramp up the military pressure through the air strikes that we have seen over the course of the last week. Some very significant ones, not only in southern Lebanon, but also in the northeastern City of Baalbek earlier this week, and then overnight in the southern suburbs of Beirut, once again, a series of very intense air strikes. And so, the military pressure is very much -- and parcel of Israel's negotiating strategy. And there is a sense that it has worked to a certain extent, at least. And that is because Hezbollah previously had said, we're only going to agree to a cease fire if Israel stops its war in Gaza. And now Hezbollah seems to be engaging in good faith in cease fire negotiations that have nothing to do with Israel's war in Gaza. And so now the question is, can Israel get all of the enforcement measures for resolution 1701, which would see Hezbollah withdraw some 30 kilometers north of the Israel-Lebanon border in order for it to be able to agree to a deal, is that something that Hezbollah will ultimately accept, as well as the Lebanese government.",

The U.S. and South Korea carrying out a large-scale aerial exercise. Following that launch more than 100 advanced fighter jets from the U.S. from South Korea. So, making it clear there will be military cooperation and North Korea carries out these sorts of tests with South Korean officials here. Both the U.S. and South Korea here said they'd like to see more engagement from the Chinese on trying to get the North Koreans to step back. But so far, all South Korea is saying is that China is waiting and watching. Oren Liebermann CNN in the Pentagon.",
