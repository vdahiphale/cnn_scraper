Standby for an update on the deadly crash as questions swirl about what went wrong and who's to blame.Also this hour, President-elect Trump leaves a trail of very provocative Christmas Day posts threatening and insulting U.S. Allies. He's tripling down on talk that the U.S. could somehow seize control of Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal. Plus, we're tracking the rise in cases of bird flu among animals in the Western U.S. fueling fears it could spread to people and potentially, potentially lead to another pandemic. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our top story this hour, new indications that Russia may be responsible for a passenger plane crash that killed at least 38 people on board. CNN's Bianna Golodryga is following the investigation.

      "sentences": "As investigators race to determine the cause of the deadly Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash, early indications suggest that a Russian anti-aircraft system may be responsible, a U.S. official told CNN. The aircraft was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian republic of Chechnya when it attempted an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. The crash occurred shortly after Ukraine fired drones nearby at southern Russia, possibly leading Russia's defense systems to inadvertently strike the aircraft, the official said.Video from onboard the flight shows panicked passengers praying and holes visible in the body of the aircraft. The source of the apparent damage has not been confirmed. The airline and Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency initially told local media the aircraft crashed after it collided with a flock of birds, an account disputed by Ukrainian counter disinformation official Andriy Kovalenko. Russian state media also reported that the plane had been rerouted due to heavy fog around Chechnya's capital. Several investigations have been opened, including one by a joint commission involving representatives from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia. PRES. ILHAM ALIYEV, AZERBAIJAN (through translator): The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, the causes and all the details of the accident and to inform both me and the people of Azerbaijan. GOLODRYGA (voice-over): The Kremlin expressed condolences for those impacted by the crash and urged against speculation into the cause until the investigations have concluded. Of the 67 people on board, 29 survived, including two children, authorities said. In Azerbaijan, a day of mourning was declared for the dead. Some relatives of the survivors remain on edge, waiting for news on loved ones recovery. FIZULI JALLIOV, FATHER OF SURVIVOR NIZAMI JALLIOV (through translator): I don't know what to say, honestly. I spoke with my son today. Thank God his condition is good. If everything goes well today and tomorrow, he will come to Baku. Let's see what happens next. GOLODRYGA (voice-over): For many families of the at least 38 people killed in the crash, answers can't come soon enough. (END VIDEOTAPE) GOLODRYGA (on camera): Aviation experts have indicated that it's unlikely a bird strike could have caused this crash and that the Russian defense system theory is possible. Officials recovered the black box at the crash site, which they hope will provide more information. For now, several world leaders have expressed their condolences and voiced their support for a thorough investigation into the matter. Wolf.",

MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: No question, this was not a bird strike that caused that shrapnel damage to the tail section of that aircraft, Wolf, that is telltale signs of an explosion. And because the metal is bent inward as opposed to outward, we can presume the explosion occurred outside of the aircraft. So that would lead us to a very strong conclusion about a surface to air missile. And that is something you don't need black boxes to tell that story.",

But also, you know, in this environment, air space command and control is very complicated. The Russians may not be very good at it. These are aircraft flying from different countries. Maybe they had a shoot first or weapons free policy at this point. And so anything that flew, they were going to engage. And so we just don't know.

You know, both of the aircraft found themselves in the middle of a war. But what's reckless about it is, frankly, that the Russian, you know, civilian air control should have closed off the airspace and the Russians knew very well that there was a hot war going on there at the time.

You may recall United Airlines Flight 232 is a DC10. Hydraulic failure, very similar control scenario. The crew desperately trying to control it using differential thrust on the engines of that aircraft after a hydraulic failure. This is all very similar to what we just saw. And they were able to land in a very dramatic way in Sioux City, Iowa. There were several people killed, but several hundred actually survived. So, it's a testament to the pilots that they were able to save lives in this case. May the pilots rest in peace. Of course, they did not survive. [17:10:12] They won't tell the tale except via that cockpit voice recorder, but they did a good job doing what they could without control surfaces, without hydraulics, you're not moving the rudder, you're not moving the ailerons, you're just trying to control the direction of the aircraft and its descent with the power on the engines.",

He's focused on delivering ordinance against Ukraine, and that's their primary thing.They've got area defense and local regional defense against these Ukrainian drone strikes.

Kazakhstan, of course, was part of the former Soviet Union. We all know Vladimir Putin has said publicly he wants to recreate the Soviet empire, that would include Kazakhstan. And foreign minister, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has actually said out loud that he does not believe that Kazakhstan is a state. So, Kazakhstan has been nervous about Russia's ambition vis-a-vis, you know, its sovereignty. And so they've tried to keep good relations with us and with the Chinese to balance that dynamic with Russia.So that's complicated. With Azerbaijan, of course, it was Azerbaijani National Airline aircraft that flew in and experienced this accident. Their pilots were probably Azerbaijani. I don't know that detail. But for some reason, the pilots didn't land actually in the Russian Republic, they didn't try to land in Grozny in Chechnya, they chose to try -- well, actually crash landed in Kazakhstan. So that's an interesting wrinkle. And the Azerbaijanis and the Russians have been trying to get a little bit closer together, and that's part of a whole another complicated scenario there, Wolf. There's been a war that's been fought for decades now between Armenia and Azerbaijan, two countries there in the Caucasus. Russia used to be on the side with Armenia. They've been increasingly flexing their muscles and gaining -- trying to gain their independence. That will also be an interesting dynamic when we have our new president, President Trump, because he has been pro Armenian. So it's incredibly complicated right now.",

It's simply because Vladimir Putin and the people in the Eurasian Economic Union that Kazakhstan's part of, they haven't shut down the airspace. They just don't have the controls up there to shut it down. They don't want to admit, I suppose, that there is active conflict. They don't want to recognize the threat from Ukraine.That would be another blow to Vladimir Putin's control over the -- over Russia and the neighboring states. And so for probably for political reasons, they're not shutting it down. Of course, people will always fly. They assume the airlines are going to be safe. We've got a great record globally in terms of aviation safety. And so, people just assume that governments will take care of them. And in this case, the government didn't.",

But when I've talked to Donald Trump's advisers, including today, about this one, particularly when it relates to the Panama Canal, they said that Donald Trump has actually been fixated on this for months now. He brought this up in an interview over the summer where he said many similar things, that he thought it was a mistake for then President Jimmy Carter to have this treaty with Panama to give them control over the canal despite it being made by Americans.And also though this idea that he really believes that American ships and vessels are being taken advantage of through this process. I'm told that a lot of these arguments, including not just the pan over the Panama Canal, but his calls about wanting to take over Greenland is because he wants to force these leaders to the negotiating table. One is that, for the Panama Canal example, he wants there to better prices for American ships. He also believes that China is controlling a lot of the ports on the canal. And so that's something that he's really trying to, you know, show strength in his leadership and kind of assert his dominance to bring some of these leaders to the table. There's also questions of, you know, influence from other countries, the United States, foreign adversaries like China and Russia, how that plays into all of this.

But there's one central theme that I hear out of all of this, and that is the Chinese Communist Party because they clearly are taking Panama and Greenland seriously. We know for a fact they do control ports at each end. We know that they have been investing billions and billions of dollars to their belts and roads initiative in Panama. We know that they have tried to buy and build in Greenland. So, this is really about a national security issue that Donald Trump is talking about.

Which were those four airstrikes were the, you know, I don't think ever in history before Israeli air force conducted such a long range strike. And I think it tells you a lot about where the Gaza war is because this is an offshoot of the Gaza war. We saw the Lebanese front close down. We saw the Iranian front sort of close down. We saw the Iraqi front sort of close down. And the Yemeni front is the only one that is still burning. And it's not only that it's burning, it's getting worse and worse by the day with the Houthis firing more and more ballistic missiles at Israel and the Israelis conducting more and more airstrikes in Yemen.",

But once they launch every day or every other day in the middle of the night, a rocket ballistic missile towards Israel, it basically turns off the sirens in half of the country and sends millions of Israelis into safe rooms and bomb shelters in the middle of the night.And for them, this is a good enough achievement. They don't even need to hit anything because most of those missiles are either intercepted, they don't really hit anything. But the fear and the uncertainty and the terror they create in Israeli population is enough of an achievement for the Houthis. When, on the other hand, when the Israelis strike in Yemen, you know, it causes a lot of damages to the Houthis, but not enough to deter them from continuing those rocket launches towards Israel.",

And I think this is a case of it -- it tells you a lot about where the war is right now, because I think that when you speak to people inside the IDF, they tell you that they feel that this -- that they achieved almost everything they wanted to in this war militarily. And everything you see right now is remnants of Hamas or Islamic Jihad in Gaza, but not something that really dramatically changes the picture.And it brings us back to the -- to the most crucial point here, that in order to end this war, you need a hostage deal. And the IDF wants this hostage deal very much, even in the cost of stopping the war. The Israeli government, on the other hand, for now, refuses to end the war.",

But the gaps are so big that in order for -- to -- to bridge them, very big political decisions need to be made. And it doesn't seem that on either side, they're ready to make those decisions. And I think that it creates both among Israeli negotiators and also people in the Biden administration that are still trying to push this thing. They're very skeptical of whether you can get any deal before Biden leaves office on January 20th.",

A big cat sanctuary says they've lost 20 animals over the past few weeks to the virus while bird flu detected in a brand of natural cat food was responsible for killing a house cat in Oregon, the virus can be fatal if it's passed on to humans. Dr. Ashish Jha is joining us right now. He's the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and the former White House COVID-19 response coordinator under President Biden. Dr. Jha, thanks so much for joining us. First of all, how serious is this threat from bird flu? Could it become as serious, God forbid, as COVID?DR. ASHISH JHA, DEAN, BROWN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Well, first of all, Wolf, thanks for having me back. You know, bird flu is a virus that we have been watching for many, many years, something that has concerned us because it can be quite serious among humans. Thankfully, we have not seen human to human transmission, not in any sustained way. As long as we keep it that way, I think the risk of the American people remain low. But there is so much virus spreading around right now among animals that we've got to be on the lookout for the virus's ability to begin to spread among people.",

So right now there are so many animals. We've got cows, we've got cats, as you mentioned. We've got a whole host of other animals that are getting infected with this virus. We really do have to put it out because eventually the virus will figure out how to spread more effectively among humans. And we've got to do something about it before it gets there.",

So the number one thing Americans need to be doing is making sure their milk is pasteurized. The stuff you get in grocery stores is always pasteurized. So that's critical. Avoiding raw meat, obviously, you can see it in raw beef, you can get it in raw turkey. So those are other things. Cooking your meat well can also really make a big difference.To me those are the most important things most Americans should be doing. Also, if you see a sick bird out in the yard, don't touch it. Don't -- don't let your pets play with it. Those are also things that are another way for the virus to spread.",
