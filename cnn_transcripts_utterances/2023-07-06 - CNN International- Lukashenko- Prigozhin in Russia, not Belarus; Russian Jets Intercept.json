Just ahead, the leader of Belarus says Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is in Russia not Belarus, as he speaks to CNN after he helped broker a deal in the wake of a Russia mutiny.This is Russian state media claim police seized gold weapons and weeks from Prigozhin's St. Petersburg residents, those details in the moment. And Meta launches Threads it's highly anticipated answer to Twitter. So what can we expect from a newer social media contender? The Kremlin is refusing to comment on the whereabouts of Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. Earlier while Speaking to CNN, the President of Belarus said Prigozhin is in Russia. The Wagner boss led his mercenary fighters in a brief rebellion against Russian military leaders nearly two weeks ago now. And he reportedly agreed to excel in Belarus but according to that country's President, Prigozhin is not there now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, well, the answer was pretty straightforward. It just contradicted the previous statements that Alexander Lukashenko had made, that Yevgeny Prigozhin was here. And of course, it all stems from the deal, which he is said to have brokered last month to bring to an end the Wagner uprising in Russia, in which Wagner fighters and the Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin were offered, essentially exile here in Belarus.And that's one of the reasons they called off their military uprising, their so called march for justice, as they called it, on Moscow. And so this throws into doubt now, whether that deal is still valid, whether it's being sort of forcibly renegotiated by the Kremlin that certainly seems to be what the indications are the fact that Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, would put so much distance between himself Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner group. He denied that there were any military facilities being prepared here for Wagner to arrive, even though there have been satellite photographs that have been published in the past few days, showing that military facilities that had tents put up there possibly in preparation for a Wagner arrival. And so it all implies that the plan to bring Wagner here to bring Yevgeny Prigozhin here, that's no longer the plan. And we might be looking at another scenario for the Wagner leader.",

Many people have fled to that part of the country because they thought it was safe. Clearly, it is not now, among the dead is a 21 year old journalist, a woman as well as a 95 year old woman who survived the Second World War, but not this one. Now there's been a bit of an uproar in Lviv over the fact that when this strike took place, 10 bomb shelters had been locked shut. There was a similar uproar in Kyiv, a little while ago because bomb shelters were locked and people couldn't escape into them during an air raid as well.

It's a social media tech sharing platform designed to offer a space for real time conversations online. CEO, Mark Zuckerberg claims 10 million people signed up in the first seven hours. Threads, is a direct challenge to Twitter.But it appears to have plenty of similarities with it, including its layout and the timing of the launch seem to be just right as well since Elon Musk took over Twitter. It's faced a series of challenges and systemic problems. The new Threads launch escalates the rivalry not only between the tech giants, but also between Zuckerberg and Musk personally. You may remember Musk teasing the idea of a cage fight with Zuckerberg. Let's bring in CNN's Clare Duffy, who joins us live from New York. This is a cleaner version of a fight isn't it than cage fight but from what you've seen of it, is it an exact copy of Twitter? How would you describe it?",

Instagram much more sort of lifestyle for me, I don't know if that's typical, but it's kind of odd seeing, you know, interiors, and travel coming through what looks like a Twitter feed.

You know, you hear a lot of people sort of making jokes about the fact that the people who follow them on Instagram are they're sort of friends and family and personal connections. And that's much different than the people who typically follow them on Twitter.And so there might be sort of disconnect, and people have to kind of build their Twitter followings on this new app. I think sort of stepping back a bit. This also gets at one of the challenges for Meta is that this is a brand new platform that they're going to have to moderate, especially going into the 2024 U.S. Presidential election campaign season. This is something that they're going to have to keep safe, avoid harassment, avoid spam, and avoid misinformation. And that's a lot of things that sort of had turned people off from Twitter. And so I think that's one of the challenges that they're going to have to deal with. It's so exciting, this new launch, but there are going to be challenges for Meta as well.",

He implemented a temporary limit on the number of tweets that users can read on the platform, which doesn't make a lot of sense if your whole business is trying to get people to read content on your platform.So I think we may start to see him changing some of those newer sorts of implemented policies. But it's hard to see what all Elon can do to really challenge this new platform. I think this presents a real problem for him because people have been looking for an alternative to Twitter for months since Elon Musk took over this platform. And so it will be interesting to see what he does. I'm sure he'll get some digs in on Mark Zuckerberg today on Twitter, but we'll have to wait and see.",

But I do think there is still a demand. I mean, we've seen people have talked about wanting a Twitter alternative for months, but there hasn't really been one that stuck so far.And so there is I think still some demand for this text based platform where people can go for real time conversations, they can go for news. And so I think that's what Meta is trying to capitalize on here. And of course, Meta brings the benefit of its existing scale, there are 2 billion active users on Instagram that can really easily now join this new platform.",

Witnesses or witness 5 appears to be Trump aide Walt Nauta, who had been indicted along with the Former President.
