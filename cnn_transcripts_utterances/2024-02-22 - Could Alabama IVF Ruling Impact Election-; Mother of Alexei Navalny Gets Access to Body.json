      "sentences": "Yes, we have seen social media posts from many, many emergency services around the country saying, hey, AT&amp;T customers may have trouble making calls to 911.A lot of them are recommending that, again, if you are having trouble getting in touch with first responders, use an alternative method, such as a landline or a cell phone that use another network service, like Verizon or T-Mobile. They have even recommended in some situations using social media to try to get in touch with police or fire departments. And in some situations, we have also seen tweets from fire departments saying, make sure, if your fire alarm goes off, that fire alarm may not necessarily be able to connect with or contact the fire department automatically through its own dedicated telecommunications service. So, make sure, if your fire alarm goes off, make a call to 911 just to be sure. Now, on the other hand, we have also seen reports that people have been making test calls to 911 trying to make sure that they can get through if need be. And the Massachusetts State Police has been warning people that, hey, our 911 call centers have been flooded by these so-called test calls. And please do not do that. Do not call 911 just to make sure that you can get through, because that bandwidth, that capacity is really needed for real emergencies. So, if you are concerned about your ability to access 911, just place a call to another individual, someone you know, a family member or a loved one. And if your service is working, if that call goes through, that means you will be able to call 911 if you need to. But please do not call 911 directly from your phone. That's according to the Massachusetts State Police. So, all in all, this issue is causing widespread disruption, Kate. And it's particularly concerning because it's affecting public safety and emergency services whose network AT&amp;T actually does manage and is responsible for. So I imagine there will be probably many questions going forward, not only about how this happened, but what AT&amp;T will do to be held accountable -- Kate.",

Alabama Fertility announced this morning it is pausing embryo transfers. Yesterday, the state's largest hospital system announced that it is pausing IVF procedures. Earlier this morning, I spoke with a woman's health advocate in Alabama about this big question of what comes next.

Are doctor malpractice insurance going to go through the roof, which is likely because now they're open to a whole new batch of lawsuits? This is financially going to put infertility treatment out of reach for most people in Alabama, frankly, even if it does become something that they can somehow modify to make something safer under the guise of the new rules from the Supreme Court.

You can see the reach here. The issue is clearly becoming another major political issue on the campaign trail. Let's talk about both sides of this. CNN's Kylie Atwood following the Nikki Haley campaign in Charleston, South Carolina. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Kylie, let me begin with you.

I don't think Arlette can hear us. So, let me reiterate. We were going to talk -- I was going to talk to Arlette. Maybe we will get her back. Please let me know. I was to talk to Arlette about what more the Biden campaign is saying as they put out this statement. But I have some of it here, so I can read it for you. The campaign is really using this to blast Republicans far beyond Alabama and trying now to make this connection. This is from the legal fallout to now to the political fallout, what they're trying to do, and saying that this is only possible -- quote -- \"is only possible because Donald Trump's Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade\" and calling the ruling a -- quote, unquote -- \"blueprint for Republicans' extreme MAGA reproductive agenda.\" So you can see that this -- reproductive rights has already been a major issue for the Biden campaign. They're trying to make it a major issue. They want to keep it on the forefront. Kamala Harris has even had a fight for reproductive freedoms tour that she's been on as part of the reelection campaign, and you see this feeds right into that -- John.",

Conway shared polling that found that an overwhelming number of voters, 86 percent, support IVF, even those who consider themselves pro-life and evangelical.\" So, again, I know this is an issue that's emotional and very real for a lot of people trying to have children.

I don't really know anybody who wants to restrict fertilitytreatments. In fact, we're a pro-family party. I mean, we want people to have babies and have families and be happy with that. And so I don't know the legal ins and outs of this particular case, but, as a political and policymaking matter, I don't hear Republicans and I don't hear conservatives out there crusading around saying we have to end all fertility treatments in the United States. I think Kellyanne's assessment is correct. I'm sure the polling she cited is absolutely right. So, as a policy matter, I think the Republican Party ought to continue to embrace the idea of people having families, starting families, and using the medical technology that's available to us. It's a miracle that it's available to us today to get that done. As Bakari talked about with his own family, these are miracles from God that we're even able to have this technology that allows people who have trouble to do it. So, as a policy and political matter, I think the Republican Party is probably going to continue to embrace the idea of making families and having strong nuclear families.",

If you're a federalist and you believe in states having autonomy over policymaking -- that was the whole issue behind the abortion ruling -- then the next part of that is that the policymakers in those states have to say, what makes sense? What's good common sense here? Can we be pro-life and can we also support fertility treatments? Of course, the answer is yes. Anybody with half-a-brain would say the answer is yes. Anybody with any common sense would say the answer is yes. So my encouragement to the policymakers in Alabama would be to say, OK, OK, this is not what we want here. We want to protect life.

He also said that Biden was trying to act like a Hollywood cowboy, and trying and failing was the implication.

There are several Americans now, including Paul Whelan, the former Marine, Evan Gershkovich, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, who are now in Russian custody.
