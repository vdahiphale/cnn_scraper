Well, listen, it's really hard to do that nearly impossible, especially tonight, to get people all in the same room to travel.Now, the snow is supposed to stop and then it's going to get as you mentioned, absolutely frigid here and the campaigns are already looking to Monday to see how they might manage that. It's Iowa, it snows in the winter, there's no doubt about that. But we're talking record breaking cold. This is forecasted to be the coldest caucus day ever in Iowa's history, wind chills at negative 40, so really extreme temperatures. So you have the Trump campaign that's starting to kind of downplay expectations, saying, look, in all of these polls, so many of these polls, we have such a commanding lead people, might stay home, we've seen the former president telling his supporters, I need you out there. So we're hearing that from the Trump campaign. On the DeSantis front, you know, they have hiked this ground game that they have for months now that with their aligned Super PAC, and then within the campaign as well. It's going to be really put to the test on Monday to see how effective it will be if they can get their supporters to those caucus sites. Nikki Haley last night just saying listen, it's going to be unthinkably cold, I'm going to be out there I need you to be out there. So they're really trying to, you know, convince people that it's worth getting out. But in Iowa especially it's about organization, it's about ground game, it's about who shows up at those caucus sites. And when you throw in extreme weather like this, we're just going to have to see how that all shakes out on Monday, John?",

And it brings Congress much closer to regular order, which is our big commitment here. And keeping up with my commitment to bring members into the legislative process, I've spoken and received feedback this week from many members all across the Republican Conference. That's a very important part of this. When I became speaker, I committed to decentralizing the Speaker's office, and making this a member driven process that's been part of this. Our top line agreement remains. We are getting our next steps together. And we are working toward a robust appropriations process. So stay tuned for all that to develop. Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But that to me says that his -- when he talks about the agreement, the last agreement was a top line agreement with the Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, a top line agreement on keeping -- on funding the government.We are up against a first of two deadlines next week, to come to a funding agreement to avoid a series of steps that lead to a government shutdown, a partial government shutdown would set in next week. And then two weeks after that a full government shutdown, this has been obviously this is now another moment where House Speaker Mike Johnson is up against a challenge and a real test. And he's really facing it from the right flank of the party who had been bulking over that top line agreement, some of them over moving forward with any government funding without serious cuts and other things brought in.

There had been some question whether that deal may be in jeopardy given the fact that there were hardline conservatives who were pushing Johnson to back away from the agreement that he reached with Chuck Schumer.He just said, he believes that that agreement is the best one he could have gotten. He also made it very clear that he was talking to the hardline conservatives yesterday, because his approach to the speakership was always going to be that he wanted to hear from all sides of the Republican conference. But the underlying reality here is that Republicans are divided on the best path forward. And as the speaker, he has to make a call, the call he's making is that they are sticking with that top line agreement. We should note that Speaker Johnson did not answer questions on whether or not he believes they need to have a short term spending deal in order to give themselves more time to negotiate those fuller bills at that top line spending agreement. That is something that majority leader Schumer has made clear that he believes is necessary. He took procedural steps yesterday on the floor of the Senate to make sure that the Senate is ready with a short term spending bill. So that still remains to be a major question right now.

That margin is going to be important because he has in the polling thus far has been 30 points ahead.So if all of a sudden that shrinks to something like 15 points, or 10 points come caucus night, that will be taken note of that his performance may not be as dominant as the polling suggests, we are going to get a final Des Moines Register poll this weekend, that will also set expectations going into Monday. But to your point about that battle for second place, if Ron DeSantis, after all he's invested here, after it has been all about Iowa for him, ends up being displaced in second place by Nikki Haley and comes in third, I think that is going to be devastating for his campaign, and its ability to have enough money and support to move forward. Otherwise, if he comes in second and does have a closer than expected finish to Donald Trump, you can imagine the reverse is true. Some money will come in and some ability to move on to New Hampshire where obviously he has not been in the game there much at all.",

That doesn't mean it can't happen.And I do think Monday is in a really important moment for the Republican Party. This is going to be the first time, Sara, since Donald Trump left office, since January 6th, that the Republican Party is going to start weighing in on this big question about whether or not they want him to be their standard bearer for a rematch against Joe Biden, or if they want someone else. Now we know where all the polls are in this race. We see how ahead he is, but voters actually start weighing in to answer that question on Monday, and that will define much of 2024 going forward.",
