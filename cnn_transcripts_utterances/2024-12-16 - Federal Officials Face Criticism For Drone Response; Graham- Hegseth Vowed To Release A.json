Jacoby, that drones and vessels off of our coastline pose specific threats that have to be dealt with. It's become to no one's surprise and to lawmakers and officials that there is more funding and development of capabilities required to counter these threats at home because the homeland really is the soft underbelly of our defenses. We're more strong overseas than we are at home. And I speak both as a Canadian serviceman but also having operated significantly the American service as well. We're much stronger on the OA game than we are at home. And there needs to be real good policy that's associated with homeland defense. Law enforcement needs to be armed with the ability to counter these kinds of systems and they need to be given funding to be able to do these. Now, pertaining to vessels off of our coastline it is very plausible that a commercial vessel off of our coastline could be hiding a set of drones or a missile system. And we worked at a variety of threats that we trained against on a continuous basis to try and counter even the wildest dreams -- what you could make up. That is why NORAD was given the maritime warning mission. That is why NORAD and U.S. North Comm, along with the American and Canadian navies and the coast guards monitor all of the vessels off the coastline. But this is difficult stuff to do, and it is -- it constitutes a significant threat.",

But he seems to be now, despite a couple of weeks ago saying that these are concerning reports about Hegseth -- he seems to be on board. And it seems that after a very rocky road Hegseth seems to be much more on the straight and narrow when it comes to getting to this confirmation. We shall see, of course. But there is this enhanced pressure campaign that seems to be growing on some of these more moderate Republicans -- the Joni Ernsts, the Thom Tillises of the world -- that are in cycle this election -- or in 2026, rather, that they could face primary challenges if they're not sufficiently loyal to Trump and his nominees.

Unfortunately, there's -- other than a few tax cuts and a few other opportunities to maybe cut government spending, there's not a lot to look forward to for a genuine conservative like myself. I believe Donald Trump has built more of a -- you know, his legacy is more built on a Ponzi scheme -- a Ponzi scheme of populist ideas -- and every day it's going to get a little bit more edgy and a little bit more daring and bombastic. And I think you have to look no further than these nominees to see it as part of that next step in the Ponzi scheme.
