And by this time tomorrow, we should have a pretty good idea whether Nikki Haley can put the brakes on what, so far, seems like a Trump juggernaut heading straight for the republican nomination. It's democracy in action. You'll see it all live right here. But first, my exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. We talked about the reversal of Roe v. Wade and what that means for voters. Plus, Donald Trump's legal woes and her candid reaction to how people view her. It's a wide-ranging conversation, one you won't hear anywhere else but here, and it starts right now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Right? It's not just about what do we have for, what happened over the last four years or what happened because of Donald Trump in the courts, but also this is something that could affect other things like birth control. And I have to say, you know, maybe this is a little bit to push back at Shermichael's point, several states have already shown that they are willing to put reproductive rights on the ballot, that they want to protect it. Sixty-one percent of Americans say that abortion should be legal in all cases or most cases. That is something that is a rallying call. It is a deeply popular issue.

But, you know, when you look at Democratic mayors who are concerned about influx into their city, the administration should be -- should be aggressive about putting the ball in the Republicans court and saying, we have put these tougher measures on the table. The Republicans are saying no. Why are they saying no? Because it's an election year and they don't want to give the Biden team a bipartisan win, frankly, on immigration.

So, last year, 2022, Donald Trump's team worked really, really hard to change multiple states. So, California is now a winner take all. Thanks in part to Kevin McCarthy. You have other states where they've changed the rules to winner take most. So, for example, if Donald Trump were to win 40, 50%, he would be allocated 40, 50% of the delegates.
