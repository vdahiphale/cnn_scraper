Both David Weiss and Merrick Garland have said he was given complete -- a blank check. He could have gone wherever he wanted. And, to me, those are two very credible people. David Weiss was a Trump appointee. He had Democratic support. Merrick Garland, for all the criticisms I've lodged against him, has been an absolute truth teller and absolute straight shooter. But I think the most interesting allegation that does need to be looked into further is this claim that certain avenues of investigation were cut off because, as a prosecutor, you're supposed to take your leads wherever they go. You're supposed to follow them wherever they may go. And if it's the case that somebody said, no, no, no, let's not look there.

He's got his nuclear weapons arsenal. He's got oil. And now he's attacking food. He's trying to make it painful for the Ukrainians. Just another page out of his play book. We've seen this before. What we need to do is get more air defense artillery assets down there in Odessa and Mykolaiv. Right now the only Patriots are in the Kyiv area. Rightfully, they prioritize their capital. But we've got - we, the United States, has a lot of Patriots that are available and I'd also recommend that we send SeaRAM, the counter rocket artillery and mortar systems that were used with great effect in Iraq and Afghanistan because they not only can attack incoming missiles, but they can also attack the low flying drones that are such a problem and the Ukrainians have been struggling to try to defend.",

But, nevertheless, they're going to have a residual problem, an enduring problem, of cleaning up a battlefield because they know that there's going to be cluster munitions out there that could potentially harm the civilian population. Now, my understanding is that the Ukrainians are targeting unpopulated areas and they're using them. But I think that this is a bridging strategy just to get them until they can get more ammunition.
