Why the Democratic candidate for president is paying Republicans and anti-vaxxers who compared mandates to the Holocaust. And a story we've been following closely OUTFRONT.

      "sentences": "And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, no show. There was no sign today of the federal grand jury in the case involving Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And the reason is unclear. But it was significant because we do know that the jury is expected to meet every Tuesday and every Thursday. And we do know the activity in this particular investigation has been ramping up. And by all current accounts, is expected to end in a criminal indictment of the former president. Trump, in fact, has been bracing for any moment for an indictment since receiving the target letter from the special counsel. And that was nine days ago. The case would, of course, if an indictment comes, as it could at any time, adding to Trump's already packed court schedule, which is in the center of the 2024 Republican primary season. I just want to show you this calendar so you can see it for yourself. In yellow, those are the known dates for Republican primaries next year. And then in red, three of Trump's upcoming court dates -- January 15th, second E. Jean Carroll civil defamation trial. March 25th is the Manhattan hush money trial with the D.A. Alvin Bragg. And May 20th is the beginning of the Mar-a-Lago classified documents trial in Florida. And hold that up for a second, because those red, those are just start dates, right? Once you start, you have a certain number of days or weeks where a trial would go on. So, as you can see, it is going to be a situation where these cases are happening while primary voters are casting their ballots. It will dominate the GOP election cycle, and I haven't even added in the potential indictment that could be coming January 6th or in Georgia. And because of that overlapping the primary season, one of Trump's biggest allies on Capitol Hill, the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, is now trying to change the subject for the first time, directly threatening President Biden with impeachment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: And this is rising to the level of impeachment inquiry. This president has also used something we have not seen since Richard Nixon, used the weaponization of government to benefit his family. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, but that is a possibility, and could be an explanation as to why the grand jury didn't meet today. With regard to the timing, though, I do believe that, you know, Smith is determined to go. I think he's probably not included in the strategic discussions about when or how to announce this that Merrick Garland is guiding, only to the extent that he will be given the green light at some point to release the indictment, because I don't think he's making any political decisions.

Elon Musk today suggesting that the COVID vaccine caused Bronny's cardiac arrest, tweeting: we cannot ascribe everything to the vaccine, but by the same token, we cannot describe nothing. Myocarditis is a known side effect. The only question is whether it is rare or common. What we do know answers to some of those questions and I'm going to get to that in a moment.

Their statement reads, in part: LeBron and Savannah wish to publicly send their deepest thanks and appreciation to the USC medical and athletic staff for their incredible work and dedication to the safety of their athletes. Now, the James family was seen in public just about two weeks ago at the Espy Awards where LeBron James was accepting an award, standing on stage with his wife and children who he called his greatest blessing, particularly saying how proud he is of his two sons and their own basketball journey. Bronny James, 18 years old, just committed to USC this spring. The team had announced that they were going on a European tour starting August 5th. That's likely what they were practicing for. Bronny James ranked number 20 in ESPN's class of 2023. His father telling \"The Athletic\" last year that his goal was to stay in the NBA so he can play alongside his son.

If you look at the data, which we published last year on athletes and professional athletes, COVID causes myocarditis under 1 percent of the time. So, myocarditis occurred before COVID. Myocarditis will occur after COVID. But it is one of the causes but not a common cause.And the vaccine, based on data from Yale, causes myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle somewhere around 30 out of every 100,000 vaccines. And COVID the virus, the illness causes it twice as much, about 60 per 100,000. So it's still better to -- safer to have the vaccine than it is to have COVID itself. And all of that happens usually in the first 21 days based on what the data. If you had the vaccine six months ago, it shouldn't be involved.",
