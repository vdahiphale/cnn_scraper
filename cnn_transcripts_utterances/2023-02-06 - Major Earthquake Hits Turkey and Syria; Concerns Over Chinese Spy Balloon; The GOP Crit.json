      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States and all around the world, I'm Rosemary Church. We continue tracking breaking news out of the Middle East this hour where a major earthquake has killed hundreds of people in Syria and Turkey and the death toll is rising quickly. Syrian state media now report at least 237 people have died in Syria and more than 600 are injured, and an unknown number could be trapped under rubble.We just got this video of a rescuer carrying an injured child away from the rubble of damaged building. The White Helmets rescue group, also known as the Syrian Civil Defense, has declared the northwestern part of Syria a disaster area. Dozens of buildings have collapsed in both countries. At least 76 people are reported dead in Turkey and more than 400 are injured. Emergency workers are asking for silence so they can hear if people are trapped under the rubble. The governor of Istanbul says nearly 1,000 search and rescue volunteers are heading to the impacted region. And Turkey's disaster and emergency management agency is calling for international support. The U.S. Geological Survey says the epicenter of the 7.8 magnitude quake was in Turkey's Gaziantep province. Now, it's believed to be the strongest to hit Turkey since 1939. At least 18 aftershocks with a magnitude greater than four have been reported. And CNN's Scott McLean is following developments for us. He joins us now live from London. So, Scott, not only was this 7.8 magnitude earthquake in central Turkey, one of the strongest in 100 years to hit the country, but it also struck when most people were sleeping. And of course, in a part of the country where buildings are particularly vulnerable and that has many worried about what the total loss of life may be. So, what more are you learning about this?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think that the death tolls right now are the people that they have been able to count, and so you can only imagine just how high the death toll is expected to get especially when you compare it to previous disasters. The previous time that Turkey had a 7.8 was back in 1939. In that case, there were 30,000 people killed. There was also a very strong earthquake, a 7.4 back in 1999 where 17,000 people were killed. Half a million people were left homeless.And so that's probably a better comparison because it happened more recently. In this case, some of the videos that we are seeing are pretty remarkable, straight out of a war zone, but obviously this is not that. And what I think strikes a lot of people is that you'll have one building that is seemingly completely intact or mostly intact or at least on the surface undamaged, and then one right next to it will be very badly damaged if it hasn't collapsed entirely. And so, I want to show you one piece of video in particular from a city called Kahramanmaras. This is very near to the epicenter of the initial quake, and it just gives you a sense of the scene on the ground just before sunrise. Watch. (VIDEO PLAYING)",

One of the videos showed, you know, large pieces of equipment trying to move rubble out of the way, but remember this is a delicate operation, if in fact there is anyone trapped under the rubble. But frankly, in some of these videos that we're seeing, it is difficult to imagine, frankly, how anyone could have possibly survived something like that.In some cases, it looks like the building is just completely pancaked onto itself, you know, floor after floor. In other places, it looks like there may be space where perhaps someone could be trapped underneath, and we're also seeing some rescue efforts. Some people, you know, trying to pull people out, but putting themselves in an enormous amount of danger as well. So, the crawling into spaces where you have a slab of concrete on top of you trying to get to anyone who might be under there without disturbing the overall structural stability of this disaster site. And also keep in mind, that they are also feeling tremors and likely will for the coming hours, maybe even coming days, given an earthquake of this magnitude. 7.8 is tied for the strongest earthquake on record in Turkey. They've been keeping detailed records for about the last hundred years. And so, this part of Turkey especially lies at the intersection of a few fault lines and so they're used to some level of seismic activity, but nothing, nothing like this, Rosemary.",

So, people aren't going to want to sleep in a building. They're going to want to be outside. That's the first thing you hear people say. We felt the shaking and they ran outside.

More than 500 people have been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Turkey and in neighboring Syria. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake had a magnitude of 7.8. At least 18 aftershocks with a magnitude over four have been recorded since that initial quake. Turkey is calling for international assistance and has deployed more than 1,000 search and rescue workers.And we are learning critical new details about when U.S. officials became aware of the suspected Chinese spy balloon last week and when they alerted President Biden. Days before it was shot down off the South Carolina coast, it was spotted around Alaska when it began drifting toward the U.S. mainland. Officials say they realized it was a situation which required the president's attention. And he ultimately ordered the military to shoot it down once it was safe to do so. The Navy is now trying to recover the balloons remnants. A resident in South Carolina filmed uniformed men inspecting possible debris on a boat, but CNN cannot confirm that it came from the balloon. Well, China's defense ministry has accused the U.S. of overreacting by shooting the balloon down and says China, quote, \"reserves the right to use necessary means to deal with similar situations.\" So, let's get more now on China's reaction from our Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang. Good to see you, Steven. So, China says the U.S. over reacted to this balloon hovering over its territory by shooting it down. What else are Chinese officials saying about this, and what would China have done had this been an American balloon hovering over its territory?",

A source says House Republicans may vote on a resolution condemning President Biden for taking too long to bring it down. The resolution could pass as early as Tuesday, the same day Mr. Biden will deliver his state of the union address. Here is more reaction from lawmakers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX):  I want to start betting something that I don't do very often, which is commending Joe Biden for actually having the guts to shoot this down. That was the right thing to do. That is absolutely what the president should have done. Unfortunately, he didn't do that until a week after it entered U.S. airspace. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  They are saying we should have shot down the balloon the minute we saw it. I would use two words in answering these GOP criticisms. They are premature and they are political. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL):  Presidents have the ability to go before a camera, go before the nation, and basically explain these things early on. And his failure to do so, I don't understand that. I don't understand why he wouldn't do that. And that is the beginning of dereliction of duty, and the second is, you have to act swiftly on these things. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The fact that they are shipping, you know, chemicals to Mexico to make fentanyl that's killing 100,000 Americans a year. The situation in Taiwan.

So, I think there are several candidates out there that can do that and find that magic formula to broaden the electorate, and also make this about the policies that are really representative of this entire country. And I do believe that many are frustrated with the current president, and we're seeing in poll, the Washington Post/ABC poll shows that 40 percent of Americans say that their financial situation is worse than it was two years ago and they are not satisfied with the job that President Biden is doing, with just a 40 percent approval.

And ever since that, it is something that the Turkish public, the Turkish government has been gearing up for. The question has always been, when is the next big earthquake going to hit? And will we be more prepared?And I think we're seeing in the response to this one, that there is a plan, unlike the '99 earthquake which was a complete failure in terms of the government response. And this time, we're seeing mobilization of rescue teams, of ambulances, even here in Istanbul we can see that ambulances and emergency vehicles are making their way across the Bosphorus Bridge here into Asia to drive into these locations in the southeast of the country. Since 1999, Turkey has been trying to update its building code, it's gone through huge urban renewal projects that have aimed to sort of take the old stock of housing and renew it and put it up to earthquake code. It hasn't, of course, been a quick process. So, there's still a lot of very old buildings that are out there. As Eyad, your previous guest mentioned, it's something that has definitely taken place in some of the bigger cities. But not everything has been up to code now. And it's been an ongoing process, but for sure, in Turkey, the response of the government and, you know, government institutions to respond to an earthquake are a very integral part of the psyche that has traumatized the Turkish public since the '99 earthquake. I've been to the aftermath of -- year for '99 and I've been at earthquakes in Turkey after, you know, after earthquakes like that. And the response this time is wide. But of course, this is a huge area where the -- that we're talking about. More than 10 provinces have been impacted. And it's going to be a very difficult process.

The Syrian Defense Ministry has already started as mobilizing across the country, all provinces to put any equipment and resources that they can towards these affected areas.

That means many of the country's institutions, its infrastructure is absolutely destroyed and devastated, has not been rebuilt.You heard from Gul there, how Turkey has been working to bring its buildings up to code. Well in Syria, these are buildings that have been devastated by bombardment and shelling again for over a decade now. In the response across the country, it's not going to be even, Rosemary. You have to remember that Idlib province in particular in the north that is still rebel-held, rebel-controlled, you can expect there and you know we have video that it will be mostly volunteer forces trying to pull people out from under the rubble.
