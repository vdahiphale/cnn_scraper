      "sentences": "There are two conflicting orders on abortion that is causing a lot of confusion in the United States. First, there's one out of the state of Texas. A federal judge suspended the FDA approval of an abortion pill called mifepristone.Now a federal judge out of the state of Washington also issued an order but ordering that that drug stay on the shelves of at least 12 liberal states. Now because these are two conflicting orders by two federal judges in the United States, legal experts say that this is likely to land in the hands of the United States Supreme Court. Now let me get you up to speed about what we're talking about here. Mifepristone is an abortion drug. It was approved by the FDA back in 2000, so it's been on the shelves for decades. It is the most common way to terminate a pregnancy in the United States. It has been used by more than 5 million women, is considered safe and effective. And medical groups say that the risk of death is quote non existent. Now the plaintiffs were asking this judge in Texas to completely take this medication off the shelves. Who were the plaintiffs? The plaintiffs are a coalition of anti abortion groups. Who is the judge? The judge is a man by the name of Matthew Kacsmaryk. He was appointed by president Donald Trump and before rising to the federal bench, he worked for a religious right law firm on anti abortion advocacy. Now the hearing for this particular case was a preliminary injunction hearing that happened last month. It lasted for about four hours. And on Friday, Kacsmaryk issued this ruling, suspending the FDA approval of mifepristone. But this judge also paused the ruling for seven days, saying that this will give time for the United States Department of Justice to appeal the order -- Rosa Flores, CNN, Houston. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. JENNIFER CONTINENT, STANFORD UNIVERSITY:  The majority of abortions in clinics in the U.S. are medication abortion, which means that this affects so many people. And even beyond medication abortion, people forget that this medication is used for other aspects of reproductive health care. And it's used oftentimes, you know, for reasons like inducing a second trimester or later loss with a very wanted pregnancy. So the fallout is really a lot wider than people realize.

You have Passover, Ramadan and Easter all converging at once. And it comes after three days of escalating violence across the region. It all really began on Wednesday when Israeli police raided Al-Aqsa mosque, of course, one of the holiest sites in Islam, very inflammatory images of Israeli police beating people inside with batons, with the butt of their rifles, that were spread across the region. Condemnation poured in as well as rockets in response, coming from Gaza, of course, Hamas controlled Gaza, and from southern Lebanon. The barrage coming from southern Lebanon was the largest seen since the war in 2006. Israeli authorities blamed Hamas from operating from inside southern Lebanon and prime minister Netanyahu vowed to retaliate. We saw these tit-for-tat responses, the Israeli military think that it did strike sites in both of those locations in southern Lebanon and in Gaza. It seemed to be a very measured response, very measured actions on both sides. But that all really spiraled yesterday with these two separate terror attacks, the first in the morning in the occupied West Bank. A shooting attack described as a terror incident by Israeli authorities that left two sisters, a 16 year old and a 20 year old, they were dual nationals, British Israeli nationals, those two sisters killed in that attack and their mother seriously wounded. And then into the evening in Tel Aviv, this very shocking, chilling attack that you mentioned on the -- on the promenade in Tel Aviv, the beachfront, very busy, popular area. Again it's Passover so you can expect families, friends gathered there that evening. That's when Israeli police say this terror attack took place, the perpetrator right driving, ramming their car into pedestrians. All of the victims were tourists. One of the victims killed an Italian national; one person killed and some of those wounded still remain in hospital and recovering. As you mentioned this morning, things are calm. But all of those factors, Paula, that have led to this latest escalation of violence from the rhetoric coming from Hamas and Hezbollah to the Israeli military being on high alert, to the religious holidays ongoing, all of those factors are in place.

Certainly that's been the call of his newspaper. They've issued a statement over the course of the past few hours, saying they categorically rejects as false the espionage charges against their reporter and they're calling them unjustified and again calling for his immediate release. In fact, that's incredibly unlikely to happen. Gershkovich has been remanded in the Lefortovo prison in Moscow until May the 29th while the authorities build their case. It could be extended even longer than that, if the authorities decide they want more time. And of course, when this trial eventually starts -- and that could be months away -- and reaches its conclusion, there's a 99 percent chance if statistics are anything to go by in Russia, there will be a conviction, which means that Evan Gershkovich will be facing a possible sentence of 20 years in prison.

Officials say Russian forces are still trying to take full control of Bakhmut. The Ukrainian general staff says their forces are still fending off Russian assaults. But British military intelligence says Russians have regained some momentum in Bakhmut and they've likely reached the city's center. Meantime, more than 30 Ukrainian children are back home after their alleged illegal deportation by Russia. They crossed the border on Friday after spending months in Russia and occupied Crimea, according to humanitarian group Save Ukraine. It says some of the children were released after their mothers went to Russia to track them down. Those women also had the power of attorney to bring back the rest of the children. Ukraine says more than 16,000 children have been illegally deported by Russia, which led to an international arrest warrant against president Vladimir Putin. Russia denies any wrongdoing. We'll now take you to a region considered one of Ukraine's success stories in this war. Russian troops were pushed out of the northeastern Kharkiv region last fall, which marked a major victory for Ukraine. Now Ukrainian troops there are playing defense and waiting for their next move. CNN's Ben Wedeman is there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Zhenya prepares his 50 caliber machine gun, he didn't fire this time but he needs to be always on alert. Russian forces are nearby. This position on the northern edge of the Kharkiv region hasn't seen much action of late but the men here have seen plenty elsewhere. In January, Zhenya was in a front line foxhole in Donbas. From early in the morning they would shell us with artillery and right afterwards their infantry would try to take our positions, he recalls, you could see them. Much of the area south of here saw vicious combat. Last September, Ukrainian forces routed the Russians for much of the Kharkiv region. Before retreating, they toppled this Soviet era communications tower, scorched Earth their tactic of choice. This position man by the 209th battalion of Ukrainian armies 113th brigade is holding steady, defense not offense is the order of the day. Oleksi was a nuclear physicist before picking up a gun.",

But we are also seeing how the conflict is having an impact felt in diplomacy as well and that can be just as worrisome.Take, for instance, the New START agreement between the U.S. and Russia. Now START stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and is the only agreement left regulating the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. Think of that. But last week, Washington told Moscow it will stop exchanging some data on its nuclear forces just as the Kremlin said it would do. Meanwhile, Belarus is potentially being pulled even more into Russia's orbit. Last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced he planned to deploy tactical nuclear weapons to his neighbor. Remember, he staged part of his February 2022 invasion into Ukraine from Belarus. So it is worth noting here that, so far, there is no indication such weapons are being deployed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

ROSE GOTTEMOELLER, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR ARMS CONTROL AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  Well, the United States does have an extended deterrence presence in NATO Europe. For many, many years, the NATO European countries have deployed some nuclear weapons that the United States maintains its control over. Interestingly enough, the USSR was very keen to have this arrangement laid down during the negotiation of the nonproliferation treaty in the 1960s precisely because it didn't want NATO nuclear countries to have their very own nuclear weapons. They didn't want to Germany in particular to acquire nuclear weapons.",

There is a central storage facility for Russian nuclear weapons at Belgorod within a few kilometers of the Ukrainian border.And NATO countries have long suspected that the Russians either have deployed or easily can deploy nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad, which is their little enclave there on the borders with Poland and Lithuania, really right in the center of NATO Europe. And so I think that, in some ways, this is not qualitatively new. There are already Russian tactical nuclear weapons close to the borders of NATO and close to the borders of Ukraine. But on the other hand, we do know that Putin has worked very closely with Lukashenko to turn Belarus into a launch pad for Russian military operations and this aggression against Ukraine. So there is a concern here that now we have yet another launch pad in this case for a nuclear threat against Ukraine and against NATO.",

The president has been very open and out there with a clear deterrence message, that any use of nuclear weapons by the Russian Federation will be a terrible result for Russia.And really very clear in his message about the willingness to deter and defend NATO allies. And I think that that is -- has been very important. NATO also, together with the United States, has continued to exercise and train nuclear forces and that, too, conveys a deterrence message. So I think the Biden administration has done a good job so far. But in this fraught period, when the Kremlin never ceases to rattle the nuclear saber, I think the United States has a special responsibility as one of the two biggest nuclear states -- of course, Russia being the other one -- to try to, in every way, avoid the potential for nuclear escalation and nuclear catastrophe. So for that reason, I'm urging that the United States should look for more ways to communicate with Russia, with the Kremlin at every level, starting at technical levels, starting at low levels and then doing our best as we can to reach that man in the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin.",
