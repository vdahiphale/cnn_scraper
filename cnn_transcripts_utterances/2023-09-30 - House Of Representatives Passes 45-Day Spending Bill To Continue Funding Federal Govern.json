I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We begin with this breaking news from Capitol Hill, where we're watching an 11th hour stopgap spending bill potentially come to reality. The House has yet to vote on it, but there are so many moving parts today, you're seeing the minority -- House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries there, who has been using his magic minute to speak to the chamber there, imploring that all of this was avoidable, there could have been some bipartisan effort to keep government spending well before this juncture, but here we all are. Let's get straight to CNN's Lauren Fox who is on Capitol Hill. Lauren, brand new reporting that you have about not just what's going on in the House, but apparently what's happening in the Senate, and how all of this is coming together. What's going on?",

Before the Senate would approve of this stopgap measure, of course, it's got to get through the House. And majority leader McCarthy needs 100 Democrats in order to get that over the line. And we're seeing the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, who really has been speaking largely to the fact that all of this was avoidable, they need more time in which to read through the 72 pages. At this juncture, does it appear as though House Democrats have received enough time to go through the 72 pages, if they would approve of it, and if it would be a viable measure that will make it over to the Senate?",

But we've asked McCarthy multiple times today, are you afraid of that, are you worried about that, are you weighing that? And he says, repeatedly, I feel like this is the adult thing to do, that this is the move I need to make. And obviously, that is what he is factoring in right now.

      "sentences": "Certainly, that would come as a surprise, Fredricka, because up until this point the Biden administration had placed its hopes and its blessing, essentially, in a bipartisan bill that had been brokered between the two leaders of each party in the Senate, with the hope that Speaker McCarthy would be forced to put that bill on the floor.The administration has been taking a hands-off approach and had its top officials and representatives on behalf of the president, Steve Ricchetti, a senior adviser to the president, Shuwanza Goff, who runs legislative affairs, and the White House's budget director essentially liaising between the president and Capitol Hill because these developments are so fast moving. But they are taking a hands-off approach because ultimately, it is up to what can pass both chambers. They have made their desires known for both Ukraine and disaster funding. They have also made their desire known to keep the government open. President Biden earlier this week challenged Speaker McCarthy to do that. He told a group of donors in San Francisco that he believes is choosing between his speakership and the interests of the American people, essentially a challenge to the speaker to find some sort of compromise that can pass both chambers. But in the meantime, the White House, in the words of one official, is hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. There is regular cadence of communication between the executive branch and all of the government agencies, who, if the government shuts down, will be stripped from staffs of tens of thousands of people in some cases, to just dozens of exempted or essential employees who would be required to continue working, and trying to figure out how some of those essential functions can continue. We expect that in the coming days the president would convene a cabinet meeting to talk about continuity of government, and we've learned that many of these agencies are planning for a shutdown that could, if it ends up happening, that could last weeks and not days. So certainly, they are preparing for both outcomes, hoping for the best, but planning for the worst, and keeping all options open because, as we've seen this play out before, it could come down to the 11th hour, Fred.",

So certainly, the White House has been talking about how important compromise is in situations like this.

There is certainly a sense of normalcy throughout most of the city now here underground and one of the entrances to the subway system that is really the lifeblood of the city. Things are also running smoothly again, finally, after what was an absolute nightmare of a day for millions of people here in America's largest city. That's because large portions of that transit system were essentially paralyzed by the record-breaking rainfall that we saw play out just yesterday.However, this morning we heard from New York Governor Kathy Hochul, along with transit authorities, who assured that that system is once again back up and running, at least what you would expect on the weekend. So that is certainly a step in the right direction. We also heard from Governor Hochul commending not just the response, the responders, but New Yorkers themselves, saying for the large part, those who could stay home actually did that. And probably one of the reasons why there were no injuries, and certainly no deaths compared to what we witnessed about two years ago with Ida, especially some of those people that became trapped in their basement apartments, that warning that was issued on Thursday afternoon and certainly on Friday afternoon, the governor said worked. So there is certainly that sense of not just pride and relief, but also some really important questions that are being asked about what can be done to at least limit the impact not if, but when we see another event of this magnitude. On Friday, we heard New York City officials point to climate change as something that was certainly a factor in terms of the frequency of these kinds of events, and something that was repeated again earlier this morning by Governor Hochul, saying that the infrastructure in the city needs to be further improved and more investments need to happen in order to keep up with that rate of changes that we've seen. A prime example here, Fred, as we get ready to send things back to you, she mentioned that the system is built to accommodate about 1.75 inches of rain an hour. But yesterday some pockets here in the city were experiencing three. So that certainly speaks to the kind of changes that need to happen. But for the most part, though, I can tell you the general feeling in New York is, yes, there's still that aspect of recovery, but there's a lot of normalcy happening again today.",

But Democrats for the last several hours have been delaying the process of bringing this bill to the floor, using every procedural tactic in their toolbox in an effort to try to read the bill, understand what was inside of it, and make sure that it was exactly as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had presented it. What they are voting on is a short-term, 45-day spending measure that would get them through November 17th. It includes disaster aid but does not include funding for Ukraine. And that is the big flashpoint between the House and the Senate, although just moments ago you had Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell say that Republicans would vote against a procedural step over in that chamber because they view, at this moment, the House bill as the only possible solution to avert a government shutdown. So the vote is ongoing. We are, obviously, watching very closely as to what Democrats are going to do. But some indications show that perhaps, yes, Democrats may get behind this measure.

He wanted, because he knew that hardliners in his conference were unhappy with additional Ukraine funding. He wanted to make sure that he sort of kept his distance.Meanwhile, McConnell walked Zelenskyy into the meeting. Obviously, McConnell negotiated a deal on the short-term C.R., the Senate package that included Ukraine aid. And in the past, these two men have just viewed this issue differently. And I think that that is still the case. But at this moment, I think McConnell made a calculus that there was one bill that could potentially pass before the government shut down, and that was likely the House bill, not the Senate bill. And the reason wasn't that there wasn't broad bipartisan support for the Senate bill, because there absolutely was. The issue with it was the fact that in the Senate one member can slow down the entire process. And Senator Rand Paul had been very clear that he was not going to allow the Senate to fast track anything that included Ukraine aid. So that is why the House and Senate were coming at this very differently, and that's why the Senate bill was potentially going to get pushed to getting a final vote on Monday, because Senator Rand Paul was threatening that, and is still threatening that if Ukraine funding was included.

So help us understand the process there, the leverage that perhaps Mitch McConnell has over the Republican caucus, but Chuck Schumer may not follow suit with that?",

We know they were talking with the White House as well. So we can never read into a situation when the vote is happening over here in the House what exactly Chuck Schumer is going to do.But obviously, there's a disappointment from a lot of Democratic members who felt like they made an agreement with Republicans that Ukraine aid was going to be worth the fight, and might feel like at this moment McConnell sort of backed off and gave up a lot of leverage that the Senate would have had to say, well, we passed our bill with Ukraine aid, you passed your bill without, let's have a conversation. So I think that that is where some of the disappointment that you talked about from Senator Mark Warner is coming from. They feel like they had made an agreement. Obviously, the circumstances changed very rapidly over here today. And as I noted earlier, there was going to be a delay in the Senate's ability to move forward with their bill, because Senator Rand Paul had vowed to slow-walk that process because of the Ukraine aid.

But ultimately the vote is not finished until you hear that gavel go down and there is an announcement of the winning side and whether it passed or not. So that is what we are waiting for right now. Typically, when you have a delay like this, it's just members getting to the floor, trying to basically move forward.

And that is where things are going to get very, very dicey for both McCarthy and Democrats. And you can bet, as many moderate Republicans and Democrats have been saying for months, the only solution is really for Democrats and Republicans to work together. But it took a lot to force that today to happen on the House floor, and you can expect that it's going to take even more to get Democrats and Republicans to that place again on the full-term spending bill.
