      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news. Israel ramping up the fighting in southern Gaza tonight as a near communications blackout hits the Gaza Strip. This on a day that CNN's producer Ibrahim Dahman learns his family in Gaza has been killed, his childhood -- his childhood home destroyed. And Donald Trump trying to connect with Black voters as he rails against the justice system, as Biden sees his support among that same group of voters taking a dive. John King OUTFRONT at the magic wall. And, vanished. A reporter who covers sensitive topics now missing in China tonight. Is she the latest person to disappear for crossing Xi Jinping? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, invading southern Gaza. Israeli troops are now making their way south after capturing large portions of northern Gaza. We have some video here which appears to show an Israeli tank on one of the few roads that actually runs from north to south in Gaza. A road used by those who have had to flee their homes. Now, these images are just about three miles north of Khan Younis, a city Israeli defense forces had told people living in Gaza city to go to, to go to for their safety, but now Israel is telling tens of thousands if not a lot more and it is unclear to how many people are still there to once again evacuate, saying parts of that area are now a, quote, battlefield. I want to warn you that this video is graphic. What you're looking at, though, is what the Red Crescent which is on the ground says is them trying to help the injured. They claim this was a strike on homes in southern Gaza. We did see a big crater actually near the Rafah Crossing overnight, as well. Those once again fleeing for their lives, it is a confusing, terrifying, complicated road to safety. The IDF is actually dropping leaflets like what you see on your screen. Now, you may notice, obviously, it's written in Arabic, but you see we're zooming in there, it's a QR code. That QR code is actually what directs people where to go. Now, I mean, it is a little bizarre to think about that for even just on the face of it, but there is another problem. Just on the actual reality, there is a near total Internet blackout in Gaza tonight which would make it completely impossible for anyone to scan the QR code and pull up the instructions on where to go. That should give you an idea how bad this communications blackout is at this very moment. We actually tried to tape an interview with the Red Cross spokesman in Gaza tonight, but we were unable to get a connection. There's no phone right now and definitely no QR links, but if anyone saw the QR code before the blackout, or after the blackout if it ends, this is what the IDF evacuation map looks like, that's what comes up. Certain neighborhoods are highlighted telling people where to go and then there are those arrows. I mean, this is confusing especially given that more than half of the Gaza strip home to more than 2 million people is now under evacuation orders. Reminder, 25 miles long, and six miles long at its widest. From the entire north now under evacuation order to the growing section of the south, the U.N. secretary-general saying there is nowhere safe to go in Gaza, which is a sad reality for so many, including our brave producer Ibrahim Dahman. You know him, he has sent us explosive daily dispatches from Gaza, as he was there in north Gaza and then trying to flee to get his family safely out of harm's way. He tells us that tonight, one Israeli strike yesterday hit his aunt's house where nine of his relatives were trapped. They were killed, all of them. Another strike destroyed his childhood home. We're going to have much more on Ibrahim's story in just a moment. And we've got Jeremy Diamond tonight OUTFRONT live along the Israel- Gaza border and Ben Wedeman in Jerusalem. I'm going to begin with you tonight, Jeremy. Israel is now expanding that ground offensive in southern Gaza tonight, of course, the place where so many millions have been told to go for safety.

These are images of the aftermath of that strike. Dahman's childhood home in Gaza city was destroyed in another strike. Now those of you who watched the program regularly will remember Ibrahim because almost every night since the war began, we were sharing his exclusive dispatches of his nearly month-long effort to escape from Gaza with his young family, including this harrowing moment when they were speeding through a Gaza road amidst massive explosions.

He's lost his childhood home. He doesn't know about his other home in Gaza. All his memories, he says, he told me are gone, and he just is sort of in a daze. I mean, really, what he's doing now is just focusing on work. In fact, he told one of my colleagues who advised him after hearing the news of the loss of so many members of his extended family that he should take the day off just to get away from work, but he responded that work helps burn the hours. Work distracts me from the fact that not only has he lost so much, but he still has parents inside Gaza, and that is really occupying his mind around the clock and it's very difficult for people to get out of Gaza and in fact, very difficult for people to get out from one part of Gaza to another and let alone get out of Gaza altogether. So he's struggling. He's struggling, but as I said, he's trying to distract himself by work, and I've known Ibrahim since he had a full head of hair. He was just a kid, and he's always been enthusiastic about the work and when he had got a full-time position with CNN, I've never seen a colleague so happy and proud. Everything that he did he put his entire soul into the work. And so when I heard and many of us heard what had happened to him, to his extended family, you know, we all reached out to him. I think he was overwhelmed with the amount of phone calls and messages that he received. I hope if he's watching us now, he understands that we all care about him. We hope his family that's still in Gaza is safe that they can survive this war and he can get back to work in his home.",

So, you just heard Ben talk about Ben Dahman, our producer, who had documented day by day his leaving northern Gaza getting to the south and getting to Egypt and his extended family killed in a strike yesterday. At least nine of them and you heard Ben talking about Ibrahim. Ibrahim said one other things about his relatives, Colonel, I wanted to share with you, he said, and I quote, they were extremely peaceful and simple people. They have no affiliation with any organization or group. What do you say to him and his family with this grievous loss in an Israeli airstrike this weekend? LT. COLONEL JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Yeah. I am -- I saw the footage, and I've actually followed his documentation of the ordeal that his family went through. I saw it on CNN, and as I was waiting for interviews a few weeks ago I saw that, and I feel for the man. I am sure that he's -- his family, I trust that what he says is true that they were not affiliated and it appears that they are the unfortunate and sad consequences of a war. I don't know the specifics of where the house was and what happened there. I don't know what impacted, but I can say that if they were not affiliated with any terror organization, then they were not a target and not the enemy. And at this stage, I cannot provide anything but words of sympathy to him and his family, and I hope that he's safe, and that other civilians are safe and other civilians forced out of their homes, 250,000 of them are safe, and that they'll be able to return to their homes at the end of this war.",

      "sentences": "Erin, as we go through this, let's just start with the numbers and the numbers don't lie.Take a look here. There's the president's approval rating among Black voters when he took office. Early 2021, 87 percent, nine in 10 Black voters approve. Following it out, this is just this summer, down to 57 percent. So, a 30-point drop from the beginning to beginning of the summer among Black voters. That's an approval rating. Now, let's translate it into some other numbers. You ask voters in the poll, right, who are you going to vote for in the election? Excuse me while I turn my back and stretch this out. In 2020 election, nearly nine in 10 Black voters said they voted for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. Three polls -- three polls last month, 73 percent in the CNN poll, Black voters said they'd vote for Biden, 69 percent NBC, 69 percent Fox. So, seven in 10 Black voters said they would vote for Biden now, down from nine in 2020. That is a problem. His support and not only approval rating is down, his support in the polls drops, and some other warning signs, you might, Erin, call these non-Biden warning signs in the 2022 midterms, just Democrats did better than they thought, but Black turnout was down. And just recently, the Republicans took the governor's office from a Democrat in Louisiana, Black turnout was down. The Mississippi governor's race, he Democrats hoped for an offset. They were hoping for a big, high Black turnout. It was essentially flat, even down a little bit. So, it's not just Biden's numbers. In elections, they see Black disenchantment you might call it.",

      "sentences": "What matters most is the key question. So, let's just look at seven, what we call presidential battleground states. In Georgia, the highest percentage, 29 percent, nearly three in ten voters in Georgia are Black. In North Carolina, a state Republicans keep winning but Democrats think is close, is 23 percent. Eleven percent in Pennsylvania, 12 percent in Michigan, 7 percent Nevada, 6 percent in Wisconsin, 2 percent in Arizona.So, in the key battleground states, the Black vote matters. In some states, decidedly so. Let's just go back and look at the map. Look at Wisconsin for example. Joe Biden won Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes. Imagine if Black turnout dropped in Milwaukee, or a small percentage of Black voters for third party voted for Trump. It doesn't take much, Erin, if your statewide margin is only 20 votes. Look at Pennsylvania, nearly what, 3.7, 3.8 million votes cast, Joe Biden won the state by only 81,660. Imagine if Black turnout drops in Philadelphia by even a small amount, or again, a little bit for the third party, a little bit for Trump. It would make the difference. I give you one more example. I could give you plenty, but just look at Georgia, right? Think about Atlanta and the Fulton County. Look at the margin there in 2020. That's predominantly Black voters for Joe Biden because he statewide, he won by fewer than 12,000 votes, again, just a tiny percentage, staying home, voting for Trump, voting for a third party could make the difference.",

Then there's something maybe Democrat driven, and is it a lack of progress on police reforms or something that maybe Black -- some Black voters had felt had been promised and not delivered? Or is it something altogether different, right? Republicans actually winning Black voters over, right?I mean, are you able to ascertain what the main driver is?",

The Biden -- the president as we know, Erin, has no significant Democratic primary challenge at least the moment. Yet, his campaign, the Democratic Party, super PACs affiliated with the Democrats and Biden are spending big on ad money already. Look at this big ad, $2.4 million here, $5 million here, $5.2 million in Atlanta and $4 million in Detroit. A lot of these ads targeting Black voters in inner cities. Now, if you look at the polls, you don't see any evidence yet that it's working, but the campaign Biden operatives say it takes time for the ads to sink in 37 the numbers right now are pretty bleak, because we'll see if the strategy works.",
