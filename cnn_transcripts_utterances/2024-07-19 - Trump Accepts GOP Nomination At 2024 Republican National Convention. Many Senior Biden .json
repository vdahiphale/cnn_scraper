My guest this hour Republican Congressman Byron Donalds actor Dennis Quaid, comedian Roy Wood Jr. and historian Douglas Brinkley. For more than 90 long minutes Donald Trump spoke on that stage as the Republican nominee delivering the piece that was billed as unifying and yes, there were some lines that certainly made that appeal. But he also did what Trump does. He went off script with some pretty familiar grievances. And it did though begin with a retelling of the assassination attempt that nearly ended his life.
