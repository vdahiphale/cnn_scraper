She got out there and knocked on doors and organized people.This is not about where you are in the political spectrum. There will be some districts where you can be - have to be a little more conservative and some districts you have to be a little more liberal. AOC replaced a guy who had been there for years and years and represented his district very well. The reason she replaced him was not because he was doing a bad job, it was because he wasn't out in the community. He'd been in Washinton to long and thought that's where the world revolved. The world revolves on - in the districts. It does not revolve in Washington. And once you get sucked into Washington, you start to believe your own BS.

And also, do you think running and putting yourself where people are is different in this age than it used to be? Obviously, AOC has a very small district, you can't really advertise on TV, but a lot of what she did was on the phone, and a lot of what Trump did, you know, Republicans took some criticism heading into Election Day saying, well, you don't have a traditional field campaign, you know, you're not knocking on doors the way we normally do.

We had to put a Logitech on top of the frame. And I didn't know what I was doing. I just did what they told me to do.But they were right, that's how you organize. And we did not do that. And Trump did. I will give Trump some credit. His field was very, very good. And I thought Harris' field was pretty good, too. The problem was, Trump was building on a generation of efforts that had already been previously made in all those states to move them to the right, with school board elections, with city council elections, with state legislative elections.

We read them during the Trump - the first Trump administration. The second Trump administration, I think they're going to be all a bit more critical. They report that the likely twist for chief of staff is Susie Wiles, who, very interestingly, I thought, Isaac, when Trump on Tuesday night told her to take the microphone, basically refused and gave it to Chris LaCivita instead, her fellow campaign manager. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yes, I mean that's the kind of role that she's had through this campaign as being in the background, helping run things, helping manage things. I think most people who looked at the Trump campaign, whether they were on - had a - a real inside view of it, or even those who were informed from the outside of it saw her as a really important part of the campaign functioning in the way that it did. But I - we can over index any staffer all the time, right? I think what is true here is that Donald Trump won because of the way that he is, because of the way that the country is and how he tapped into it. So the question now is going to be taking that and figuring out what this looks like, what a mandate looks like, what a governing approach looks like for Donald Trump, and whether he - and how he will respond to it. We've had - all through the campaign we've heard, well, if he comes back into power he's not going to have - he's not going to want any of the guardrails around him, he doesn't like, even less so than when he first came into the White House eight years ago. So, Susie Wiles has figured out so far how to navigate that role around Donald Trump. If she's in as chief of staff, then she will be having to figure out that role in a much different capacity and with a lot more intensity around every decision.",
