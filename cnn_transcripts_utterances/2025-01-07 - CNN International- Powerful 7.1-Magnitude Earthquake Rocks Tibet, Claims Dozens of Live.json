I'm Amara Walker. This is \"CNN Newsroom\". Just ahead, rescuers in Tibet are racing against time to find survivors of a deadly quake. We will bring you the very latest. Also, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's casket will make its final journey to Washington later today to lie in state at the Capitol. All the details are coming up. And a controversial figure in French politics has died. We'll look back at the life of -- legacy of Jean-Marie Le Pen. Search and rescue efforts are underway at this hour in Tibet, where a powerful earthquake has killed at least 95 people. The U.S. Geological Survey says a 7.1 quake struck just after 9:00 a.m. local time, and it was followed by dozens of aftershocks. Authorities say the shaking could be felt as far away as Nepal and Northern India. Social media video from China shows streets filled with rubble as a result. Marc Stewart is joining us now from Beijing with the very latest. What do we know about this quake? I mean, I understand it struck in a remote area. I'd imagine that's hindering rescue efforts.",

Even if you are in very good shape, it's very difficult to breathe. And that is one of many reasons why this rescue is so difficult. We have rescue crews who are having to go through boulders, through broken buildings, and put the altitude on top of it, it is a very daunting task.A lot of resources are being sent by the Chinese Air Force. In fact, we've just learned that a very large military transport plane has been sent, just some of the hardware that's being dispatched to the area, but an indication of just how difficult of a task, this is. In fact, you see video of these crews arriving on the scene, going into action. Weather is also a challenge as it's now night time, the temperature has dropped significantly. No snow on the ground, but very cold temperatures overnight, adding to the difficulties in all of this. Another sticking point in all of this is going to be infrastructure. Many of these roads, as you've seen, have boulders on them. There's a lot of debris, in addition to buildings that in many parts look like as if they have collapsed. So it's difficult for people to leave the earthquake zone and adds challenge for crews trying to go in to see what is left behind. You mentioned all of the aftershocks. This is a fact that we just learned that really struck me, 150 aftershocks reported at six o'clock local time and that is just an indication of what these crews are facing, a very long list of challenges. And quite frankly, a lot of these images are just heartbreaking. Earlier, we saw a man on a stretcher and you could just see the despair on that person's face. Tibet is a very significant part of the world here. It is -- it's seen as a very sacred place, of course, with its origins in Buddhism. We have heard now from the Dalai Lama, in fact, he says that he's saddened by what has happened, he is offering prayers for people who have lost their lives and is offering hopes for a swift recovery for those who are injured. Also hearing from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who earlier today really made it clear that this rescue effort is a national priority, an all-out effort to rescue people from the hurricane -- from the earthquake zone, I should say. Amara, it is just past nine o'clock in the evening, it is dark and there's certainly a lot of concern what the hours will bring and what will be discovered when the sun starts to rise in the morning, Amara.",

So the earthquake was certainly felt well away from the epicenter and we do anticipate the aftershocks to continue, especially with this powerful of an earthquake.In fact, when we look at similar strength earthquakes, magnitude 7.0 or greater, we typically experience at least one magnitude 6.0 or greater aftershock with several dozen 5.0 or less. Now, where the earthquake occurred on the Tibetan Plateau, it is a high-elevation location. So here's the Himalayan Mountains, here's Nepal, India to the south, China to the north. That's the epicenter right there. So just by its true nature of its location, it is a cold part of the world, but it's been particularly cold lately. Now, in terms of the weather going forward, we don't have any significant weather systems in play for the search and recovery efforts until the weekend. So, we look towards Saturday and Sunday when you start to see some of this impactful weather starting to impact the Himalayas and the surrounding areas that could pick up the winds and complicate that search and rescue effort going forward. So, that's again for the weekend. In the meantime, generally dry conditions anticipated in and around the epicenter. Here's the closest reporting station. The next three days, you can see temperatures will drop well below the freezing mark overnight, so that also complicates the search and recovery efforts. But you can see by the afternoon, temperatures warm into the single digits to around 10 degrees by Friday afternoon. Back to you.",

Trump complained on his social media platform and in a radio interview that the Biden team are making their transition as difficult as possible.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Amara, I think two things can be true at once. The transition -- the transferring of power from a previous administration to the next has a lot of logistical attachments to it. There is a lot of procedures and processes, a lot of briefing between the incoming staff and the outgoing staff. And so, I think when Susie Wiles is talking about a smooth transition, I think that is probably what she is referring to, the more logistical aspects of a transition.Trump's frustrations are more with how the Biden is posturing himself in these final moments as president. We have seen him take a number of steps to burnish his legacy on areas like the oil drilling off the coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific, an area where Donald Trump has been very vigorously promising to open up oil exploration. There has also been suggestion that Biden might protect more federal lands and prevent mineral extraction from those parts of the country. He has also given blanket pardons and commutations to certain non-violent offenders with Trump coming in on a message of being tough on crime. So, there is potentially a disconnect in what Wiles is saying and what Trump is saying, partially because they are experiencing the transition from very different vantage points. And we are seeing Trump becoming more and more frustrated after a pretty cordial start with Biden. We had -- they had that meeting in the Oval Office. They shook hands. They were complimentary of each other. But now with Joe Biden taking more and more steps and more liberties with the presidency in his final days, Trump is now lashing out and creating some hostilities for these final two weeks before he officially takes office.",

People had been expelled from the party. The party was about closing borders and ultra-nationalism, but none of the nasty racism and anti-Semitism that her father had so explicitly often represented.There are those here in France that argue that the party is very much as it was, that a number of its candidates continue to make statements reminiscent of the darker days of the National Front. But what is remarkable is its position when you consider, Amara, this is a party that won the European elections back in June that has prompted all of the political turmoil that we've seen since with our fourth prime minister over the course of 2024, now trying to cobble together a budget that he can get through, all this was born of Emmanuel Macron dissolving the French Parliament in the wake of that shock victory in the European elections by the National -- by Marine Le Pen's rebranded National Rally. It is an important reminder of just how important this party now is in French politics, and the expectation is, as we look ahead to 2027 and the next presidential race, that it is likely to be one of the main parties hoping to win the presidency. So much of Emmanuel Macron's presidency so far has been devoted to how he and his allies can prevent the far-right, rebranded, but still created as it was all those years ago by Jean-Marie Le Pen, from winning the next French election. So I think it's an important reminder of just how important the party has become. Another important part of this, and this is something very specific to France, is the sort of soap opera quality that this family has had and it has played out in the imaginations of the French public for decades. It was to embarrass her rising star of a young politician husband, the Jean-Marie Le Pen's first wife pose for Playboy. And that was just the start of the family drama. So much of it made public, not least the dismissal of her own father by Marine Le Pen, still a formidable French -- force in French politics, whose views however controversial, however outrageous, have come to represent something much more powerful electorally than they had when he founded the Party, Amara.",

And it makes sense, mineral rights, military rights, and maybe that's the end game that Trump has in mind, getting the opportunity through payment to have a greater military presence there, mineral rights, that makes some sense and it's easy to see how that could develop in that direction.

Donie O'Sullivan has that story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  If Trump pardons your dad, what's your biggest fear? JACKSON REFFITT, SON OF JANUARY 6TH CONVICT:  You know, just getting shot in the street. I don't know. O'SULLIVAN:  By your father? J. REFFITT:  By my father, by someone he knows. There's a bunch of people that I don't know and I don't know their intent. So -- you want to help me lift this? O'SULLIVAN:  Sure. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  This is Jackson Reffitt. O'SULLIVAN:  Do you want me to take this end here? Or how do we do this? J. REFFITT:  Yes, please. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  He says he's moving out of his rental home and into hiding for his own safety. J. REFFITT:  Bought a gun because I got so paranoid and moving out because I'm scared. O'SULLIVAN:  Do you know how to fire a gun? J. REFFITT:  Yeah, I've been shooting it. O'SULLIVAN:  Do you have it on you right now? J. REFFITT:  Yeah, I have to wear it around the house kind of often just to get used to how it feels. O'SULLIVAN:  OK. J. REFFITT:  But I'm part of that, like -- O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Jackson's dad is Guy Reffitt, who was a member of the Texas Three Percenter militia. GUY REFFITT, JACKSON REFFITT'S FATHER:  And I just kept going, go forward, go forward. I couldn't even see, bro. O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  He's serving a more than seven-year sentence for his role in the January 6th Capitol attack. Reffitt was convicted of five felonies, including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. O'SULLIVAN:  So you reported your dad to the FBI? J. REFFITT:  Yes. O'SULLIVAN:  That's what got him arrested, basically? J. REFFITT:  More or less, yeah. O'SULLIVAN:  What effect has that had on your family? J. REFFITT:  It's destroyed it. O'SULLIVAN:  Was there a moment where you thought I know my dad has done all this stuff, but I don't want to report him? J. REFFITT:  Yeah, I still feel horrible. Of course. Like, I -- I can't get over it, but I don't regret it. O'SULLIVAN:  When was the last time you spoke to your dad? J. REFFITT:  Five months ago, it was the first time I talked to him and it was just a crying fest for the first 10 minutes, and that was great. And then, I brought up the fact that I'm worried about him getting out and he was almost puzzled, like he was confused as to why I thought that. O'SULLIVAN:  Are you overreacting? J. REFFITT:  No, I get death threats daily, hourly at this point. NICOLE REFFITT, JACKSON REFFITT'S MOTHER:  Unbeknownst to us, it was our 18-year-old son who turned his dad in to the FBI.",
