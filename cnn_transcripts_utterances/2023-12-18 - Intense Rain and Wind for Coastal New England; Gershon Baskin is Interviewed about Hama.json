What you're looking at now is a live camera, this is EarthCam, over the Hudson River into a very socked in New York City skyline. And notice the winds picking up. So, that combination of heavy rain and wind is causing our customers - a number of people without power -- to jump exponentially here within the past few hours. We've been watching that numbers go up and up and up.Now, we're particularly concerned about an area really along this I-95 corridor, stretching as far south as the Delmarva Peninsula, through New Jersey and into Long Island, including New York City, for the potential of 2 to 3 inches per hour. It is associated with this band of rainfall you can see moving through central New Jersey, kind of fluctuating east and west. That is a training line of thunderstorms -- showers and thunderstorms, I should say, heavy rainfall, that's falling on top of an already saturated environment. So, the potential there to add an additional couple of inches of rain will lead to flooding. All in all, nearly 60 million Americans impacted by flood alerts now. A lot of wind associated with this. Poppy mentioned tropical storm force gusts. Certainly, a possibility along the coast. Look at these impressive rainfall totals. Nearly a foot in South Carolina. Phil.",

People really like him. And I think it's also really interesting because depending on what Tim Scott does, he said in November when he dropped out that he wasn't interested in endorsing in a Republican primary. I am told that he might be interested in endorsing come new year. Depending on who he endorses, that could really set him up. If he endorses Donald Trump, he will jump to the top tier of options for the vice presidential ticket.
