Trump's pick for defense secretary now facing a very rough road to confirmation with more senators balking over serious allegations of misconduct. Tonight, our KFILE with new reporting on Hegseth's criticism of Trump himself. Plus, protests growing tonight after the president of South Korea declares martial law. The United States completely caught off guard, about how many troops we have on there. And all eyes now are on how North Korea will respond. And bitcoin madness. One market analyst predicting it could hit $225,000 from $100. Is this actually the real deal or the craziest bubble ever? I'm going to ask a top Fed official. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good -- good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, in jeopardy. That's Trump's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. And tonight he is in trouble. Senator Lindsey Graham, a top ally of President-elect Trump, tonight calling the allegations of sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse by Hegseth, quote, disturbing. Several other Republican senators telling our Manu Raju that Hegseth has a tough road to win confirmation. Now, this has Trump's team scrambling to try to shore up support. We are just learning that Hegseth will be back on Capitol Hill tomorrow to meet with Republicans sitting down for a Fox interview as well. It all comes as Trump's transition team announces it has signed a major agreement with the Justice Department, a deal that paves the way for Hegseth background check. Today, Hegseth was trying to convince lawmakers that he can do the job after a report in \"The New Yorker\" went through details of a whistleblower report and it laid out allegations that Hegseth was pushed out as the head of two veterans advocacy organizations, two of them for, quote, financial mismanagement, sexist behavior and being repeatedly intoxicated on the job. And after \"The New York Times\" obtained this extremely troubling email from Hegseth's mother back in 2018, in which she wrote, quote, you are an abuser of women. Hegseth's mother told \"The Times\" that she apologized for what she wrote. Only four Republicans need to side with all the Democrats in opposing Hegseth's nomination to tank his chances. That is why it is in jeopardy tonight. And amidst all of this, our KFILE is uncovering more questionable comments from Hegseth when it comes to the military, including his support for using the United States military against American protesters and for waterboarding -- waterboarding, which is now forbidden under both American and international law. He also called Trump, quote, all bluster very little substance. Now, we have full coverage of this breaking news that is developing by the minute as these things do, especially when you start to see one domino. The question is, will you see more? Manu Raju is OUTFRONT on Capitol Hill. Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach, and the KFILE's Andrew Kaczynski is here with me in New York. I want to begin with you, Manu, OUTFRONT on Capitol Hill, of course, as I said, sometimes when you get one domino, its just whether it pushes over and then all of a sudden, something in jeopardy becomes dead. What are you learning from Republican senators tonight?",

But if you talk to a number of people in private, and they don't have that same level of defiance when it comes to Hegseth getting confirmed.One thing to keep in mind here is what exactly happened when Matt Gaetz withdrew his name. That came from Donald Trump. Donald Trump was making personal calls to senators. He was listening to what senators were saying. And in the end, Gaetz just had a math problem that they didn't believe they were going to get over. And I was told by a source close to Donald Trump that he was warned consistently, Trump, that he was going to essentially expend all of his political capital on getting Gaetz confirmed. We are now in a similar situation. Yesterday on the Hill, Hegseth met with roughly a dozen various lawmakers they came out of it. Nobody had a real bad word to say. Many of them saying they didn't even bring up the allegations. Today, a very different story. And Trump transition team is watching all of this very closely, wondering if Hegseth has the math. Now, the other part of this that has been unfolding behind the scenes is this concern from Hegseth allies in particular in Trump world about these drinking allegations, particularly given the fact that Donald Trump himself has spoken out against how he doesn't like people who get too drunk. He has a complicated relationship with alcohol. He doesn't drink. But his brother was an alcoholic, and he doesn't like it when people around him or people in public get too drunk. These kind of allegations are something that bother the people close to Donald Trump, who know this about Trump. So the two parts that they're watching here are one. Trump's reaction to this, and two, Trump's reaction to the senators' reactions to meeting with Hegseth.",
