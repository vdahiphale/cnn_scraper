      "sentences": "It's 8I'm Paula Newton, in today for Jim Sciutto. Thank you for joining me on CNN NEWSROOM. Let's get straight to the news. President Zelenskyy has fired his air force chief just days after a U.S. made F-16 fighter jet crashed, killing one of its top pilots. Now it's unclear if the two incidents are related, but Zelenskyy said the command level of the air force needed strengthening, his words. The F-16s, which the Ukrainians have long asked for, only arrived at the start of the month. All this comes as the Ukrainian defense minister, meantime, is in Washington pleading their case to allow the United States to lift restrictions on its weapons. Rustem Umerov met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier today as Ukraine gains more territory inside Russia. Now, over the past day, Ukrainian forces say they have advanced up to two kilometers. That's in the Kursk region. CNN's Oren Liebermann joins me now from the Pentagon. I mean, I'm interested to learn from you about the curiosity that American officials will have right now about this F-16 crash. As I said, you have certainly been following this story very closely -- closely, up to and including the fact that, you know, this does involve training -- U.S. training on these pilots. And beyond that, you know, where this goes from here, given all the Western military aid, Ukraine is still asking for.",

      "sentences": "Well, U.S. official so far have been very careful with what they say about the F-16 crash. They have not attributed a cause of the crash or said, who or what is responsible. At the same time, U.S. experts are ready to help should they be needed, but they're not expected to have access to the crash site itself and do this investigation you would expect or you would see if a U.S. F-16 crashed. They'll simply help the Ukrainians because although this is U.S. manufactured, it is, of course, a Ukrainian F-16 one, they got from a European country, not directly from the U.S.At the same time, U.S. officials were well aware of what it takes to operate and maintain these jets. These are complex jets. U.S. F-16s don't operate 100 percent of the time. They have their own readiness rates. They are rotated out of frontline and flying an operations regularly for maintenance. So that will be something certainly Ukrainians are looking to examine what is their own readiness levels for their jets, given the fact that the pilots effectively, had a truncated timeline for their training. On top of that, Ukraine's military is effectively the most complex in the world because of all these different systems from all these different countries that they have to make work together. And that includes aircraft, command and control, control nodes, air defenses, all of these have to talk to each other on her right way as they're being bombarded with these Russian aerial assaults with dozens, if not, if not, hundreds of drones and missiles. So all of that creates an incredibly complex environment in which you have to operate these F-16s. Ukrainians need to sort through all of that as part of this investigation with whatever help the U.S. can provide from the outside. So, we will be very closely watching this. It will also be interesting to see how Ukraine approaches what is effectively their prized possession right now, having only had them operating for several weeks at this point, Paula.",

If you can give them a longer range air, air interceptor, missile, so they can hit these Russian planes when they're bringing the glide bombs over. That's another thing. But to do that, you've got I get closer to the front frontlines and you've got to have the ability to shut down the Russian air defense systems and the EW that might interfere with the F-16. So this is a matter of working it incrementally, understanding the threat environment the envelope of your flight, understanding what you're weapon systems can do and then exquisite timing and execution.

But on the other hand, the longer this goes on, the greater the risk, actually. It's not as the risk is getting lower, the risk is getting higher as Putin gets more frustrated and as other complexities come in like the possibility of an Iranian nuclear weapon.So there's a lot happening right now. What I would look for is in the plan, I'd look to see is it realistic? What does it take? And so they don't have the combat power to really take back what they need right now to force Putin out or force him to the negotiating table. But what's it going to take, a realistic plan that shows what the requirements are, the United States got to buy off on those requirements and fulfill those requirements. And here's the thing, Paula, there's no quick fix on this. This incursion into Kursk, it's great. And he used eight to ten combat brigades, that's most of their reserve force and you can see its taken a very small slice of an -- it's not yet able to obtain a strategic military objective. It's politically strategic, everybody's talking about it. Putin's embarrassed. He's going to have to do something. But they haven't been able to get to Crimea, cut the logistics lines to Crimea, go back to Kursk and take out the factories and the nuclear power plant there to seize bargaining leverage. And so, it's clear that it takes more than aides to do this.",

He described this as a monumental undertaking, something they've never done before, never in a combat zone had to do this. They're going to have used their medical centers, use their smaller medical clinics? They're going to have roving teams who literally be setting up out in the desert in the middle of tents. They're going to have about 3,000 workers out there because it's a really, really limited space of time they have available.This is broken down into three different areas, the center, the south, the north, each of those areas gets three days for these pauses and each of the pauses on each of those days, it's about seven or eight hours long. So kind of multiply all that out. You said there 640,000 children under the age of ten need to get the vaccine, multiply that out, the number of hours you've got there. That's -- that means basically you need to get through roughly 10,000 children an hour. Now he feels confident that they're ready to do it, but there are so many unknowns. And one of them is the fact that number 640,000 and they need to -- they need to vaccinate 90 percent of them. So you can check off the numbers as you go through them, but they're not really clear, it's a good estimate, he says, but they're not clear how many of those children sadly may be trapped under rubble. They don't have a precise numbers. So, there's all these difficulties in and putting this plan together, but they plan to sort of learn from each day and make changes and a review their calculations each day but there's one other thing here that that is a major hurdle and it's a hurdle that's so far down the road for weeks away that he can't -- he couldn't even answer me. I said, do you have any guarantees yet that you'll be able to implement the second phase of this because the second phase is a second dose. And he said, if you don't give that, then that means the whole of this 12th day period of vaccination coming up, you just lose it. It has no effect at all. So they have to get another pause in four weeks time and is no idea yet, hopes, of course, but no guarantees of that will actually happen, Paula.",

And while Trump is there, the campaign is trying to clarify his stance on reproductive rights after Trump weighed in on Florida's six-week abortion ban and in vitro fertilization. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think the six-week is too short. It has to be more time, and so, that's -- and I've told them that I want more weeks.

That is what the campaign is trying to make that point after Trump himself spoke about this and was specifically clear about what sort of timeline he was talking about in terms of what would he support?That's why there's so much ambiguity there. But the broader issue here is this, what the campaign is trying to, as they're trying to appeal at this point to as many people as possible, including those people who turned away from the GOP and turned away from the former president with the feeling that this is a party that is not receptive to those who respect reproductive rights. And so that's why you see the former president now trying to find that sweet spot if you will in terms -- in terms of what to do with this -- with this initiative in Florida. And not surprising now, he's come up with this new plan in terms of IVF treatment, which is a new initiative that is putting forth. He is saying that if you were to be reelected, his administration would see to it that any couples seeking IVF treatment, they would have that covered by the government. And if the government doesn't cover it -- cover it, then it would be the responsibility of insurance industries to cover the full cost. Again, some questions still outstanding there in terms of where is this money going to come from? How is that going to be paid for? So a lot of still outstanding questions here surrounding the top of reproductive rights, again, all in an effort to reach out to some of those voters who have left the fold. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He talked about the border control bill, which the Republicans voted down, and said she would sign it. And I think the same questions would be fair for the former president, who also, if you listen doesn't really give specifics. He gives promises. And often they're inconsistent, such as on reproductive rights, and often, they include things that aren't true. So I think it's -- there's a danger, too, for the Republicans to go too deep on this.

What instead, what's happened is China has played our openness against us, and that's why there's a growing awareness among Democrats and Republicans alike, and not just in the United States. You mentioned these other countries now that China is abusing the international trade system and forcing the rest of the world for our own good to build the kind of walls that nobody wants. Because when we have tariffs, that is certainly attacks on us in the United States. And so, as I said before, the rest of the world is going to need to come together to balance China. And I hope we can do that effectively.",
