(END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER (on-camera): Good evening. Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper. Starting tonight, we are bringing you the best of CNN storytelling from our reporters and anchors all over the world. It's one whole story one whole hour every Sunday at 8:00 p.m. Tonight we take you on a dangerous and difficult journey through the Darien Gap, the only land route connecting South America to Central America. It's a 66-mile stretch of jungle between Colombia and Panama. So migrants hoping to get to the U.S. have to get through the Darien Gap first. That means trekking through rivers and mud and up steep mountainsides. Along the way they face exhaustion, disease, drowning, and the very real risk of being robbed, assaulted or even killed. So far this year five times as many people have made this journey compared to the same period last year, and a record number of them are children. To see what they face, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and his team recently walked the entire route. Some of the things he saw along the way are graphic and hard to watch, but we want you to see the reality of what's happening on \"The Trek: A migrant Trail to America.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over): Sometimes a dream sells you a nightmare first. And beauty is deepest in a place you may never get out of. And the need to keep moving is the only thing left to carry. A quarter of a million humans last year walked for four deadly days through this, the Darien Gap. An untold number do not make it. A much, much bigger number do. And with every moment of success, resilience and even cost them suffering evermore come. The world may be on the move because of climate, conflict and corruption. But here is where the most of them are on foot. These are the stories of people from just five days. An endless trail in the jungle of pain, hope, loss and grit. Through the world's biggest hole in the fence. They gather under a glowering dusk as if to say goodbye to their old lives in the hope the dawn ahead is new of a promise and an opportunity they have never known before. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through text translation): Don't be afraid of the terror in the night. Nor of the arrows that fly by day. Nor of the pestilence that walks in the dark. We won't be afraid of bugs. We won't be afraid of serpents, snakes, scorpions.",

A revelry of hope, of conviction that they will be the ones to make it over danger, disease, dehydration, deportation, about this number every day every year almost doubling.The Darien Gap is the only land corridor from South America, where entry is easier to its north, where it's not. There were no roads, only 66 miles of treacherous jungle from Colombia to Panama, and onwards north. 3,000 miles to the U.S. border. We walked the entire route of the Darien Gap over five days in February to document the suffering endured by people milked for cash by cartels, unwanted by any country. (On-camera): What's startling is the sheer number of children on this trek as it begins on a route sometimes adult don't even survive. (Voice-over): We heard Jean-Pierre's son, Louvens, coughing all last night. But still they set out whatever is ahead, Haiti, its heat, hunger and hellish chaos, is at least at their backs. There are the older two, 58-year-old Maria, a teacher from Venezuela, who's monthly salary of $16 can't feed anyone. So she and her daughter, Yendry (PH), are headed to Houston, hopefully to relatives. (On-camera): We've only been going a matter of hours and it just seems an endless series of river crossing. Some distance of just constant water. I'm pretty exhausted. (Voice-over): Manuel and Tamara like many here trying to keep the kids going with treats. And then there are those whose jungle it is, the wildlife. One bite from this snake and you may never leave. The walk is organized as that makes more money. In fact, the cartel gave us permission to be here as if to parade that. These discarded color-coded armbands show which day and route people have paid for.
