The generational change piece is huge and she has wonderful zingers around that. I think the key with Nikki Haley is that she is the only person who has been able to navigate Donald Trump on her own terms. She left his cabinet at her own time and choosing, without having him say, don't let the door hit you on the way out. And so, if there's anyone in the Republican field who I think can navigate his peculiar -- frankly bullying, which by the way, she tipped her hat to without naming him.

Today, a woman and two children, 8 and 10 years old were pulled alive out of the rubble of their apartment buildings. Rescuers say that the victims were trapped for 228 hours. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is on the ground in Turkey. He joins me now. Sanjay, you've been such incredible work there, can you just explained how their surviving. I thought humans can only go a few days without water. How are people staying in the rubble 8, 9, 10 days without no food or water?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  It is really, truly, remarkable, Alisyn. I mean, if you look at these types of situations, the vast majority of rescues, people being rescued, 90 percent happen within the first 24 hours. And then, after that, typically the maxim time to rescue a seven days. So, what we're seeing here is pretty extraordinary. Now, there can be all sorts of different reasons for that. You know, part of it could just be the condition. It is very cold, which is sort of a double-edged sword, Alisyn. On one hand, it makes it very hard just the circumstances around trying to rescue people. But it may also cut down on people's water needs. You typically think 100 hours. That's sort of a ballpark figure, 100 hours is what someone might be able to go to without water. As you point out, people been going longer. Do they have sources of water? There are certain parts that had rain or is there water available in some way? We don't know, but I can tell you this though. I spent time in the military today. They are still very much in search and rescue mode. At some point, there's some transition to more recovery mode. You don't get that sense it all, Alisyn. I mean, people are working around the clock. People are rising up. And they tend to be up when they hear about another rescue, which is still happening.",
