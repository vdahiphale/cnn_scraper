A source is telling CNN Harris will interview top candidates, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly in the coming hours. Harris is also expected to speak with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Sources familiar with the selection process say there's been a renewed focus on him. The Harris campaign is having to move at lightning speed. And CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere breaks it down for us.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Let's remember, first of all, that two weeks ago, right now, Joe Biden was still in the race. Kamala Harris was the running mate. This is a process. And that itself is having a determinative effect on what's going on. There's a piece up on our site right now that I -- where I write that leaps of faith are not Kamala Harris' style, but she is going to have to make one, at least to a certain extent in this decision. She's looking at who can help her win. She's thinking about a governing partner. She's thinking about what kind of rapport she'll have with the person. But all of that needs to be done along with all the vetting, about all the past business transactions, all the personal affairs, anything that they've ever done in their lives, all in a period of just a couple of days here, right? And in maybe one or two meetings that Harris herself will have with the final picks. And importantly, she does not know any of the picks that well, and the one that she does know that has spent the most time with, Pete Buttigieg, that relationship has been a little troubled over the years, but it's gotten a lot better lately. So, she's having to do this all very quickly and figure out where she is. This is not something that ever is done over a two-week period. And even for the people who have been trying to put together the documents on the side of the potential running mates that takes a long time. Go get all your financial records for the last 10 years or 20 years or 30 years. See how quickly you can do it, right? And that's just one piece of it. So, it's a lot of the information that needs to be compiled quickly, gone through quickly, trying to not have anything that blows up on them. There's a feeling that if you look at J. D. Vance's rollout and some of the trouble that he's had on the Republican side, that is the kind of thing. It's sort of best-case scenario when not enough is done. But obviously, we've seen in the past sometimes when running major pick that there can be bigger things that aren't caught in the vetting process. That's why usually this is a fine-tooth comb that they go through, months of questions, of interviewing lots of people and anybody who has ever had any contact with the potential running mates. That is not what they have the option of doing here. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

She really will shine in the debate, and she did shine in the first debate, the first presidential debate in 2020 and didn't do quite as well afterwards, but I would imagine she'll be incredibly prepared, and it's less awkward for her preparing for a debate against President Trump versus trying to compete against other Democratic candidates in the primary.Trump's debate style, as we know, is basically to just speak a bunch of lies and bully and overpower people, which he did effectively when he had to debate Joe Biden, who had a horrible performance, of course. But he knows that he will not do well against Kamala Harris, and that's why he's backing out of the debate and trying to change things so that it would be on Fox News, which is obviously a more like a media propaganda machine for the Trump campaign.",

Also, for just all of the energy and excitement behind Kamala Harris' campaign. I mean, we were speaking about this weeks ago. Her approval rating wasn't particularly good. But now, he's sort of in a corner. And when he's in a corner, he tends to become completely unhinged and more angry than normal, and he starts even attacking those that might even support him going after secretaries -- the governor, Brian Kemp.I mean, this all comes across as very petty. And he even admitted it. I only really like people that like me. He also criticized the deal -- the hostage deal swap, and said Putin should be congratulated. And then, he went into his normal sort of misogynistic attacks with racist undertones against Kamala Harris, you know, talking about her name and that there's 19 different ways to pronounce her name. And that's really all his campaign has to offer. I mean, we know that he has. 46 percent support. This hasn't changed at all. He needs to gain people. He needs to be able to attract more voters, but he doesn't have a clear message. It's really all about himself. He's rambling on and on. And his talking points aren't uplifting, and you contrast that with Kamala Harris' talking points, she's been pretty effective talking about issues like health care, gun control, reproductive rights. This is juxtaposed with Trump's campaign, which is really moving the U.S. closer to dictatorship and is very dark and very personalistic.",

And of course, what we're also seeing in Gaza is a continuation of Israel's military onslaught. We saw deadly strikes yesterday targeting two schools near Central Gaza in Gaza City. And today, overnight, we have seen the distressing images, video coming out of -- around the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. This is a hospital, one of the last few remaining that is able to take patients. It is on a daily basis, hugely overrun. But outside the hospital on the compound, there are countless tents for the displaced. And we've been seeing distressing images of those tents engulfed in flames. At least five people so far said to have been killed, many more injured as well, but we are still getting more details on that.

No one died. But it was considered well judged.Now, Iran could do the same with much less warning. It could overwhelm Israel's air defenses. But if it did that, the chance of big Israeli retaliation would be severe. So, they could go after military targets. They could try to assassinate an Israeli leader, which would be reciprocal.

You talk about other countries urging restraint because, you know, among the fears is that this could drag the U.S. into a wider regional war and President Biden has been calling for de- escalation, but it seems over the course of the war, at least against Hamas, that Netanyahu hasn't really listened, that President Biden hasn't had as much influence over Netanyahu's actions as you might think.I want to quote from one of your recent articles, Israel appears to have gone rogue. Explain what you mean here. ERLANGER:  Well, what I mean is that, as you summarized, Netanyahu isn't really listening. He came to Washington to give a very defiant speech. He then went to pay obeisance to Donald Trump, who he clearly wants to win the election. He thinks Biden is now clearly lay a lame duck figure, and Bibi is pushing his domestic audience to say, look, we need to restore our military deterrence. Look how clever we are in these assassinations. We are going to keep pressing in Gaza. We're going to continue to suppress Hamas in the West Bank. And the problem is he's playing to a domestic government where he is dependent on these two far-right messianic religious, very clever ministers who he normally doesn't like, but who he's given incredibly powerful positions to. One, the finance minister and one, the police commissioner who have very, very strong influence over what happens in the police, the West Bank, and they represent a kind of revolting against conventional wisdom. So, Bibi is presenting himself much in a way as Trump is as the leader of the anti-elite revolt that does not see a Palestinian State as possible, that talks about annexing the West Bank, that wants to resettle Gaza, and that has no interest in what most of the world says because it believes the world is against Israel anyway.",

This is -- well, this is the best in sports. You have Katie Ledecky and you have Titmus raising Ledecky's arm in triumph after Ledecky won that -- her ninth gold, which now ties her with a Soviet gymnast as the most -- from back in the '60s is the most ever for a woman. So, that's extraordinary. And Titmus realizing the moment, even though she's just been defeated, raising Ledecky's arm in triumph, hugging her. And then, when Ledecky came out of the pool deck and was announced one last time as she got out of the -- pulled herself out of the pool, you've got Titmus with prolonged applause for Ledecky. As Katie said earlier in the week, when asked about the rivalry between Ledecky and Titmus, she said, it's not a rivalry, it's a friendship. And what a great statement as Ledecky went into the history books. And an hour or two earlier, you had Simone Biles winning the vaults, winning her seventh gold medal. She could -- has a chance for two more. She could tie Ledecky for the most golds ever for a woman in any Olympic sport from any country ever. This is what we're seeing here from these two 27-year-olds. It's quite remarkable. It's exhilarating. And as I said a moment ago, it is the very best of sports.",
