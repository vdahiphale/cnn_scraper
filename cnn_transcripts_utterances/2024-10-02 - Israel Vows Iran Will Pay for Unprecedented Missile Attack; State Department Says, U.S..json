Across the region, violence is escalating with fierce clashes between Israel and Hezbollah forces. The IDF says that it plans to send additional troops. Already eight Israeli soldiers, by the way, have been killed in combat.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing Iran, quote, will pay for yesterday's aerial assault, which Iran says was in response to the killing of Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah and other leaders. A big question now is, what role would the U.S. have in all of this? Here's what President Biden said a short time ago about whether he supports an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear sites. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The answer is no. And I think there's things -- we'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us agree that they have a right to respond, that they should respond in proportion.

And that is the big open question, the one you're talking about that precisely what Israel will choose to strike back at. The prime minister here has been very clear the response will come. It will be strong. It will look like a deterrence to Iran to dissuade them from attacking again. And but the scale and scope is very likely to determine the potential for escalation in the region.And a very deadly day as Israel has been pressing its ground offensive into Lebanon for the second day. Hezbollah is saying that they targeted Israeli troops in three different villages at the border. The IDF now saying that eight soldiers have been killed, a number of others injured. A hospital near the border in the north of Israel early this morning declared a major a major casualty event. And we understand troops from those clashes with Hezbollah were taken to a number of different hospitals across the north. But this is perhaps a very tough reminder for the IDF, for the prime minister of Israel's previous experiences in 2006, in 1982 until 2000, when it pulled troops out of Lebanon, about the cost of having ground troops go inside Israel. We would just talk -- to go inside Lebanon. We were talking yesterday at the border with a lady living at the border. She actually refused to evacuate. She makes food for all the soldiers, and she told us, and we were overlooking the area of one of the attacks before the attack happened, she told us yesterday she was really worried about the troops going across. She wants and believes that they can deter Hezbollah, but she said she knows it's going to be dangerous for them because Hezbollah has been expecting the troops to come across. So, this casualty toll, the prime minister offering his condolences to the families, but it is significant that it comes so soon in this ground operation.",

      "sentences": "Brianna, that's an incredibly noteworthy comment from the president, because what we heard yesterday from the national security adviser, from the State Department spokesperson here at the department, was effectively that the United States was giving Israel a very large degree of decision- making space in terms of how it responds to this attack from Iran. They weren't counting anything in, they weren't counting anything out. They said that they were going to be ongoing close discussions with the Israelis.But now today, it's very clear that even though the United States does expect, U.S. officials do expect that Israel is going to respond, they're not trying to prevent them from doing that, with the national security adviser saying yesterday that there will be severe consequences for Iran here. The United States doesn't feel that everything should be on the table in terms of what that response looks like because President Biden is saying very clearly, no, he does not support Israel going after Iran's nuclear facilities in response to what we saw occur yesterday. What he said was that he spoke with his counterparts from the G7 and they agreed that Israel has a right to respond. It should be a proportional response. That is noteworthy. So, what we'll watch for now are the ongoing discussions between the U S and Israel on this topic. President Biden said that he is expecting to speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu in the near term here. They have not notably spoken since the end of August. That's more than two months now. So, watch and see what comes out of that conversation. But the fact that the president is now saying that the United States doesn't support going after Iran's nuclear facilities is noteworthy, particularly given the rhetoric that we're seeing out of Israel right now. We're hearing from some former officials, former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who is saying that they should go for Iran's nuclear program. If they don't do it now, they may never do it. So, the United States does see a need, does support Israel responding, but they are, in these conversations, at least publicly and -- excuse me, at least privately, and now we know publicly with these comments from Biden, making it clear that they don't want this to get too far out of control where it turns into an all-out war.

General, thank you so much for being with us.You heard President Biden there saying that Israel should respond proportionally. What would that look like? MAJ. GEN. JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Boris, I think it's fair to say that Israel certainly will choose when and where they want to respond, and I would say they're in no rush. They can do this at a time of their choosing. So, we're all leaning forward, trying to anticipate. I think it's also fair to understand that Israel wants to ensure that Iran feels some increased pain. No one, and I would say either in Tel Aviv or in Tehran, that they want to escalate this thing much further. There seems to be this proportional tit for tat type of a response. Bear in mind, I think it's fair to say, bear in mind that Israel is an incredibly resilient nation. And what we saw yesterday with the attacks from Iran, there really is a sense of business as usual on the ground in Israel. Certainly, there was some tragic loss of life and some property. But this is what they've lived with for the longest, longest time. So, there's going to be a response on the part of Iran. And I also think that response, it will not be a decapitation of the Iranian leadership, although I must say, they probably know they're on a hit list. They're on notice. And I don't think it will be an attack against kind of the nuclear R&amp;D facilities. I think that's much beyond the scope of what Israel needs to do right now to ensure they don't want to achieve any symbolic response. They want to impose some additional pain on the Iranian regime, and they can do that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, really good point. I mean, there's always the temptation to put the Iranian development of a nuclear capability off the table, remove it from the table. All you're going to do is achieve some time in that regard.[13:10:0] Iran will still, I think, in some case, try to redevelop that. Now, the Iranian regime has not decided that they want to go forward with a full militarization, weaponization of nuclear capabilities. They're developing that, but there's been no evidence or a declaration from the leadership that that's an objective. So, in this particular case, I think you can put that to the side. Let's address what is the immediate challenge Israel feels from Iran, and that is kind of unlimited use of drones or ballistic missiles or rockets, in the case of rockets, we saw most of those yesterday, which are very, very difficult to go after. It can penetrate the Iron Dome and the arrow system. That needs to be addressed. And then that kind of establishes what I think is kind of a status quo moving forward. I don't think either side wants this thing to blow up to the point where we now have Russia more violently and more openly getting involved, or China more openly involved, or North Korea acting in a really spontaneous and disruptive way. The United States doesn't want to be dragged into this. Both of those nations understand that there can be some limits to this engagement, and I think they're both working on that, fair to say. But we also have to -- if I can one more thought, it's going to be a decoupling of what's taking place in Lebanon right now, relative to the response that Israel's going to impose against Iran. And so this is the discussion about deterrence. Iran wants to achieve deterrence. They haven't done it with this response. Israel will try to punish Iran some more. But, again, I think in terms of deterrence, Israel clearly has the upper hand and the capacity to ensure that, not so with Tehran.",

That's how it's just embedded in the society. They want to get it north of the Litani River.That's a wonderful objective. In fact, the United Nations Security Council resolution has indicated that it must be done. U.N. has never been able to enforce it. I mean, they can't. Lebanon hasn't enforce it. They've chosen not to. So, Israel said, we got it. We're going to push these borders north. There is going to be a cost associated with that. And Israel has been working desperately to try to and very aggressively to try to identify those targets that they want to go after as a result of their decision to invade Lebanon. They want to try to keep it limited, but bear in mind a limited incursion also involves Hezbollah. Hezbollah, I think, would love to get entangled into the Israeli fight, so Israel ends up getting, to some degree, bogged down, much like they were in Gaza. Israel doesn't want to do that. So, they've said, we're going to go after very specific targets. We have good intelligence on where those targets are. We want to attrit those, in some cases, not only to attrit. We want to destroy those and we want to push destroy as much Hezbollah fighting infrastructure and fighters as we can, destroy those, defeat as best we can and push them north of Litani, bearing in mind that the missiles that Hezbollah has will still be able -- you know, north of Litani, will still be able to reach much of Israel.",

You know, Brianna, as far as these events go, this was not a debate that showed a lot of fireworks. You know, there wasn't personal name calling, there wasn't, you know, personal insults that were traded back and forth. Mostly for 90-plus minutes, we saw the two vice presidential nominees sparring on important issues, like foreign policy, the economy, immigration, reproductive rights. And our polling of the debate seems to indicate that as far as the voters who were watching was concerned that there wasn't a clear winner. If you take a look, pretty evenly divided on the question of who actually won the debate. A couple other interesting notes, more people said that Walz seemed in touch with voters and more people also said that Walz shares their vision for America. And also interestingly, Brianna, a bigger percentage of Trump supporters than Harris supporters, that's 14 percent, said after the debate, they would reconsider their support for Donald Trump. As you know, last night could have been the very last debate before Election Day and both campaigns are very aware that they need to make every day between now and then some five weeks left count. And that is why, at least for the Walz campaign, they want him to really hit the ground the campaign trail again. Of course, he had been really at debate camp for a number of days now preparing for last night. And if you look in the coming days between Harris and Walz, they're going to be traveling to a number of places. This includes a bus tour for Governor Walz that will take him through Pennsylvania and New York. And I should note that the vice president is herself was initially supposed to join the governor on this bus tour, but her schedule got changed. She is going to be traveling to Georgia to assess the hurricane damage. This is a good reminder, of course, that for the vice president, it is very important for her to be out on the campaign trail but it's also important for her to be balancing her day job, and in recent days, that has included monitoring the situation in the aftermath of the hurricane, and also getting briefed on the situation in the Middle East, which is something we saw her having to do yesterday.
