And Ecuadorians are absolutely traumatized by what took place yesterday seeing this not only on live TV but also having attacks at universities, attacks in hospitals, in prisons against police. They've never seen a wave of violence quite like this before. It's all being fueled by these powerful drug gangs, gangs that are trafficking cocaine through Ecuador to other places in the U.S. and Europe. Ecuador's president has sent troops out in the streets that has stabilized the situation for the time being. But this was all kicked off when one of the highest-profile criminals in the country, a gang member known as Fito, escaped from prison. And they don't know when or how it took place. The president of Ecuador saying this morning that they believe officials inside the prison helped him to escape. And they will face charges. But this is part of the larger problem there. The corruption of the gangs is so malignant and so widespread that literally you don't know who to trust in Ecuador and that the gangs have become so powerful that it's not even clear yet whether the government can put a stop to them.",

Two former secretary-generals, both Ban Ki Moon and Kofi Annan, publicly addressed the issue of anti- Israel bias in the United Nations.

We have CNN's Zachary Cohen following this story for us. Zach, tell us what is happening here and how this could potentially impact the case in Georgia. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, in the short-term, obviously, it's already creating an optics problem. Right? Fani Willis has been under fire from political attacks. She's faced violent threats the entire time we are seeing this case. But right now, we are seeing Republicans and Donald Trump himself jump on these new allegations, really trying to use them to undermine the credibility of the entire case. And as you mentioned, the defendant in this case, Mike Roman, one of Trump's former campaign aides, is trying to get the whole case against him thrown out. It remains to be seen if that will be the consequence here. But in the short-term it's raising legitimate questions about why Fani Willis was not open about this, why she wasn't honest about it publicly. According to the records we have seen that this has been a relationship, allegedly, that has been going on for a while now and she has been under a lot of scrutiny the entire time. And now this is coming out at a sensitive moment in the investigation where, presumably heading towards a trial here, and the credibility of an ultimate conviction potentially and the prosecution itself does hang in the balance as far as her credibility.",

This is the result of retiring very old coal-fired coal plants, which is really low-hanging fruit. Last year, the United States, exported more oil and gas than any country ever. So now comes the hard part, dialing back on liquefied natural gas and not tapping into oil reserves that we know that are out there. That's what the scientists are calling for.
