I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's all aboard and full steam ahead as the Democratic National Convention kicks off in Chicago tonight. It's where Lincoln accepted the presidential nomination in 1860, and a slew of Republicans and Democrats have done so ever since. It's also a city of political protest, and this convention promises more of that. Across the world, allies and antagonists will be watching carefully to get a measure of Kamala Harris' policies and grip on the election. Not so long ago, Democrats worried that their convention would be a rather downcast affair. But the party and the race have been completely transformed since President Biden decided to drop out a month ago and hand the baton to his vice president. The Democrats have been steadily clawing back lost ground, according to the latest polls and are hoping to keep the good feeling going long after this week. With superstar party stalwarts like the Obamas, the Clintons, and Nancy Pelosi all speaking after President Joe Biden headlines opening night. A night he, of course, had hoped to be basking in the adulation and the nomination of a grateful party faithful. Few could have foreseen the twists and turns that led here, but my first guest got very close. Democratic Congressman Dean Phillips, was a one-man early warning system citing President Biden's age and ability to run and win a second time. He even decided to challenge Biden by running against him in the primaries earlier this year, and he's joining me now from Chicago. Congressman Phillips, welcome to the program. REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN):  It's great to be with you, Christiane. And let me tell you, the Windy City is living up to its name today.",

I saw with myeyes, I heard with my ears, I read the numbers in front of my face, and it was so clear to me what we were facing, sleepwalking into another disaster. But, of course, in politics, both here and in the United States and around the world, there are rarely professional rewards for courage. In fact, courage is often punished. And I'm feeling joyful. I was hopeful. I was excited about the possibility if we could just make that change that we could feel like we do right now and I have no resentment, only gratitude and a great deal of excitement for what has transpired because it is never too late.",

      "sentences": "Well, Christiane, I had seen his decline begin in mid-2021 when he appeared in front of us at our Democratic caucus meetings. When hedecided to run for re-election, it was a surprise to many of us, a disappointment to many, not because we don't love Joe Biden. I and my colleagues do. He's a remarkable man, did a fantastic job in his tenure as president, saved this country in many ways, shape, and form. But in American politics and democracy we do not coronate kings and queens. It is not supposed to be about personalities. It's supposed to be about pragmatism and winning. And it was clear that was not going to happen. So, like I said earlier, I saw what was going on. Most of my colleagues who are running for re-election cannot take the personal risk to say that quiet part out loud. And I called other sitting governors who I thought would be exceptional candidates. I made public calls beginning back in 2022, for others to join the Democratic primary. But my party did not want to host a competitive primary. And that's why at the very end, just a couple weeks before the New Hampshire filing deadline in October of '23, I decided someone had to do it and I did it myself. And while it is almost impossible to stand up a presidential campaign in a mere two weeks, once again, nothing is impossible when you're on a mission of principle. And I was trying to call attention to the truth. I'd hoped that the president would have debated me back then. I think we would have discovered the challenge nine months ago instead of right now. But like I said earlier, Christiane, it worked. That mission was the beginning. Others started to recognize the truth. And slowly but surely, I think it gave permission to others to join me. And here we are today with an entirely new world and great optimism and excitement that you could not even feel an ounce of as recently as just a few weeks ago.",

I wanted to see a competitive primary. I still believe that competition ultimately generates better outcomes. I will always speak that truth. And I think it's important for both parties to pursue. But in this case, she is absolutely the right candidate. The way that she mobilized and consolidated support amongst almost every Democrat in the country within a matter of literally a few days, I think is a remarkable demonstration of her leadership. What we have seen now, the movement in the polls, Christiane, is, I think, it does not even have a historical precedent. So, yes, she's the right candidate. And Tim Walz, my governor in Minnesota, who I believe will be the third Minnesotan of the last six Democratic vice presidents is a remarkably wonderful choice who is going to open the door to conversation with Americans who've been left behind by the Democratic Party over the last number of years. So, the answer is absolutely yes, but with the caveat that competition is important, period, and we should always pursue it.",

What does Kamala Harris have to do on the economy? And do you think it's the number one issue? And I ask you this because The Washington Post editorial has said, following her economic speech on Friday, that we need real policies, not gimmicks.

And as I said, in tandem with Tim Walz, I think a remarkable ticket. And I also -- I think it's important that we honor President Biden. He didn't just save the United States, he restored the relationships with the rest of the western world, including in Europe and in Asia that had really been struggling after the tenure of our Former President Trump. He should be celebrated for that. He has given his entire professional career to this country, and I'm excited that tonight we'll be honoring a man of great integrity and compassion, a man who called me the day I ended my campaign with some very kind words and even ended up calling my two daughters to do the same thing. This is an extraordinary, compassionate man handing the baton to a woman of equal competency and potential. And it's awfully exciting, not to mention the next generation of Americans is rising.

Very different to the cult of personality, as people have described, the current Republican Party leadership and their presidential campaign. I mean, we've talked to people who wouldn't dare tell Trump, don't run. Although, some of his former certainly national security officials say that they're going to put the case as to why he's not up to the task.

Now, that said, there is a major difference between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. If you look at how my Republican colleagues were treated, who had the audacity to call out the truth about Donald Trump, I think eight of the 10 of those who voted to impeach him after January 6th lost their jobs. Now, I went through some tough times and was somewhat excommunicated from the party for a period of time. But the way that I've been greeted with high fives and hugs and handshakes and gratitude, even some apologies, really demonstrates how different these parties are. We make space and place for dissent. Leader Hakeem Jeffries, my dear friend and colleague, a former -- I sat at his leadership table in the House Democratic Caucus, was an extraordinary gentleman during all of this time when I was making some enemies within the party during my run. But here I am, being thoughtfully celebrated and welcomed back into the fold because Democrats do allow dissent discussion, debate, and deliberation. But to your point, yes, we have to -- both parties and this country have to return to some of the key tenants of democracy. And also, as I said earlier about -- I want to say something about Joe Biden. You know, I was trying to be Paul Revere, the man who warned of the pending attack here in the United States during the Revolutionary War. George Washington, of course, the first president, the only American president not affiliated with a party and the only one in the world history who actually gave up his power proactively, very much in the same spirit that Joe Biden did. So, that's the bookend, from Paul Revere to George Washington, something to celebrate. But democracy does not happen on its own and we have to invest. Americans have to participate. One in 10 voting in primary elections is not sustainable for a thriving democracy. That's true all around the world. So, my call to action, Christiane, to everybody watching, no matter where you live, is be a participant. That's why I got involved in politics. My career will end here at the end of this term, after six years. It was beautiful, it was joyful, it was meaningful and inspirational. And I hope I can just use a little bit of that joy to spread to others around the world to be participants and know that anything is possible.",

I knew when I made this decision, it would likely mean the end of that career. I do believe I could have -- if I ran, I would have won again. But I also have to say that one of my other principles is term limits and ensuring that we constantly have new ideas and new people running for office in America. I served three terms. They were extraordinary, beautiful days and painful days. But I think it's really important that we always allow space and place for those of great potential and aspiration and competency to run for office. And I serve with way too many people who've been there for decades and decades. And I think modeling the very behavior that we want, I'm a bridge builder. I believe in decency and respect. And I also believe in limiting one's term in public office. And that's exactly what I'm doing. I never say never. There may be another intersection in the future in which my skills and availability matches the country's needs. But right now, I'm here to celebrate something that I gave a good part of my last year and a half in my life, a lot of sweat and tears to, and that is to change this ticket and here we are, and it is a beautiful celebratory day.",

I know the vice president to be a woman of both greatstrength, great principle, and also great compassion. And if you're a human being, it is impossible to watch both the attack on October 7th in Israel and the aftermath of the horrific loss of life in Gaza. Two things can be true at once, Christiane. We can empathize with both. I believe Israel has a right to exist. I believe Benjamin Netanyahu has not led Israel in the manner with the principles and values that I surely would like to see. And I think most Americans and many around the world would like. But we also have to acknowledge that Israel is constantly under threat. And we can do two things at once. Ensure the safety and security of Israel and invest in the safety, security, and self-determination of Palestinians. I believe both are important. I think you'll see a President Harris and Vice President Walz do just that. And I would argue also, Christiane, it's time for an international marshal plan of sorts, to, for the first time, really invest in a Palestinian State with the support of the Gulf States, the rest of the free world, hopefully, even in collaboration with China. Because what is going on there now is not just a risk to Israel and to Palestinians, but to the entire world. And I think we'll see a President Harris with a wonderful heart and an equally outstanding head as we approach what may be the last great opportunity to bring peace, prosperity, and security to a region that needs it. And I'll just wrap up, of course, with the Iranian regime. Iran is an extraordinary country. The Iranian people, extraordinary themselves. But this regime is accountable for horrific loss of life over the last number of generations. Currently responsible for so many of the terror attacks in the Middle East and around the world. And I think it's time for the free world, at least, to unify behind a change, if you will, and ensure that both those in the Middle East and around the world have opportunity to live in peace and security. That's what we'll see from this administration. We will not see that from Donald Trump. And I think that's fair. I think he -- we should be listening to his words and watching his deeds.

When you look at the practice of female genital mutilation, it happens in Africa, it happens in Asia, and it happens in parts of the Middle East.

Everyone's already asked all the good questions. But she really made a point to think about how she could attack some questions that hadn't been asked yet. She prepared very lengthy preparation session.

When it came to legislating, you know, she was only in the Senate for four years, and she was in the minority the whole time. So, that's usually not a good atmosphere for producing big bipartisan deals or things of that nature, but even for that set of circumstances, she didn't seem as interested in legislating, aides say, and fellow senators say.

And she was able to kind of pick her spots when it came to being the voice of responding to Roe v.

And Joe Biden sort of never engaged in that game because he was sort of, you know, I'm the vice president, I am who I am. And he also began to seem sort of like the safe choice. I think there was a lot of anxiety about the idea of picking another woman after 2016, much less a black woman because Hillary had lost and some people felt maybe that was because she was too much of a gamble just on the gender portion alone.

And so, I think there's a lot of different factors that just make this moment right for her. One piece of it is just the relief among a lot of Democrats that it's not Joe Biden, and the surprise of that and her seeming so fresh in comparison, given concerns about his age, and that's really boosting her right now. At the same time, you're starting to hear people say, you know, I want to know more about your policies. What do you believe in? Can you show us, you know, exactly what you would do? And that is something that did trip up her earlier presidential run when she had to flesh out policies and it became this race, you know, among Democrats for whose policies could be more liberal.

Her maiden speech in the Senate was defending undocumented immigrants, and that's something that now, I think, with polls showing that a lot of Americans are very concerned about illegal immigration, that she's not really emphasizing as much. And there's other issues like that as well, where she's -- she has reversed her position, like, on wanting to ban fracking, for example, and that does open up the risk of being labeled a flip flopper or inauthentic and in some way, which Republicans are making that argument. You know, if you ask her people around her, they say that her time as vice president has shifted her opinions because she's been dealing with real world issues and she's kind of learning as she goes and changing her mind, which, you know, people do. So, it's -- it just -- I think the whole world around her policy issues and where does she stand how liberal does she want to be, that's been something that's been in the air for her for years now, and I think that's going to be one of the main things she has to tackle before the election.",

And then, I think there's also the risk of people on the far-left, you know, being angry that she's not with them, right? So, that's always the tightrope any candidate has to walk. Do voters really get worked up about policy? How much are they thinking about fracking, for example, versus does this person seem like they have a steady head on their shoulders? Do they seem like someone who is nice that I trust? A lot of times decisions do come down to candidate kind of qualities versus policy papers. So, I think the -- to me, the most potentially potent attack Republicans could have on Harris is if the policy switching becomes a character issue. Is it inauthentic?
