A gunman allegedly tried to enter a Jewish school there, but when he could not get in, he opened fire outside the building. The suspect later shot by police.CNN's Ryan Young has been following this for us. Ryan, goodness. A close call. So how exactly was the shooter averted? RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. The details to this are quite scary, Jim, as you understand. So many kids going back to school in the near future all across this country. So this really puts this in the forefront. Apparently, the gunman showed up to the school and tried to gain entry. And because of safety protocols that they have at that school they were able to stop him from getting on the inside. During that time, though, the surveillance cameras at that school were able to take pictures of the man, and they were able to put the pictures to police so they could get an accurate description of the suspect. At some point, he got so frustrated about the idea that he couldn't get in, he started shooting. Listen to the 911 released tape that we got just today about this 911 call when the shooter showed up. (BEGIN AUDIO FEED) 911 OPERATOR: An armed party 390 South Y Station, the Hebrew Academy. He originally called advising there's a male in a lime green shirt on the property armed with a gun. Now advised the suspect left the scene.",

The officer opened fire. Now he's in critical condition. Jim, we should say they believe he's a former student, who's also Jewish, who arrived at that school yesterday with that gun with whoever knows what intent. But this just highlights the reason why schools have to have these protocols to be able to avert situations like this. This was a close call, obviously, yesterday, but all the security protocols worked. And now we have to start waiting for the TBI, the FBI to dig into this person's background to figure out exactly what the motivation was.",

The 68-year-old man turned himself in to police yesterday. But authorities now say they don't think he intentionally hit them. They say he told investigators that he simply panicked and left the scene. Also the western U.S. is seeing a surge of wildfires. At least 64 have scorched more than 300,000 acres across nine states. A dozen new large fires were reported this weekend. Five in Arizona alone. The threat for more remains moderate across much of the west. And a key report released today on the labor market. The number of available jobs has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years. The Fed will be keeping a close eye, of course, on these numbers. It sees the strong labor market as one cause of rising inflation. Jim?",

And this loss has been going on for years.According to researchers at UCLA, rising temperatures have sucked up more than 10 trillion gallons of water from the Colorado River basin from 2000 to 2021. And this is critical because that river supplies drinking and irrigation water to seven western states with some 40 million people. CNN's Lucy Kafanov joins us from Denver. Lucy, this is interesting because folks have taken some comfort seeing the big snowfall, for instance, in the past season to help address the many issues we're seeing from rising global temperatures. But here you see a lot of that's just disappearing. That's a problem.",

It was not pretty, however. The two-time defending champions barely got past Portugal. CNN's Coy Wire is with us now. OK, is it panic time? Do they need to get their stuff together? They need to get their heads on straight? What's going on, Coy? COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes, yes, and yes. And, Brianna, good to see you. I first saw Team USA play in person at the 2015 World Cup in Vancouver. And this current team seems to be struggling to find that same chemistry and passion we've seen from them. They needed to tie or win in order to advance against Portugal here. They were this close, Brianna, to being sent back home to the U.S. Check this out. Hardly any time left, in the 91st minute of the match and Portugal lets loose a rocket that barely catches the post here and ricochets away from the net. Team USA, they had six shots on goal. They were unable to score though, Brianna. This is just the sixth time ever the U.S. didn't score in a World Cup match. And you can see, it so nearly cost them everything. But the nil-nil draw was good enough to advance to the knockout round. Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and the two-time defending champs are celebrating the narrow win by dancing afterwards. Others were taking selfies and smiling with fans. And that didn't set well with two-time World Cup champ U.S. soccer legend, Carli Lloyd, who blasted the team after the match. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARLI LLOYD, TWO-TIME WORLD CUP SOCCER CHAMP: Today was just simply uninspiring, disappointing. They don't look fit. They're playing as individuals. It's OK to be confident but you never want to cross the line of being arrogant. And this is exactly what can come and bite you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Those were his words.But take a look at Lloyd's former teammate, Kelley O'Hara. She's also a member of the last two World Cup championship squads. And she's laying into the team after the match. This team is young. Remember, 14 of the 23 players on this squad are playing in their first World Cup ever. They were the favorite to win it all coming in, looking to become the first nation to three-peat as World Cup champs. Maybe this was the exact wake-up call this team needed. Next up will be a familiar foe, most likely a match against Sweden, 5:00 a.m. Sunday. They were in the same group in the last five World Cups and Sweden beat them in the last two Olympics. So, yes, they better get their heads on straight, they better bring it this next match coming up.",
