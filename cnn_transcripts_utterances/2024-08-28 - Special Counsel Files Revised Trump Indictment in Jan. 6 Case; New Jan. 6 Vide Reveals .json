      "sentences": "Good morning, you are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this morning with a defiant special counsel and a furious former president. In a reworked January 6th indictment, federal prosecutors are making clear they are not backing down despite last month's Supreme Court ruling giving former presidents immunity from prosecution for official actions. We will dig into the differences between this indictment and the original in moments, but the main points of the allegations remain, that Donald Trump attempted to defraud the government by obstructing the certification of the 2020 election and tried to strip voters of their rights. All four of the felony charges remain. And in true Trump fashion, he took to Truth Social, his social media network to rant, calling the indictment an act of desperation and ridiculous and calling for the case to be immediately dismissed. Joining me now, Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Carrie Cordero and CNN Political Analyst Laura Barron-Lopez. Katelyn, walk us through this because I mean it is slimmed down. There are some differences here and we should point them out. What do we know?",

But in this version there's evidence that's removed so that it would not have to be presented to the jury, because the Justice Department has to follow what the Supreme Court said in protecting the presidency and giving some immunity.So, the things that are cut out of these allegations, it's about 13 fewer pages, no more do we hear about Donald Trump talking to people in the Oval Office, hearing from intelligence officials and other officials that there wasn't fraud in the election that would allow him to win. That's not going to be able to be part of the case. And then the entirety of his conversations with Jeffrey Clark, who previously was a co-conspirator, no longer is here. He was a top Justice Department official. All of that idea of trying to pressure the Justice Department, that's not there, but everything where Trump was a candidate and acting in the Justice Department's view as a personal entity and directing private lawyers around him to bring together fake electors to pressure for the vote, and even to pressure Mike Pence as president of the Senate.

And I continue to think, and I thought this from the beginning of the case, that one of the challenges in telling the story is that the special counsel chose not to indict the other individuals at the same time. A conspiracy has to be more than one person. He's got these unindicted co-conspirators.

[10:05:10] ACOSTA:  It's a little confusing. BARRON-LOPEZ:  Yes. But it's also what he has been saying even before the 2020 election, which was the whole thing was rigged. And he's now laying the foundation again to say that the 2024 election is rigged. I mean, yesterday he was on Dr. Phil saying that he would win California, that he could totally win California.

On the 60-day rule, so that's the Justice Department policy that says that investigators are not supposed to take investigative action that would impact the election, we're coming up close on that.
