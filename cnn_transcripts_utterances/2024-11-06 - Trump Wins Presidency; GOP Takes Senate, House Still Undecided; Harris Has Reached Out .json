Remarkably, Trump made significant gains in nearly every demographic group across the country. And now is on track to win the popular vote as well, something he failed to do in his previous two presidential runs.Also, at stake right now. The balance of power in Washington, Republicans have flipped the U.S. Senate. We're learning they're growing more and more confident. They'll also keep control of the House of Representatives. More on that in a moment. But first, we have a key race alert for you right now. Let's take a look at the key race alert, starting in Michigan with its 15 electoral votes. 98 percent of the estimated vote is now in, Trump has a lead of nearly 100,000 votes, 49.8 percent to 48.2 percent for Kamala Harris. In Arizona and its 11 electoral votes, 63 percent of the vote is in, Trump has a lead of 51.9 percent to 47.2 percent, a lead of more -- slightly more than 100,000 votes over Kamala Harris in Arizona, another key battleground state. Nevada and its six electoral votes, 88 percent of the estimated vote is in, Trump is ahead in Nevada, 51.5 percent to 46.8 percent, a lead of nearly 60,000 votes for Trump over Harris in Nevada. Right now, just hours from now, the Vice President Kamala Harris will be speaking after conceding to Donald Trump. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is over at the Harris campaign headquarters in Washington, D.C. Kristen Holmes is over at the Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach, Florida. Let's start with Vice President Kamala Harris. We're told she has reached out to Trump to concede but has not connected yet with him. Priscilla, what else do we know?",

We have reached out to several senior advisers, to campaign staff, to see why exactly Harris has been unable to reach the former president. We have not heard back yet.But when it comes to the former president, look his team clearly celebrating, they've been celebrating since last night. They were projecting a cautious optimism. And then, of course, we saw what happened last night when Donald Trump won the presidency, or I guess, early this morning. One thing that they're contending with this morning is that the knives are already out. It's not just talking about at the campaign level, but in Donald Trump's whole orbit. I have been talking to a number of sources who are already starting, starting not jockeying for a position on the Trump administration. They are talking about various jobs, like secretary of state, like chief of staff. They are trying to get their names floated. They are trying to prove to Trump's inner circle, and that's likely the people who have been closest to him during this campaign, just how loyal they have been to this cycle. And one thing to keep in mind, we talked about this in January. Donald Trump was keeping very close tabs on when exactly Republicans backed him. Did they back him after he won Iowa or before? Were they joining his team with closest to 2022 when he was exiled essentially from the Republican Party, or were they just coming around in recent weeks? All of this is something Donald Trump is likely to take into consideration. One thing to note, he has not been having serious conversations about what his transition would look like or what his administration will look like, because he is so superstitious, that's obviously all now going to change.

And one of the people that is going to get a brunt of that is President Biden, going back to his decision to even seek reelection in the first place.Something else that I think, just bears repeating is the degree of shock that I am getting from the Harris campaign as well. You know, this is a candidate and a campaign that, from the very beginning, they build themselves as the underdogs. And up until the very end, you know, they said, we know that this is going to be a very close race. This could come down to the margins in a number of the states. But I will say, everybody that I have talked to, to a person there is shock at the scope of the defeat that Kamala Harris saw last night. One senior adviser I was talking to said, of course, we knew that this was possible, but in a world where she is winning New Jersey by just five points, this is a state that Joe Biden won by 16 points back in 2020. We knew that something bigger was at play. And I think it's also just worth talking about, the fact that this is just an emotional time for everybody on the campaign and Democrats, of course, writ large. You know, these are people that worked on, whether it's the Biden campaign that turned into the Harris campaign, really poured everything into trying to get the vice president elected. And now not only are they dealing with sort of the emotional processing of what happened last night, but also figuring out their lives or packing their -- packing up their homes that they had temporarily set up in the -- in these battleground states. And figuring out what's even next for me in my life and my careers, happens every cycle, but just worth repeating that this is some of what they are processing right now in the big picture and then in their own lives.",

Manu, I know you're getting some new reporting right now about the Florida Senator Rick Scott and how he's positioning himself. What are you hearing? MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENTThere are three candidates in this race. One of them is the person on your screen there, Florida Senator Rick Scott, who did win his second term last night in Florida. He is telling his colleagues that he will be essentially the Trump candidate, someone who could align himself with Donald Trump. They say they could push along the Trump agenda. Now, he is seen as a long shot candidate in this race. He's up against Senator John Thune, who's the current Republican whip, and Senator John Cornyn who is a former whip, someone who is actually involved in ran the GOP campaign committee for two cycles. Both Thune and Cornyn are seen as the favorites in this race. But this is a secret ballot election, Wolf. So, it's unclear how senators will ultimately come down. And here's another big question. What will trump do? We know that Cornyn and Thune in particular, been trying to bolster their relationship with Trump over some time. Thune had a bit of more fraught relationship with Trump over the past couple years. He backed him Scott for the presidency as well. How does Trump react? Does he try to tip the scales into senators actually listen to him, because this position is so huge to help define the future of this party. As Republicans are looking at a 50 to 48 Senate at least, but that could potentially grow even to a 54, 46 Senate.",

So, Congresswoman Dingell, you and I have spoken several times over these past recent days. I guess there's got to be a part of you who knew this was possible because I remember the last time we spoke, you said you were nauseously optimistic, and that was after going across the state. Now you know what you know, and obviously, we have not yet made a formal call. What are you thinking about what happened in Michigan? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): So, I'm not surprised, Erin, like many others are -- that back to the matter is, is that I continue to tell all of you for months that this state was tight. It was going to be close. It may be a little bigger than I thought that it was going to be, but I knew that it was coming down to. So, it's not unexpected for me. So, I think -- I'm going to be very blunt. As Democrats, we got to do some soul searching that we're getting a message from a lot of people that we're not hearing them.

Because you and I spoke a couple times in recent days, right? And both times, you talked about Jill Stein, and you talked about how significant it was. And in fact, in one of the interviews, I knew coming in that you really wanted to bring it up because you were concerned. You wanted to send the message to the Arab American community, particularly in Dearborn, that voting for Jill Stein was a vote for Donald Trump, of course, who is a very clear Israel supporter. So, the numbers for Dearborn come in. Trump wins by 42 percent, Harris at 36, Jill Stein got 18 percent of the vote in Dearborn, Michigan. 18 percent of the vote. This isn't two or three.

I talk to them.And a lot of people are unwilling to just put themselves out there and listen and understand what their hurt is and what they're saying.

Not surprisingly, they went against the incumbent party.Look at the margin that we see that Donald Trump pulled off amongst those who said the economy was not going to report. Look at that, that's a 40-point margin. No way Kamala Harris could win given that these particular numbers. How about Latino voters, right? We spoke about them last hour. We spoke about Latino men. Let's talk about Latinos overall. Look at this. What do they say their most important issue was. Number one, the economy. Number one the economy. And how did those 40 percent who said that the economy was their top issue. How did they vote in the election? Take a look at this. This, I think, gives the game away amongst them. Look at this, a 33-point edge for Donald Trump. You know, in the exit polls, Donald Trump kept Kamala Harris's margin down to, I believe, eight points. I went back through exit polls since 1972, looking at the Latino vote. Donald Trump did better for a Republican nominee for president than any Republican nominee for president dating all the way back since 1972.
