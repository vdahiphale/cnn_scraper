If he doesn't New YorkAttorney General Letitia James can begin the process of seizing assets owned by Trump and the Trump Organization. Trump's lawyers say he's unable to secure payments, even though he has claims to have almost $500 million in cash and they've asked the court to reduce or eliminate the bond. Now Trump says he would face irreparable harm if he's forced to sell his properties at what he calls fire sale prices among them golf courses, hotels and prime Manhattan real estate, including Trump Tower. CNN Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz joins us now live. Katelyn, great to have you with us look, we're expecting to hear about the trial date today. This is what this hearing is about. It is important to note the trial was essentially set to start today that was delayed because we saw more documents over 100,000 being put into the fray. So what are you looking out for? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's the criminal case in New York in Manhattan. Trump is going to be there today in the courtroom. And we're looking to see if the judge wants to hold with that April 15th trial date. Now this case is on the cusp of going to trial. And it is a situation in court often that trial dates can slide a little bit. There was this very late collection of evidence that Trump's team was successful in having just recently from federal authorities that had investigated him previously, when they got those records. They used that to their advantage and said to the judge, we need a lot of time to look at them. And so that's why the trial is not starting today in New York on this falsification of business records set of charges. This is the charges in Manhattan that he falsified his business records to cover up payments he was making to reimburse his Attorney Michael Cohen to pay the porn star Stormy Daniels for hush money before the 2016 election. So what we're waiting for today is if the judge wants to hold that April 15th trial date, or if he agrees with Trump's team that thinks should move back more give them more time to prepare for trial? Every day is a day that we are waiting to see what will happen with timing in these cases because it is not the only criminal case Trump faces. And so when this trial gets on the books for real and starts, that kicks off the process of him being in criminal court as a defendant. We're also waiting for trial dates in his three other criminal cases. And there are a lot of questions. How many of those cases will go to trial before the election?",

Donald Trump lost his civil fraud case, the case wherethe State of New York accused him of essentially giving fraudulent amounts of what his properties were worth. And so he lost that lawsuit, the judgment, the amount that he is being fined in it is nearly a half billion dollars. That judgment was set a month ago, and he had a 30 day clock where he could put up money, essentially a bond to the court to continue appealing and try and get that overturned. We're at that 30 day deadline. And so today is the day that the Attorney General of New York Letitia James can start trying to satisfy or collect that money, those assets she can go after his bank accounts. She can go after buildings, houses, cars, he owns perhaps his plane. She's going to very likely start in the State of New York, Westchester County and New York City where Trump has many properties, resorts, hotels, a penthouse in Trump Tower and she's going to be talking to those authorities to see exactly what she can do first foreclose or put liens on properties? Not everything is going to happen right today. And there could be additional court fights down the road as she tries to enforce this judgment. But if Donald Trump does not put that bond up today and does not get a lifeline through the appeals court, then that's it. The New York Attorney General gets to collect.",

Why he needs to do that is if he doesn't do that, the state as you've been hearing can start to target his assets, even during the time when he's appealing this fraud verdict. So he faces the real prospect if he cannot come up with this money over the next period of weeks and months of seeing his business empire that helped him make his name as a celebrity, as a billionaire, and was central to his credentials to run for president being dismantled piece by piece. This is something that's very clearly worrying Trump a great deal. He put out a Truth Social post -- social media post this morning saying that he was being forced to sell his babies. You know, -- he loves these buildings. It's central to his self-identity, and his political and business brands. So the chances that some of this can start to be dismantled. This is a hugely serious moment for Donald Trump. He has throughout his business career, as I was saying there gone through extraordinary periods of triumph and disaster near financial ruin. And this is perhaps the most acute yet. And let's not forget this is happening at a time when he's not just a private citizen. He's running for President of the United States.

Now it has been responding to investigation after investigation. And Calhoun himself has gone to Capitol Hill to the top lawmakers on the Senate overseeing -- the Senate Committee overseeing aviation to say that his planes are safe, is not helped much when it comes to the FAA audit of Boeing quality control. Remember the NTSB its own investigation found that this 737 Max-9 in question, left the Boeing factory without the four critical door plug bolts in place that was on the NTSB preliminary report that came out on February 28th -- February 21st.

The jury's clearly isn't going to be favorable to him, as many conservatives would argue, but in terms of it moving the needle one way or the other. Jim, I think most conservatives would probably say it's going to be insignificant, which is why you've seen the former president more than anything, and his attorneys really, really focus on the other three trials trying to delay those as long as possible, because there is the possibility of actual prison time if a guilty verdict is rendered in one of those, this one here, he'll probably pay a fine and move on.",

And one of his statements Jim, at the formerpresident, I believe either made or posted on Truth Social several days or a week ago, he talked about how the cash is used to run many of his businesses. And perhaps many of our viewers, maybe the international viewers may not be aware of some maybe. But if you're in the real estate, business or market, it is very, very cash intensive. It's very, very rare that you will find a single individual similar to the former president, with access of half a billion or even a billion or more in liquid assets, most of whatever available cash is going to go towards continuing the daily operations and functions of the business. So it could be possible that the former president has access to the cash that's necessary. But if he were to deplete all of that cash, would he be able to operate and the businesses function probably not? Would he be able to pay people salaries? Probably not, which is why I think he's fighting so hard here. But again, looking at this from the political lens, I think his message is going to be clear. They're doing everything they possibly can to make sure that I can't win. And when you spend time talking to many Republican and conservative voters, the message is very obvious. Why are they going this far against this man? What is it about him that they disliked so much? Why can't they beat him on the issues? Why can't they beat him on policies? That's the way they're going to interpret this? And I think the former president recognizes that. And I do believe that there may be a sliver of independent voters who may be more concerned about other issues and less concerned about how much money Donald Trump has or doesn't have.",

Israel reportedly agreed to the number of Palestinian prisoners it will release in exchange for Hamas releasing hostages held in Gaza. This according to CNN Analyst Barak Ravid, the deal would release about 700 Palestinian prisoners 100 of whom are serving life sentences for convictions of killing Israeli nationals. In exchange, Hamas would release 40 Israeli hostages currently held in Gaza. This comes as senior Israeli officials are expected in Washington this week to discuss the Rafah operation differences between Israeli leadership and the U.S. leadership on the course of this war. CNN's Paula Hancocks has been following these talks from Doha, Qatar. Paula, there have been fits and starts in these talks for weeks. Where do they stand? I mean is there genuine hope that they're moving towards agreement here? Or are we likely to be disappointed again?",

      "sentences": "Well Jim, one source close to the talk says there is steady progress, but there are still differences between thetwo sides. So the Palestinian prisoners aspect of it that you just mentioned there, the fact that there is reportedly an agreement between the U. S. and Israel on the 700 Palestinian prisoners to be released just about 10 days ago. Hamas' counterproposal said they wanted between 700 and 1000 Palestinian prisoners released. So that is within the range of what they were looking for. So that potentially, is something that could move things forward. It's, of course, not just the number of prisoners, but also which prisoners are going to be released as well. We have been hearing a number of things from unnamed Israeli government officials, regarding this agreement between the U.S. and Israel obviously, it needs to be agreed by Hamas as well. And that would be waited for at this point. But Israel is under huge domestic and international pressure to push this process forward, and to secure a ceasefire and release the hostages. Now, as you said, we have heard pushback from Hamas, as well, two senior leaders at speaking to CNN saying that they blame the Israeli and American media for trying to add pressure to these talks specifying particularly, that the Palestinian prisoners is not the only issue at stake here. They say that they haven't had a reaction or a response from Israel when it comes to other key matters. For example, a complete ceasefire, which we know Israel, has said publicly, it would not want to agree to at this point, also the withdrawal of Israeli forces, even in stages. Now, Israel has made it very clear that it still intends to carry out a ground offensive in Rafah. So up until now, it has not been willing to entertain the idea of pulling its forces out of Gaza, also talking about the return of the displaced people within Gaza back to their home. So these are the issues that Hamas senior leaders are telling us that they still want to have clarity on. And as this point that they say that the focus is just on the Palestinian prisoners to be released and not to take anything away from potential progress that is happening on that that front. But of course, this is a very complicated, intricate negotiation. The technical teams are still here in Doha. The decision makers have left the city though. So at this point, we're really waiting to hear responses on the proposals that are on the table at this point, Jim.",

Former President Donald Trump's pre-trial hearing is set tobegin at the top of the hour just under 10 minutes. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. Four hush money payments he made to adult film star Stormy Daniels this before the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all those charges. Joining me now ahead of the hearing is Katelyn Polantz. And Katelyn before the judge today a couple of questions one, when to have the trial and two whether to dismiss it? I imagine that second question, not going to dismissed. Do we have any sense of what the possible outcomes are in terms of the start date?",

Trial dates, they do move and Donald Trump's team did develop an opening here where they were able to push back the trial at least till April 15th that's because they got 100,000 records, more than 200,000 pages of new documents just in the past few weeks, through their pursuit of building their defense case. Those documents came in from federal investigators who had looked at Trump years ago. And once they had those documents that are when they went to the judge. And they said, well, we need time to go over these. That's what's going to be discussed today, how much time they actually need to look at these records? The District Attorney's Office in New York says there was no wrongdoing here with those documents being turned over to the defense late and it's a very small amount, just a few 100 that are actually relevant to the defense's case. And so the district attorney's office is going to try and convince the judge to keep April as the start date for this case. So we're going to see exactly what the judge wants to do here. How much sympathy he's going to be giving the defense team to move trial dates? Trial dates, they do slide but this judge has been quite forceful in saying he wants the case to move forward even though Donald Trump is in court in a lot of different jurisdictions. They know that that's something they have to deal with as lawyers who are representing him on all of these cases. And there would have to be real significant problems for this not to go to trial in the coming months.",
