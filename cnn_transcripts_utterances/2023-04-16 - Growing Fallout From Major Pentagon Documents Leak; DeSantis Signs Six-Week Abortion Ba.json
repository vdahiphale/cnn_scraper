And as of this morning, the full extent of the impact of these leaks remains unknown. Armed federal agents descended on the Massachusetts home of 21-year-old Air National Guardsman, Jack Teixeira, on Thursday, arresting him for allegedly leaking troves of U.S. military intelligence. But the Biden administration is still very much in damage control mode today, struggling to contain a fallout from this crisis and trying to understand exactly how a relatively low-level member of the military was able to just walk away with such highly sensitive information. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've instructed the department to make sure that they get to the root of why he had access in the first place, number one. And number two, to focus extensively on the extent to which it all occurred. And that's going on right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And also, Taiwan's doubts about its own abilities to defend itself against an invasion by China. Senators sounded the alarm about the gravity of this situation just a short time ago. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): I have a lot of questions about why were these documents lying around? Why did this particular person have access to them? Where was the custody of the documents? And who are they for? SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I don't know what led to this airman's actions, but he's done a lot of damage to our standing. It's very hard to get people to come forward right now to tell us about things we need to know about if they feel like they're going to be compromised. So the question is, how did he get it?

And I think that's going to continue to be the message from most Republicans. We know that they've been really eager to get way more information on this. They felt very out of the loop on what's been happening with this investigation, and all senators will have a briefing on this leak on Wednesday.

The documents that he was revealing were really only to show his friends, essentially, what was going on inside the U.S. government, and we're not meant, according to these people in this chat, to be shared widely. So this individual was not doing this, because he wanted to expose broadly to the American public these kinds of things.And then the second, though, I think, to your point is that the vetting that went into this very young man, for him to be able to get a top secret sensitive compartmented information clearance. That is going to probably be looked at very closely here because, did they look at his online history? Did they look at his presence in these chat rooms, which he had apparently been on for at least five years before he got that clearance? All of these things the military is going to have to grapple with, but their point is that they can't legally kind of monitor all of this stuff domestically, right?",

So while -- and meanwhile, in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis may have made one of the most consequential decisions of his political career thus far, choosing to sign this highly restrictive six-week abortion ban into law. That's before many women even know that they are pregnant. Now, it won't go into effect until some of the legal challenges play out. But if and when it does, the procedure will be banned now in virtually the entire southeast region of the country. And given that this has been a huge Republican priority for decades, one would expect that DeSantis would be more vocal about touting his legislative success. And yet, 12 hours after he signed the bill, in a private late night ceremony, he gave a speech at Liberty University and this was as close as he came to mentioning it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

If you speak to them, they say, well, look at Stacey Abrams, Beto O'Rourke, Tim Ryan, they centered this issue in their contests, and they were not successful. In fact, some Republicans are encouraging lawmakers to double down on this issue and say, hey, you know, don't sort of crumble under democratic talking points remain firm.

It's something that galvanized evangelical voters around him, galvanized a lot of the conservative right around him because of his stance on abortion.
