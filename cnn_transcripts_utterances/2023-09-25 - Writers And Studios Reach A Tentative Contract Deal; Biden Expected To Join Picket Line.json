The Dow is down 47 points right now, but it's a mixed day in the US, and those are the markets and these are the main events. An end is in sight to the writers' strike, a tentative deal to start making movies again. While Hollywood moves one step closer to reopening, the US government is heading the opposite way. Little progress in Washington to avoid a shutdown. Plus Huawei woes, the China giants has a big launch, but it's what they didn't announce that raises eyebrows. Live from Dubai, it is Monday, September the 25th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening, and welcome to the show. Now after five months on the picket lines, it appears Hollywood's writers are about ready to get back to work. (PROTESTERS chanting.)",

They are ready to go back to work. I talked to one writer who said, I want to go back to making music. I want to go back to telling stories. But the union says not yet. They are still on strike. So what they're saying is they have to figure out essentially the writing, the details in that contract and what they're describing it as is dotting every I. So after that it gets done, tomorrow, we believe what's going to happen is that union leadership will have a number of votes and after those votes are made, then the contract is made public and it is handed to the writers to see if they like it or not, and they will have to vote on it. So once they do ratify it, they really will be able to go back to work full force. Now, the only problem here is that the actors are also on strike and have been since July. And so a lot of the work won't really be able to go back to normal because you still need the actors. So a lot of people here in this industry believe that maybe the writers deal will likely push or speed up or motivate the actors to get a deal as well. I want to read part of the statement from the actors union, which is currently not negotiating and here is what they're saying: \"Since the day that the WGA strike began, SAG AFTRA (which is the union for the actors) have stood alongside the writers on the picket lines. We remain on strike in our TV, theatrical contract, and continue to urge the studio and streamer CEOs and the AMPTP to return to the table and make the fair deal that our members deserve and demand.\" Now, the writers have been told we are no longer in the picket lines, but they're being encouraged to go out to the picket lines with the actors. So we're still going to see movement on the streets and we're still going to be hearing about this over the next couple of days. But again, the writers may be able to get that greenlight pretty soon and this is something they're thankful for, because it has not been easy economically for a lot of people in this industry. The estimated impact -- economic impact of this is about $5 billion. So really people just eager to get back to work and get this done.",

That was one of their biggest points that they were making and saying, we need to be paid more, we need to have more writers in the room. And then there was artificial intelligence, that was a big one as well, because we just don't know what's going to happen in the future and what AI is going to be capable of doing or replacing when it comes to these jobs. And so it looks like they made progress on AI, and sources telling CNN, that that was really the last sticking point. They were really trying to figure out the AI portion of this deal, and if they figured it out for the writers, it's possible that this could be helpful for the actors as well. It acts in different ways, because you know, AI is not going to be writing for the actors, or that's what these writers were asking for, but the issues may be different, but at the same time, this could help them in that process, as they already likely have a deal that probably these writers will vote for in the coming days.",

I mean, this whole fight, as I said, you know, a long time ago, it was about our -- it was about saving our middle class, you know. And so having a contract that gives us a basic cost of living raise, which has been one of the main sticking points. You know, in the US, we just had two consecutive years of more than six percent inflation, and that was a bad thing that happened to our economy, and the studios were trying to turn it into a good thing for them, which would have effectively been a pay cut for us. So we're getting the raises we needed. We're getting some protections we needed. I look forward like -- with every other member, I look forward to the specifics, but I am confident that we're going to be in a much better situation than we were before the strike, and then we would have been without a strike.",

The question is, howmuch more money and what other sort of concessions they're able to extract from the automakers? I recently talked to the former Ford CEO, Mark Fields and he told me that there's really no question that workers deserve more money, and that they're actually going to get it. His concern, though, was that if they get paid too much, then it could make some of these US automakers less competitive versus their foreign counterparts and the non-union US automakers like Tesla. So that's where the issue is. But what's interesting now is, this auto strike is colliding with the 2024 race for the White House. As you mentioned, President Biden plans to make history tomorrow becoming the first sitting US president to join the picket line. He previously had sort of been kind of neutral in this and now, he is clearly taking the side of the workers. Former President Trump, he's holding a rally in Detroit on Wednesday, where he is sure to criticize the electric vehicle transition that has been championed by the Biden administration and has been one of the sticking points in these negotiations between the UAW and the Big 3. As you mentioned, we see the strike escalating when it comes to Stellantis and GM, the UAW not escalating when it comes to Ford. But what was interesting is that on Friday, the UAW said that there's been real progress with Ford. Last night, Ford put out a statement saying that there's \"significant gaps\" to close on the key economic issues. And just a reminder here, Eleni, that the longer the strike goes on, the greater the economic impact.",

That's up from 58 percent early last year. Bank of America says that just 42 percent of workers say that they are financially well. That's a 13-year low for this survey, the lowest they've had since it came out in 2010, so that means lower than even the COVID low, lower than right after the Great Recession. These figures are clearly moving in the wrong direction, which is somewhat surprising, because government data shows that the rate of inflation in the United States has cooled off considerably, right? Prices were going up at more than nine percent year-over-year at the peak in June of 2022. We're at less than half of that, and yet you have this survey showing that workers feel otherwise. And I think that, you know, this raises two points. One, prices are still going up. They're not going up as fast as they were, but they're still going higher. And two, inflation is cumulative, right? There's this snowballing effect, whether you're talking about the cost of rent of a car, the price of eggs, the price tag when you go out to eat at a restaurant, all of it is significantly more expensive here in the United States, and really in many places around the world relative to pre-COVID. And so even though some of the government data shows that very recently, paychecks are going up a little bit faster than prices, when you ask workers, they still say they feel they cannot keep up.",

The continent of 1.6 billion people. This is a national aim for a global issue that all of us must come together to result.

We expected maybe a couple of ounces, but it got like eight -- half a pound of material got grabbed up into the capsule. Then that continued on to re-intersect Earth, deploy that capsule, and then it kept going and it's on to another asteroid. And so yes, it is rocket science. And yes, it's a brilliant feat.
