Camp residents say the military is also supplying medicine and medical treatment and facilities to sleep. However, it is not clear for how long Morocco will continue operating the camp. The government plans to rebuild some 50,000 homes that were destroyed in the magnitude 6.8 earthquake. Residents fear that could take months, or even years. Ukrainian forces are making headway in the East. That's according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He says Ukrainian troops liberated a key village Southwest of the city of Bakhmut on Sunday. Now that region has been a primary focus of Ukraine's counteroffensive efforts in the past few months. This latest victory comes right before Mr. Zelenskyy heads to the U.S. to address the U.N. and meet with U.S. President Joe Biden. He will use these new gains as evidence that Ukraine is pushing Russian forces back and that its counteroffensive is right on track. CNN's Fred Pleitgen brings us the latest now from Kyiv.

There's been some pretty remarkable video that's now been released by the Ukrainian armed forces that shows their troops advancing through Andriivka, and it really is showing the utter destruction that was brought on by months of fighting that was going on there. In fact the settlement of Andriivka is pretty much completely destroyed. It wasn't very big to begin with. But you can see on that video the ruins that those forces are advancing through. The Ukrainians also saying that the Russians now firing a lot of artillery shells at that place, seemingly trying to stop the Ukrainians from advancing any further. Nevertheless, they believe that these are important gains that they're making, especially as they're trying to take back Bakhmut. But of course, this is also very all very important to show that Ukraine has momentum as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is set to head to the United States, both to go to the U.N. General Assembly. But of course, also to meet U.S. President Joe Biden. Ukrainians once again reiterating that they need more longer-range weapons from the U.S. But also immediately, they say, ammunition. Artillery ammunition. HIMARS ammunition. Because they say there are areas on the front lines where the Russians are able to fire a lot more than the Ukrainians can, because they simply have a lot more ammo. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians are saying they understand that the counteroffensive is difficult. It's going a lot more slowly than they would like and that certainly many others would -- would've thought, as well. But at the same time, they do say that there is a degree of success as the Ukrainians on pretty much all areas of the frontline are putting pressure on the Russians while the Russians are on the defensive.

It is from a Jesuit in Germany to Pope Pius' personal secretary. It confirmed that the Nazis were murdering 6,000 Jews and Poles every day in S.S. furnaces at a camp in what was then Poland. The Vatican at the time claimed its information was only vague and, in fact, unverified. But the letter contains references to Auschwitz and Dachau and suggests there were more communications that have yet to be found. E.U. chief Ursula von der Leyen and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni say they are working to resolve the migrant crisis facing the Italian island of Lampedusa. Von der Leyen visited a migrant reception center on the island with the prime minister Sunday. During her trip, she outlined a ten-point action plan to deal with the surge in migration, saying Europe and Italy are both committing more resources. Now, this week, Lampedusa saw a massive uptick in migrant arrivals, equivalent to the entire island's population of about 7,000 people. One resident in town, a council member, says she hopes migrants who experienced a rough time during their journey get the help they need, especially children who are now arriving alone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELISA FRAGAPANE, LAMPEDUSA RESIDENT AND TOWN COUNCILOR (through translator): We saw people suffering. Children without parents.

But it must be said that when they went to Lampedusa, they didn't meet a single migrant or refugee in those camps. They did kind of a quick trip, three hours, and then Von der Leyen was off to New York for the U.N. Security Council. But while she was there, she did lay out this ten-point plan, none of which actually deals with the issues facing the migrants themselves and the refugees themselves.

Refugees, of course, are very different from migrants. It's an entirely different category that's being discussed here. What we're talking about is trying to do what they want to do is deal with the problems in the transit countries. And that's Tunisia, and that's Libya. Neither of these countries are necessarily being as cooperative as they'd like. And that would mean putting in some sort of infrastructure in those countries to hear asylum requests. What would mean -- what that would mean, though, of course, is that all of the people who don't -- you know, don't qualify for asylum then would be left in those countries. And that's something that's not being dealt with, and that's very much why neither Tunisia, or Libya, both with problems of their own, are not being that cooperative in terms of trying to find these, quote unquote, \"safe pathways.\" No one's really talking about addressing the problems where they start.
