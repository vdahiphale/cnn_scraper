We just learned that a fourth fire, yes, that's right, a fourth fire has just broken out. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders. The flames are moving so fast that people are abandoning their cars and fleeing on foot. Take a look at this right here. Yes, you are seeing bulldozers clearing cars that have been blocking the roadways in Los Angeles. This was in Pasadena, as a senior center rushed to evacuate its residents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That was the L.A. County fires. So, our northern boundary has pushed up to that.Our priority is saving lives and structural defense. So, we are in positions where we will defend as many homes as we possibly can. Unfortunately, the winds are not forecasted to lighten at all, and they're at a level where they prevent our rotary wing helicopters from being able to fly.

And then volume two about the classified documents case against Trump, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, doesn't want to release that publicly because there's ongoing appeals related to Trump's two co-defendants, whether that case could be revived against them, and they could still face charges. They don't want to prejudice that.

They should do that, and they've said, that's what we intend to do. The legal dispute here really shouldn't have anything to do with the January 6th report.Now, separately, we've got the report on the classified documents case in Florida. And what the Justice Department has said is, okay, we understand there's two other defendants here other than Trump, that's Walt Nauta and Mr. De Oliveira, they still have potentially live cases. And so recognizing that they have a right as defendants, we're not going to blast this report out publicly. Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to make it available behind closed doors to the leaders of Congress in order to protect their rights.
