Today, the FBI announced that it started analyzing the first pieces of the balloon at its lab in Quantico, Virginia. And senior officials say those parts could be used as evidence in a future possible criminal case against groups linked to the Chinese military. The Biden administration has determined the balloon was capable of monitoring U.S. communications, but sources say U.S. officials believe the Chinese government did not have the opportunity to gather much intelligence because the Chinese government stopped transmissions to the Chinese mainland once the U.S. found out about the balloon. House and Senate lawmakers were briefed on the spy balloon today including the president's decision to let it fly across the country before shooting it down. A top Senate Democrat who led one of today's hearings is going to join us in just a few minutes.

But this is also, of course, the home state of two potential GOP challengers in 2024. So Biden used his remarks to call on the spirited debate with Republicans during the State of the Union to call Scott's plan, quote, outrageous and also to say quite simply he would veto it if it got to his desk. Now, this is plan Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said does not have any traction. Scott on CNN this morning pushed back saying he doesn't want to cut Social Security and Medicare.

One interesting point he made he was talking about something President Biden did when he was Senator Biden back in the 1970s when he also suggested this idea of having federal legislation sunset.

So, both Todd and I believe Article One matters. Congress should be deeply involved in this. It's our job. Second, Iraq's not an enemy anymore. These were war authorizations against an Iraq ultimately leading to a toppling of Saddam Hussein and the Baathist Party. Iraq is now a security partner of the United States in the fight against ISIS, in the fight against Iranian bellicose activity in the region, why have a war authorization against a nation that is your partner? And finally, I think it sends a good message, a great thing about America we have had a capacity to take nations we've been at war with and then end up as allies, Germany, the U.K., Japan, and it's good to send that message that a nation that's been in war with the United States, we're open to making the relationship better, and other nations have been, too.
