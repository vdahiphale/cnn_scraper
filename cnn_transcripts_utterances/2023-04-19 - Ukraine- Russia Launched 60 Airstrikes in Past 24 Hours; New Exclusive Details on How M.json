But what we saw was a real intensification of the fighting in that area. There are a lot of Ukrainian troops.Clearly, the Ukrainians are trying as hard as possible to hold on to the little part of the city of Mahmoud that they still control. Now, there is much anticipation and talk about a Ukrainian offensive coming up and certainly in this part of Ukraine, in the eastern part of the country, what we see is a huge amount of troops and armor on the move. Also on the move is Patriot anti-missile systems. The Ukrainians announced today that a German-provided Patriot missile system has arrived in country. There's more weaponry on the way. We know that the Spanish are loading up Leopard 2 tanks to be sent to Ukraine. They're expected to be on the front line at the end of this month. Now, when this offensive is going to begin is not clear.

Obviously, those procedures failed. We are investigating why, and trying to figure out if we need new procedures. They didn't really give us a lot more information than that, and that's what we members of Congress are really interested in finding out. What happened here?
