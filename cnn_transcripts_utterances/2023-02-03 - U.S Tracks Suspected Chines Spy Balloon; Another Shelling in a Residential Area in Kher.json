Coming up on \"CNN Newsroom,\" U.S. officials believe China has sent a spy balloon to float over sensitive sites inside the country. Ahead, we'll look at how this could affect Secretary of State's upcoming visit to Beijing.Plus, European leaders are in Kyiv right now for a wartime summit with President Zelenskyy. We'll take a look at what Ukraine says it needs to defend its borders. And later, an event that is 50,000 years in the making, how to view the green comet as it passes overhead. For the first time we are hearing directly from China after surprising reports that a suspected Chinese spy balloon is floating over the northern U.S. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson addressed the situation a short time ago saying they are aware of the reports. We will have more in a live report from Beijing in just a moment. But a senior U.S. defense official says that Pentagon is confident this surveillance balloon belongs to China. The U.S. has been tracking it for a few days and says it entered Montana via Canada and we've hearing that it does not pose a serious risk. But it is traveling near sensitive sites. And people living in the Billings, Montana area definitely noticed something strange in the sky. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The visitor shown here over Stonehenge in England was lost visible during the Stone Age. It's orbit around the sun takes it furthest reaches of the solar system which is why it has taken so long to swing by again, when it just completed its closest approach to our planet, about 42 million kilometers away.For more on this, we're joined by astronomer, Laurence O'Rourke, a senior systems engineer at the European Space Agency and he is in Madrid. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, 50,000 years ago when the comet was last seen and the sky, mammoth and saber toothed cats and Neanderthals might have looked up and seen it. Now, 50,000 years later, you are among those who saw it. So, describe what you saw. LAURENCE O'ROURKE, SENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEER, EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY: Yeah. I mean, 50,000 years ago, we don't have the light pollution, which we have these days, with all the lights from the city and those days we would have seen it very, very clearly. But if you really want to see it, you have to be in an area which -- with no background light. What I have seen -- I mean, I saw it a number of number of nights ago, it's very much a diffused cloud of small whitish cloud which -- it is quite beautiful when you look through the telescope or either you can see it through binoculars or even -- in the last few nights, you can even see it with the naked eyes.",

So, why is that?O'ROURKE:  Yeah, it's -- I mean it really -- it comes from what comets are made of. Comets are really just a ball of ice and dust, and the ice has many different types of ice as well as there are different types gases, which are -- which formed the ice. And so, comets are just ball of ice and dust as it gets closer to the sun, it heats up and the ice sublimes because there's no liquid in space, it changes from ice to gas. And so, what you have around the comment is gas and you see dust. And one of these gasses in fact is like dicarbon. It's C2. So, just like water, it's known as H2O, you got two hydrogens. This case, we're dealing with two carbons. The discus (ph) and the -- is illuminated by the sun. Effectively, you get fluorescence. And so, the photons from light actually released green photons. And so, it's quite beautiful. And so, of course, while I said it was white when I was looking at it, of course, it's -- as you look and if you're using cameras, you can really see it as green.",

And we believe it originated from comets and asteroids. The gases, which we have, which we are breathing, also a small -- a lot of would have come from comments.

I mean, it is a shame we won't to be able to do the same thing with this comet, with the interceptor, but talk us through what we will be able to do in the future if we get another visitor like this?O'ROURKE:  Well, indeed, I mean, the European Space Agency is planning to launch in 2029 a mission called Comet Interceptor, which is intended to fly out into an area space which is there, for example, James Webb telescope, is (inaudible) located and we leave it there exactly in waiting mode, waiting until a comet just like this one, because this really is a perfect candidate. It's Oort cloud. It's coming from this location, very, very far away. It's clean. It hasn't changed by much from the sun. And so, when we launch, we will be waiting in space and waiting to identify a comet like this. At that point, we fire the thrusters and we effectively try to pass that comet as close as possible, take images. We have two different virtual robots (inaudible) really at the time.

Instead, the court found the charge was at a low level of seriousness, and let him go because he was not at risk of re-offending.Well, just one NFL legend Tom Brady thought he was out of the game. New England Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft wants to pull him back in, at least symbolically. Brady announced his retirement after 23 seasons on Wednesday, this time for good, he says. He briefly retired, of course, last, year before returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for one more season. He spent the vast majority of his career with New England Patriots, winning six of his record seven Super Bowls with the team.
