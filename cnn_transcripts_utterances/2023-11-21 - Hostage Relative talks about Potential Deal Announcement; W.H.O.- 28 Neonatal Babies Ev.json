There's word of a deal to free 50of the hostages taken by Hamas during the October 7th attack on Israel. That deal could be announced in the coming hours. Sources tell us there are still some things to be worked out, but an agreement is getting closer. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just a short time ago saying they are making progress. And he hopes for \"Good News\" soon. His office source say the government is meeting over the next few hours to discuss the deal. Now for the families, this has been an emotional roller coaster. If the deal comes to fruition one of the hostages who could be released is a three-year-old American Abigail Idan. CNN talked with her great aunt just a short while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ HERSH, GREAT AUNT OF THREE-YEAR-OLD HOSTAGE: We can't get our hopes up in a way that just believes that it's going to happen right in the next couple of hours. But you know, when I think about that on Friday is Abigail's fourth birthday, and that she should be home with her family and with her sister and brother. And she isn't right now. It's just it's that if you get your emotions, you have to keep them in check. Because if not, and you think about nine-month-old children, little girls, little boys, mothers and you just hope that there's somebody holding these little children. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Mosab AbuToha had been contributing to the New Yorker with reflections on his life inside Gaza. PEN International wrote on X formerly known as Twitter that it is demanding to know his whereabouts and the reasons for his detention. Mosab's brother Hamza said the army took him at a checkpoint as he was traveling from the north of Gaza to the south. CNN has reached out to the IDF for response. The IDF says it's checking on the report. Joining us now to talk about the arrest is Nada Bashir. Nada, as I mentioned there, The New Yorker if a regular readers of that will recognize his name. And one of the essays that was very poignant to me the agony of waiting for a ceasefire that never comes. He and his family were in the Jabalya refugee camp for a long while. What more do we know about his potential whereabouts?",

North Korea has launchedwhat it claims is the military reconnaissance satellite southwards. That's according to the South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. This will be Pyongyang's third attempt to place a spy satellite in orbit this year. Japan issued an emergency warning in response to the launch telling residents in Southern Japan to take cover. We'll have much more on this story and the breaking news of course out of the Middle East as well after this short break, stay with CNN. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Everybody should be out now. But here we are in a negotiation. And we're getting closer to the end. We believe of that negotiation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Becky Anderson is in Doha tonight for us, Becky, great to have you with us.I think you and I would agree that until the moment those hostages are released, and are safe and sound and back with their families. We're going to be very cautious, cautiously optimistic, we hope. But just the fact that the Israelis now were talking about scheduling a war cabinet, a security cabinet, at least suggest that we can at this moment say we're closer than we've ever been in this process.",

Farah was a Correspondent, a Reporter, Rabih was a Cameraman. They were killed in an Israeli strike outside the town of Teir Harfa, which is very close to the border with Israel. Now, Al-Mayadeen came out with a statement saying that this was direct deliberate targeting by Israel. CNN has gotten in touch with these rarely military to see if they have any comment, clarifications why these journalists were targeted and killed. But as is often the case, the Israeli military doesn't get back to us very quickly. Now regarding the CPJ report, in addition to the death toll they're talking about, they say 11 journalists have been injured since the beginning of this war on the 7th of October, three are missing, and 18 have been arrested. This is as they point out, by far the bloodiest conflict for journalists in recent history. I mean, let's see, this is only since the 7th of October, basically, at least one journalist is being killed a day and the vast majority of them are in Gaza. And it's not just the journalists themselves who are being killed in Gaza. It's many of the family members of these journalists as well. So yes, this is a grim report and it certainly does set a horrendous record when it comes to our profession, Julia.",

Report say talks continue to get CEO Sam Altman rehired at the firm after his sudden ouster on Friday. A majority of OpenAI employees sent a letter to the company's board on Monday threatening to resign unless Altman comes back. And Board Members themselves that fired him resign. Report say top OpenAI Investors are also pushing to get Altman back. Microsoft, which owns a sizable portion of OpenAI, has announced that they will hire Altman to head up a new AI development unit. But it hints it's open to Altman keeping his old job with conditions. Microsoft stock hit a record high on the news on Monday. Anna Stewart joins me now. And of course the CEO, Satya Nadella as well is sort of caught up in the mix of this and was talking to journalists as well, during Monday's session. And was sort of open to options, either we'd get them in house for free, or everyone just goes back to where they were a week ago I mean, what a joke.",

One, that Microsoft which is you know, the biggest partner biggest investor of OpenAI was not informed by the Board that they were planning to fire its CEO Sam Altman. That going forward is Microsoft definitely wants some sort of governance going forwards with their partnership, whether that is a seat at the Board, or some observation position with the Board, that they have indicated that they will continue to work with. And I quote from Nadella, whoever is left at OpenAI; they are committed to that partnership. But they will also work with Sam Altman, whether that's from within Microsoft or from outside, Julia. And also Nadella is very keen to point out to people that he's worried that people are getting the wrong end of the stick here. He says OpenAI is a value partnership. It means a lot to them. But he says it is not consequential for the future of Microsoft.",
