According to the NTSB, the first alarms went off at 1Today, the search for the victims has been paused due to the sheer amount of debris in the water. Dive teams pulled out the bodies, however, of two construction workers. Their bodies were found submerged in a truck surrounded by concrete. CNN's Gabe Cohen is live with us from Baltimore.

Eventually, though, that made a call went out, which helped police on land stop traffic to the bridge.Though, look, it's really hard to hear these details heartbreaking, knowing that those eight construction workers weren't reached throughout all this, six of whom are believed to have died in the river. And as you mentioned, Sara, the recovery effort has stopped today because of the conditions that those rescue and recovery crews are dealing with out there on the Patapsco River. Take a listen. This is how the chief of state police described it yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. ROLAND BUTLER JR., SUPERINTENDENT, MARYLAND STATE POLICE: Because of the superstructure surrounding what we believe are the vehicles and the amount of concrete and debris, divers are no longer able to safely navigate or operate around that. We have exhausted all search efforts. (END VIDEO CLIP) G. COHEN:  And so, Sara, now a lot of the focus turns to getting the bridge, all of that steel out of the water and getting that ship moved. What is going to be a major problem or at least another roadblock here is the hazardous material that's also been discovered, 56 containers of it, more than 700 tons. And it's making it difficult because it means that crews, in large part, can't get on the bow of the ship where the bridge came down because some of those containers have been breached. There is a bit of a spill into the river, although the Coast Guard says it's not a public health concern at this point, but it's creating more problems for those crews that are still bringing in equipment and are trying to figure out how to move this massive bridge. You can see a lot of it when we look at the pictures above the water. There's even more of it below the water, Sara. And any little bit, any piece of concrete could be a hazard for ships coming in and out in the future. So, they have to get it all out.",

First, the initial shock of what happened, then those that were clinging on to hope, hoping that a miracle would happen. And, of course, the realization that, as the hours and days went by, that just seemed less and less possible.What we know is that two bodies were recovered. Authorities have identified one of them as Dorlian Castillo Cabrera. He is a 26-year- old from Guatemala. CNN has been able to speak to his family members. They say that he had been working for this construction company for three years and that he absolutely loved his job. He was one of two Guatemalans killed in this incident. The other body that was recovered was that of Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes. He's 35 years old from Mexico, one or two Mexicans killed. We do not have that much information about him. We spoke yesterday with the press secretary for the U.S. embassy here in Washington, and they said that these families have asked for privacy and that they are trying to respect those wishes. The other immigrant worker that was killed is Miguel Luna. He is from El Salvador. He is a father to three children, but his family also told us that he has three stepchildren. Maynor Suazo Sandoval, he is a 38-year-old from Honduras. He has two children, and we were able to speak to his family members. He was a construction worker, but also an entrepreneur who had established several businesses here and in Honduras. And we spoke to this brother, Carlos Suazo Sandoval, yesterday, and he told us why it was so important for these families that the recovery efforts continue. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

COHEN:  So one of those efforts, in Willis' opinion, seems to also be coming from Trump's allies in Congress. Republican Congressman Jim Jordan did subpoena Willis a few weeks ago. She responded to that subpoena yesterday in a letter that also hit back at Jordan for trying to wage what she calls a political investigation against her. She wrote, in her letter to Jordan, nothing that you do will derail the efforts of my staff and I to bring the election interference prosecution to trial. My family and my staff and I have been threatened repeatedly by people making violent, often racist attacks. Neither those threats, nor anything your colleagues, and you say or do, will deter us from fulfilling our duty to bring this case to trial. So, obviously, today's hearing is the first moment where we will hear from Fani Willis' team and Trump's attorneys since that disqualification effort you mentioned largely failed. The appeals court could still take that up, but now Willis really trying to move the case forward and McAfee has agreed to allow that to happen.",

COHEN:  Yes, Fred. Harrison Floyd, as you mentioned, he's charged in Georgia alongside Donald Trump as part of this RICO case brought by Fani Willis. He actually only realized that the judge gave him permission a month ago to work for Donald Trump in Trump's campaign in 2024, only realizing it this week. He posted the letter from McAfee on Twitter. It's interesting because the terms of his bond agreement, Floyd cannot have any direct contact with any of his fellow co-defendants, including Trump. But the judge is making an exception a little bit here saying that he can have indirect contact with Donald Trump about the employment on the campaign. So, it's sort of a bizarre scenario, one that we haven't really seen happen before, where two co-defendants, one of them working on the other one's presidential campaign.",
