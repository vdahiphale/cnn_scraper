      "sentences": "Yes. I don't think White House officials could have been happier in the wake of that speech last night, not just because they feel like he delivered the extensive remarks that they'd spent months preparing but also in these off-the-cuff moments that he had with Republicans inside the chamber back and forth. Where they felt the president, both demonstrated a level of vigor that they wanted him to show but also kind of crystallized a really critical moment, one that now former White House Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, called one of the greatest moments in State of the Union history. Maybe a little bit of hyperbole there, but certainly underscoring how White House officials felt in the wake of the speech last night and what he's carrying into the president, this trip to de-force Wisconsin.Now, keep in mind, guys, you noted battleground state, this is the most battleground of battleground states. The president winning it by less than 1 percent in 2020. If he runs again, which is expected this will be a critical state and his path to 270 electoral votes. But when you talk about the message the president plans to deliver today is delivering right now in front of a union workers' training facility, it is very much tied to a central component of those remarks on the economic side of things. The idea that this is a blue-collar economic strategy that he's been putting into place, one that connects with communities that perhaps over the course of the last couple of decades, have felt invisible, have been hollowed out by globalization, by technology. That is at the center of many of the legislative proposals that he's signed into law in his first two years. And White House officials know to sign them into law is certainly a huge step. Implementing them is perhaps the most important because that's where they will have a tangible impact on Americans. And that is what the president's trying to demonstrate right now in Wisconsin. Certainly, as you guys noted, the post-State of the Union traveled not just for the president, but the vice president, cabinet officials, notably visiting a lot of different swing states here. The vice president in Georgia today will be in Minnesota tomorrow and other critical swing states for the president. All of this kind of serving as an impromptu soft launch to some degree of a reelection campaign we expect to kick off in the weeks ahead. The president coming off that State of the Union address clearly feeling good about the message he delivered last night, a message he's going to be delivering day in and day out in the days and weeks ahead, guys.",

      "sentences": "And yet today, 24 hours later -- less than 24 hours later, there he goes. Laura, if I can go back to you because aside from this one issue, I do have to say that it was probably one of the least partisan or polarizing speeches that we've seen in a while. That the president really got into issues that are kitchen table issues that most Americans regardless of which party they are in, can agree on. And that is preserving Social Security and Medicare, paid family leave, going after big corporations that pay zero percent tax rates, advocating for small businesses, made in America. What do you think the motivation in that was in terms of how Republicans are going to respond to that because there was a lot there that they really couldn't disagree with?BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, part of that is in response to the fact that even though inflation as the president noted last night is going down right now, a lot of Americans don't feel as though the cost of consumer goods is going down. And that's something that Republicans have attacked the president on, and the administration on repeatedly. And so, we heard the president last night talk specifically also about junk fees. And that's been those -- the fees of -- overdraft fees from banks, as well as excessive fees from airlines, resort fees from he said, hotels that are not actually resorts, those -- that's an attempt by the White House and by Biden to show the American public that they are trying to make things less expensive, trying to help people at their pocketbooks and tackle inflation. But I did just want to note on what Phil was saying about this back and forth with Republicans on the debt ceiling, is that a White House official texted me today that it was -- that Republicans \"walked into the trap,\" and that essentially, the president was trying to get them to respond to what he was saying, so that way, he could, as he just said, right now, he admitted, negotiate with them on the floor of the House right in front of the American public. And I think an important context there is also that in addition to Rick -- senators Rick Scott and Mike Lee, there are a number of House Republicans who have proposed cutting entitlements. And before speaker McCarthy said that that was off the table, he did tell Punchbowl News last October that he didn't want to return -- predetermine any type of potential cuts that he would want to make essentially leaving those on the table.",
