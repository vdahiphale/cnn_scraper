Trump is expected to make five trips to Iowa through October with his first visit on Wednesday. This comes as Trump is going after DeSantis for signing a Florida law that bans most abortions after six weeks into a pregnancy. Well, Trump, who appointed three Supreme Court justices that led to the overturning of Roe versus Wade, is now criticizing his party over its messaging on abortion as he avoids laying out a clear position himself.

It is contrary to the fundamental rules by which free, open and democratic societies conduct themselves.NEWTON (voice-over): The killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar remains unsolved. Royal Canadian Mounted Police say Nijjar suffered multiple gunshot wounds while sitting in a vehicle outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Colombia. Homicide investigators say two masked suspects described as heavier set males, fled on foot and then possibly in this 2008 silver Toyota Camry. In the earliest days after the homicide, protesters demanded justice, saying the killing was politically motivated and chilling retribution for Nijjar's activism and support for Sikh independence in India.

If proven true, this would be a grave violation of our sovereignty and of the most basic rule of how countries deal with each other.NEWTON (voice-over): That stern rebuke was followed by swift action. Canada expelled the head of India's spy agency in Canada, one of India's top diplomats in the country. In a statement, the Indian government responded saying the allegations are unsubstantiated and accused Canada of sheltering terrorists. Trudeau considers the intelligence so credible that his foreign minister says he raised the issue with both U.S. President Joe Biden and Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The killing of Nijjar and its fallout is now a potential political powder keg in both India and Canada, home to one of the largest Indian diasporas anywhere in the world. Sikh independence has long been a dangerous fault line in Indian politics. Canada now fears that conflict may have been brought to its shores with deadly consequences. Paul Newton, CNN.

All of a sudden, smart and sophisticated ecosystems are looking at their area and saying I'm not limited by anything. I can look at something like agritech because I can leapfrog the challenges of agriculture they were before.
