But yes, we are going to have some showers to contend with, not just in the early end of the festivities, but really through most of them from 8 p.m. all the way through midnight. You do have those shower chances in effect.But the chance the temperature itself is going to be in the upper 40s to lower 50s. When we compare that to other years, that's not too far from say the top five warmest of the New Year's Eve ball drops. So again, it could be worse. It could be a cold rain. At least it's going to be on the milder side. Now, the rain itself is all coming from this system right here that's currently in the Midwest, bringing rain to portions of Chicago, Indianapolis and even a few rumbles of thunder across Cincinnati. That's going to continue to slide to the east as we go through the day today. Now, on the southern side, we also have some very gusty winds up around 40 to 50 miles per hour. That includes Knoxville and Lexington, Kentucky. We also have the potential for some strong to severe storms today across the Mid-Atlantic looking at mainly strong wind gusts. You're talking Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. Baltimore, even Atlantic City, New Jersey. The system itself will continue to slide to the east again around the evening rush hour tonight, really starting to spread more of those showers into the Mid-Atlantic as well as the Northeast. And some snow starting to see that change over there across portions of Michigan as well as Wisconsin and Illinois. By tonight in time for the ball to drop, yes, we do have some rain unfortunately in New York also around Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, even around Hartford, Connecticut, also looking at some showers. So don't forget to take that poncho with you because remember, most places do not allow umbrellas.",

I think that's a very notable tone and message change.And I think look, it's really important as we're also seeing, again, to bring it back to Congress. I think Republicans are very, very keen on the fact that their first priorities, they need to be things that unify. So look, H-1B is an important immigration part. I don't think it'll be in that first package, especially with this fissure.
