Besides a major breakdown in communication, the report found that the Secret Service failed to set a visual barriers, had no plan on how to secure the building where the gunman was located. Some requests for critical resources were denied. Some of those requests not even made. This morning the agency's chief of communications is responding, saying the report lines up with what the agency's own review found. The statement says, \"The U.S. Secret Service has implemented changes to our protective operations to ensure the highest levels of safety and security for those we protect.\"With us now is the chair of the Senate committee behind this report, Michigan Senator Gary Peters. Thank you very much for being with us. Senator, let me ask a simple question, or what would think would be a simple question -- who was the clear leader in charge of planning and security decisions for the July 13th rally? SEN. GARY PETERS (D-MI):  Well, you're absolutely right. That should be a very clear answer. And the problem is there is no answer. That was astonishing to us is the fact that we could not find one point of contact who said this is the person -- to ensure there was supervision, that it was being implemented properly. So we found a lot of finger-pointing, saying, well, it was a collaborative plan. Many people worked on it, but no -- local law enforcement saying they weren't being told. We had Secret Service saying they were telling them. It was clearly not what you would expect to see when it comes to securing a principal like the former president.",

It should be based on intelligence as well.But clearly the threat assessment, where we're dealing with a highly polarized environment, lots of tensions.

That has been sort of part of the Joe Biden coalition that seems to be hanging on there for a moment.But I would say with young voters, the big question for me, Kate, is always, will they show up? We see in our survey research in this brand-new poll where our colleagues have done sort of a deep dive into the youth vote. They're very dissatisfied with their influence on the political process. And does that make them so disenchanted to not show up? We talk a lot about the youth vote in cycle after cycle. We've seen in recent years in the Trump era that they did show up in greater numbers than they had before. Not sure if that will continue.

It's a 19 point gender gap, meaning Kamala Harris has a 10-point advantage with women in our poll, and Donald Trump has a nine-point advantage with men in our poll. So that's the divide there.But it's interesting when you look at sort of subcategories in there. You see among independent women, when you look at likely independent voters, the gender gap, the gender gap plays more into Harris's advantage. I mean, she goes to a 15-point advantage among independent women. And we also see a big difference among white voters compared to black or Latino voters where the gender gap isn't as pronounced. But among white voters, Donald Trump has an enormous advantage with white male voters, as you might suspect. And among white women, Kate, Kamala Harris is within the margin of error. Numerically, she's trailing him by three -- 50 percent of white women support Trump in our poll, 47 percent support Kamala Harris. I mean, that's well within that subgroup's margin of error. I would just note, Hillary Clinton in 2016 lost white women to Donald Trump by nine points. Joe Biden lost white women do Donald Trump in 2020 by 11 percentage points. If that is -- if that mirrors what it looks like on election night about how white women cast their ballots in this election, that would be very good news for Kamala Harris.",

Big focus on workforce development, making sure people are trained for the very sophisticated, advanced manufacturing jobs that are out there. I think that's a big piece of the Harris agenda.

Those sustained winds up to 70 miles per hour, it is expected to become a hurricane at some point today and that could be rather soon. We are only five miles per hour away from that. The storm right now, just to the east of Cancun, Mexico. It is expected to go back out over open water where it will intensify. We have not one, but two separate hurricane hunter flights currently investigating the storm, that will send back a tremendous amount of data for us to understand even more so what this storm is expected to do when it gets over those warm waters off the Gulf of Mexico. We expect it to get to a hurricane today, a major hurricane at some point on Thursday before it makes landfall late Thursday and then continuing to move inland. But it is a very fast-moving storm and that is going to allow a lot of these impacts to be able to stretch inland. Now, along the coast, you've got a lot of storm surge that is going to be a concern pretty much up and down the entire western coast of the Florida Peninsula here. The worst is going to be along the Big Bend where you've got ten to 15 feet of storm surge. Those winds, we talked about the storm being very quick. At the time it makes landfall, it could be moving at say, speeds of around 25 miles per hour. It doesn't sound like much to folks who drive cars, but for hurricanes, that is very, very fast.  That means it can move really far inland before you start to see the storm weakening. That means areas of inland Georgia could end up seeing a high-end tropical storm force winds, or even low-end Category One hurricane. We are talking Atlanta, a very city that is nowhere near the ocean whatsoever, could end up having those wind gusts up around that 70 to 80-mile per hour range. Rain is also going to be a big factor with this because that will also spread inland. You've got a lot of these areas in the Southern Appalachians where you're talking widespread rainfall accumulations of four to six inches, some of them could pick up eight, ten, even as much as foot of rain just over the next several days. So you have that potential there for some excessive flooding and rainfall. You can see the area here for today is really going to be focused across much of Central Georgia up through Western North Carolina. That does include cities like Atlanta and Asheville. And then Thursday, you also see it, but now seeing that upgrade to a high risk. That's a level four out of four, the highest possible category you can get in terms of flood risk.

What we understand is that air quality testing was done yesterday. Those results are expected sometime this morning, so we are looking to get those updates. We also know that there were federal officials that went to that area. And of course, those local emergency management officials who are going to provide us some updates as well. But let's tell you what happened: At about two o'clock yesterday afternoon, the fire department there in that area near Cincinnati, as you said, in Ohio reported that this chemical, which is called styrene, it is used to make plastics and rubber -- it is colorless, it is toxic, highly flammable -- it was leaking out of that train car that was in the rail yard. Officials removed that train car, they shut off that valve, but again, the repercussions or the effects of it, we don't quite know just yet. Some of the things that styrene can do to people, well, it can cause serious headaches, it can cause nausea, respiratory issues, and certainly there could be some long-term issues like organ damage, so no joke. Officials taking this obviously very seriously. Once that was reported yesterday, there was about a half a mile radius around that area of homes, of schools, as you mentioned, that were evacuated. I just looked at the schools in that area. There are three schools that are not going to be open today, but they did say at about one o'clock today, they are going to decide if they can do after-school activities. So you can see that that whole area sort of in waiting pattern, trying to get an update about the air quality and about what officials think that, you know, the solution is at this moment.
