Mexico electing its first female president. The Morena Party gets the super majority in Congress and investors take fright. Trial tension. Hunter Biden in court on felony gun charges. The first time in history that the son of a sitting president faces a jury. And a new warning about the use of A.I. and one you probably haven't heard about before. Could A.I. help deepen and prolong economic downturns in the future? We'll discuss how and why, and most importantly, how we can stop it. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, Mexico has elected its first female president. Claudia Sheinbaum will also become the nation's first Jewish president. Leaders across the North and South America are offering their congratulations, with U.S. President Joe Biden saying he looks forward to working with her. It's a high priority relationship for President Biden. Mexico is America's top trading partner. Markets, however, were a bit less optimistic about Sheinbaum's presidency. The peso slipped nearly 4 percent against the U.S. dollar on Monday, while Mexico's main stock index fell nearly 6 percent. For more, we're joined by Gustavo Valdes in Mexico City. Gustavo, great to have you with us. It's a record win for a president, as I mentioned, so congratulations to her. The key challenge I think she has, first and foremost, when you combine that with the super majority in Congress is perhaps calming people that that strength and power won't be used to undermine the private sector, financial markets and erode the institutional fabric. She sort of made a start at talking about those things.",

Now, as Gustavo was saying there, while the trading relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, one could argue is stronger than ever, the border between the two nations remains a challenge. Now, President Joe Biden is set to announce an executive order on immigration. Under the order, most migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally would be forced be deported without being able to apply for asylum. However, those crossing legally could still try to begin the process. MJ Lee joins us now from the White House. MJ, help me understand this. How different is this from the efforts made by the former administration, the Trump administration, and I think it was back in 2018, where they came up with a proposal that was then blocked by a federal court for violating asylum laws that grants people the right to ask for humanitarian protection. How is this going to be crafted or shaped to make it different from that that was then rejected?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, there's no question that this issue of border security is one of the most politicallyfraught issues here in Washington. And what sources briefed on this executive order has told CNN is that this is an announcement that could come as early as tomorrow. And essentially what it would allow the administration to do is shut down the U.S.-Mexico border to asylum seekers if the number of daily crossing surpasses a certain threshold. Now, importantly, we are told that unaccompanied children are expected to be exempt from this, but that would be very worrisome to a lot of immigration advocates who would argue that that actually would have the effect of incentivizing and encouraging some desperate families to actually send their children to travel to the border on their own. Now, you were asking about how exactly this would work. Well, the president would be using an authority that is known as the 212(f) section. This is a regulation, you might recall, was one that was used by Former President Donald Trump during his administration and at the time was widely criticized, including by a lot of Democrats. So, it is not hard to imagine President Biden being criticized for being hypocritical for leaning on this very authority. And of course, you really can't ignore the politics that are at play here. Border security is one of the issues that has been the toughest for President Biden and for Democrats to navigate. And they certainly have gotten a lot of pressure from all sides to do more, to get a better handle on the situation at the border. And the timing is, of course, really significant as well, given that we are in the middle of a presidential election, and we are only three and a half weeks away from that first presidential debate between President Biden and former President Trump. Now, the White House is not confirming that this announcement is coming tomorrow, but a spokesperson saying in a statement to CNN, as we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options, and we remain committed to taking action to address a broken immigration system. Now, the caveat that I should mention is that, of course the text could be changed, the final text before tomorrow, but we do know that when it does come, it is going to be a sweeping announcement from the president. He is certain to get a lot of backlash. But of course, he is hoping that he can also get some political points by making this announcement.",

      "sentences": "Yes, there's no question about it. The Israeli prime minister is juggling a lot as he contemplates a choice thathe may very well have to make -- a decision that he may have to make, and that is choosing between the survival of his government or this ceasefire and hostage deal, which was indeed crafted by his own government. And the reason for why he may have to make that choice is because we've watched over the course of the last couple of days since President Biden laid out the Israeli proposal an uproar from the far-right members of Netanyahu's governing coalition, namely Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both of them threatening to bolt from the government, to force its collapse should the Israeli prime minister move forward with this deal because they believe that it will lead to an end of the war. And that is indeed how President Biden framed this deal in his remarks on Friday. And that's why we've watched the Israeli prime minister, over the last couple of days, trying to reframe this agreement, insisting that Hamas will be destroyed before Israel agrees to any permanent ceasefire, it's difficult to see how that can happen if, indeed, the Israeli government does enter this deal. Because while it is not agreeing to a permanent ceasefire up front, you are effectively talking about going from a six-week ceasefire, one that could be prolonged for several weeks or even months, as long as negotiations are ongoing to enter a second stage where that permanent ceasefire would go into effect, and effectively makes it very hard for the war to start up again, which is what the Americans are banking on. And so, the Israeli prime minister has been downplaying this notion of ending the war. But in doing so, not only has he not been successful in convincing the far-right members of his government to support this deal, but at the same time, I'm now hearing from two Israeli sources familiar with the matter that there are concerns now in the Israeli government that the Israeli prime minister is effectively undermining this deal, undermining the way in which it's being sold to Hamas the ambiguity in the text about potentially leading to an end to the war by making these repeated public statements, insisting that he has not agreed to a long-term permanent ceasefire. And so, amid all of that, of course, the question now is whether or not Hamas will indeed agree to this proposal. We know that there is efforts being made by the United States, by Qatar, by the Egyptians to try and convince Hamas to take this deal. We will see whether or not it happens and then whether or not the Israeli government, the Israeli prime minister, stick with the proposal that they themselves put on the table. Julia.",

Oil fell sharply on where that OPEC plus member nations will begin phasing out those voluntary production cuts and begin adding more barrels back to the market later this year. It was another meme stock Monday on Wall Street, too, with GameStop shares on a wild ride, rising some 70 percent intraday after the investor known as Roaring Kitty said he's built up more than $110 million stake in the firm. GameStop shares finished well off their best levels, closing up 21 percent. I'd be interested to see if he took profit at any point as a result of those rises. Now, a mostly higher start to the trading month in Asia, Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea saw gains of well over 1 percent, as you can see that. India's stock market also rose more than 3 percent to record highs as exit polls showed a decisive victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP Party in the nation's just concluded national elections.

We also discuss alot its uncertainty and the potential risks like misinformation, ethics, privacy. Well, the International Monetary Fund is now highlighting different kind of A.I. risk that gets far less attention, if any, in fact. It's the risk that A.I. could exacerbate economic crises. How? Well, by creating large-scale disruptions to labor markets through automation, financial markets through robo advisers, and to supply chains that rely on algorithms using potentially obsolete or dated data. My next guest says to protect against an A.I. amplified downturn guardrails should be in place for decisions based on artificial intelligence. And incentives are needed to too protect the global human workforce. We'll explain. Gita Gopinath is the first deputy managing director at the IMF. She delivered her warning in a speech to the A.I. for Good Global Summit and joins us now. Welcome to the show. Thank you so much for your time. And it was a fascinating speech. I want to hone in on the labor market portion in particular, because plenty of the headlines about A.I. talk about coming for people's jobs, but they never really talk about the mechanism. And what you say in this speech was that when times are good, businesses do invest in automation technology, but they tend to keep their workers. Then a downturn hits.

What we've seen from previous waves of automation isthat the time that you actually see automation related job losses is in the first year of recessions. So, around 90 percent of automation related job losses since the mid-1980s has been literally in the first 12 months following a recession. And it is because, you know, of what you just said, which is that when the times are good and profits are high, firms invest in automation, including as they are doing right now in terms of artificial intelligence, and they hold on to workers because even if their value added is low, profits are good and they hold on to workers. But then you hit a downturn, and that's when they get going to cost cutting mode and lay off workers. And we saw that, the great financial crisis was an example of that. We saw one of the most severe forms of jobless recoveries that came after the great financial crisis, both in the U.S. and in Western Europe. Given that the scale of the job market that's now potentially exposed to A.I., including high skilled cognitive jobs, I think this is something we should be watchful of in terms of what might happen in another future downturn.",

However, what you are seeing is the use of much more sophisticated models. In fact, the sophistication is even -- surprises experts in terms of how it delivers predictions and delivers advice and where to invest. There's also much more client focused use of A.I. We have robo advisers that are now expected to manage a very large amount of assets. Now, again, in normal times, all of this is good. It can increase market efficiency, it can lead to better predictions, it can have greater financial inclusion, and all of that is great. But then you hit a downturn. And one thing we know is that no two downturns are the same and you can have very unusual patterns of reactions in the economy. And what we do know is that these A.I. models have been shown to perform poorly in the face of events like no other or events that they have not been trained on, and humans do much better in those circumstances. So, if we don't have the right checks and balances, we could see, you know, a big shift in asset trade moving towards more safe assets, you know, we could see a hurting away from riskier assets, asset price collapses that go along with it.

      "sentences": "Hi, Julia. It's good to see you. So, whale watching in Japan, like you said, is actually quite popular acrossthe country, and you see domestic tourists looking at these whales, you see international tourists as well, whereas whale meat, the meat that you eat, of course, is not very popular. In fact, consumption is at an all-time low. The fisheries agency in Japan estimates that only about a third of the world's fish 1,000 to 2,000 tons of well meat are eaten each year. And of course, after World War II, whale meat was a very popular source of protein due to the scarcity of food resources. But since then, popularity has really, really dipped because, of course, we eat chicken, we eat beef, we eat other sources of protein, not whale meat. And as you mentioned, internationally speaking, whaling has long been a controversial issue and Japan has been criticized for its long practice of whaling. But like you mentioned, the industry is trying to revitalize itself with the help of the Japanese government. I spoke to some industry insiders about how they were looking to boost consumption and change popular opinion. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Marvels of the deep-blue are to others a meal. Whaling in Japan is poised for a major comeback with the launch of this vessel.",

      "sentences": "This vast, new whaling mothership, the Kangei Maru, cost nearly $50 million to make. And it just goes to show how Japan is not onlycontinuing to hunt whales, but also is trying to revitalize this shrinking industry in a very, very a big way. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): We get a tour of the ship led by Hideki Tokoro, the president of Kyodo Senpaku, the whaling company that made it, who doesn't hide his fondness for whale meat and rejects the idea of changing his business model. HIDEKI TOKORO, PRESIDENT, KYODO SENPAKU (through translator): We will not switch to whale watching unless it is eating whale while whale watching, which sounds very chic. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): This ship hunts whales in Japan's territorial waters before getting served in the country's supermarkets, school lunches, food carts, and vending machines. But public appetite for whale meat just 1 percent of its former peak according to government data. It's still far from satisfactory for Tokoro. And with the launch of this expensive new boat, Tokoro says bills are piling up. But even if the new boat sinks him into bankruptcy Tokoro insists there is no Plan B. Internationally, whaling is criticized as a brutal and unsustainable practice that once pushed many of these mammals to the brink of extinction due to centuries of over hunting. And may still carry environmental consequences today.",

      "sentences": "The things that we're learning about whales is that they're not just consumers in this ecosystem, but by the fact of themconsuming so much food, they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment that actually helps to stimulate plant life growth. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But Japan's Fisheries Agency says there's nothing wrong with whaling. They claimed Japan should continue whaling because their research shows it sustainable and whale populations in Japanese waters are increasing allowing them to hunt even endangered species, even as whale meat's declining popularity is a regrettable trend for the agency. TAKAAKI SAKAMOTO, WHALING AFFAIRS OFFICE (through translator): Since we are promoting increased consumption of marine products, I think it is unfortunate that consumption is decreasing. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Japan's whaling industry attempting to revive its shrinking business, betting on a future that may never materialize. (END VIDEOTAPE) MONTGOMERY (on camera): So, you heard from the horse's mouth there, Julia, there is absolutely no plan to switch to the far more popular whale watching. Now, I also asked the Japanese government about any plans to return to the Southern Ocean, which is, of course, home to a very large sanctuary, given the fact that this new boat actually has the capacity to travel these long distances. Now, the government assured me that there were no plans to currently whale in the Southern Ocean. But of course, activists are very hesitant to believe Japan, given its poor track record when it comes to protecting these mammals. Julia,",
