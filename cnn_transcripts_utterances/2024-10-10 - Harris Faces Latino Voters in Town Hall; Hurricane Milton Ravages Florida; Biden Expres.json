I think what's important to remember is this: No matter how good of a salesman or how big of a hero is Barack Obama is to the Democratic Party, he can't sell crap. And the last three and a half years of economic policy from the Biden-Harris administration has been crap for the middle class. His bankrupt to the middle class is extended. He has forced them to take credits to pay for school supplies. There's no amount of selling, there's no amount of charm, there's no amount of charisma that can change the fact that Barack Obama cannot paint a pretty picture of what the American people have experienced over the last three years compared to what they experienced under President Trump. He can try to change it, he can try to lie, he can try to do whatever he can, but people look at their pocketbooks and they're nostalgic when they have more money.",

So, let me not even mention him. But Bryan or anyone else around the Trump campaign orbit can actually point to -- that shows that the economy was better under Trump than it is today. But the problem is, and this is what people point to, whether or not voters are feeling that, and that is a different -- that is a different question, and the pain that voters are going through. And we have to recall what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris inherited coming off of COVID, record job losses under Donald Trump, et cetera, the economy under Donald Trump in tatters. It's not -- it's not a new story when a Republican passed off an economy to a Democrat, as we've seen, but it is on the upswing. And Kamala Harris has to continue to push that message. She has to continue to meet voters where they are. And just to point, one quick point about Barack Obama, look, we have Barack Obama. We're sending out Hillary Clinton, we're sending out Bill Clinton, we're sending out Al Gore. There's literally no one, no one who has run for president or vice president of the United States outside of Sarah Palin that wants to stand beside Donald Trump. And that's indicative of the man that he is. And so, you can lampoon, you can say whatever you want, but this race is really going to come down to not vibes but character.

Nobody. Bryan, who loves Trump, doesn't believe he's capable of having that moment. It's just not in his belly wick. It's not something he's capable of doing. That level of empathy will go a long way in resonating with voters today versus what the chaos was of Donald Trump.

I mean, my father -- I'm not going to get into personal details, but Donald Trump has displayed moments of empathy for people. He has certainly displayed moments of empathy for the families of Afghanistan who died under President Biden with their failures there. He has expressed moments of empathy for soldiers who died under his watch when he had to go, you know, and meet them -- and meet them at the military bases. He has explained empathy for families who've lost, you know, precious family members to illegal aliens who shouldn't be in this country.So, listen, I think we all get comfortable insulting President Trump and we all feel good about it, but you sort of lose those moments that actually do exist. You know, there has been plenty of moments of empathy during Donald Trump's administration. We just choose to ignore it because it's easier to insult him. But when you do that, you sort of lose connective tissue. And Bakari is right, that connective tissue matters. And so, when he's having that connective moment with people and you have other people saying those things don't exist, you've lost those people forever because they experienced empathy from President Trump and people are seeing it, and it has an impact. COATES:  Bryan, I don't actually hear Bakari, and he can speak for himself on this issue, relishing at an insult. I hear about the comparison and contrasting between what is the consistent message of either compassion or empathy that can be undermined by comments that are wholly void of that. When you're talking about migrants who are legally in this country and being accused of horrific things, I think that's the balance people are trying to strike. But I want to go back to the former president of the United States, if we can, because Obama is taking Black men to task for hesitation over supporting Harris during an unannounced stop today in Pittsburgh. I'll read for you one of the things he said. He says, part of it makes me think that you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president. He says that Trump is -- going to Trump is not acceptable. I wonder, Bakari, from your perspective, will this message resonate with Black men? One, do you think that he has his thump appropriately on the polls as to why some are reluctant to support Harris?",

I agree that it's unlikely that Donald Trump is winning Black men, but certainly, Donald Trump doesn't have to win Black men, just do better than expectations. Well, Barack Obama is an unbelievably talented political communicator. I would not claim to have my finger on the pulse of African-American men as a voter group more than Barack Obama. I do think that message is a little curious. It's hard to persuade a group of voters to do what you want them to do by telling them you think that there's something going on that they believe that is bad and, therefore, they should stop believing it. I jus -- something about that message strikes me as a little bit odd.

I can show you a little bit of what we've been seeing. This homeowner, we understand, these are their trees that are down in the front yard. From Helene, there weren't any trees that fell here on Siesta Key. So, the winds from Hurricane Milton brought those trees down. And then you have this flower pot that's here at the planter, that's here in front of the gate. That certainly wasn't there beforehand. And let me just take you across the street here. There is, of course, standing water throughout Siesta Key. But on this house here, we understand that the resident had just moved here a month ago from Texas, and then they experienced Hurricane Helene a couple weeks ago, and their front windows got blown out from Hurricane Milton just yesterday. And now, all of this debris that's in their yard, that was all stacked up very nicely here at the curb after Helene. And this is what Milton did to it. It threw mattresses airborne, made them airborne. They're out in the lawn there. There are suitcases scattered around. There are personal photos. There's a television on the ground. Again, all of this was here from Helene and stacked up. So, when we came in here today, I could show you some video as we drove through the area just making our entrance to Siesta Key, this is what we saw all over the place. There were roads that were blocked, streets that you couldn't even get down, there was standing water everywhere. One woman told us she had fish from the storm surge in her backyard. There were trees down. We saw a tree that was more than 100 years old. We talked to the resident, the owner of that home, who was so upset to have lost such a beautiful tree. But incredibly, their home was still standing. But I can tell you, Laura, talking to these people, they are frustrated, they are angry, they are in tears, they are tired of watching the weather.
