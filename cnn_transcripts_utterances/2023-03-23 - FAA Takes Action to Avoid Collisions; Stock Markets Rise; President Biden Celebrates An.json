I'm Brianna Keilar in Washington, and we're following major developments in multiple criminal investigations surrounding former President Trump.First, in Manhattan, we have learned that the grand jury investigating the hush money scheme will not be voting on a potential indictment today. They are meeting today. They are not planning, though, to discuss Trump. The Manhattan DA's office now hitting back at House Republicans, accusing them of launching an unprecedented inquiry into a pending local prosecution. And, in a separate case, this is some video here of Trump defense attorney Evan Corcoran arriving at federal court this morning. He's there for a sealed hearing on whether Mike Pence will have to testify before a grand jury investigating Trump's role on January 6. But, tomorrow, Corcoran will face another grand jury as a witness. This comes after an appeals court quickly ruled Corcoran can no longer invoke attorney-client privilege in Trump's classified documents case. We have reporters on the scene in New York and in Washington. First to CNN's Kara Scannell, who is outside the courthouse in Manhattan. Kara, what's going on with the grand jury there?",

Now, the grand jury can hear multiple cases at one time. So it's notunusual that they would be meeting and not hearing this case. But, as we have been reporting, this investigation is very much ongoing, and the grand jury will again hear testimony related to the Trump-related investigation Monday. And sources tell us that the district attorney's office is weighing whether they should bring in at least one other witness. Now, other sources say that they're debating whether that -- one of those witnesses would be Michael Cohen. He, of course, is at the center of the hush money payments. These are all indications that the grand jury work isn't done yet. And we're waiting for Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg to make a decision, the unprecedented decision, of whether to seek an indictment of a former president -- Brianna.",

The letter only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day, and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene. Neither fact is a legitimate basis for congressional inquiry.\" So, they're putting this squarely on the congressmen, saying that they're doing this at the behest of Donald Trump and calling out Trump's false claims that he would have been arrested on Tuesday -- Brianna.",

They want to know what happened with Evan Corcoran, what he heard, what he said to Trump, what Trump said to him. And we did get word from the appeals court yesterday. We don't have the full set of filings of what's going on here. It's all under seal. But we were able to see that the appeals court in D.C. in this courthouse ruled that Evan Corcoran would have to turn over documents to the special counsel investigation, as well as appear before the grand jury. Again, we expect him to come tomorrow. And he's been pretty busy this week, not just with that, but he was just here at this courthouse taking part in another hearing, sealed hearing, before the chief judge in the separate criminal investigation into January 6 that he was arguing alongside other lawyers for Donald Trump about Mike Pence's testimony, whether he can be having certain things blocked when he may go before the grand jury as well under a subpoena.

It's a little tone of humor there, because they're saying, well, to extent you're asking about federal funds being used here, we will write you a separate letter to let you know how the federal funds are being used, because that's the barely slightest hope they have of jurisdiction over this.",

What is their thinking here? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  That's right, Brianna. Democrats at large, as well as President Biden in the White, House and the White House, writ large, they don't want to be seen as trying to interfere at all in these investigations, that whether it's the investigation in New York or the DOJ's investigations regarding classified documents or January 6 and the -- and Trump's efforts to protect to overturn the election results. They don't want to touch it at all, because they want to show that these are independent investigations, which they are. Republicans, on the other hand, particularly a growing number within the House GOP, have decided to really send a signal with these investigations, which right now are just based solely off of Trump's comments earlier this week, which is that if you investigate or try to hold the former president accountable for potential wrongdoings and criminal acts, then the House GOP is going to investigate those investigators.",

But from the reporting that they may put in other witnesses, that could be that they need to decide who to put in and to prepare the witnesses. Now, personally, I hope that they don't put in too more -- too many more witnesses, because the grand jury is not the final place to resolve the case. You're really just either using it for probable cause to charge, or the DA is using it kind of proactively to lock in testimony that they want to know about ahead of time, either defensively, if it's a defense witness, or affirmatively, to make sure their own witnesses are solid. Certainly, I don't feel they need any more testimony from Michael Cohen. He's already testified so much. And it can look like a sign of weakness to put him in to rebut something Costello said, because it gives the grand jurors the idea perhaps that the DA thinks there's an issue, a real issue, that Costello raised.",

I mean, there are -- there is a segment of Republican leaders, more, I would say, in the Senate than in the House, that don't want to be talking about this, that also wants to be seen as impartial and not touching this. House Republicans and the leaders there, though, have taken a very different track. You saw immediately after Trump tweeted about the fact that he thought he was going to be arrested that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy came to his defense, as did the chairman, Jim Jordan, who is saying he's going to investigate Alvin Bragg and try to discredit this potential -- this investigation and the potential charges.

Everybody deserves a little peace of mind for things they can't control. That's why my administration has focused intensely on building on the progress of the Affordable Care Act, getting more people affordable insurance, lowering prescription drug prices, giving families more breathing room. We have passed historic laws to get that done. And now we're moving quickly to implement them, so people can feel the effects in their everyday lives. The Affordable Health Care Act expanded Medicaid to cover an additional 20 million people. Before it was passed, 20 fewer million -- 20 million people -- fewer people had insurance. So, it expanded to cover 20 million more people on Medicaid. That means more cancers detected early, more mental health treatment available, less medical debt and fewer evictions. I signed the American Rescue Plan, which went further and allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to new moms for up to one year after they gave birth, instead of only for 60 days. You remember, Gov, what that did, what you guys did; 36 states and counting, and now we're extending to a full-year coverage. (APPLAUSE)",

We should note that, at the time being, for now, we know these are just potentials. This is not something that China has been seen to do. But there is serious concern.
