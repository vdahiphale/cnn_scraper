And the heat: What's behind it, where it is worse, and the places that could soon set all-time records. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. Twelve-and-a-half years ago, the bodies of four people were found over several days buried near a remote beach on New York's Long Island. All four were women, murdered wrapped in burlap. They were eventually identified as Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Maureen Brainerd- Barnes,  and Amber Lynn Costello and they were not the only ones. In the year that followed, investigators will uncover seven more sets of human remains across two Long Island counties, bringing the total to 11. But there were few clues. The case went cold. No arrests were made, until now. Tonight, the remarkable story of how authorities came first to suspect and then build a six-count murder case against a 59-year-old married architect with two children of his own and a home in a quiet Long Island neighborhood. CNN's Miguel Marquez joins us now from outside the suspect's home -- Miguel.",

I mean, it seems like that profile seems to certainly fit this suspect. How common is it for serial killers to have a spouse, to have a family, to have kids? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT PROFILER:   Well, we have many cases where these serial killers have families and they have children and they have jobs that they've held down for years. And it is this ability to live a normal lifestyle when they're not out killing that allows them to fly under the radar screen for years. So we used to have a theory in the unit that if some cases go unsolved for a long time, we're probably looking for someone that's living that prosocial life and appears to be very normal to friends, neighbors, and family members.",

He was trying to locate members of the victim's families, taunting -- we know at least one family member victim was contacted by someone claiming to be the killer.I mean, if these were the same person, what drives that sort of compulsion? O'TOOLE:   Well, that's the right word to use that those are compulsions, and one of the things, one of the motivations that probably drives that is he has tried to monitor the investigation and trying to figure out exactly what's going on and then another reason to do it is to enable him to relive the murder itself. And so if he did target one family member from one of the victims, and continually called that person that may have been because that particular victim was his favorite victim. I've done interviews with these serial killers, and they will tell you, I have a favorite victim and they obsess on that one victim, even long after they are dead.",

Like favorite in terms of who that person was, or how the killing went down?O'TOOLE:   That is defined by them. So for example, a favorite victim could be someone that fought back and didn't die quickly enough. So the serial killer liked that. Another definition of a favorite victim could be the manner in which he killed her, and he is reliving that more really enthusiastically than some of the other victims. So it really depends on what his definition is, but I've heard them say that on a number of occasions, \"I had a favorite victim.\" So I don't know if that's the case here and why he targeted that one family, but it also seems to blend into the behavior at the crime scene. This individual seems to have sexually sadistic tendencies and one of the things that oftentimes kind of underpins making phone calls into a victim's family, which quite frankly is really high risk is that they love to hear the fear in the family's voice, and the sadness and the upset and the anger. So that response they get from the family member can be actually sexually arousing to the serial killer.   COOPER:   Wow. And, I mean, do you think this -- if this is the correct suspect, do you think he may have been involved with other killings? O'TOOLE:   Yes, I do. I do. And I say that for a couple of reasons having worked many, many serial murder cases, this is not behavior that starts at 40 years of age. This is behavior we generally see beginning in about late teens or early 20s and we always look for practice murderers when we're dealing with a serial sexual killers. Those are the murders that they commit prior to becoming a serial killer, where they decide on what weapon they want to use, who is their victim going to be? How do they approach the victim? What do they say? So they have a period of maybe years of practice until they get it down to the point where now, it is exactly the way they want it to be. So I think that there are other murderers out there, and I think eventually, they will hopefully find most of them maybe not all, but that's what we say, what is the full extent of this person's lethality because we are probably only looking at a part of it right now.",

They made it such that they could only get four Democrats who, by the way, you know, there were four Republicans who voted no.So that sort of evened itself out. This was not a bipartisan bill. And I think you're right, he wanted it not to be a bipartisan bill. And that is the issue with Team Extreme of the Republican Party. They're not interested in trying to pass things. They're not interested in trying to govern. They're not interested in getting that raised for service members. Otherwise, they wouldn't have passed a bill that is not going to pass in the Senate.
