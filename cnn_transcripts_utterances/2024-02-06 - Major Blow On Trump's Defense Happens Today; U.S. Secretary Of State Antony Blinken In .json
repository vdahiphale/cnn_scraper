      "sentences": "All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. My colleague, Bianna Golodryga, is off today. You areindeed watching \"One World\". A U.S. appeals court has ruled on one of the major constitutional issues surrounding the trials of Donald Trump. A three-judge panel unanimously agreed that Donald Trump is not immune -- that he is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed in his bid to reverse the 2020 election results. It is a major blow to Donald Trump's defense. In that case, the former President has argued that his conduct was part of his official duties as President. But the judges said, and I want to read for you, quote, \"For the purposes of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump with all the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as president, no longer protects him against this prosecution. Let's bring in CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz for more on this. I mean, Donald Trump has really hammered home this argument for quite some time, this idea that he was immune just in terms of actions he took while he was in office, while he was President. Obviously, these judges are disagreeing. They're saying that is not the case. Just walk us through Donald Trump's appeals options at this point, Katelyn.",

      "sentences": "Well, Zain, there is going to be a very quick amount of action that happens now because ofthe way that this D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel has set this up for the days ahead in six days. That's the amount of time that Donald Trump has to get the Supreme Court essentially to intervene and put everything on hold again or else this case goes back into the hands of the trial court and gets headed toward trial. There was supposed to be a trial in March that's not on the calendar because of these appeals in this case. But what happened here today is significant on so many fronts, first and foremost, that it does put in place a schedule where Donald Trump is going to have to get relief from higher courts very, very fast, does not have a huge amount of options to do that, and is facing what amounts to a losing battle here, meaning that it's very possible yet again that we could see a trial of the former President about what he did after the 2020 election happening very quickly and potentially even this year before the presidential election. That is not what Donald Trump wants to happen. He wants to hold off the trial, but it could happen. And Zain, the other thing here to note is what's so significant about this opinion today from this Appeals Court is that they are striking down every single thing. They're hitting back at every single thing Donald Trump and his legal team was arguing and saying, you can be tried in court. It's the responsibility of the court to look at a former President accused of crimes and potentially hold those trials. And the former President or the President himself is not above the law, cannot intentionally violate the laws of the U.S. Constitution and the American government. Zain.",

      "sentences": "Right. So, the first thing to note is that it was two Democratic appointees and one Republican appointee to the court. They were unanimous.They issued what's called a per curiam opinion. That's an unsigned opinion for the court. Sometimes that's done to, you know, emphasize that this is from all the judges. Sometimes it's done also because things are on a quick time frame and they all work together on drafting the opinion. It is unequivocal in stating that no one is above the law, including a President or a former President. We've never had a situation before where a President is claimed. He's essentially absolutely immune, can do any criminal activity that he wants. And unless he's impeached for it, he can't be criminally convicted. It was a bold and very weak theory. So I'm really unsurprised by the fact that it was rejected. What did surprise me was the quick timeframe. Everyone understands that this could well be what determines whether or not Trump can win the election, whether or not he's going to be convicted of these crimes. And so, this fast tracks the case to potentially get back to the trial court. And it does so in a way that underlines the idea that no person is above.",

So, the court is going to get this stay petition probably by Monday afternoon. It's going to get a response from the government. And within a few weeks, we should know the court's going to have really two options. Number one, it's going to put the trial on hold until for months, which probably essentially means there will be no trial before the election, or they're going to reject this idea of a stay. They're going to let this thing go to trial. If it goes to trial and Trump is convicted, he can then appeal and those appeals can take, potentially, years. But on the -- so he would not go to jail if he, very likely, even if he's convicted. But what it does mean is this decision that the Supreme Court's going to make in the next few weeks, likely, is going to be the one that's going to determine whether we get this trial or not. If he loses there, he can go to the Court of Appeals and ask for something called an -- petition to have the entire D.C. Circuit hear the case. But if he does that, unless the D.C.

The Colorado Supreme Court said he can't be on the ballot because under Section Three of the 14th Amendment, he's disqualified because he engaged in insurrection. Donald Trump then brought that case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court fast-tracked that case. They held briefing over a matter of weeks. And the oral argument on Thursday will pit those voters in Colorado who are trying to get Trump off the ballot against Trump's lawyers. The state of Colorado is also going to be weighing in there on its interests in this case. There's going to be hours of arguments. And I expect that we will get a decision relatively soon from the Supreme Court, especially if they're going to disqualify him.

      "sentences": "Yeah, and it's all about hostages as well, isn't it? And I think this really frames the dayfor Secretary Blinken in Cairo and in Doha, the capitals of the main two interlocutors, as you were saying, with Hamas. Both the Qataris deal with Hamas and the Egyptians. And it was notable when he was in Egypt that Secretary Blinken met also with the head of Egyptian intelligence, who was part of that forum over a week ago that put together the proposal with the Mossad chief here, the CIA chief and the Qatari prime minister, that proposal about a ceasefire and prisoner release and hostage release and all those details that Hamas has yet to actually respond to. But I think it is significant that he did spend time talking to the person in the Egyptian government who perhaps has the most understanding of where Hamas is thinking is at the moment. If anyone can, he's the person, the head of intelligence there who would have best access to that. Making comments, Secretary Blinken, in both Egypt and Qatar actually, according to his press secretary, that there should be no forced removal of Palestinians from Gaza. This is a reaffirmation of what the Secretary of State has said many times. The foreign underscores fears that Palestinians could be forced because of the situation, to leave Gaza. But central to it all, trying to get that ceasefire -- trying to get that ceasefire, trying to get that hostage release, thanking the Egyptians, of course, for all their help, getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying more needs to be done. And the same meeting with the Qataris today. It's the same effort to try to find a way to shift the dial on this impasse over how long we assume this is the impasse because we don't actually have accurate details, but this is what we best understand at the moment, that the impasse is over. Hamas wanting all its prisoners from Israeli jails freed, and that seems to be a huge stumbling block for Prime Minister Netanyahu's government. And also, Hamas wants a complete ceasefire and a complete pullout of Israeli forces from Gaza, and that seems to be an impasse, as well. So, the proposition on their table is for a shorter truce, perhaps different numbers of prisoners released -- we don't know. But that's where things are on that front. But it's the humanitarian effort, as well. And you highlighted his visit to Saudi Arabia just yesterday. What to do the day the ceasefire does come? Ramp up humanitarian effort. There needs to be an administration for Gaza. There needs to be a revamped Palestinian authority. All of these issues are going to need regional buy-in. So that is also the subtext of what Secretary Blinken is trying to achieve here.",

One that we've justbeen discussing is, of course, the impeachment vote. That is not only historic, but Democrats will tell you that it is extremely politically motivated. You also have the Senate border deal, as well, that is pretty much on the brink of death at this point in time. We know that President Biden is set to speak any moment now.

      "sentences": "Well, Zain, we expect President Biden to make the case for that bipartisan border deal as we haveseen the White House increasingly try to put the onus on Republicans in this debate. The White House and Democrats have really been quite eager to go on offense on immigration at a time when that issue is one that is at top of voters' minds heading into the 2024 election and one where voters have pessimistic views of President Biden's handling of the issue. Now, if you remember, when this debate first started, Republicans had insisted that any aid for Ukraine must be paired with changes to border policy. But now, as they've been presented with that bipartisan proposal, Republicans in the Senate and House have started to balk. It's unclear whether the measure would be able to advance with a key test vote tomorrow over in the Senate. And on the House side, House Speaker Mike Johnson has declared the bill dead on arrival. This all comes as former President Donald Trump has really lobbied hard against the bill. And it really points to not just one of the challenges the White House has, but also a messaging opportunity that the White House has going forward. Their argument here is that they've presented policy changes to try to address the crisis at the U.S. southern border, but so far they argue it's Republicans who are blocking that from moving forward. I think another item to watch today is to see how the president speaks about the $60 billion of aid that he wants to secure for Ukraine. Just moments ago, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, John Kirby, said that not passing this bill will prevent the U.S. from offering further security assistance to Ukraine, and ultimately that will hinder Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield. So, the President, at this time, really trying to balance these two issues of the border, trying to get that funding for Ukraine. We've also heard House Speaker Mike Johnson wants to hold a stand-alone vote on aid for Israel. That is something that the White House has said President Biden would veto, because they believe that the path forward for this is still that bipartisan deal, which includes border policy changes, as well as aid for Ukraine and Israel. And on that impeachment vote facing Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the White House offered a forceful defense of the Homeland Security Secretary, as they expressed their strong opposition to the resolution. At this time, it's unclear whether that will, in fact, past the House, but there are clearly some very major lines happening in the immigration debate, not just with that border policy deal, but also this House attempt to impeach Mayorkas today.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think, let's also pick up on the significance of this moment as well. Because as we wentinto that press conference, the State Department was briefing -- as they have been briefing since Secretary Blinken began this trip, that the ball was in Hamas' court. Now it's been in their court for over a week. That's what the State Department was saying until half an hour ago. That was the State Department's line on this. So Hamas has very clearly chosen this moment, it appears from what we're being told, to now release their response when Secretary Blinken is on the eve, and will be landing here actually in Israel, expected later tonight, is on the eve of his meetings with the Israeli Prime Minister. So, I get a sense here that Hamas has made a point of the timing. Again, you're right, we don't know the details, but it's significant because the ball is now back in Israel's court to use the parlance that the State Department has been using. What did we hear from the Qatari Prime Minister? He said that the response had been positive. He hinted that it wasn't a straight up yes, so we know that there are still issues there. And he said it had been passed on to the Israeli government. What did we hear from Secretary Blinken? He said, well, we've just heard from Hamas this evening their response to the offer that was put forward over a week ago now. And he said, I'll be discussing that with the Israelis tomorrow. And this is what we understand now will be an important part of the discussions, because there will be something on the table. What have been the sticking points? Hamas has held the position since last weekend, since there's sort of been a public understanding that what is acceptable to Israel, to Qatar, to the United States, to Egypt, is an offer that doesn't have a permanent ceasefire, which is what Hamas wants, which doesn't talk about a withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, which is what Hamas wants, which doesn't get into the specificity of the exchange for Hamas and Palestinian prisoners who are in Israeli jails, which has been a central part of what Hamas wants. They want a serious discussion about it, and the understanding is they want big numbers of their prisoners released for, particularly for IDF troops who are held hostage. So, I think these still seem to be the fundamental gaps. Are we talking about a four week, six week, eight week truce, which is sort of the ballpark of where the conversation has been? Or are we talking about a permanent ceasefire, which Hamas wants, which Prime Minister Netanyahu's right wing elements in his government has said, that won't work. If you go that route, we'll collapse the government. So, I think that's where we are. But I think the timing here, none of this is coincidental. Hamas has clearly chosen this moment, this precise moment, to make their response clear. And this is now front and center of Secretary Blinken's visit here with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow.",

A decision that could have immensepolitical implications for this year's U.S. presidential election. The Federal Appeals Court has flatly rejected Donald Trump's claims that he cannot be prosecuted for charges that he plotted to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The three-judge panel unanimously ruled that Trump is not immune from criminal prosecution. Trump's legal team has now responded saying, quote, \"If immunity is not granted to a President, every future President who leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party. Without complete immunity, a President of the United States would not be able to properly function. Prosecuting a president for official acts violates the constitution and threatens the bedrock of our Republic.\" Larry Sabato -- Larry Sabato, excuse me, the director for the Center of Politics at the University of Virginia joins us live now from Charlottesville.

And I can see why. I think he should be taken off. But I can see why they don't want to enrage his base even further and take him off the ballot. Because the way to deal with Trump, if he's going to be defeated, is to have him defeated at the ballot box. If the people do it and it's accepted as a legitimate result, and who knows what Trump will say, but if it's accepted as legitimate, then it will have a major impact on the society moving forward.
