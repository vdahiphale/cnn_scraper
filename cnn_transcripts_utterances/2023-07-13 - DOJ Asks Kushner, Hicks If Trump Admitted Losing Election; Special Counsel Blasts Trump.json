Tonight, we are learning the special counsel is asking that very question to his inner circle. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, along with close aide Hope Hicks, they have not testified before the grand jury in Jack Smith's investigation of efforts to overturn the election. And by asking that question, it might show that prosecutors are interested in something in particular, whether Trump acted with a corrupt intent, what he knew, when he knew it, and how he was acting on it. Now, Kushner, according to The New York Times' reporting, testified that he believed Trump truly believed the election was stolen. Now, I should note, of course, that that contradicts what other witnesses have claimed, including what Cassidy Hutchinson said that Mark Meadows told her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Two, there is opportunity here if it gets delayed beyond and he ends up winning an election, winning the primary, and then winning the election, that creates an opportunity. He has already said in the past that he has the power to pardon himself. I'm sure that that is probably in the back of his mind if he is, in fact, convicted. And, lastly, if it happens after the fact and he ends up -- in his mind, if he ends up being president, he is then in charge of the Justice Department once again. So, I think they're looking to create opportunities and stretch this thing out.That being said, I think the judge in this case probably feels a little stung by some of her earlier decisions, likely wants to appear impartial on this thing, wants to make a decision that is in the best decision of the country on this thing.

Sometime during the Trump administration, they decided to put more of these cubbies on the outside of the situation room to try to encourage people to not bring them into the SCIF, even accidentally. It was reinforced after Omarosa was caught using a recording device in the situation room to record, I think, when she was being told that she was going to be fired. So, they have been there for several years and the idea is people should be voluntarily be putting them in these lockers to avoid accident having a phone in a secure space, which can be a dangerous thing.

Medical Examiner says that she died from a small bowel obstruction, which was caused by complications from weight- loss surgery that she had years ago.Joining me now to talk about more of this is CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, I'm so glad you are here. It is so sad to think about this happening to anyone, but the notion of someone dying of obstruction of the small intestine might sound very surprising to people. In fact, the deputy medical examiner in this case said that it was likely related to bariatric surgery that she had years ago. What do you know about this sort of condition and potential even side effect? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  There are certain parts of this, what happened to Lisa Marie Presley, that sound pretty common. We know the sort of thing can happen after a previous operation and some things that are more unusual. Let me sort of talk you through it. What we know is that she had an operation years ago. After you have an operation on your abdomen, you can develop scar tissue. These are called adhesions inside the abdomen. And over time, they can develop and actually cause pressure and blockages, sort of blocking off part of the small intestine. And someone might have pain intermittently. Those blockages may come and go. And it sounds like maybe she had pain off and on. Certainly, the morning that she died, she had significant enough pain that she was taken to the hospital. She was unresponsive, and subsequently, had died. Now, we are getting the official cause of death, which they say was due to this strangulation of the small bowel. So, think about the scar tissue sort of pushing on the small bowel, and that part of that small bowel not really getting adequate blood flow and becoming completely blocked. That is what they are saying ultimately led to her dying. The first part of that, developing the scar tissue, developing the adhesions after the operation, again, that is something that happens, Laura. And people sometimes have to have repeat operations to sort of lift up that scar tissue. Dying of this, though, is a bit more unusual. It could be that the small bowel actually opens up, that strangulated part opens up and someone develops a severe infection, sepsis. That could be the problem. Sometimes just the necrosis, the dead tissue of that small bowel, that can lead to someone dying. But, again, you know, I want to be clear that that is unusual. If someone goes to the hospital, oftentimes, they can have this treated. It sounds like by the time she got to the hospital, it was so far along that they simply couldn't do anything for her.",

And it sounds like what the medical examiner is saying is that did not happen in this case.On the other hand though, medications like opiates, if you have a small bowel problem, they slow down the motility and the movement of the small bowel even more so. So was it the cause of death? No. I think that's what the medical examiner is saying. Could it make things worse in a situation like this? Perhaps, she's having pain. She takes opiates, that's the wrong thing to take when you have a small bowel obstruction because it can actually make that problem worse.",

Wolf joins me in a moment, but first listen to President Biden's take. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The idea that we don't have a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the idea that we have all these, all these promotions that are in abeyance right now, that we don't know what's going to happen, the idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what in fact, as a domestic social debate on social issues, is bizarre.

What a complex environment this is, you know, around the world, quite frankly. We see the tough things that we're dealing within -- here in Europe as we continue to provide support to Ukraine in its efforts to defend its sovereign territory. We're working hard to make sure we keep the right balance in the Indo-Pacific and strengthen our alliances. And we need leaders to be able to do that. This is a national security issue.

Earlier today, and I like to think that as a result of playing that excerpt here on CNN, the two men, Tuberville and Secretary Austin, did have a phone conversation, and they began a little dialogue on what to do, and maybe they could resolve this. But I like to think that exchange that I had with Secretary Austin played a role in convincing Tuberville to go ahead and have this conversation with Secretary Austin, maybe they can resolve this. It is so important. You can't imagine what it would be like if they held up the confirmation of a new commandant, for example, for the U.S. Marine Corps. It would have very, very significant developments. And let's see what happens. Hopefully they can work this out.",

Even though if you listen to the original version of \"Fast Car.\" Luke didn't change very much.
