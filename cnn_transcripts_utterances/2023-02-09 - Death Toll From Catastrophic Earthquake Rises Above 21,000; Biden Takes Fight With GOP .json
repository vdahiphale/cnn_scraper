Stand by for live reports on the catastrophic distraction in Turkey and in Syria and the increasingly desperate search for survivors.Also tonight, President Biden takes his new fight with the Republicans over social security and Medicare to Florida. He's laying more groundwork for his expected re-election bid on the turf of Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. And Biden administration officials now reveal new evidence that a massive Chinese balloon was spying on the United States, saying it was capable of monitoring secret communications and gathering intelligence. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's go right to the scene of that massive earthquake where rescue and recovery teams are working into the night. They're finding far more bodies than survivors three days after the first powerful tremor hit. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Salma Abdelaziz are on the ground for us in Turkey, covering the destruction there and in Syria. First to you Jomana, tell us what's happening where you are in Southern Turkey.",

People are walking the streets dazed, confused, just really struggling to process what's happened to them, to their city, and to this country.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice over):  Endless lines on the road to Iskenderun, a devastated city's crying for help answered by a nation in shock, united in pain. These men tell us they drove more than eight hours carrying diapers, water, and bread, whatever they can do to help strangers who need all they can get. Destruction in every corner of the city, no building spared Mother Nature's wrath. So, even in this part of the city where buildings are still standing, you can see that there are cracks all over these buildings. They've sustained damage, so we are going to have to walk through here really fast. We don't know how stable these structures are right now.

Just six trucks with a little bit of equipment to help shelter people, but they need so much more help. Take a look at their plight.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice over):  A rescue worker sings to little Mina, talks and shares stories with her. He goes on and on, chatting about anything to distract her from the horrifying reality that she's being extracted from the ruins of her home. Mina is eventually pulled out safely. Her family has also survived, rescued by members of the White Helmets, a group of first responders seen as heroes in this rebel-held enclave of Syria. Nearly 12 years of war has made the group experts on the grim task of retrieving people from collapsed buildings. Syrians living in opposition-controlled areas battered by the government of President Bashar al-Assad and feeling neglected by the world have come to depend on only themselves, even in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. The result is catastrophic. Here, there's a shortage of everything, even body bags. This man has arrived with just one bag to hold all four of his dead relatives. We hope that countries would come to our rescue, he says, but there was only our community that came to help us, nobody else. We have no one to help us. And for the thousands of wounded pulled out of the rubble, they face a health care system on the brink. Another volunteer group here is the Syrian American Medical Society, doing its best to provide care on the ground. But equipment and supplies are scarce and countless deaths, they warn, could be prevented if they could just get the basics. And for those survivors, unharmed but made homeless, vehicles are now shelter, sidewalks are beds, shivering in olive groves is all that's left, a crisis within a crisis that's left those with nothing somehow with even less. (END VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (on camera):  Unimaginable suffering there in Syria, Wolf. Absolutely help can't come soon enough. But I want to take you to where I am here in Istanbul. I know you hear people clapping. We're in a huge aid center, this hangar that's been turned into an aid center. They clap every time they're able to load a truck. Let me just walk you through this. You have this chain of humans, their just carrying these boxes along. And if you just follow me through here, they're loading them up into those trucks over there. They're trying to work as quickly as they possibly can. They know that every single second counts, that people are depending on them to help. And then take a look over here, just at the enormous amount of donations they had. Everything you are looking at here, Wolf, we've talked about international aid, but everything you are looking at here is for Turks from Turks, individuals, businesses, families, people simply wanting to help out. There's a true sense of community here, a true sense of solidarity, everyone wanting to feel like they can do something for those on the ground who are suffering. If you speak to any of these volunteers, some of them have families, some of them have relatives, and they've told us, I couldn't just sit at home and do nothing. I had to come. I had to help out.",

NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Absolutely. And, listen, you mentioned Mitch McConnell, this is what he was nervous about in 2022 when Rick Scott rolled out this plan. Even back in 2022, Biden was making an issue of it. He went to Florida. He passed out Rick Scott's 12-point plan to a crowd there and was highlighting this idea that Rick Scott had of essentially putting Medicare and social security up on the table, and up for grabs, every five years, and having it be reauthorize. I think the problem that Republicans have on this is they have talked about changing social security, raising the retirement age, same with Medicare, privatizing social security. So, it's kind of an easy attack because we've been here over many years with Republicans and social security in these very popular entitlement programs. So, I think it puts Biden in a good position not only going into 2024 but going into these debt ceiling negotiations as well because you have Republicans repeatedly saying this is not what we want to do, this is not what we want to do, but if you're explaining, you're sort of losing, I think.",

And so he's always been in this very, very, I think, tenuous position, because he doesn't really quite have a base of support within the Republican Party without Donald Trump, who, really, beginning on January 6th, really started to hammer him and undermine him politically, and that will only keep going.",

And I think it's important to underscore the fact that Mike Pence's team, those around him, and by every account, those around him, they have participated in the legal processes that have played out around it.So, you look at the case down in Georgia. You saw his aides kind of going in there. You've seen them going in and out of courthouses here in Washington, D.C. From a political perspective, a subpoena was absolutely required to get him to turn over any of this information. There were no circumstances under which that was going to happen voluntarily, for all of the political reasons that David Chalian laid out. But that doesn't mean his team is not committed to making sure that justice is played out here. And I just think it's important to think about that, because they obviously are making a very complicated set of political calculations right now, to David's set of excellent points. However, their lives were all put in danger on that day, and the memory of that has not gone away, and the memory of what Trump did or didn't do is also extraordinarily fresh. And when you think about how the nominating contest is going to play out, the results of these probes matters quite a bit for Trump's bid to become president of the United States again. And I think we have many, many questions about whether a legal recourse is something that's going to keep him out of the Oval Office again. But if you're Mike Pence, if you're other Republicans, I mean, there have been, let me tell you, a lot of Republicans I've talked to in Washington who will say, it would be great if the courts would get rid of this guy for us. We want to get rid of him, but we can't from a political perspective.",

Give us a sense, Kaitlan, of what's going on right now and what you're learning from your various sources. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENTAnd this is the special counsel, Jack Smith, who's investigating two things. To be clear, he's also investigating the classified documents that former President Trump took with him to Mar-a-Lago, but he's also investigating Trump and his role in January 6th and what that looked like. And so, that is why it makes sense kind of, that Pence is involved in this and that he would be subpoenaed in this, because obviously, he's closely involved. And so, I'm told that Jack Smith's office is seeking documents and testimony related to January 6th, and they want to hear from Pence, personally. They want him to testify about the interactions he had with Trump, you know, leading up to the election, leading up to January 6th, potentially even after that. And so, I just heard Jessica talking about Pence's book and how maybe that could have a factor in what DOJ is trying to learn from him, because obviously, conversations between a vice president and a president are typically closely guarded, potentially protected. We'll see what argument Pence's attorney tries to make about how guarded those conversations are and whether or not he can be subpoenaed to testify about those conversations in particular. But certainly, it's notable that the vice president -- the former vice president has been subpoenaed by the special counsel.",

You know, Pence, who is often someone who did not break with Trump ever when he was in office, has done so publicly in saying they do not see eye-to-eye on what happened on January 6th, saying that they'll never see eye-to-eye.The other thing though that has caused a strain in that relationship is the idea that Pence is flirting with the idea of running for president in 2024, which is very clear to anyone who has been watching him and where he's been going, even he himself has said it's not a surprise. So, that's been an added factor in the notion that he potentially may be running against Trump for the Republican nomination. But yes, they did -- they have spoken several times since they both left office, but nowhere near obviously as often as they used to. They used to have lunch once a week right at the Oval Office, where they would speak. And so they obviously were very close together. Everyone knows about the infamous Oval Office meeting where Pence was brought in as they were trying to pressure him to do something that he illegally could not do on Capitol Hill on January 6th and that was really the breaking point in their relationship.",
