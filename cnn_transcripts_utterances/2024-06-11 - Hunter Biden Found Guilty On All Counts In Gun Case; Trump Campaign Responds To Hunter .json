A federal jury in Delaware found Hunter Biden guilty on three felony gun charges. It took the jury just about three hours of deliberation to reach that verdict. Hunter Biden said he is disappointed by the verdict, but still grateful for his family's love. The special counsel in this case, David Weiss, a Trump appointee said the president's son brought this verdict on himself in 2018 by lying about his drug addiction when he bought a gun.

So when those verdicts were read out, very little reaction from the president's son. He basically was looking straight, taking it all in. After court adjourned, he turned around, flashed a very brief smile to his legal team and then hugged them all one by one. Some pats on the back as well. He walked out and there were quite a number of family members and friends that had been there to support him throughout. It was almost like are receiving line, Jim, one-by-one he gave them hugs and kisses and pats on the back and he is going to be needing them their support as he goes through this journey of being a convicted criminal because the next step is sentencing. He will eventually learn his punishment. The judge which did not set a sentencing date quite yet, but she said it should be probably around four months from now, which would put it in the fall right around the time of the peak of the re-election campaign. So he could face up to 25 years in prison. That's the statutory maximum. But he is a first-time offender. This was not a violent offense. It is highly unlikely that that's going to happen. A lot of the legal experts that have been watching this case have said probation might be what he ultimately ends up with. One more thing, Jim, that I do want to note, it happened so quickly this morning. It was fast between the moment that they announced that the verdict was in until the time that they actually read that verdict. It was its pretty swift. So fast in fact, that the First Lady, Jill Biden, she missed it. She walked into the court about five minutes after things wrapped up. She missed the verdict, but she has been there obviously throughout this whole process for her son.",

And frankly, I think Republicans could suffer from a backlash if they tried to politicize this too much. Because as you know, Jim, so many American families feel the relevancy of what the Biden family is going through right now, and especially with the public remarks that President Biden has focused on, and that is not so much him as president of the United States, but Joe Biden, as a father, Joe Biden as a dad who is standing by his son, who has said that he is proud of him, he is proud of the man that he has become, understanding everything he has gone through and the family has gone throughout Hunter Biden's recovery. And I think importantly, also, Jim, the fact that President Biden has said that he is not going to intervene in any of this, that he is going to respect the outcome, that he is not going to pardon his son even if he is convicted, and we just saw that he is. You know how tough that would be, and you know if the tables were turned, somebody like Donald Trump would never, ever have the ability to say something like that. And in fact, we already see Donald Trump saying that if he wins, he is going to pardon the January 6 \"warriors and hostages\" that he believes they are, because he doesn't care about the country. He doesn't care about American voters. He doesn't care about our democracy. He doesn't care about our Constitution. He only cares about himself. He only cares about staying out of prison.

We know he doesn't have a sympathetic bone or blood cell in his body, and I think at the end of the day, Jim, that is what the American people are going to see in terms of the contrast between, again President Joe Biden and somebody like Donald Trump. You know that elections are all about the future, but they're also all about a voter's gut and when are people are going to go into that ballot box in November, you know that the vast majority of them are going to want somebody in the White House that they can feel good about, that they can say this person understands the humanity, with which so many of us have to live our lives.

I think it is going to take time to sink in. I believe that the majority of Americans still have not completely tuned in to this election, have not completely tuned into every single detail, and so I think those numbers in favor of Joe Biden are going to continue to grow. But I also believe and I think this is critical and important and smart that the Biden campaign is not counting on this conviction in order to win them the election, and I think that is really smart because it has never been part of their strategy to count on any of Donald Trump's legal woes or troubles. It is a good contrast to use and for his supporters to use and they will, but the Biden campaign is focused on delivering their own message, their own accomplishments, and frankly, the contrast and this conviction does help with that contrast between somebody who is focused on delivering for the American people every single day, and somebody who wants to destroy our democracy and only talks about revenge, vengeance, and retribution, and that's a great contrast that I believe at the end of the day, Joe Biden will win in November.",

Now we know the points that they have been pushing consistently is they want a permanent and complete ceasefire and they also want all Israeli military to pull out of Gaza. So at this point, the amendments or the suggestions from Hamas with the mediators, so Qatar and Egypt, they say that they will be considering those amendments. They will also be working with the US mediators as well to try and figure out if a deal can still be done, and it comes on the same day that we also had a statement from an Israeli government official, which really comes the closest so far to suggesting that Israel will sign on to this proposal. It is a three-phase ceasefire and hostage deal which President Biden has pushed and he says it is an Israeli proposal, but we've really not seen a full-throated agreement to the proposal from Israel itself, either. They say that they will agree to a full ceasefire if certain conditions are met, if the governing and military capabilities of Hamas are destroyed, if the hostages are returned, and if Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel. So at face value, some of those do appear slightly different, slightly at odds with the three-phase proposal at this point given the fact that the first phase says there will be a six-week ceasefire and that should evolve into the second space when there will be a complete cessation of hostilities. So all of this really as we have heard from both sides today. We have heard from Hamas, we have heard from Israel; neither side giving a full endorsement of this proposal at this point but they are still talking. They have given amendments at least in Hamas' point of view. So I think the hope will be with the US Secretary of State in the region trying to push this proposal, that it potentially could be a step forward.

So this is what we heard consistently from Hamas that they want this permanent ceasefire. They want the complete pullout of all Israeli military from Gaza and it is really the gap that we've been seeing between the Hamas and Israeli positions to say the least, on this proposal. So these are potentially messages that \"The Wall Street Journal\" has seen saying really that Sinwar believes that Hamas does have an advantage over Israel. It does have the upper hand, and the fact that there are these loss of life on the Palestinian side plays into her Hamas' hands as it plays against Israel. Now we've heard an Israeli response as expected to this reporting saying that that is exactly what they believe, that this is Hamas using the Palestinian civilians to get what they want, but of course at this point, it does come, this reporting on the same day that we are hearing at least from Hamas, an official response, meaning that it would have potentially likely come from Sinwar himself as he is the one that is believed to be the only one that can agree to this proposal  -- Julia.",

I think it is worth noting that I think more than 20 people ended up in intensivecare in a Bangkok hospital for injuries to spine, brain, and skulls. So really quite severe injuries. Now as you say, those with more serious injuries get a starting sort of piece of payment of $25,000.00, but that's just an advance on a final compensation package. So clearly, there is more to be argued for. But ultimately, I don't think there are any strings attached, at least in what is written from Singapore Airlines for any of these compensation packages. Although a lawyer representing some of the passengers has suggested that everyone and anyone before signing anything like that should of course, get legal advice first. The question is, of course, what will the final payout be for Singapore Airlines and so much of that depends on the ongoing investigation to essentially determine whether or not the airline was at fault or whether so this was completely unavoidable. Under the Montreal Convention, airlines do have a limit in terms of liability if it wasn't their fault. So that also plays into the mix here.",

Is this perhaps an increased risk with simply more planes in the air that is another argument out there. And ultimately, what can airlines do to help each other? So, for some time now, IATA, which is the big airline association, has had a Turbulence Awareness Program in place. I was actually with IATA in Dubai last week for their big annual conference and lots more airlines are interested in joining this. It is essentially real-time data sharing of things like turbulence so that more airlines can be aware when there are these sudden incidents of turbulence. But also, you would imagine and this was discussed at great length, what artificial intelligence could do in this space in terms of predictive modeling with all that data. By the end of the day, turbulence unfortunately is a very real hazard and it can be incredibly sudden, and I for one, Julia, am definitely buckling in with my seatbelt pretty much at all times now on a flight.",

It makes up for Monday's losses to some degree after Apple revealed plans to put AI features in their products. It also announced a partnership with OpenAI and Elon Musk is none too pleased. Musk said he'll ban iPhones at his company if Apple integrates OpenAI into their operating systems, saying it will present an unacceptable security risk. It's worth noting that Musk co-founded OpenAI back in 2015. He's had a rather rocky relationship with the company since. Samantha Murphy Kelly just got an early look at all the new AI features and she joins us now from New York. Never mind the fighting, Samantha. Welcome. I know you're an iPhone user, not that we have any bias on this show. So what difference did the AI features make? What do you make of it?",

So a lot of the features we were able to see up close and personal last night are notunlike other features that are already on the market from Microsoft and Samsung and Google. A lot of these players have already been tinkering around with these tools. Now it's Apple's chance to show its own spin on AI. So some of the things that we saw were a lot of like compositions, things related to crafting an e-mail or perhaps like writing a cover letter, suggesting changes, fixing typos, things like that. Of course, there's image generation, lots of fun tools around emoji, and things like that. But by far, the most interesting and potential here is with Siri, the virtual assistant that we've known for years with very mixed results, is now getting a super charge, much smarter, more intuitive, can have back-and- forth conversations with. It can do anything from kind of look at what you're working on, what you're doing and help you with things. So for example, if you have a conference coming up, you can ask it to look for hotels in the area or suggest flights. And keep in mind that you have to be home by a certain time to make it to, you know, a certain engagement. Another thing it could do is if you're texting with somebody and you're talking about tennis player Roger Federer. for example, and you can say, hey, Siri, how many games has he won in his career, Siri will know who you're talking about and make changes. One of the more interesting things and to your point about OpenAI is now Siri will be integrated with ChatGPT. So if you ask Siri specific question and it thinks it's better suited for ChatGPT, it will ask, it'll prompt you if you want to consent to either upload a photo or a document or proceed and ask a question for ChatGPT.",

When you do do an inquiry with ChatGPT, it's not sharing your name or any information that would identify you as well.
