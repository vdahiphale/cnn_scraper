He is expected to stick around through the election for his replacement which is expected to start next week. We don't know when it will end. Those same sources say McCarthy does not plan to get involved in the speakers race where the two leading candidates are Jim Jordan of Ohio, current chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the current House majority leader. As of now, neither Jordan nor Scalise has claimed to have the magic 218 votes required to become the speaker. Scalise has been working the phones and courting GOP lawmakers privately, while Jordan is publicly making the case that he is the best messenger for the Republican Party ahead of the 2024 election where his close ally Donald Trump is the frontrunner for the presidential nomination. But in the last day or so, a couple of prominent Republicans have been issuing a stark warning about Jim Jordan, specifically about his role in attempting to overturn the presidential election of 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  Jim Jordan knew more about what Donald Trump had planned for January 6 than any other member of the House of Representatives.

So, we're going to keep looking until we find something. Well, that's not how the Constitution works.And the thing you need to understand about Jim Jordan is he's a true believer but he truly believes that the Democrats or the left is an enemy of America, and he will do anything, even extra constitutionally to defeat them. That's his general belief. I would put him in the camp of Christian nationalists where he believes he is truly fighting these dark forces and the Constitution in some cases is an impediment to him being able to fight those forces. It's very dangerous for this country, very dangerous for the House, and I'll just say this to my Republican colleagues, really dangerous to the future of the Republican Party, especially if you're the party that still ascribes to Lincoln, Reagan, et cetera. TAPPER:  Congresswoman Lofgren, you just heard about Congressman Kinzinger about what his view of what Jim Jordan thinks about the left, that's you. What do you -- what do you think? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Well, it's not true. I mean, Adam can tell you that our bipartisan January 6th committee worked very professionally and in an apolitical way to get to the truth of what happened on January 6th and leading up to it. And what we found I agree with Adam. I mean, Jordan was up to his neck in this plot for all we could see. He refused to provide us the information we needed. But it looked from the contacts that we could identify that he was heavily identified in the plot to overturn the election, overturn the Constitution.

Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:20:27] TAPPER:  We're back with our politics lead and the news that former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is expected to resign from Congress before the end of his term. This comes as Fox was all set to host a joint forum with the Republican candidates for House speaker but just as soon as that was announced, it was canceled because both declared candidates, Congressman Jim Jordan and Congressman Steve Scalise said no. They were not going to participate because of -- well, we don't know because of, but this was after reports of major backlash from their fellow Republicans to the televised debate from House Republicans. Let's discuss all of this with former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent of the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and former Republican Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan, who was one of only 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after January 6. Congressman Upton, what's your response to the news that Kevin McCarthy is expected to leave Congress in the middle of his term now that he has been ejected as speaker. FRED UPTON (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, MICHIGAN:  Oh, I think that that was a given. I mean, former speakers don't like to stick around. I'm actually surprised that Nancy Pelosi is still there. She was elected in 1986, she lost the gavel of course, but you know, Kevin doesn't want to walk down that center aisle and see Matt Gaetz and those guys sit in their normal little spot. So, yeah, he's going to leave pretty quickly. He's got a lot of different opportunities. He's not used to doing constituent service, that's for sure. So time to get, to do something else.

And further, what were these guying going to negotiate away on Fox News? Were they going to make commitments on Ukraine a condition on becoming speaker, or what kind of idiotic things might they have thrown away on television. These conversations have to happen among the members, not this wider audience.So I'm glad they scrapped it. But it was an absolutely boneheaded idea to think that was good.

For her activism, Mohammadi has been accused of actions against national security and propaganda against the state, and she's now facing more charges as she continues to defiantly speak out from behind bars. In an exclusive recording from inside Evin, Mohammadi reads excerpts of a letter she sent CNN. NARGES MOHAMMADI, IRANIAN ACTIVIST (through translator):  This letter is not written by a free feminist in a developed, democratic society, benefitting from civil protest methods and human rights, but rather by an imprisoned woman who like millions of Iranian women has been living under the authority and oppression of a military system with ideological, patriarchal and tyrannical foundations. Since the age of six, deprived of life, youth, femininity and motherhood.",

So, they've long sort of been seen as frenemies here on Capitol Hill. Then you have Jim Jordan. He is someone who is the House Judiciary chairman. He has become a very strong Kevin McCarthy ally in recent years because Kevin McCarthy took him under his wing and made him House Judiciary chairman as part of his effort to bring the Freedom Caucus more into the fold. But Kevin McCarthy says he doesn't want to get involved, but he does want to see the conference find someone to lead them.

Also, it's going to be a closed door secret ballot, at least on the first initial vote Republicans take.And on the other side of it, that endorsement doesn't do anything to win over moderates. Centrists, of course, are going to be a key constituency in this speaker's race, and Jim Jordan knows that. He has actually been directly reaching out to those members, trying to make the case he is the best positioned to unite this bitterly divided GOP, in part because he does have the ear of the Freedom Caucus, which has been behind a lot of the chaos that we've seen over the last few months in this Congress. So, Steve Scalise making his speech to moderates. Obviously, both of them know that at the end of the day that at the end of the day, they're going to need as many votes as possible. But, Jake, what I can tell you is that a lot of Republicans say that before they go a House floor vote, they want to have this sorted out. They do not want that dysfunction on display like it was in January, where it took Kevin McCarthy 15 rounds to become speaker. So, they really want to get behind closed doors, hash this out. They'll close their conference meeting where they elect a speaker. And then they really want to make sure that whoever that person is, they're going to have 218 votes before they go to House floor, Jake.",
