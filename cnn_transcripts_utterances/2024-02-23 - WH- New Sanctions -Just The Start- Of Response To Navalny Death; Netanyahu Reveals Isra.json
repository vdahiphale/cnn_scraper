The new measures spurred by the death of jailed Vladimir Putin critic, Alexei Navalny, targeting everything from Moscow's war machine to officials connected with Navalny's imprisonment.But there's a huge question about whether Ukraine can afford to wait for all these sanctions to trickle down and degrade Russia's battlefield capabilities and economy. Now two years into the war, Kyiv is set to launch a new counteroffensive and is desperate for the U.S. to pass more military aid. We're covering all of the angles starting with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez who is at the White House for us. Priscilla, what's the administration saying about these new sanctions?",

      "sentences": "Well, the White House argument is that this is a way to apply pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin following the death of Alexei Navalny and also to mark the two-year anniversary of Russia's invasion in Ukraine. This is a way, they say, where they can choke off Russia, try to slow down their ability to obtain certain goods but also their ability to build weapons.Now these over 500 targets include multiple items. It includes hundreds of entities involved in Russia's military industrial base. It's also 26 third country entities facilitating Russian sanction evasion. That includes firms in China Serbia and the United Arab Emirates. We should also note that the State Department imposed sanctions on three prison officials that were linked to the death of Alexei Navalny. Now leading up to this weekend, U.S. officials were already preparing a sanctions package to mark the two year anniversary of the war in Ukraine and then supplemented that sanctions package with what we're learning today after the death of Alexei Navalny. But this is still only one part of the larger equation according to the White House and that is that Congress also needs to pass funding for Ukraine. The $60 billion that the White House asked for last year and that remains stalled in the Republican-controlled House and the President taking direct aim at Republicans in a gathering of governors earlier today.",

I asked National Security spokesperson, John Kirby, what assurances if anything can be provided to these allies when Congress is still on recess and that - and there hasn't been any funding passed. And he maintained that the President is going to continue to apply pressure on Republicans as they come back from recess to try to get this funding across the finish line.But there is no doubt Brianna that the world is watching as the White House says and that there is still immense pressure and urgency to get this funding across the finish line in addition to the sanctions that were announced today.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, we've got to be honest about these sanctions, a huge number of 500 speak targets. But the Russians have become exceptionally adept when certain vehicles they use to get round sanctions to get the chips, to get the certain parts they need for their missiles, for their drones are finding a new means to import them through third parties too. So these may be well targets that may be thought through.But remember too, the Biden administration has been burrowing deep into its toolbox of sanctions for two years now and may slowly be running out of stuff they can do without actually impacting U.S. economic needs at the same time as well. So really we've not heard much of a reaction here in Ukraine to those sanctions. They don't - they're not in the competition for economic convenience at the moment. They're in a flat out war and they need that $60 billion as soon as they possibly can. And so we've seen President Zelenskyy give an interview to Fox News. I mentioned that media outlook because this is clearly Kyiv directly appealing to a part of the Republican Congress that is holding that money up. And that money is already in its absence having a huge impact on the front line, Avdiivka lots of the weekend; pressure in Kherson; pressure in Zaporizhzhia near where I'm standing; Pressure all across the front line. Ukraine today announcing a small victory perhaps claiming it had taken down a Russian spy plane, an A-15 near the Sea of Azov, the second multimillion dollar such plane in the last month or so. So they're trying to project strength and gains, but be in no doubt too, they're also trying to remind the world that the absence of that $60 million means the death of Ukrainian soldiers day by day. So this sanctions package from the Biden administration work (ph) because as I'm sure it will be in a bid to try and close those loopholes Russia has to try and economically inconvenience. Now remember Russia is still making tens of billions of oil money from selling directly to a U.S. strategic partner, India. That's not against any sanctions, but it's certainly something that has many people raising their eyebrows. Lots of more potentially that the U.S. could do to reduce U.S. - Russia economic might. But they have to bear in mind the impact that could have on the U.S. economy as well. Ukraine needs that money frankly, not 500 extra sanction targets. Back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's not clear really quite what stage this planning is at. This is in response to a question by Fox News saying that they're going to plan another counter offensive. There have been hints in the past after the last counter offensive which had billions of dollars of NATO aid and NATO intelligence assistance and planning as well. And that really didn't go at all as anybody had planned. Ukraine very quickly said we'll do it again and we're not going to tell you more about it.So clearly Ukraine does want to go on the initiative again. But with the absence of that 60 billion dollars and the slowdown in ammunition the problem they're all facing across the front line in terms of sheer personnel, they're often outnumbered in extraordinary ratios by Russian forces that are willing to throw thousands of men, it seems, that often targets of limited strategic use. Ukraine isn't really in a position right now to go on the active offensive. It's often playing catch up in various areas along the front line. And, of course, they're keen to project success in the Black Sea against Russian naval targets and other areas too while they can. But the news has been persistently bad for the last week. Maybe that's a bid by Kyiv to remind their Western allies how urgently they need help, but it's also backed up by a sheer loss of territory and lives too across the front line, Brianna.",

That money, most of it, is actually spent in the United States to produce these weapons and equipment, et cetera. But that apparently still is not making the case. It's just a very politicized situation right now. Because if that vote were held, it is believed that it would pass because a lot of people in Congress support it.

All of the entry and exit points.In the meantime more high stakes hostage negotiations are underway in Paris as families of those held captive in Gaza stage more protests in Tel Aviv.

But Brianna, as you know, Congress does have a tendency to kick the can down the road. And the topic of government funding has been a very vexing issue particularly for House Republicans. Let's not forget that Kevin McCarthy was ousted from the speakership because he put a stopgap spending bill on the floor.Now just to set the stage for you a bit here, four agencies are set to run out of money next Friday. The rest of the government agencies will run out of money the following week on March 8th. And right now the House is not even scheduled to return from their recess until next Wednesday, so not a lot of time really to figure this out. But we are being told that the leadership is hoping to finalize a bipartisan deal to fund the government and release it by Sunday with the idea being that then they could try to jam it through both of the chambers next week in time for that Friday deadline. But even that would carry some risks for House Speaker Mike Johnson. And that is because he is under immense pressure to fight for a number of conservative policy wins, and everything from abortion to guns to DOJ funding all of which would be non-starters with Democrats which means in order to secure a deal he is going to have to drop those demands which could land him in some hot water with his right flank. But at this point no one wants to shut down including Mike Johnson. He knows that's bad politics particularly for his own more vulnerable moderate members. But at this point nothing is certain. We'll have to see what they come up with if they come up with anything on Sunday, Brianna.",

Biden's too old to effectively serve another term. Look at this, 67 percent. And so voters are kind of weighing this in their minds two candidates that they certainly don't adore and they're kind of going back, which is the negative.
