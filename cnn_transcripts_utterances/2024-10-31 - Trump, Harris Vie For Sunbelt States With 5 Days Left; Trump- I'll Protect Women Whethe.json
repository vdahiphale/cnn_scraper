One Arizona Republican official says, they've tried hand-delivering Musk notes to get them to tone down nothing work. You write in the book that you're a big mosque admirer, and I understand why is inventing and his risk risk-taking. I totally get it. But on this issue, mighty be better if he turned it down when it comes to allegations of election malfeasance that aren't proven, especially because he could become a central figure in a second, Donald Trump presidency. REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL):  Well, Jake, let me take that back part of that first. I mean, look, he's revolutionized, not one, not two but there were three different industries. I remember everyone saying when he bought into Twitter that it was going to completely crater. He eliminated, what, 70 percent of its employees because he thought it was too bloated and was one of the reasons it was under -- it was not profitable and it's -- it's working. And Lord knows, when you have a Pentagon that cannot audit itself year after year after year, when you have a massive bloat in our bureaucracy that many Americans feel like is not working for them or if you look at what he did for SpaceX just ten years ago, he was having to sue the federal government, having to sue the air force to even have a shot. And now he's responsible for 80 percent of our launches and is completely reinserted. America as a dominant player in space when the Chinese and Russians are literally trying to take our constellations out that would send our economy back into the dark ages I welcome his input. I welcome private sector input, and I certainly welcome more efficiency when it comes to the private -- or when it comes to the bloated federal bureaucracy. And as I say in my book, that adaptive mindset that bottoms up leadership Green Berets specialized in unconventional warfare and he is certainly unconventional. We should take those ideas on board.",
