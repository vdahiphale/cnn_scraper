Firstly, I don't think the Biden administration can afford to delay for too long as your report indicated, days are going on, since that attack, and at some point, the U.S. does need to act.The question is how they act in a way that essentially degrades the abilities of Iranian sponsored militia groups to attack the U.S. in the future, and at the same time, sends the message to Iran to basically stop all future attacks. And, in particular, I think the conduit for that message has to be the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. I don't think you're going to see attacks on Iranian soil. I think the president has made that quite clear. But the risk is that, you know, the U.S. will do these attacks, there might be a bit more intense or widespread than previous attacks. But if the Iranian-backed militias, then launch more attacks, potentially injuring more U.S. service people, then, President Biden is under immense pressure to do something far more destructive and widespread.",

And that could involve attacks directly against Iran itself.And that could then see Iran retaliate against the U.S. militarily. And so, then you have your tit for tat escalation into a wider war. We are probably at that wider war now, that it's just at a very low level.

If the -- if the Iranians, then, all the Iranian sponsor groups then strike back, then, I think Biden has to have a much more expansive target set rather than just the militia group. So, it could be attacks on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, both on land and at sea. It could be cyber-attacks, on targets inside Iran. And at the ultimate stage, of course, if things keep going would be kinetic attacks on targets in Iran. And they have to judge how those strikes are going. And they have to determine what sort of strikes to do, what sort of targets to hit and how intensely to hit those targets in order to force Iran to back down, in order to restore deterrence so far. The U.S. military strikes have seen deterrence fail. CHURCH: Malcolm Davis, want to thank you for joining us and for your analysis. Appreciate it.",

The world cannot abandon the people of Gaza.

I think if we weren't playing them out on a news channel, you might think you'd stumbled upon an episode of the hit Netflix show \"Fauda\".Now, these kinds of raids aren't unprecedented but what is rare is to actually see them or part of them unfolding, thanks to this security camera footage. And from what we understand from both the Israelis and the Palestinian news agency, WAFA, is that about a dozen commandos from this Israeli special forces unit raided the Ibn Sina hospital in the Israeli occupied West Bank city of Jenin. Now, they were disguised some as civilians, some as hospital workers. There were women among the commandos, wearing hijabs. One of the commandos was carrying a wheelchair, another a baby car seat, and they seem to know exactly where they were planning to go, and who they were targeting. They went to the third floor of this building, they found the three -- the three Palestinian militants, and they killed them. Now, one of them had actually previously been injured in an earlier part of the war in a drone strike, and he was said to be recovering. And then, the commandos left the building, there were no other injuries. No one was any of the wiser until this footage emerged later on. Now, according to Herzi Halevi, he is General Herzi Halevi, he is the chief of the general staff in Israel. He says that not only were these militants involved in terrorist activities beforehand, but they were planning, in his words, a serious attack. And he had heard that we do not want to turn hospitals, into battlefields, but so that they won't allow them to be used as a cover for terrorism. Now, as you say, Israel has been criticized not just for the disguising of their commandos, as civilians and as hospital workers, but also for killing these three men inside of hospital, one of whom was injured. Now, it's debatable whether there was any breach of law or whether the protected status of this hospital would have been at risk if these militants were planning attacks from the hospital itself. But I think the other ramification is perhaps twofold. One is going to be very hard for Israel to carry out a similar raid of this sort, now that perhaps people will be ready for this eventuality. And I think also psychologically, it will have an impact on militants who perhaps if they're injured next time, will think twice about going to a hospital because they will now know that nowhere is safe for them.
