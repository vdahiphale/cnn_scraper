And ideally something that, of course, is going to result if far fewer civilian casualties, something that the U.S. has been urging the Israelis to do more about. Just, you know, for the last several months even, not just the last several weeks. And so Secretary Austin's going to be meeting with his counterparts there, hoping to get an assessment from the next phase of the war. And he's also, importantly, going to be meeting with counterparts in the region writ large in Bahrain, in Qatar, to talk about the broader regional tensions, of course, that have led to dozens and dozens of attacks on U.S. forces in the region, as well, of course, as in the Red Sea in recent weeks, Sara.",

Let's start with kind of the big mission that Secretary Austin has as he is back in Israel and in the region. This is -- it was just earlier this month that he offered kind of that blunt advice to Israeli partners, which is, you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians. You've talked about this, General, when he talked about the -- the risk of replacing a tactical victory with a strategic defeat. What do you think his main mission is this time? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: First of all, Kate, what I'd like to say is, the film you just showed of Secretary Austin in Israel, I believe he was talking with Benny Gantz, who is a -- the Israeli minister, right now, of defense, or he's working with the Defense Department in Israel. And Gantz was also a chief of the Israeli defense forces. So, what you have is two former soldiers who understand battle, who understand the balancing act between a massive kinetic operation, which Israel has been going through over the last several weeks, to an understanding of what the perception is by people in the population, as well as the world stage. So, I think they were talking about that. How can you potentially lose this fight, Israel, if you continue to show that you are massively kinetically hitting targets, even though we know those targets are still there, much like the tunnel that was seen this weekend, but how do you ensure that you're doing the right thing and messaging it the right way? Secondly, I'd suggest -- you know, I know Lloyd Austin, and he is of the school of, what comes after the fight. So, I think, you know, a lot of people are focused on him trying to control the operational battlefield tempo of Israel right now. But I think Secretary Austin is also asking some really important questions about, what are you going to do, Israel, about Gaza after you complete this destruction of Hamas, or attempted destruction of Hamas. There are going to be a million and a half people without homes, without electricity, without water. What are you going to do about that, and what's your proposal?

That, you know, military operations will be confused, that there will be smoke and fire and darkness and closed quarters where a rescue attempt might be made. But in this case, it's even more horrific than that, that these individuals were in the open.What I'd tell you, Kate, having experienced fratricide in combat, it not only devastates the families of those who were killed but friendly forces, it also devastates the individual that actually pulled the trigger and killed them. And it ripples through an entire unit. This is - this is a difficult moral issue within the Israeli Defense Force. I've read the message that the chief of the IDF sent to his troops, and how he talked to his troops, saying we can't allow this to happen. [09:25:01] We're better than this. But sometimes, truthfully, soldiers on the battlefield are frightened. They're scared. They're anxious. They're in a fire fight. Adrenaline is rushing. And, you know, it's very difficult in these kind of fights to determine, you know, civilians from hostages from terrorists. They're not wearing uniforms. You don't know what their actions are, and you're fighting in conditions where if you're a friendly force going in like the Israeli soldiers were, you're receiving sniper fire, anti-tank fire and all you're worried about is getting the first shot off so you're not killed. All of those things combined with the smoke and the dark to create these kind of situations. That's not explaining it away. I'm sure Israel will investigate this and take a hard look and get it out to their soldiers. But it's just really tough if you've never been in a situation to understand what might have happened. I haven't read the final report of what happened in this fratricide incident, so I don't know.

They said that it was an accident and that the 46-year-old man who was driving the car will face charges. A spokesperson for the Wilmington Police Department told our colleague D.J. Judd (ph) that the Wilmington Police have determined that this was an accidental collision and have charged the driver of the striking vehicle, a 46-year-old Wilmington man, with driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol and inattentive driving. The Secret Service, last night, had released a statement suggestingthat this was unintentional. They have said that there was no protected interest associated with this event and the president's motorcade departed without incident. But it certainly was a startling moment. President Biden was departing the campaign headquarters where he had met with staff over a holiday event. And you could see the look on his face as they heard that bang when that car crashed into a motorcade - or into an SUV in the president's motorcade. Secret Service quickly moved him into the car. But, today, we are learning from the Wilmington Police Department that they've determined this was an accident, that that driver is now facing charges.",
