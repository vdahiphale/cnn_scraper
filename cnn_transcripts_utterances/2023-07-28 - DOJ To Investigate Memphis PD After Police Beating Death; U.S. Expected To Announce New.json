The question investigators has is if Memphis police systematically used excessive force and discriminated against black residents.In January, Nichols, a 29-year-old black man was stopped by police, beaten, kicked, and tased. He died three days later from his injuries. CNN's Nick Valencia has been covering this and joins us now with the latest on the new investigation, Nick.",

And ever since the death of Tyre Nichols, community leaders have been very vocal about their desire for the Department of Justice to come in to investigate the Memphis Police Department. The DOJ announcing yesterday that they are going to grant that request, announcing a formal investigation -- a civil rights investigation into the Memphis Police Department based on publicly available information as well as information they say that was provided to them. They didn't give a timeline as far as when this investigation will be wrapped up. But they did say that they expect to release their findings soon.And if you remember, it was a separate office of the Department of Justice that started working with the Memphis Police Department in March. That work will continue in parallel with this investigation. And here's what this investigation will look at. It will look at the use of force by the Memphis Police Department as well as stops of motorists to see if this Memphis police department engaged in a -- in a pattern or practice of discriminatory policing. It will look at also whether or not any constitutional rights or federal laws were violated. And it was at the press conference announcing this decision by the DOJ that the U.S. Attorney in Memphis says that the city will fully cooperate with the defense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN REITZ, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE: There cannot be one rule of law for the powerful and another for the powerless. There cannot be one rule of law for the rich and another for the poor. And there cannot be one rule of law for people who look like me and another for people of color. And so I welcome this opportunity to let the facts lead in what I know will be an ongoing and important discussion about civil rights in our city. Together we can build a stronger Memphis.

We've seen the Department of Justice that's been committed to looking at patterns and practices throughout the country. This is, I believe, is their ninth pattern and practice. You'd recall as it related to George Floyd in Minneapolis looking at that. You recall in Louisiana, as it related to a Louisville -- as it related to Breonna Taylor. They looked at that. So, it's important. And what now happens? What happens is the Department of Justice goes into that area -- in that community. There'll be a number of interviews. Hey, will look at pattern -- they will look at prior stops. They will look at reports. They will speak with police. They will speak with community residents. They will try to learn and discern really the core focus. The core focus will be predicated around three major things. Number one, the stops -- stopping of residents with a pre-textual. What was the basis of those stops? Number two. Was there excessive force? If so, was it justified? Was it not? Number three. Is there a component of racial profiling? Very important because you want to police policing and the justice system relies on public confidence. There's a place for the federal government here. When the federal government looks at it at least police and residents know they are being heard. And if there are systematic deficiencies, they are being addressed. So, this is a very important thing.",

What is the basis for the stops? Are they justified, etcetera? And there have been a city council in this particular community that has said, look, we're not stopping people anymore because of a taillight. We're not stopping them because they have some minor violations. That has to be some teeth to it. And so, when people look at this, they have to understand that I think, you know, at the end of the day, if there are things that need to happen. Whether there needs to be more training. Whether there needs to be more recruitment. Whether that needs to be just a reinforcing, or really a re-imagination of policing, I think that's what will happen. So, after this happens, Rahel, they will institute a number of reforms. It's always whether those reforms are implemented and how they're implemented is to -- as to how this moves forward. And whether it has any teeth and whether or not it has its desired effect, which is to change policing, which is really disproportionate to certain communities.",

And it would be the first time that they provide Taiwan with this assistance in the form of the presidential draw-down authority, which means that the money and the equipment would be coming directly from U.S. stocks. Essentially, allowing the equipment to get there faster.Previously, Taiwan had purchased military equipment from the U.S. which takes a little bit longer to get there. But now, we are preparing -- we are expecting an announcement from the U.S. that they are preparing to actually send Taiwan equipment directly from its stockpiles. Similar to how it is -- how it has sent Ukraine much of the weaponry and equipment they had been receiving over the course of the war. Now, we have been expecting an announcement like this for the better part of two months now. This package has been delayed since the time when it was first announced by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin back in May. Largely because of an accounting error, we're told. Very similar to the one that the Department of Defense made when they were trying to calculate the weaponry and equipment going to Ukraine. But now, we're told they are finally going to be providing this package. It is going to be valued at over $300 million despite Congress authorizing about a billion dollars in this kind of presidential drawdown authority for Taiwan. So, it remains to be seen just why this is not a higher number. And of course, what is actually going to be in the package? The administration is not expected to issue kind of a detailed list of all the equipment that's going into it. But again, this is the first time that the U.S. is going to be providing equipment directly from its stockpiles. Expect that to really anger China at a moment when the U.S. has been trying to mend relations with them, John.",

That one, Ukraine did claim. And then just a short time ago, we saw an attack on a city just across the border in southern Russia called Taganrog. And the Russian military is saying that an S-200 missile, a Ukrainian missile that is normally used for air defense had hit that town. There are some casualties, we understand from that -- from the military. And then separately, there was an explosion in Samarra, which is about 500 miles east of Moscow at an oil refinery.
