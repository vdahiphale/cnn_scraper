And also, we've heard the U.N. -- the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. We had the U.S. national security adviser in to see President Zelenskyy, and all of them have spoken about their commitment to this fight. And by the way, it's actually working. I spoke to the NATO secretary- general yesterday and we can see with our own eyes on the ground that the amount of help from the U.S. and its allies in terms of financial or, indeed, weaponry and obviously moral support has made a difference and continues to make a difference on the battlefield. And there is no blank check. The two senators told me they look at all the money that's going out and they're convinced that it's all accountable for and nothing is being spent in the wrong way.",

But Port Canaveral, where the cruise ships docks, 75 mile per hour gusts. And then eventually, it goes to the west and to the northwest and then to the northeast. So this is kind of a long-range storm as we move it on up toward Savannah and then up into the Carolinas. And a lot of rain even for Pennsylvania. Some of these spots across parts of the northeast could pick up four to six inches of rainfall. And in some spots, we know that that's enough to make some flash flooding.
