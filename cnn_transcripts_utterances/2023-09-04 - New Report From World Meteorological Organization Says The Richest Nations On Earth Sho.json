A new report from the World MeteorologicalOrganization says the richest nations on earth should be doing more to help Africa cope with climate change. The WMO says that Africa accounts for just 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, but the floods and droughts that accompany climate change have taken a very heavy toll on the continent, as you can see by some of these pictures here. Reports come on the first day of the African climate summit in Nairobi. Kenya, leaders from across the globe are attending the three-day climate gathering, organizers saying that their goal is to showcase Africa as a hub for climate investment instead of a victim of floods and famine. Opening the event, Kenya's President William Ruto emphasized that Africa's rich natural resources can actually help the continent thrive as a source of alternate energy. I want you to listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But Putin said that won't happen until Western restrictions on Russia's agricultural exports are lifted. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us live now from London. So, Nic, not only did Russia leave the Black Sea grain deal, but they also bombed several Ukrainian grain storage facilities, as well.

In fact, President Erdogan was the one who told him that the world is watching. Erdogan went in with the U.N.'s concrete proposals, but he did perhaps soften his own language a little bit to reflect some of what Vladimir Putin was saying. Indeed, he said that -- Erdogan said that Ukraine would have to soften its position if it wanted to get in step with Russia. In essence, what Putin appears to be doing here, pulled out of the grain deal, up to the number of attacks on Ukrainian grain facilities, uses this platform to point out that a lot of Ukraine's grain doesn't go to developing nations and the most needy around the world. And President Erdogan is saying, well, you know, Vladimir Putin has got a point here. Where does this actually take the negotiations and the conversations? Of course, we don't know what really happened behind the closed doors there. But Putin is saying, you know, we've had our agricultural spare parts have been cut off to us, the fees, the financial transactions have been slow or incomplete in going through. Indeed, these are the Western sanctions on Russia for its war of choice in Ukraine. But nevertheless, Putin is taking this argument and using it as leverage to get what he wants, sanctions relief of some sort it appears, to rejoin the deal. That's what's on the table and that's why I think you're right that this isn't going to happen overnight.",

And this is a critically important relationship between the two countries, not just for the two countries, but on broader issues when it comes to the African continent and relations with the global south. It depends on whether more revelations come out on this particular incident. And the broader issue still remains that South Africa's non-alliance stance on the war in Ukraine has been questioned by many. But we are having a pretty significant meeting here in South Africa in the coming months on the AGOA relationship, but that's a critically important act that allows African nations, including South Africa, to export its goods tariff-free to the U.S. Now, I don't think either side would want any other issue playing into that discussion even after some U.S. members of Congress questioned because of the issues around the Russia relationship, whether that meeting should even take place here.
