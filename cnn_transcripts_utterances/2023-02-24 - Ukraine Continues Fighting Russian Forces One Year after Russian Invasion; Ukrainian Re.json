The Ukrainians have made a series of impressive gains on the battlefield with counteroffensives taking back territory around the country.But the Ukrainian leadership is telling us that their goal is to take back everything that was taken, even dating back to 2014 when Russia first annexed Crimea. And there is no question that that is going to be a challenging road ahead for them, particularly when you look at the fighting in the east which is grinding on. It's almost looking like something of a stalemate. And that's why I think you're seeing the Ukrainian leadership repeatedly asking the U.S. and NATO and its supporters for the heavy weaponry that they believe is needed to finish this off, to win this war once and for all. I asked one senior Ukrainian official whether that message was imparted once again to the Biden administration when President Biden visited here.
