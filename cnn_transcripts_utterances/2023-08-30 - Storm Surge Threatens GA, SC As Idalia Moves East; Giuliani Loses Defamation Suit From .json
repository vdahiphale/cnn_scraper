The record storm surges that continue to pose a threat, the homes underwater, and the rescues that are still underway. Plus, new questions being raised, tonight, after Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell freezes up, for a second time, one month after a similar health scare. Dr. Sanjay Gupta will join us. And a searing front page, unlike any other, students, in North Carolina, summing up, an American crisis, really better than any photo ever could. The student behind it will join me. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, hundreds of thousands of people are still without power, in both Florida and Georgia, where Idalia is barreling through now, as a tropical storm. It is also lashing South Carolina, with heavy rain, and sustained winds, of 65 miles per hour. Idalia did prove to be that once-in-a-lifetime storm, for the Big Bend of Florida, the strongest one to hit there, actually, in at least 125 years. Thousands of homes have been damaged, after the hurricane struck, as a Category 3 storm. Look at this gas station. This is in Perry, Florida. You can see the powerful winds, just dismantling it, and knocking it right down to the ground. In Tampa Bay, the storm surge, there, broke records, with water levels that surpassed four-and-a-half feet. So far, more than 75 people, tonight, have been rescued, from the severe flooding that happened in St. Petersburg. It has been a long day, to say the least, for Floridians. The danger though is not over yet. Our Meteorologist, Chad Myers, is in the CNN Weather Center. Chad, I know you've been following the path of the storm, ever since we were talking, last night.",

And it's going to get into these creeks and streams, and then into the rivers, and then pushed down toward the ocean. That's my concern, at this point. And then back out here, the other flare-up we're seeing, in the very warm Gulf current here, very warm water here, that's going to start to rotate, into North Carolina. And so, when that happens, we are going to see the potential, for spinning storms, and of course, the chance of a tornado or two.

That is evident in the scenes that we are seeing, in the Big Bend region, of Florida, where damaged structures and rushing waters left some neighborhoods, unrecognizable, to people, who live there. Florida's Emergency Director says their biggest concern, are the roughly 190,000 customers, who don't have power, right now. Search and rescue teams are still making their way, tonight, through those hard- hit areas. Someone who knows what they are going through is joining me now, Florida congressman, Jared Moskowitz, the State's former Director of Emergency Management. And Congressman, thank you, for being here, tonight. I mean, you know what it's like to be in this position. What is the biggest challenge, for these response teams, in the aftermath, of a storm, like what we just saw hit Florida? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Well, thanks, Kaitlan. Thanks for having me. Well, right now, the biggest challenge is search and rescue. Obviously, the surge has been, and continues to be the greatest challenge. And the greatest potential loss of life, it is the water, it is not the wind. And so, time is of the essence, where water rushed into homes, very quickly, within a matter of hours, eight feet, in some areas, making sure that they can go home to home, to make sure that people, who need to be rescued, by those Swiftwater rescue teams, that's the greatest challenge. And then, obviously, rushing in those resources that are life, health and safety, so, drinkable water, ice, food, making sure people get medical supplies. Sometimes, they set up, portable hospitals, they set up, portable prescription centers, so people can get their medicine. So, that's what Director Kevin Guthrie, right now, is dealing with.

That eye wall came through these areas that have not been hit by a hurricane, in over 100 years. And in those areas, a lot of them are fiscally-constrained. They don't necessarily have the resources. And so, there are some communities that may never look the same and others that will get rebuilt that will look slightly different. And so, look, this is a life-changing event, for some of these counties, some of these fiscally-constrained counties. But look, all of those resources, from the State, all of those resources, from FEMA, they're going to come in, the FEMA reimbursement, the HUD money that comes in, for housing, all that CDBG-DR money that's going to come, that will help the community recover.",

And they're battle-tested, right? They just did Ian a year ago. And so, the State of Florida is on top of emergency management.

Neither of our bills are moving.And so yes, the Biden administration, coupled that together with Ukraine, which I support the Biden package.

The FEMA Administrator said these communities, both, in Maui and in Florida are going to have the money that they need, for the response. But one of the things that we know is that hurricane season is just beginning. We got all of September. We got all of October. And reimbursement for the state and these towns will be slowed down. And that's not something the Emergency Management should be focused on. They shouldn't have to worry, that their money is not coming on time. That's not what they should be focused on. They should be focused on response and recovery and rebuilding. And so, Congress needs to do its job, right? Emergency managers, out there, are saving lives. They're preparing for their communities, right, every single solitary day away from the families, away from their kids. People are losing their houses, they're losing loved ones.

GOTTLIEB, ATTORNEY FOR SHAYE MOSS &amp; RUBY FREEMAN: Thanks for having me, Kaitlan. It's great to be here. They have been through so much, and really have been heroic, in their willingness, to not lie down, and to stand up and fight, for what is right, not just for them, but for democracy, and for the future of the protection of election workers, throughout the United States. So, they were very pleased to hear, about this result, today. They feel vindicated. But they know that there is more work to do, and that there is a long road ahead, for the two of them, in restoring their reputation, and in trying to get some semblance of normalcy back, in lives that have truly been shattered, by the kinds of grotesque lies that you just played a clip of. And yes, to your point, it was a ginger mint. It was not a -- it was not a USB, or a vial of cocaine or heroin.",

Why do you think he chose to take what could be a potentially huge loss, rather than comply with those orders? J. GOTTLIEB: There's some of that questioning, in the court's order, today. And I think only he can explain, why he has made the strategic decisions that he's made, to show up and litigate this case, but just not turn over any of the discovery and evidence that we asked for, and to not comply with the court's orders, for everything, from producing basic documents, to us, on his financial condition, to paying us $89,000, in attorneys' fees that he was required to pay us, and still hasn't. So, I don't know why he's chosen this path. I can't speak for him, or for the strategic decisions, he's making. But it's not been a very effective strategy. It's one that's led him to a place, where liability is now established. And we really look forward to being able to put forward our damages case, and to pursue that over the coming months, so.",

What is your response to that?J. GOTTLIEB: I very much look forward to their appeal. The weaponization of the justice system, is when powerful individuals, refuse to be accountable, to the justice system. It's not when people, who have traditionally lacked that power, go to the justice system, and fight over years and years, to get their opponents, to comply, with basic discovery obligations. So, in our view, the weaponization of the justice system is when powerful individuals, hide behind it, and refuse to have accountability. And that is exactly what Mr. Giuliani attempted to do, in this case. He attempted to get out of all of his obligations, to do what every other person, whoever gets sued has to do, which is to turn over potentially damaging or incriminating text messages, and emails, to the other side in discovery. It is a painful, a laborious process. But it is one that all responsible parties, who are -- who sue or get sued, comply with. Particularly, people, who were United States Attorney, for the most famous district, in the United States, they're expected to comply with those obligations.",

After both incidents, aides said that McConnell was feeling just light-headed. He did attend a fundraiser, this evening. He did not make any mention of what happened, earlier today, in Kentucky. But this time, unlike a month ago, when it first happened, as you saw there, on the right, McConnell's office said that the 81-year-old lawmaker will see a doctor. This comes months, after McConnell suffered a fall, at what was then the Trump Hotel, in Washington. He also had a concussion, according to his office. Joining us, tonight, is CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, obviously, you have not treated the Senator. You can't provide any solid conclusions, without examining him, yourself. But you are a neurosurgeon. I mean, what do you see, in those 30 seconds, from today? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is a pretty classic episode of freezing, the same term that you used. I mean that is what I see. You see someone, who becomes frozen, in their speech. Even their face is sort of frozen. Their body is frozen. You can see his hands, Kaitlan, are sort of clenching the sides of the lectern. One of his aides comes over to try and raise his hands. But he's really sort of locked in, in place. He doesn't look like he's fainting or something like that. And you'd be surprised that there's a pretty long list of things that could potentially cause this. Is it a temporary sort of lack of blood flow, to the brain, something known as a TIA, a mini seizure, or something like that? Those seem less likely. But you've seen people, who have Parkinson's disease, who will become kind of frozen, if their medications start to wear off. We don't know, again, as you say, what he has. But that would be an example of something that could cause that. And that's often associated with what's called a masked facies, people really lose expression, of their face, at the same time. So, we don't know. We do know that the aides, who came to his side there, they didn't seem that surprised, Kaitlan. We've seen this twice. But you get the sense that they see it quite a bit, even knew how to react. And one of the ways that they -- there wasn't a sense of urgency, \"Oh, we need to get him to the hospital right away,\" which makes you think that they kind of have dealt with this, may already know what's going on. And as has been reported, he was doing fine, later on. So whatever it was, came and went, pretty quickly.",

Those suggest that something else is going on. Again, I mean, a seizure perhaps, or medications wearing off. We don't know. But I'm glad that he got checked out. Because again, even though it sounds like this is something, his aides have been dealing with, these were pretty characteristic episodes. And this is my area of expertise.

Some students were seen jumping out of windows, to find safety, in the chaos, after those shots had been fired. You can see them here. Today, the school student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, filed its front page, and filled it, with text messages, sent and received, by students, during that long lockdown. Some of them are understandably explicit. But that is the kind of language that people use, when they feel like their lives are at risk. The messages are just snapshots of what it is like, to live through a school shooting. \"Are you safe?\" \"Get under the desk or run if you can.\" \"Please pray for us.\" I want to go straight, to the source, tonight, The Daily Tar Heel's Editor-in-Chief, Emmy Martin, who is a student, at the school. Emmy, I think this front page is really brilliant. Can you just tell us how you came up, with this idea, and how you're doing, tonight? EMMY MARTIN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY TAR HEEL: Thank you, Kaitlan. I'm doing all right, I think, like any student, at UNC. It's a weird feeling. We've lived through a campus shooting that something I couldn't say before Monday, and now I can. But the newspaper was an idea that I had, after seeing so many texts, from loved ones, and friends, and family members, on my phone, and also, on social media from students, across UNC's campus. And so, The Daily Tar Heel's team immediately started asking other students, for those texts, and they just came pouring in, so much raw feeling, and emotion, and pain.
