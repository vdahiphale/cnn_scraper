      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone.Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we start with this breaking news. The questions around Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's secretive days-long hospitalization are growing. We are learning President Biden, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, even Austin's own Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks had no idea the Defense Secretary was incapacitated for portions of last week. Austin was admitted to Walter Reed Hospital on New Year's Day after complications from an elective surgery. CNN's Natasha Bertrand and Arlette Saenz are gathering new details about all of this. Natasha, you first. How were so many top officials kept in the dark about what was happening?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's really the big question that we have right now, Fredricka, is just whose decision this ultimately was to keep this information not only from the public, but also from the White House for roughly three days after Secretary Austin was first transferred into Walter Reed Hospital to receive treatment for a complication from an elective surgery that he had had previously.But what we are learning is that the Deputy Secretary of Defense was actually on vacation in Puerto Rico, when she was informed that she would be needing to take on some of Austin's duties, but she was not told why and that is really key here, not even his number two was told that he was actually hospitalized, and that that would be the reason why she was taking over some of his responsibilities. Now according to the Pentagon press secretary, Major General Pat Ryder, she assumed some certain operational responsibilities that require constant secure communications capabilities, and this is how it was described to us is that it was not necessarily that Austin was incapacitated, it was just that certain aspects of the role needed to be delegated to her while he was in the hospital. Now, it remains unclear at this point, just when Austin is going to be released. He is still in the hospital, or at least he was as of late last night. And so the question now becomes, what is the political fallout from all of this? The questions are continuing to swirl about why the Defense Department did not feel the need to inform not only senior leaders, but of course, also rank and file who now feel deeply frustrated that they were left in the dark about all of this. The national security implications are also looming large as well, and so we'll continue to ask for more information from the Pentagon about just why this lapse in transparency occurred -- Fredricka.",

It was not until Thursday afternoon that National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan found out about it and then he promptly briefed President Biden. But President Biden was unaware for three days that Austin had been hospitalized. Now there has been quite a bit of criticism already. You have the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, who said that the delay in disclosing this matter was unacceptable and that it erodes trust in the Biden administration. There have been some defenders of Austin who, such as Jim Clyburn, who have noted that, yes, he needed to disclose this but he also should be privy to have access to the same patient privacy laws as other American citizens. And earlier today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that he also had been unaware about the hospitalization. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let us know when you learn more.We're also getting new details about a terrifying flight over Oregon on Friday, when a part of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max-9 jet came off, leaving a gaping hole in the plane as you see right there. The National Transportation Safety Board now says the sudden depressurization from that accident was so strong, headrests and cushions were ripped off seats near the hole. Investigators are asking for the public's help to recover the large section of the plane that fell off. CNN's Pete Muntean and Mike Valerio joining us right now with more on this. Pete, what are you learning about the focus of the investigation?",

      "sentences": "Well, we're getting some incredible new details about the force of this incident, Fredricka.I just spoke to the head of the NTSB. She says the video on board might look calm, but chaotic is a lot more like it. It was very cold and very windy on board Alaska Flight 1282 she says. NTSB investigators having now toured the plane from the outside and the inside and NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy tells me she saw a headrest ripped off from Seat 26-A, that's right next to the refrigerator-sized hole ripped in the left side of the fuselage. Also, the headrests missing from Seat 25-A in front of it, even some of the seat assemblies themselves were twisted. The investigation is now going to focus on a few things. First, the design of the door plug. You can see it missing there. That's the part on the left side of the plane that failed. It's where a door can be installed on the Boeing 737 Max-9. This plane did not have a door, instead a plug that fills that door frame visible from the outside, normal window wall and seats on the inside. Investigators want to know about the maintenance of that door, also the maintenance of the plane in general. Maintenance records were on board the plane, those are safe, they will be reviewed. Homendy also tells me she is aware this plane had pressurization issues prior to this incident. So the question is what was done to fix that and could it have been a factor? There is a little bit of luck here. This incident happened at 16,000 feet. The flight was still climbing, not at its assigned cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, and Homendy says, it is fortunate that passengers were buckled in and the plane was only 10 minutes from getting back to the airport.

So that's interesting, and not terribly surprising, but just interesting to confirm that, like in cycles past, we have a lot of people who will be late breakers in this campaign.And also, it's just kind of interesting to see, especially this past weekend, there's a lot of activity going on. Interesting to see the increased attention, we're starting to see more people come out to these events, especially at Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis' events.

But to your question, I think that is the one big question left here in this last week is how much of that ground can Ron DeSantis and/or Nikki Haley make up and at least make that margin a little closer and come out of Iowa, maybe with some momentum going into New Hampshire and South Carolina. And we are seeing some evidence, like I said that the attention is a little greater on those two coming out of the holidays, the events that I went to this past weekend, there's a few more people coming out, and so that last minute shopping, so to speak, is happening in the caucuses, and it will be interesting to see, you know, do they just get a little bump and they're still down in the 20s or does someone manage to really close the gap?

I think in Nikki Haley's case, it is because she has sort of appeared to develop a multi early strength state strategy. So she wants to just do well enough here to then go on, and she is doing a little better in New Hampshire, a little bit in South Carolina, and kind of take the long play here.So that's why, you know, she can't just ignore Iowa all together, so she wants to just do well enough here to involve herself moving forward.   Meantime, Ron DeSantis has very heavily invested in Iowa, and that's why he's still hitting the road here, too, as he wants to pay that off. He has put a lot of time in here, he has put a lot of resources in here. He has a PAC supporting him here. His campaign really needs to have a nice night on January 15th to sort of pay off all of that investment and still have a shot at the nomination coming out of Iowa.",

They like Donald Trump. They want to see him in office for another four years. They like what he did before, they want to see it again, and there is a chunk of that, a percentage of that field that's just not going to move on that no matter what.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A child's lifeless body carefully pried from the rubble. Gaza civil defense says this is the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah, a city where tens of thousands are seeking shelter. Heeding evacuation orders like these dropped by the Israeli military this week. It's not just Deir al-Balah. Several cities where civilians have been told to flee have been hit by Israeli airstrikes in recent days, including this camp for displaced Palestinian in the southern city of Rafah. That city has been struck repeatedly this week even as makeshift camps have ballooned in recent months as seen and the satellite images. YAMEN AHMAD, DISPLACED GAZAN LIVING IN RAFAH (through translator): I have been displaced from one place to another, Bureij, Maghazi, Nuseirat, then we left the last place for the safety of our children. There is no safe place. DIAMOND (voice over): That brutal reality all too clear at the morgue, as families mourn. The Israeli military says that they struck more than a hundred targets across Gaza overnight, reporting fierce fighting and strikes on targets including Hamas command centers and rocket launch pads. Amid the strikes, some are once again on the move. Mattresses and blankets carried however they can, but fleeing Gaza is no guarantee of safety. The Nijem family who fled south from northern Gaza are the latest to learn that cruel lesson. MAZEN NIJEM, 10 FAMILY MEMBERS KILLED IN STRIKE (through translator): They told us to go to Maghazi where it is safe and we have nothing left. Where do we go? We only have God. DIAMOND (voice over): Seven-month-old Imad (ph) and nine other members of his family are now dead, killed in an Israeli airstrike according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. KHALED NIJEM, 10 FAMILY MEMBERS KILLED IN STRIKE (through translator): They told us to come to the center and that it is safe. We came here and nothing is safe. DIAMON (voice over): For many, that exhausting, elusive search for safety is over. All that remains is the pursuit of dignity. ABU ADNAN, DISPLACED GAZAN LIVING IN DEIR AL-BALAH (through translator): There are no toilets, no food, no water, no clothes. With all of this, I prefer to go back home and die with dignity than die in this way. DIAMOND (voice over): Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Turkish- Israeli relations have been somewhat strained as a consequence of these Hamas war, but I suspect Turkey remains to be a problematic ally when we're close to them and even when we're not.

It rejects deep cuts to programs hardworking families count on and provides a path to passing full year funding bills that deliver for the American people and are free of any extreme policies.\" He goes on to say: \"Now, congressional Republicans must do their job. Stop threatening to shut down the government and fulfill their basic responsibility to fund critical domestic and national security priorities, including my supplemental request. It's time for them to act.\" Now, the OMB Director Shalanda Young just on Friday had expressed some concern about the policy to get a funding agreement before that first funding deadline approaches on January 19th. That concern is due in part to the fact that some conservatives have threatened to try to use this government funding deadline to try to push forward some of the measures that they want to see enacted when it comes to stricter immigration and border policy. Of course, separately from this funding debate is also the talks about this additional funding that the president had requested for Israel, Ukraine, and border security. There are still those negotiations underway where the White House has made some concessions that they are willing to make when it comes to border security and in order to get that other funding passed, so that is something that the president referenced in this statement. But just because these funding levels have been agreed to does not mean that people are entirely in the clear from a shutdown just yet. As Manu noted, there are still a number of hurdles that need to be crossed, including getting those funding bills together and passed by January 19th, and then the February 2nd deadline, but also those concerns about whether conservatives will try to use this moment to try to push forth some of the immigration and border policy changes that they want to see made. But at this time, the White House is expressing some optimism about this, what the president is saying, that it does bring the country one step closer to averting a shutdown.",

All right, New York could become the first state to offer paid prenatal leave for pregnant women. Governor Kathy Hochul is proposing 40 hours of paid leave for prenatal care in her plan to improve maternal and infant health. Currently, infant mortality rates are increasing in the US and Black women in New York City are nine times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth than White women. Joining me right now to speak about all of this, Dr. Gigi, El-Bayoumi. Good to see you, Doctor. So how will Governor Hochul's proposal for paid prenatal leave help address these mortality rates in New York? DR. GIGI EL-BAYOUMI, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Well, first of all, Happy New Year and I'm glad that that's a start. I'm not sure how much it's going to impact, because if we look at the two drivers of infant and maternal mortality, one of them is the healthcare ecosystem, and we have some really awful statistics.

She has a worst outcome with her pregnancy than a woman who is a White high school dropout. So there is something in the health care system about how that woman is being treated, that impacts outcomes, so that's one. The second thing is what makes a pregnancy a healthy pregnancy? Well, the food that the woman eats; rest, making sure that she is sleeping adequately, that she doesn't have a lot of stress; housing, you know, all of these things, which are the social determinants of health. Only 20 percent of any healthcare outcome is actually linked to seeing us as clinicians. So I don't want to be a naysayer, I think that that's wonderful that there is a policy because it reflects putting maternal and child health as a priority, which is incredibly important. And, I shouldn't say but, and there are these other factors that we have to attend to. It is going to be a multi-pronged approach if we're really going to make a difference.",

And by having some sort of paid prenatal leave might allow for some of those things that you talked about, women to get more rest.While they're carrying, obviously, their bodies are going through all kinds of things, but then you're talking about, you know, getting to work handling and taking care of affairs at home and beyond. Do you see some real assets as to how this kind of home prenatal, you know, time off, can help? EL-BAYOUMI: Absolutely. First of all, it is giving everybody notice, including employers, that this is a priority, that these women will have time to take care of their own health and their baby's health. So if nothing else, that messaging is very important. And again, I don't want to say anything negative because that is a huge first step. That's putting this as a priority. So yes, no question, the stress of, oh, are they going to fire me or am I going to lose my job if I take this time out? So yes, that is important. And as with anything when you start off, this is sort of the first step and hopefully, other steps will come on, so we will have a really solid foundation. So kudos to her. I know that the governor is a mother herself and really said you know, this has to be a priority so I want to give her, her props.",

You know, I come from a culture when a women is pregnant, you're supposed to treat her like a queen because there is an understanding that the mother's mental health actually affects the baby's mental health. That is really important. So beginning to tie all of these other aspects of a woman's health not just when she is pregnant, really, but beforehand, which is key.",
