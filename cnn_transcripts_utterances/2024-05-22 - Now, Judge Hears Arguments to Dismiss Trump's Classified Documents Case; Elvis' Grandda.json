      "sentences": "And good morning you are live in the CNN newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now, a federal judge is considering whether to dismiss some of the criminal charges against former President Donald Trump in the classified documents case along with his co-defendants. Trump stands accused of retaining those documents or refusing to turn them over after leaving office. Last night, an unsealed opinion from another federal judge delivered a startling revelation in the case that Trump's attorneys found additional documents in his bedroom four months after the FBI's Mar-a- Lago raid. And take a look at this here, a new footage from the Department of Justice, Trump aide Walt Nauta is seen moving boxes just days before Trump's lawyers searched his Florida residence. That led Judge Howell to conclude there is, quote, strong evidence that Trump intended to hide boxes from his attorneys. The bid to throw out this case, we should note, comes after the former president scored a big win earlier this month with the Trump-appointed judge who postponed the trial and definitely drawing criticism from many legal experts. CNN's Evan Perez is outside the courthouse for us down in Florida. Evan, tell us what you know about this hearing.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, you know, one of these times when we come to these hearings by Judge Aileen Cannon, we might get a new trial date. We're, of course, going to be watching to see if that happens. That hearing, the first of two hearings, is now getting underway at the courthouse behind me.And we have a couple of different requests from the former president and from Walt Nauta, his aide and co-defendant, a couple of things. Nauta is asking for the charges against him, obstruction charges chiefly, to be tossed because he claims that this is a vindictive prosecution by the government. The former president and all of the defendants, they're asking for a lot of this evidence that the government has in this investigation to be tossed out in the case of the former president. He's saying that the evidence from the FBI search, that extraordinary search that happened at Mar-a-Lago two summers ago, that all of that evidence needs to be tossed, as well as testimony from Evan Corcoran, his former lawyer, who helped oversee the receiving of those subpoenas from the government for those documents to be turned over. Now, Jim, you know, ahead of this hearing, we saw those new documents, those pictures that, you know, The prosecution says are of Walt not a moving boxes before Evan Corcoran, the former president's attorney, I got a chance to search for those documents. We also saw, according to prosecutors, they said that there was a search that happened four months after the Mar-a-Lago search, and that during that search, there was a found classified documents, including a folder labeled classified evening summary. Four additional documents were found in the in an office there at Mar a Lago. And now all of this is what explains some of the mystery here behind the scenes, Jim, of why a judge ruled, that Evan Corcoran, the former lawyer for Donald Trump, why he needed to provide testimony. I'll read you just a part of what she says in approving that. She says that the government has proffered sufficient evidence that the former president used person 18, in this case that's Evan Corcoran, as a front man to obstruct the government investigation. Again, that hearing is now getting underway at the courthouse behind me, and we'll see, Jim, whether we hear more on these two motions that are being made in court today. Jim?",

And that's why we've seen a number of gag orders with regard to his current case in New York and other cases, right, where the president, perhaps, former president, is a little loose with the language.Just to be clear, to your original point, when you do a search warrant, obviously you in law enforcement, there are measures of protection around you. You do come, the FBI comes with a number of people on positions of authority carrying guns, et cetera. It's not a pleasant experience, but they're there, right, for a show of force to get what the warrant authorizes you to get, and in this case classified documents. I should also hasten to add that those are documents that, of course, they try to negotiate. That is the government with getting them back. And that's why one of the charges is willfully retaining, right, or some charges relating to willfully retaining documents. They tried. They couldn't. And so as a result, they have to execute a warrant to go and get them in the way that they did.",

There's no evidence to back that up. All right, Joey -- none whatsoever.Joey Jackson, thanks a lot, as always. I appreciate it. Also breaking another court case to tell you about the granddaughter of Elvis Presley is inside of Tennessee court right now fighting the foreclosure sale of Graceland.

The historic Memphis estate is reportedly worth hundreds of billions of dollars and is the nation's second most visited home after the White House. CNN's Isabel Rosales joins us now.

It does so much for our economy. We attract over 600,000 visitors each year to this city as a result of Graceland. And so we'll let the process play out.

But, you know, hey, guys, right? I'm kind of with you. Like I'm not with the Nazis, but if the Nazis are with me, that's okay. And that's what he does, the whole stand back and stand by with the Proud Boys. Look, if you want -- he would come on and say, well, I actually denounced him. I told him to stand back. Yes, okay. But then the Proud Boys -- I remember actually, I was in Vegas, not that long after he said that, and I saw some proud boys with a shirt that said, stand back and stand by. That's what he does.

And he is vowing harsh, punitive measures for the Palestinian Authority in response for this move by these three countries to recognize Palestine as a state. He is seeking the approval of tens of thousands of housing units in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. He wants to establish new settlements in the West Bank in response to this, and he's also calling for the cancelation of crossing permits for Palestinian Authority officials to be able to travel to Israel. He is also saying that he is going to withhold Palestinian tax revenue that is collected by the Israeli government, but that's supposed to go into Palestinian Authority coffers. That is a move that could have very, very serious ramifications for the Palestinian Authority, which is already quite cash-strapped. Despite all of that, the Palestinian Authority's president, Mahmoud Abbas, is calling for additional countries to continue to follow suit. He and other Palestinians believe that these moves of unilateral recognition only bolster the case for a Palestinian state, and he believes it could contribute to a two-state solution down the line. That's obviously a view that this Israeli government, which does not want a two-state solution, very much disagrees with. Jim?",
