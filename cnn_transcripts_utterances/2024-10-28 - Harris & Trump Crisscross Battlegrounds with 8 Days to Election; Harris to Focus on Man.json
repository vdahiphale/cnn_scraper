And these spaces gives her the opportunity to talk about what she describes as the opportunity economy and the different planks of that that include provisions for manufacturing jobs, like improving apprenticeships programs, as well as tax credits for American manufacturers. And this comes at a time when Democrats, more broadly, are saying that the Vice President needs to be doing just this, focusing on her vision for the country and why she wants to be vice president, not so much on the former president, because there are limitations to this argument and that most Americans essentially already know who he is and what he's about.

I do want to quickly read it to you because it really is one of the only times we've seen them distance themselves from remarks that were given at a Trump rally. They wroteNow, there they're specifically referring to the comedian, the opener of yesterday's Madison Square Garden rally. And the joke in particular was about Puerto Ricans saying essentially that Puerto Rico is a floating island of garbage. That received massive backlash, not just from Democrats, but also from Republicans. It could also be very politically silly to make those kind of remarks at a Donald Trump rally, given the fact that Puerto Ricans make up a large swath of voters in swing states, including critical state of Pennsylvania, where there are more than 400,000 Puerto Ricans who are going to head to the polls. And I've heard a lot of finger pointing from some of the Trump campaign, from some allies who said they couldn't believe that this speech wasn't vetted ahead of time. They couldn't believe that these jokes were approved, that they got out on the stage. Now I talked to one campaign advisor who said that this speech was not vetted entirely. Another one said that, yes, they did go through a speech and go through some of the jokes, but these jokes, particularly the one about Puerto Rico, was never actually in any paper that they had looked at, that this comedian was speaking off the cuff. But really the anger among these various allies is that they believe it overshadowed Donald Trump appearing at Madison Square Garden. He had a full house. He filled every single seat. There were standing ovations when it came to Donald Trump's messaging around immigration and crime. But all of that, of course, has been overshadowed by the coverage of the fact that there were so many vile, racist and sexist remarks leading up to Donald Trump speaking. Now, I am told that there's no formal plan right now for the former president to address any of these remarks in the pre-program. They're going to let this campaign statement speak for itself, not today in Georgia or tomorrow when he's actually in Pennsylvania. Of course, we'll be keeping an eye on whether or not that changes as Donald Trump takes the stage.",

But also, she said the crowd, they didn't mind. You were there. Did you mind? VIVEK RAMASWAMY, (R) FORMER 2024 PRESIDENT CANDIDATE: Look, the fact of the matter is, I wasn't in the room when that joke was made, but I got to say, we got to take a step back and look at the double standards here, Brianna. Let's be really honest. George Lopez made a joke at Kamala Harris' rally over the weekend about all Mexicans being thieves. Are we attributing that comment to Kamala Harris or querying all of her proxies who are at that rally? No, we're not. So I think we need to all get off our high horses and acknowledge that a bad joke was told. It was bad because it wasn't very funny. The audience didn't find it funny. The guys told other funny jokes in other places. This wasn't one of them. But the media manufacturing of outrage out of this is really just a double standard when you look at the exact kind of jokes being told at the Kamala Harris rally over the weekend.

One of the things I've done in my studies of the island meeting with leaders there is understand how they conduct elections in Puerto Rico. And I think we have a lot to learn from them where they do have single voting on - single day voting on election day as a holiday for the island. They use paper ballots and other election security measures that we don't use in the United States. So for our part, speaking to Puerto Ricans, what I want to say is we have a lot to learn from Puerto Rico, including the way they run elections. But yes, we have to win this election in order to get there. And so play by the rules we have legally to the fullest extent allowed.

If we get to voter ID laws that match the voter file and have single day voting on Election Day as a national holiday, I'm done and anybody else in the Republican Party should be done as well. And the Democratic Party, too, in complaining about election integrity, do it the way Puerto Rico does it. And if they do it in Puerto Rico, we can do it in the rest of the United States and turn this page so that we're not talking about this issue. But the fact that voter ID laws are themselves controversial with the left reveals that there is a real issue here, that if a voter ID law is deemed racist and you're not even allowed to talk about advocating for that without undergoing this kind of grilling, that reveals a real issue and loss of public trust that I do believe we need to fix to unite this country. That's my hope.

So that's where he's coming from, obviously no fan of Musk. But in his eyes, this is unlawful and needs to be shut down to maintain the integrity of the election. Let me read for you a little bit from the lawsuit filed this morning, quote, \"Running an illegal lottery and violating consumer protections is ample basis for an injunction and concluding that America PAC and Musk must be stopped, immediately, before the upcoming election.\" Went on to say that America PAC and Musk hatched their illegal lottery scheme to influence voters in the election. So their plea to this judge is to shut this down ASAP before it can continue to influence voters. Musk and his team have not responded in court yet. Obviously, they don't think they're doing anything wrong because we asked them for comments and their response was a tweet, which was the announcement of the latest million dollar winner announced this morning in Michigan.",

They've been challenging pretty much every aspect of elections, including rules for mail-in ballots. We've talked about that here, including overseas ballots. Historically, others were predominantly military ballots. Now, actually, civilian expats outnumber military ballots, and that is a concern for some members of the GOP. They've gone after election certification rules. Now, this is something they, of course, tried to exploit back in 2020. They've also focused a lot on noncitizen voting. Just today, we saw the Virginia case go all the way up to the Supreme Court, unclear if the justices will weigh in. They've also taken aim at poll workers. They've gone after pretty much any aspect of the election you can imagine. But overall, they've had some successes, but mostly either they've had losses or cases that were just stalled.

You file a lawsuit, maybe you don't pursue it, but if things don't go the way you hope for your candidate after November 5th, you can go back and try to resurrect that and challenge either ballots that were counted or were not counted or rules.
