Well, we're about find out. She's expected to make an announcement regarding her future on the House floor today. It is unclear what she's going to say. A source says Nancy Pelosi has two different versions of her speech. Speculation about her future has intensified in the aftermath of the midterm elections. The balance of power in the House has officially shifted. CNN projects that Republicans will take control of the chamber with a very slim majority. President Biden was quick to reach across the aisle and congratulate GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is in line to succeed Nancy Pelosi as speaker. Now, the president says that he's willing to work with anyone who is willing to work with him. House Republicans are expected to make investigations into the Biden administration a priority.

Beginning last spring, the White House and key agencies began hiring officials to handle what they expect will be a deluge of Republican oversight requests should Republicans take control of Congress. You can see some key hires at the White House as well as at the Justice Department and also the Department of Homeland Security.At the White House, a team of lawyers, legislative affairs specialists and communication strategists, they have been mapping out where these Republican investigations are going to go. They've been doing so by going through hundreds of Republican oversight letters to the White House and key agencies. They've been watching the likely incoming chairman of the House Judiciary and House Oversight Committee to see where they're planning to go with these investigations. Those Republicans have really been telegraphing their strategy. And another thing that the White House has been doing is meeting with agencies to ensure that they are on the same page. One of those meetings I'm told took place more than four months before Election Day with top officials from the White House as well as the Department of Homeland Security, meeting inside the Roosevelt Room to go over what their strategy would be. The White House wanted to ensure that agencies were prepared, particularly DHS, but similar meetings took place with the State Department, with the Justice Department, and the Defense Department as well.",

And one of the reasons I mentioned that meeting with the Department of Homeland Security is that they are viewed as one of the top targets of Republicans, in particular, the DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas. Republicans have been threatening for months the potential of impeaching him over his handling of the border. There's no question that they will look into that. But as you saw that list on the screen, there's border security, there's COVID-19, there is the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.Now, the way that the White House and these agencies choose to respond to these requests is largely going to be based on what they see as the validity of those requests, whether they give the White House time to actually gather the documents and respond. But make no mistake about it. The White House is very prepared to forcefully respond and push back on those requests that they see as overreach, especially when they believe that these are mainly just intended as political attacks to damage the president.",

That's certainly something that the Russians seem to be enjoying hearing. One of the things that the Kremlin spokesman said, we actually just got out of a conference call with him a couple minutes ago, he said that he praised President Biden for showing restraint in reaction to what happened there in Poland. Obviously, President Biden coming out fairly early and saying that it seems as though the rocket or the missile that landed there on Polish territory, that that seems to have been launched by Ukraine.But then the Russians ripping into the Ukrainians and the Poles as well accusing them of hysteria and trying to essentially drag NATO into a full-on conflict with the Russians. So, you can see the Russians really trying to capitalize on that. It was quite interesting, because  in the phone call as well, he was asked about the fact that NATO allies are saying that, ultimately, Russia bears responsibility for this because, of course, the Russians unleashed that war in Ukraine and also are doing those cruise missile strikes across the country that's damaging critical infrastructure there. The Russians essentially trying to play that back at the U.S., saying, look, if NATO had done more to restrain Ukraine in the past and taken Russia's security concerns into account, this war wouldn't have happened either, so you can really the Russians trying to throw that back at the U.S. There's one other thing that we also learned, which I think is also really important, Don. He was also asked whether or not there could be a lull in fighting in the winter. Because right now with those attacks on the critical infrastructure, you do have a lot of people, of course, freezing in Ukraine and he simply said that the weather will not stop what Russians call their special military operations. So, it certainly seems as though no hope that the war might wind down or go slower in winter, Don.",

Because he said when there's an opportunity, they should seize it. But then you have National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who said, no, no, no, no, when he was asked in recent days. He said the position of the Biden administration is that the United States is going to strengthen Ukraine's hand in the war and then they will seek diplomacy. They will seek a political solution when they want to. The United States isn't going to make that determination for them. So, it's pretty striking that Milley came out just yesterday and sort of doubled down on what he said even though it doesn't match the approach of the Biden administration at large here.And we should note that it has sent some Ukrainians with questions as to who to listen to in the Biden administration, even though President Biden himself has been very clear saying the Ukrainians are going to dictate any political solution here, any diplomatic solution here.

You're welcome back in January when you make the presidential announcement as well.But let's talk about something significant happening in the Senate right now and the fact that they're about to vote with the support of 12 Republican senators to enshrine the right to same-sex marriage federally. And it is a narrow bill, right? It wouldn't force any state to perform same-sex marriage but just recognize legal same-sex marriages from other states, and I wonder if you support it.",

And so the federal legislation made it clear, perhaps, and so it wouldn't -- it's not going to change what we have at Arkansas and I certainly support the continuation of the recognizing of that constitutional right.",
