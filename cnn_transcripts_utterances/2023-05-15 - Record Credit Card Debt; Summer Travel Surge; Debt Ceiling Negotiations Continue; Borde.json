Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in the United Kingdom enlisting serious financial and military support from British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. It's the latest stop on Zelenskyy's tour through Europe. He's been meeting with key NATO leaders ahead of Ukraine's planned counteroffensive. He says his country needs a little bit more time to prepare for that major assault. Meantime, back on the battlefield, Russian troops are facing some real setbacks. Several Russian aircraft have been shot down, and Ukrainians recaptured more territory in Bakhmut, the site of a brutal monthslong battle. Let's take you now live to Ukraine and CNN's Sam Kiley. Sam, it sounds like President Zelenskyy is leaving Western Europe with some serious advantages and assurances.",

From the British, he got long-range attack drones, more ammunition, more air defenses. But what he didn't get, which is what he's been asking for, have been F-16s. It seems that the Ukrainians have focused down their desires to get F-16, rather than a number of other potential European aircraft. That is the kind of ultimate workhorse of the U.S. Air Force that they would like to see deployed here. It's a standard NATO aircraft. All the weapons will work with it. And they really, really desperately say that they need it. But, so far, they have also got Storm Shadow cruise missiles, an Anglo-French development given by the British, all intended to give them the strategic capability to go after the Russian forces, not just on the front line, but behind the lines inside the territory of Ukraine, but still deeper in. Now, the reference to these reported downing of four aircraft, two helicopters and two jets, inside Russian territory, it's a very murky situation indeed. We don't even know, Victor (sic), for example, whether or not it was Ukrainians who shot them down or whether it was an own goal by Russian air defenses, because very close to the border there. But this all adds up to sort of chaos and friction, nervousness -- nervousness and anxiety in the ranks of Russian forces, which, of course, is being reinforced now by successful offensives being conducted on two flanks around this town of Bakhmut, where the Ukrainians have enjoyed a degree of success in a counteroffensive, after many months of very, very slow, grinding losses and loss of territory, very, very slow losses of territory. They're able to recapture it very rapidly. And that is all sending that message to Russian forces on the ground to make them anxious about what the Ukrainians are going to throw at them next, Victor (sic).",

Boris.So this is, according to \"Washington Post\" reporting that's based on leaked intelligence documents that had leaked on to Discord, that social media app for gamers. And, according to these documents -- as you said, this happened in late January. Yevgeny Prigozhin -- the head of that private Russian military group that is fighting on behalf of Russia alongside the Russian military in Ukraine, reached out to commanders in Ukraine and offered to them that, if they were willing to withdraw some Ukrainian troops from around the area of Bakhmut, that he would share with them Russian military positions. Now, we don't know exactly what positions he was going to share, what troop movements on the Russian side he is privy to, but, according to two Ukrainian sources who talked to \"The Washington Post\" and were familiar with this incident, there was no agreement that was struck, because, of course, they were skeptical of the offer that Prigozhin was offering them. They really didn't know exactly what he could deliver on. And, as you said, Prigozhin today is coming out on Telegram denying this, suggesting that this could have been leaked by his enemies. But, critically, we're also hearing from the Kremlin, and the Kremlin spokesperson saying that they don't have the authority to speak to these reports, and also saying -- quote -- \"It looks like another hoax.\" But what we're watching for here, Boris, is any actual response from the Kremlin. We know that Prigozhin and Putin have quite a close relationship, but if this offer was actually made without knowledge of the Kremlin, that could result in quite a sticky situation. And so we will watch to see how this plays out. This obviously happened in late January, so there's been a lot of time since then. So there's a lot to watch after this report -- Boris.",

Federal officials said that border officers have actually seen a 50 percent drop in encounters with undocumented people, compared to the numbers right before Title 42 ended. CNN's Polo Sandoval, he is down in El Paso, Texas. Polo, I wonder what officials there attribute this to, this, well, 50 percent drop, rather than the surge many have been expecting.",

      "sentences": "Well, the messaging for the Biden administration is what some people think here. It was really kind of a deterrent for so many people on the Mexican side.But in terms of like the main headline here on the ground, Jim, it's that those apprehensions, as you noted, they are down, significantly down. But the system itself, it is still strained. And all you have to do is walk through this particular block in downtown El Paso, and I say this particular one because this isn't really widespread. What we saw overnight were perhaps dozens of recently released migrants. These are people who had been processed by federal authorities. And now they wait here in a state of limbo. Most of the people that I have seen out here on this sidewalk are adults, single adults, male and female, perhaps one family that you might be able to see here to my left, but a bulk of the families have been able to shelter indoors. But it really speaks to the bigger issue, which is those folks that are processed and then released. These are people in the sort of a state of limbo because they are waiting to secure passage to major American cities. I keep hearing over and over again that Denver is going to be their next stop. Most of these folks, though, they're staying. They're sort of lingering here, waiting for either friends or family that are still in detention to be released, and then, together, they can proceed onto their final destination. So that is why you will still see some asylum seekers, some migrants here in El Paso. But the numbers that we have seen the last several days, they do not compare to what our colleagues Ed Lavandera and Rosa Flores showed us about this time last week, when you just saw people throughout the downtown area. So, the key metric to watch will be the rate of release at which DHS processes -- process -- the process that they're going through under Title 8. And then those that are released into the United States, they will likely end up here before they head to cities like Denver and, as you and I know, New York City as well.",

So if they don't see that they can use one of the tools that the administration has put out to legally migrate, they may try to cross.So that is what the administration officials are watching. They held a briefing moments ago, where they said that it was -- quote -- \"very fluid still.\" I mean, we were talking about 10,000 daily encounters at the beginning of last week. Over the weekend, they were just under 5,000. That's a considerable difference. It gives them time to breathe and continue to set preparations in place, for example, capacity, which has already been under strain. But it was very clear. A top Homeland Security official said he cannot draw any firm conclusions. So they're very much still watching this. And, still, there is anxiety that it could change in the days to come. But, of course, Jim, this is not just a border story or a border issue for this White House. It is also an issue in the interior of the United States. You heard it there from Polo. Migrants want to go to cities across the U.S. They always have. But, of course, if there's more crossing, there's more people that are going to different cities as they go through their immigration court process. So we heard this morning from a -- from the Denver mayor, who was cautiously optimistic, but still said that he has concerns for the White House. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL HANCOCK (D), MAYOR OF DENVER, COLORADO:  Let me also share with you that five of us mayors, including Mayor Adams of New York, D.C., Chicago and Denver, have joined together in a letter to the White House that arrives today requesting a meeting with the president, so we can sit and be very specific with him on what we need to help our cities deal with this influx of migrants, and particularly as he continues to try to communicate with Congress about what they need to do to step up to the responsibility of federal government on this issue.

Remember, the White House did not want to have negotiations at all on raising the debt limit. They said, simply, the Congress needs to move ahead and raise the debt ceiling without any conditions to avoid the process of debt default. That's not the view of Kevin McCarthy, the speaker instead pushing for significant spending cuts. They attached those spending cuts to a plan that passed the Republican-led House narrowly just a few weeks ago. And now they're trying to figure out some sort of resolution in the middle. But can they get there? It remains unclear. And, this morning, Kevin McCarthy made clear that he believes there's a long way to go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

AAA predicts 37 million of those 42 million people traveling 50 miles or more will travel by car, that number up about 1 percent from what we saw last year, really only off 1 percent from pre-pandemic figures. Really helped by that is the fact that gas prices are lower, the average price for a gallon of regular, $3.54 right now. It was $4.47 for an average gallon of regular this time last year. The worst times to travel, according to AAA, Boris, 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on the Friday before Memorial Day, then everybody coming back all at once, noon to 3:00 p.m. on Monday. But we also have to talk about flying. Those numbers are going to be up above pre-pandemic levels. AAA anticipates up by about 11 percent compared to the same period over 2019.

The New York Fed report found that consumer debt since the end of 2019 is up by nearly $3 trillion. Now, we know that, in 2020, the Fed slashed interest rates to basically zero to try to get people to borrow. Now they have reversed course, right? They're spiking interest rates to discourage borrowing and try to put out this inflation fire. And yet we are seeing that borrowing is up pretty much across the board. The New York Fed report found that, over the last 12 months, mortgage debt is up by about a trillion dollars to $12 trillion, student debt, auto loans, and, yes, credit cards, all of them rising.
