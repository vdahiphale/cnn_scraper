Also, Congress has started the clock, on TikTok, the House overwhelmingly passing a bill that would ban it nationwide. And President Biden says he'll sign it if it reaches his desk. But that's a big if. We'll take a look at the national security threats, as well as the political threats, if lawmakers cut off the app that is used by 170 million Americans. Also tonight, a potential Trump running mate is posting about her brand-new teeth. The South Dakota's governor is now facing ethical questions, about that new smile. We'll dig into that video that some are calling downright bizarre. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Fresh off of clinching the Republican nomination for President, as he did last night, it was the win that very few people saw coming. Not even really Donald Trump. The judge that is presiding over his election conspiracy case, in Georgia, has now dropped six of the 41 counts, in that indictment against Trump and his co-defendants. Three of those six charges that were dismissed were pending against Trump himself, including the one that was tied to that infamous phone call that we all remember to Georgia's Secretary of State, after Trump lost the 2020 election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So look, all I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.

But he also made sure to note, and this is important here, I'm quoting Judge Scott McAfee. He said \"This does not mean the entire indictment is dismissed.\"The heart of this case, in fact, really, the vast bulk of it does still remain intact, and Donald Trump is still facing 10 criminal counts in Georgia. Meanwhile, there could be a bigger decision coming in that state though, in the next 48 hours. The judge is still weighing, whether or not to remove the District Attorney, Fani Willis, from this case, over those accusations of a conflict of interest that stemmed from a romantic relationship that she had, with the lead prosecutor she hired on that case. Judge McAfee confirmed to CNN today, and we rarely hear from him outside the courtroom, that he is still on track to issue that decision, this week. I'm joined now by CNN Legal Analyst and former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore; and CNN Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor, Jennifer Rodgers. And Michael, let me just start with you, since all this is happening in your home state. What did you make of Judge McAfee's rationale for dismissing these charges?",

      "sentences": "Well, I'm glad to be with both of you.This, what was filed by the defense is a very standard motion that's filed by defendants, in many cases, in Georgia. It's a demurrer, or a challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment. And the law says that a defendant is entitled to an indictment. It's basically perfect in form and substance. And so, the judge simply looked at it. He said, look, you've got this, these allegations in the indictment, that where you're saying he tried to solicit people to violate their oath. But you need to tell me what part of their oath, what part of the constitutional provisions -- whether it's a state constitution or federal constitution provisions, as they take an oath to uphold both. You've got to spell that out in the indictment, so that the defendants have some knowledge, before they go to trial, of what they may have to prepare and present a defense against. So, while it's a significant win, I think, for the defendants, it certainly is not fatal to the entire indictment. And the District Attorney, as a matter of fact, can go back and re- indict and claim those charges up, or there could be an appeal of the judge's ruling or, frankly, they could just move forward, because so many of these allegations are wrapped up in the RICO charges. We've heard about that. Those charges stand.",

That tells me, frankly, that he is probably thinking this case is not getting tried this year. He would have no problem with some delay, through the appeals process on that.

RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Unfortunately, I think, the TikTok CEO is getting into trouble once again. He made similar representations, on Capitol Hill, which proved to be false. He made three, at least three representations which were false. First, he claimed that American user data is stored only in America and Singapore. That turned out to be false. Some of it is stored on PRC servers, including sensitive financial information. Secondly, he claimed that ByteDance employees in China have no access, to the data of Americans. Again, false. It turns out that ByteDance employees in China routinely access this data, even unbeknownst to TikTok USA employees. And then, the third representation he made, before Congress, is that this data has not been weaponized against Americans. Again, that's false.

And so, what we're saying and what we expect is that once this bill were to become law, that essentially ByteDance would then sell off enough ownership, to get below the 20 percent threshold that's specified in the law. And then, the app would continue to operate as it is right now. This is not without precedent. Let me just point out one thing. Grindr, a very popular LGBTQ dating app, was once owned by a Chinese company. Once the United States government recognized that the CCP had access to sensitive data, about LGBTQ members of the U.S. military and the government, it forced the divestment.
