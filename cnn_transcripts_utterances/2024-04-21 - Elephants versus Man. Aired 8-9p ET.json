What makes this scene feel even more out of joint is that the elephants they're parading here are also objects of worship. This is about harnessing their power, adorning them for a wider spectacle.This is Perahera, the Festival of the Sacred Tooth. It fills the streets of the Sri Lankan city of Kandy every year with 10 nights of flame, dance and elephants. When Buddha died and was cremated, the story goes, his left canine tooth was found in the ashes. It became a symbol of great power in Sri Lanka but the power on show here is uglier. Our power over nature, and the damage we are doing to our world daily. So much of it to forests, oceans, glaciers, things that cannot fight back. But elephants, uprooted, forced from their homes by our unhinged expansion, have become a violent sign of nature repelling us. We need it, we revere it. But just look at how we brutalize it. In our acts of admiration here, we cause some great stress and pain. The parade is blocked as one elephant has gone astray. They have to pin it down. The chains are aimed at pulling the legs apart, painfully, limiting movement. Police tell us to stop filming and move back.

The human decision was simple. The president at the time toured rural areas asking people what they wanted. Here someone said a lake. It's incredible at night how the building just never seems to stop and quite wise even need it out here just don't get to really understand.

And it is often horrific. We got a call to come quickly. Two hours away a 4-year-old female elephant has been shot. It was night, and she had entered a farm field. We don't know who shot her. They might be among the onlookers.Guns are mostly illegal, but shooting elephants definitely is, except it happens a lot. There are signs she's been in trouble before. The green antiseptic from earlier vet treatment also on her knee. Because this is a chest wound there is not much they can do. Water and straw to keep her fed but really time is not her friend here. More of it won't heal her. They built a plastic sheeting shelter for her to keep the sun away. The vet in this Buddhist countries seldom euthanize animals so they must just wait. This is the closest these children say they've ever been to an elephant. We later learned it took another three nights and two days for her to die. Yet nature is capable of similar violence. We learned back in (INAUDIBLE) father was killed by an elephant. They were both security guards near the reservoir project we saw earlier.

But the facts here say it's basically a reflection of the fact that she thinks food is coming and some elephants have very different personalities. They think Arati (PH) is perhaps a little grumpy. (Voice-over): They fed human baby formula in huge quantities. But the number of orphans coming here is rising year-on-year. Ever more, showing signs of being wounded by humans or in these cases perhaps losing their parents to the conflict. These are the rare few who get patched back together again. Most of the time, elephants just die quietly in the wild from their wounds. About 50 are here, feeding time is noisy. And to help its funding a spectacle, too. The paradox here is keeping them alive using the human tools they have while nudging them back towards the wild. This one, Sapuma (PH), is missing part of his lower jaw. A survivor of the so- called jaw bomb, explosives deliberately hidden in vegetables by humans as a trap, detonating when the elephants bite them. He may need a tube for some time more and may never eat like the rest of them. But even this doesn't stop this little guy butting in. Now the game. Humans administering who gets human baby formula. It's about as far from nature as they could get. Some like Lamar (PH) will never truly live in the wild again. This 13-year-old lost the bottom part of his leg to a snare. And now we have made him a prosthetic foot. He feeds apart from the others, lives apart from them, too. In this heat, they give him a washdown, a powerhouse, also something he'd never feel in nature. Human charity here is a response to its own brutality. Fixing our own errors. The sanctuary adjoins the lake, where people also wash. The amputees seems to have adjusted to coexistence. It's a man who helps him bathe here, who is his companion, and another man who put him in this position. It's pretty clear who is winning the avoidable battle between man and elephant. Their victims who strike back who done submit quietly. And so let us see the violence we are doing to nature. They're a warning sign of how perilous our survival is. pf how deeply we are disrupting a planet that lets us feed, breathe, and drink, and how lonely and barren our immediate future here could be.
