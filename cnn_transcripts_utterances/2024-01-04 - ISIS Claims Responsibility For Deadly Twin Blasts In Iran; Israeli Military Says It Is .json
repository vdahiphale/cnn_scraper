      "sentences": "All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. My colleague, Bianna Golodryga is off today. You are indeedwatching ONE WORLD. We want to begin with breaking news just into CNN. ISIS is now claiming responsibility for the deadly twin blasts in Iran. ISIS claiming responsibility for the deadly twin blasts in Iran. Wednesday's blasts, which happened near the grave of Iranian Quds Force commander, General Qasem Soleimani, killed more than 80 people and left scores injured. The terror group says that two suicide bombers were indeed responsible. It happened in Kerman in Iran. I want to bring in International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson -- joins us live now from Tel Aviv. So, Nic, clearly ISIS is a Sunni group, so it would make sense why they would want to target a majority Shia country. But just explain to us why this location -- why the tomb of General Qasem Soleimani on the four-year anniversary of his death, when mourners would have been gathering there -- what would be that specific motivation with that target? NIC ROBERTSON CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera):  ISIS typically not worried about killing innocent civilians and just killing people as they said that they killed 300 poly atheists -- they mean Shias. The Iranian official death toll was 84, there were almost 300 injured. But -- and it's not unusual, I have to say, for ISIS figures to be inflated. But in that context, ISIS is quite happy hitting a large gathering of people. But to your specific point, why choose this large gathering of people? Well, ISIS saw Qasem Soleimani, who was the head of the Quds Force, the IRGC, the top military body, if you will, in Iran, the head of their Quds Force, which was responsible for its international operations. And ISIS saw him as responsible for cracking down on ISIS. So he was a nemesis of theirs, and therefore a commemoration of his death would be a logical target for them. Why this year? Why not previous years? Why now, in amidst everything else that is going on in Gaza and Hamas, looking to -- which is predominantly a Sunni group that's looking towards Iran for support -- why should another predominantly Sunni group attack Iran? This is ISIS's own doing. They are fringe and extreme to a very, very strong degree. But I think that does explain why they've gone after this target -- this group of people at this time. That said, there are some elements in their narrative that don't quite add up, not just the figures of the death toll, but it's quite usual for ISIS to overstate the death toll. But they claim two suicide bombers perpetrated this attack. Now, just yesterday, Iranian officials said their first analysis was that it was a suitcase bomb that was the first bomb remotely detonated. So, the Iranian assessment was not suicide bombers for at least one of those bombs. So, that's in a variance with what ISIS is saying. But again, ISIS quite typically rags and overstates its claims but the target does seem to be one that they would very likely, potentially choose.",

And, of course, the death toll now is topping 22,000. These developments prompting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to head to the Middle East. He is making his fourth trip there since October 7th. I want to bring back our International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson, in Tel Aviv, and also joining us is CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent, Alexander Marquardt, in Washington. Alex, let me start with you, because I just laid out there all the different facets, of course, when it comes to the regional tensions. Many people are describing it as a tinderbox right now.

We don't have the exact details yet on Blinken's trip. We know that he will be going to Israel, which almost certainly means the West Bank, but we can imagine that he will be going to other countries in the region, as well, that don't only have relevance when it comes to the fight between Israel and Hamas, but also in helping the U.S. tamp down the temperature in the region to try to make sure that this conflict doesn't expand. So, that could mean Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, among others. So, certainly, the war between Israel and Hamas is front of mind. But, as you say, there are significant fears when we see what's happening -- going on in the Red Sea with the Houthis, the fighting between Israel and the various factions in Lebanon, and then, of course, the Iran-backed proxy groups in Iraq and Syria that continue to carry out attacks against U.S. forces and coalition forces in the region. But Zain, when it comes to Israel, the message is going to be one that we have heard before from other U.S. officials. And this really is notable to see this parade of U.S. officials who have recently visited Israel, whether it was Jake Sullivan, the National Security Adviser, and the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin just before New Year's. Today, we have Amos Hochstein, who is the top envoy for energy who is in Israel, and now Secretary Blinken going there -- all to convey this message of -- they say not pressuring Israel, but asking hard questions. And it's clear that the Biden administration wants to see the civilian death -- the impact on civilians in Gaza to lessen, that the Biden administration has been horrified by the high number of civilian casualties, the difficulties of humanitarian aid being delivered to Gazans. So, that message will continue, of course. Major questions about whether that message is actually landing as we continue to see this death toll go up, continue to see this fighting. The administration really does want to see a shift in Israel's approach from what they've been calling this high- intensity phase that we see right now to a lower-intensity phase in the near future.

Buckingham Palace is not commenting on Prince Andrew's name appearing in documents unsealed as part of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The release comes four years after Epstein died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Other famous names also appear in these papers, as well. But it is important to note that the fact that a person is mentioned in these documents is in no way an indication of any wrongdoing. Shimon Prokupecz has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Long-awaited documents finally released. The first batch of sealed court filings pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public Wednesday. The documents stemmed from a civil defamation lawsuit brought in 2015 against Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Prominent figures, including Prince Andrew and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, included in a 2016 deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, a former employee of Epstein. She says in the document that she and Epstein had a conversation and quote,\" He said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls.\" When asked if Clinton was a friend of Epstein's, she said she understood Epstein had, quote, \"dealings with Clinton\". Clinton has not been accused of any crimes or wrongdoing related to Epstein and has denied any kind of criminal activity. But in 2019 he admits to having flown on Epstein's private plane but knew nothing of the financiers quote, 'terrible crimes\". Sjoberg also recalled the time she was with Epstein on one of his planes and pilots said he needed to land in Atlantic City. Jeffrey said, \"Great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to -- I don't recall the name of the casino, but we'll go to the casino.\" She says in the deposition, she never gave a massage to Trump. This is the first reference to Donald Trump, but he is not accused of any wrongdoing. LISA BRYANT, DIRECTOR \"JEFFREY EPSTEIN: FILTHY RICH\":  Right now, the only person who has been prosecuted is a woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, who certainly, you know, should be behind bars. But it's interesting in this, you know, network of all these men who have been trafficking young women and underage women for decades, and yet the only person that's been prosecuted, you know, is a woman. There are many, many other people that, you know, should be held accountable, as well. PROCUPECZ (voice-over):  The documents also contain excerpts of depositions taking of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who previously reached an out-of-court settlement in her sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew. Giuffre alleged in her deposition that Maxwell directed her to have sexual contact with people including former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Prince Andrew and Tech Guru Marvin Minsky. Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell said in a statement on Wednesday, \"She has consistently and vehemently maintained her innocence.\" This is the first set of documents to be unsealed under a December 18 court order with more expected in the coming weeks. The documents are expected to include nearly 200 names including some of Epstein's accusers, prominent business people and politicians. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And when you say seal, it means to really protect it from public view. The judge made a determination initially back in 2015 with the Giuffre lawsuit that was settled in 2017. The judge making an initial determination that those documents would be sealed. Why? To protect the privacy of most of which were victims at the time, to protect the personal interests of those who were involved in the litigation with the understanding that they would be released on a date certain. Now, that time has come. The judge saying and giving the indication that they would be released was mindful of the fact that this is information that is already in the public discourse, so that there's no real bombshells in terms of wow, really? So, the judge feeling that a lot of it is already out there. For those few victims who were not already out there, they are still subject to redactions. That's a fancy, legal way of saying that you'll still see their names blacked out, which is to mean you won't see their names at all. So, for the protection and preservation of the victims, they were sealed. That time has since passed. And we know these initial documents, 40 of 250 have been released were ongoing. Taking a look to see what is inclusive in the remaining documents, 250 in total, we know a lot of people may be on edge in terms of the reputational damages, the, you know, professional damage, the personal damage that they can cause of they're on the list. It doesn't suggest because you're on any list that you've done anything wrong. But to be associated with Mr. Epstein, Zain, I just don't think that's what many people or any people are looking to be associated with at any point in time.",

LAVANDERA (voice-over):  The White House is increasingly facing pressure from both Republicans and Democratic mayors and governors on the need for real solutions to the immigration crisis.

Most migrants say they're just trying to escape the hardships they left behind. Like Kenny Contreras from Ecuador, who says his country is plagued by violence and extortion. And this migrant from Liberia, who says he spent $15,000 to reach the U.S. border.",
