You can see the place has been ransacked. Shattered glass and debris cover the grounds. Medical personnel fear that outbreaks of diseases are likely. Now on Friday, the Haitian government extended a curfew in the country through Sunday. According to a government statement, police have been ordered to use, \"all legal means\" to enforce the curfew and stop public demonstrations. On Thursday, armed men attacked the home of Haiti's national police director and set the place on fire. Now, it doesn't appear that anyone was hurt. On the humanitarian front, authorities in the Dominican Republic said the transport of aid and United Nations non-essential personnel could get underway next week. An air bridge would have two connection points in the Dominican Republic and one near Port of Prince. Officials are said to be finalizing the details of the plan. And the state of Florida is now collecting the names and information of Americans stranded in Haiti. The portal, run by the Division of Emergency Management, features a questionnaire asking for the location where a person needs to be rescued from. The U.S. State Department has also directed U.S. citizens in Haiti to fill out a form with information on the embassy's website. Now in October, Florida officials did something similar in Israel. The state contracted with private organizations to fly Americans out of Israel following the October 7th attacks when commercial flights were canceled out of Israel. It's unclear if Florida will try the same rescue efforts in Haiti. The country's main airport in Port-au-Prince remains closed, though CNN has learned it could soon reopen. Danny and Amara.

The holdup was the department was Homeland Security and specifically funding over a border wall. They seem to have come to an agreement not to make any change in policy on that, and just use a one-year continuing resolution on that portion, which was kind of the last hold up. But they are still negotiating furiously. I was just talking with some folks yesterday about this. One key difference why I think it will get done is Speaker Mike Johnson, who had voted against keeping the government open when he was not the Speaker has really been pushing to get this done by Friday, and he does not want a government shutdown on his watch, now that he is the Speaker. I would also note that this is not some great accomplishment. This should have been done last year. We're already in the budget year that started October 1st, and we still don't have this legislation done. And it would -- if they do finish it this this week, we're going to be coming right up again on the next budget cycle. So, I mean, this is well, well, well overdue. They pick the can five times, as you said, and so, it's not as though we're seeing some monumental accomplishment here. This is stuff that should have done last year.",

But they do not have the votes.They haven't been able to find the evidence to convince enough House Republicans that they should vote to impeach him. So, what's under discussion now is to essentially send a letter to the Justice Department that they will call a criminal referral. And in that letter, they would name certain things that they think the Justice Department should investigate. That way, they don't have to put the impeachment vote to the floor and lose. They already had a losing vote on one impeachment, the first time they tried to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. That was very embarrassing. They have lost seats since then. They have fewer House Republicans now, it seems less likely that they can muster the votes to actually vote to impeach Biden. So, they are in a tough situation.",

And those that are running on the ballot paper are those who are close to him. There are obviously questions about what happens and is going on in the occupied territories of Ukraine, where Ukrainians with Ukrainian passports are still being encouraged to vote.
