There's a much larger group now that is not necessarily calling for a full ceasefire, but maybe humanitarian pauses.

But I think the case the White House is trying to make is that, privately and through diplomacy and all these things that Biden has very experienced in, he is trying to, you know, steer a more careful course with this policy with Israel and with, you know, their degree of support for Israel's offensive. That's a little bit harder of a case to make. And you see from the polls that some Democratic voters certainly do not believe that or at least are on the fence about it.
