We are traveling to three states to talk with all American about what is at stake in this election, but doing it through the lens of a very important point that what is at stake in this election is so fundamental that it really does cross partisan lines. We are talking about whether you will have a president United States to take seriously their duty and their oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.And there is a clear distinction here, which is that I will, and he will not as evidenced by many statements he has made, including his intention to be a dictator on day one, his intention to weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies. And then you just look at what the people who know him best and worked with him in the Oval Office, in the White House, have said about him, which is he is unfit to serve and would be dangerous if he were president again, and he even by the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has been called a fascist to his core. I am quoting. So what we are talking with folks about today is what I've been talking with folks about since I've been on campaign trail these last 70-odd days which is this is a choice for the American people. And it is a choice between whether we're going to chart a new way forward that turns the page on the division, the hate, the chaos of Donald Trump. But also, and maybe even more fundamentally, do we have a president of the United States who stands behind the seal of the president of the United States, taking seriously their oath and their duty to uphold the Constitution of the United States and abide by the rule of law. And so, I'm out here talking with folks to remind them of what's at stake. And I'm very pleased and honored that so many people are showing up to these events to have this conversation because I think they know regardless of who they voted for in the last election and the party with which they're registered to vote on some issues. We just have to all be Americans and put party aside.",

And what we saw is in so-called red states and so-called blue states when the issue of the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body is on the ballot, the American people vote for freedom, regardless of the party with which they are registered to vote. And I do believe in a such a fundamental issue which is understanding you don't have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling women what to do with their body so I do believe it is a compelling issue, especially when we consider the fact that for so many of us, our daughters are going to have fewer rights than their grandmother and America's strength -- one of the attributes of our progress has been the expansion of rights, not the restriction of rights. And that's what we're seeing happen and it has happened because Donald Trump created this situation when he's hand- selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention they would undo the protections of Roe versus Wade, and they did as he intended.",

So I will say and repeat what I think most people understand in America in a democracy we should have no room for, nor should we ever condone it. Any form of political violence in a democracy. People will debate, people will disagree, but not resort to violence and everyone should speak out about that, including and especially anybody who is running for president. Thank you all.",

The goal for Vice President Harris today has been to win over independent and Republican voters in three blue wall counties in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. She is campaigning with Republican, former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Meanwhile Donald Trump is spending the entire day campaigning across the state of North Carolina, holding a rally in Greenville. Earlier today, he delivered remarks on the devastation from Hurricane Helene and visited relief workers. Harris as of late has sharpened her attacks on Mr. Trump as you just heard over his rhetoric, she has been saying he's unfit for office, specifically drawing attention to his remarks, referring to his opponents, including elected Democrat -- Democratic officials as the enemy from within. That law that was originated during a Fox interview that aired on October 13th, when Trump said that the military or National Guard could handle the, quote, radical left lunatics and those he labeled, quote, the enemy from within. He went on to say the enemy from within includes Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and her husband, Paul. Yesterday, House Speaker Mike Johnson on \"STATE OF THE UNION\", became the latest Republican leader to tell me that Trump did not actually say what he actually said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Waukesha County, Wisconsin, Haley got 13.8 percent of the vote. Chester County, PA, that's one of the collar counties outside Philly. Haley got more than 24 percent of the vote.

It never would have even occurred to me to ask that. What I did ask everyone, are you okay? And when I think about what is at stake in this election, I think that's the biggest question and it is a moment were borne out of our love of our country, borne out of for me, having taken the oath of office to the Constitution of the United States at least six times. I believe what is at stake in this election is so fundamental for us as Americans. And it is about do we take seriously the importance of a president who obeys the oath to be loyal to the Constitution of the United States. Do we prioritize a president of the United States who cares about rule of law, much less the spirit with which they approach this most powerful position? There's so much about this last era when I talked about turning the page, that's what I'm referring to. Like the last decade that has been about some powerful forces suggesting that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of what I think most of us believe, regardless of your party affiliation that the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up and -- (APPLAUSE)",

He tried to overturn it and seize power. And then he sat in his dining room and he watched the attack on television. He watched it. People pleaded with him to tell the mob to leave and he wouldn't and he watched law enforcement officers be brutally beaten. He watched it. That's a depravity that to me.
