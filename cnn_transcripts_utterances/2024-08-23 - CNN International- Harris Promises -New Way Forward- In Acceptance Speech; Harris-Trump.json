I mean, she has yet to do really an unscripted moment as a presidential candidate, as the nominee of the party. She has yet to do a major interview. I do expect that to come maybe, if not, before Labor Day, perhaps right after Labor Day. But look, she has been drawing major crowds. She has been drawing a considerable enthusiasm and energy. But, how does that translate into votes? One thing about this convention, of the Democratic Convention, and of course, the Republican Convention as well just a month ago in Milwaukee, they're organizing tools. So, they're really using these to organize their troops, if you will, their volunteers across the country. But, you have a sense here that the Biden campaign is a -- it seems like a very long time ago.

Jeff, thank you. And reactions to Harris' speech are pouring in, including from her Republican rival, former U.S. President Donald Trump. In a new interview with Fox News, Trump attacked Harris' record, accusing her of not accomplishing policy proposals while serving as Vice President. When Harris took the stage in Chicago Thursday night, Trump commented in rapid succession on his Truth Social platform. Here you can see just some of his criticisms. They range from how much time Harris talked about her childhood, to slamming her on the issue of illegal immigration. And now that Kamala Harris has accepted her party's nomination, Donald Trump could, he hopes, get back the spotlight today with a major endorsement. The Republican nominee says that it is possible he will be meeting with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. today, any moment now. The independent presidential candidate is expected to formally announce that he is suspending his campaign after filing papers to withdraw from the presidential race in the state of Arizona. Now, both Trump and Kennedy are separately scheduled to appear in Arizona later today, but right now, an endorsement is not guaranteed. That is the big question. So, let's bring in Steve Contorno, who is covering the Trump campaign. Steve, Trump did tease ahead to this possible meeting with RFK Jr. today. Certainly, that question lingers, what could we see today in Arizona between these two camps? What more do we know about this?",

Now, we are being told that is not a guarantee, but Trump's team has been working behind the scenes really for several months now, laying the groundwork for RFK Jr. to exit the race and to endorse Donald Trump, and they believe that this will be a significant win for them. There is not a lot of support for RFK Jr. still out there. A recent poll had it at just about two percent.However, this is going to be an exceptionally close race, potentially, in a number of key battlegrounds, and any sort of support Trump can win over from RFK's voters, especially those anti-establishment types or anti-vax parents that people like that they are hoping to bring into the fold. Trump actually commented in recent -- last 24 hours on the potential for an RFK Jr. endorsement. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We haven't talked about that yet, Ali, but we'll find out, and we'll see. I have a lot of respect for him, and I think he has a lot of respect for me. But, it would be my great honor if he wants to endorse me. I have good respect for him.

Errol, let me start with you and pick up where Steve Contorno left off there, this intrigue about whether RFK Jr. is in fact suspending his campaign, dropping out, but also endorsing Trump. How much would that change the race, if in fact that happens? ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; HOST, \"THE BIG DEAL WITH ERROL LOUIS\": Well, look, it doesn't change the race so much. There was always an underlying assumption that RFK, because if you looked at his donor list, a lot of his support was coming from Trump supporters, so, there was always an assumption that he was intended to help Trump in whatever way he could. Back when Biden was in the race, the assumption was that he would help in a particular kind of way, perhaps even running as a Democrat or trying to peel away some Democrats. Now, I think it will be a different dynamic, but the underlying goal has always been for RFK Jr. to try and help Donald Trump. I assume that whatever serious support he has, people who just like RFK for no other reason that that will go to Donald Trump, and in a close state, it could make a big difference.",

LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, CHICAGO SUN-TIMESPart of it is, I think, and my analysis in the column is that there had been a doom and gloom thought for a while when voters had a choice between two elderly men, one President, one former President. Now, when that changed, something lifted. The mood lifted. Every data point lifted, crowds, money, polls, and they're talking about it. And the way you use joy is to they still attack Trump, but you could talk about bringing joy to life, into politics, economic policy. We'll see how it mobilizes people, because we've seen that enough to know that this politics of joy can mobilize people and that the campaign is big enough to organize it.

Take 2025 for a quick example. Instead of saying he had nothing to do with it, which won't necessarily be effective, because the Democrats are going to keep making that a central line of attack on him, say what you're for, and just do what you often do in politics, say that you're not for something, that is the point.

It's an area where Israelis say that Hamas has been smuggling weapons into Gaza for years now, and then from there, into tunnels, and spreading them out throughout the Gaza Strip.And so, the Israelis set their sights on this Philadelphi Corridor very early in the war as something that they felt they needed to conquer in order to regain security control of the Gaza Strip. They captured the Philadelphi Corridor in May, and since then now, the Israeli Prime Minister has been saying Israeli troops need to remain there. Hamas, meanwhile, wants Israeli troops to withdraw from that corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. And we should note that the previous -- the initial framework that these two parties had reached, it did not mention Israeli troop presence along the Philadelphi Corridor. It talked about Israeli troops withdrawing from population centers in Gaza, and the Philadelphi Corridor is right along the key Palestinian city of Rafah in Gaza. And it was only weeks after that that the Israelis said that one of their key demands was that troops needed to remain along the Philadelphi Corridor.

He really didn't hedge much there, and even went further when he talked about his concerns around the jobs market. He noted that while the unemployment rate is historically low, it's unmistakable that the jobs market has cooled off. And he said, Fed officials, they would not welcome any further cooling here. So, Rahel, you put all this together, and he effectively pre-announced an interest rate cut in September.",

But, the question, of course, is by how much. And so, I was just looking a few moments ago, and there is basically a two-in-three chance that the Fed does a small interest rate cut, its first since COVID, of a quarter of a percentage point. But, Powell, he basically kept alive the possibility that they could do a bigger cut of a half a percentage point, because if he wanted to, he could have pushed back against that thinking today, and he really didn't. So, the market is still pricing in about a one-in-three chance of that larger cut.The other big thing that came out of this speech is this question about whether or not the Fed can pull off a soft landing. And Powell did address that. He said that there is no reason to think that the economy is going to continue to weaken, that the jobs market is going to significantly weaken from here. And he also said that the Fed has room to cut interest rates further, if needed, to address any sort of weakening in the jobs market. I mean, he basically alluded to the fact that they have a lot of firepower here. When interest rates are above five percent, they can do a lot of cutting, if they need to, and he is basically signaling that they're prepared to, if that's what it takes to make sure that this is indeed a soft landing.

That first clip we heard from Kamala there where she seemed to be really sort of getting at patriotism, not partisanship, I think that seems to be a theme we have heard quite a bit this week. We heard it from Tim Walz. We've heard it even from some Republicans who took the stage. What are some of your takeaways from this week? I mean, what are you left thinking?MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\", &amp; CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I totally agree with you, Rahel, that patriotism has been something that, for folks overseas, this may sound odd, that it would be a partisan type of thing. But, Republicans have owned the flag more than Democrats have in the last several cycles. For example, Trump, at all of his rallies and at all of his events like the Republican National Committee, there is Lee Greenwood, and the song is always \"God Bless the USA.\" I love the song. It gives me goosebumps. But, there has not been a Democratic response to it. Beyonce, \"Freedom\", was really the anthem of this debate, and from the get go on night one, like that was the song that launched the convention. The chants of USA, USA, Vice President Kamala Harris saying last night toward the tail end of the speech that she loves the United States. How about this? The country stars, three acts in this convention, as compared to zero in the prior Democratic National Convention, just all signs, symbols of how we traditionally express our love for the country. Up until now, it was the Republicans who were always playing that card. Now, the Democrats have as well.",
