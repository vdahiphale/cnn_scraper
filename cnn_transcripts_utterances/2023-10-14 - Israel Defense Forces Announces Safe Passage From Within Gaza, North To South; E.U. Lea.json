Two Molotov cocktails were smashed into our car. And two minutes just before that happened, I saw the terrorist. I saw the terrorist when he got close to the car. I saw something in his hand.

And the streets are filled with thousands of people, who will have to flee intense bombing, indiscriminate bombing or be threatened to leave or be bombed and killed. This is the commitment they have to make. They're not launching an attack of Hamas. Not at all. It's an indiscriminate attack. Over 600 children have been killed so far, 2,000 people killed. I just came back from the scene of bombing of two houses, where people I know personally have been killed and pulled from under the rubble. To say this is an attack of Hamas is another distortion of fact, if you allow me to say so. It's an attack on the Palestinian people. We saw it before. We're seeing it now. Cutting power lines, water supplies, people's resources is a crime. But sadly, Israel is above the international law (ph). If I am a human being, I have to feel the suffering of a civilian. On either side of the oppression that this is going on and I feel sorry for if any civilian has been killed on the Israeli side. But let me make it clear. Those civilians are the victims of long, long decades of Israeli aggression almost every day, almost every moment of Palestinian lives. And this is why Israel should rethink the way they approach this. And think their army, not only since 1940 but recently, nobody talks about 270 Palestinians that were killed since the start of 2023, including 79 children in the West Bank. Nobody talks about displacement of people or colonial settlements that are taking Palestinian lives. Nobody talking about the theft of Palestinian waters and the pollution, attacks on hospitals. Let me give you something today. A hospital in the north part of the Gaza Strip have been threatened to evacuate. For goodness sake, how can you evacuate a hospital? All departments; 10 hospitals have been hit. And (INAUDIBLE) lives. You can come, CNN or BBC or whatever other channel. Come to the Gaza Strip and see the (INAUDIBLE). (INAUDIBLE) the statement about (INAUDIBLE) of babies in Gaza because these lives have changed the world against the Palestinians, where the Palestinians have been victimized for 75 years. Come here to the Gaza Strip and see the suffering on the streets, of people, orderly people, not even supporters of Hamas, the collective (INAUDIBLE) is a war crime. And we must understand that, if the world continues to (INAUDIBLE) the fears of the Palestinians and blind eyes of the Palestinians' suffering, all they will have is more suffering for the Palestinians and more violence that will be imposed on the Palestinians and more reaction from the Palestinians as well. You cannot expect to put people under such circumstances for so many years and we expect them to throw roses at you. This is the reality of the matter. (CROSSTALK)",

And what was the reaction after the attack on Saturday? (CROSSTALK) EL-FARRA: (INAUDIBLE), I'm going to tell you the whole truth. Before that attack, support for Hamas was dwindling and Hamas wasn't popular at all because people weren't happy with the way Hamas was running the Gaza Strip. They weren't happy with the siege and what's happening with their lives, which was miserable as a result of the (INAUDIBLE) siege. But following the attacks, the severe, intense attacks, the Palestinians are united. We don't think of Hamas and not Hamas. I'm never, ever supporting Hamas in my life. But as I'm talking to you, Hamas is now part of the Palestinian social fiber because we're all under attack. Support for Hamas was dwindling. Thanks to Israeli, support for Hamas is sky high now because of the severity of the crimes that the Israelis are committing, not because of the popularity of Hamas. When they hit us in every aspect of our lives, Palestinians get united and don't think of Hamas but Popular Front or jihad or whatever. They think of their suffering.",
