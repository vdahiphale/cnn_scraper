The resolution will need bipartisan support to pass quickly, but both chambers are facing challenges that could threaten the shutdown. Then on top of that, the House scrapped any vote today because of severe weather here in Washington. Speaker Mike Johnson is also facing some fierce criticism from hardline conservatives over this legislation brokered with Democrats in the Senate. The House Freedom Caucus writing on X, formerly Twitter, quote, \"This is what surrender looks like.\" Joining us now is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, Congressman Warren Davidson of Ohio, who also sits on the Financial Services Committee. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. Especially this very snowy afternoon. We appreciate it. And I may already know the answer to this question, but will you be voting for the short-term deal? REP. WARREN DAVIDSON (R-OH): Well, it's an honor to join you. Thanks, Brianna. No, I will be voting for it unless it changes. So, the deal that's presented right now, basically just continues the status quo. It's, quote, called a ladder C.R. It was supposed to be this new, novel approach. And in theory, it was going to give us some leverage so we didn't get more of the same. And unfortunately, what's coming at us is more of the same.",

But the plan that Speaker Johnson has agreed to personally with Senator Schumer spends more money than we spent last year. And it, frankly, spends outside of what was passed by two-thirds of the House and Senate. So, it was bipartisan to spend less money back in May. Now the framework is, we have to spend more money.
