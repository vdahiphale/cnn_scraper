So, the Justice Department will file a response by midday Wednesday, and then the Supreme Court could rule at any time after that, as this legal battle over the abortion pill Mifepristone continues and nearly two weeks after a Texas federal judge said the drug should not have been approved back in 2000.

Allow there to be access to Mifepristone. Put a put a stay on Judge Kacsmaryk's decision and allow the Fifth Circuit to have their hearings in the middle of May, allow this case to play out. The default should always be when we have a change like this, basically, do no harm, maintain the status quo while the case is being appealed. And that's really what the court should do.

One, I think the decision is without legal basis, regardless of what you think about Mifepristone, the decision that says one district court judge, one federal judge, can undermine the FDA's approval of a drug from more than a quarter -- almost a quarter century ago. Legally, that doesn't make sense.It doesn't make sense in terms of the people who sued, they don't have enough of an injury, the doctors and the Medical Associations. It doesn't make sense in terms of the power of a judge versus the power of an executive agency. And it doesn't make sense under our current reading of this very old 1873 law called the Comstock Act. So, I think for all those reasons, and the reason again, that we default to keeping the status quo while cases are appealed, it would make no sense for the court to do anything but just pause this ruling.",

I think there would be a lot of confusion about which law to cover. And then there's this question of, would the FDA actually have to follow this Texas court's opinion because the FDA has something called enforcement discretion? And so just like the Department of Homeland Security, when we were talking about DACA, essentially decided not to prosecute and deport some people, the FDA could basically decide not to enforce this particular ruling. Now, that's a path a lot of people don't want the FDA to take because it does set a certain precedent about what executive agencies would do. But that's a long way of saying, there's lots of moving parts. We don't know exactly what would happen for women's ability to obtain Mifepristone if that's what the Supreme Court does. It depends on the FDA. It depends on our reading of that Washington judge's decision as well.",

DeSantis has a spat with Disney started last year when a Florida law was passed that he backed limiting instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. Disney spoke out against that bill. Analysts say by declaring war on Disney, DeSantis is up ending the Republican landscape going against the traditional pro- business values of the party.
