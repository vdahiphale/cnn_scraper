Biden leaving a working dinner of G7 leaders here in Hiroshima early on Thursday night to be briefed on the talks. His second briefing of the day on negotiations that are in desperate need of a breakthrough. A White House official telling CNN, quote, there are real differences between the parties but that the president`s team is working hard towards a reasonable bipartisan solution. Biden`s domestic political challenge coming at the same moment U.S. officials are pressing to maintain and accelerate the steadfast support for Ukraine. G7 leader is putting the conflict front and center in the first day of their summit in Japan, launching new sanctions and export curbs designed to squeeze Russia`s ability to wage war, at the same time, Biden marking his own dramatic shift, delivering the message to his counterparts that the U.S. will support a joint effort with allies to train Ukrainian pilots on fourth generation fighter jets, including F-16s. Those fighter jets have been a top Ukrainian priority, as Russia`s invasion of the country grinds towards its 15th month, at an inflection point with allies rapidly moving to provide new defense capabilities as Ukrainian forces prepare for a long-awaited counter-offensive. Those efforts set to receive a dramatic boost by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy`s last-minute decision to travel to the G7 leader summit this weekend. It`s Zelenskyy`s latest visit to rally`s support after securing commitments for additional aid in European capitals last week, before a stop in Saudi Arabia where he addressed the Arab League Summit. And President Zelenskyy is expected to participate on Sunday in meetings with G7 leaders. President Biden is expected to be meeting on issues like climate, issues like infrastructure but a central focus or an overarching focus on the issue of China. Phil Mattingly, CNN, Hiroshima.

TikTok says that more than million Americans are active users on their platform known for sharing short videos of anything from dance challenges, food recipes, inspiration, motivation, how-to tutorials, comedians and more. And for their part, TikTok maintains that all user information on their platform is safe. Our Brian Todd has more from Montana. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For the first time, a U.S. state has completely banned TikTok, sort of. Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signing a bill that bans downloading the app in Montana. Individuals who already have TikTok won`t be prosecuted for using it, but App Stores like Apple or Google Play would be fine if they let anyone in Montana download it. The Montana ban will probably face strong challenges in court, but it`s the latest salvo against the popular app that nearly half of Americans use for sharing short videos, of everything from goofy stunts, to food recipes and dance challenges. Critics call it a security threat because a Chinese company owns TikTok. REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R-WA):  To the American people watching today, hear this, TikTok is a weapon by the Chinese communist party to spy on you, manipulate what you see and exploit for future generations.",
