They still have to get through their own nominating process to see who is actually going to run against Biden before they can come up with a deep strategy. However, we did start to see what that's going to look like today.Shortly after Biden announced, the RNC put out their own AI-generated attack on Biden, essentially saying that if he were to be elected, again, that financial institutions would crumble, talking about open borders, and that's really what we've seen in a number of issues that Republicans have hit him on today. It's not that surprising. It looks very similar to what they did in 2022 during those midterms, talking about open borders, crime, inflation, gas prices have started to hear from some of the potential candidates in the 2024 hopefuls as well. We heard from former president Trump, who essentially went after Biden for what he was implying was bungled foreign policy, saying that Trump was the only way you could prevent World War Three. We heard from Asa Hutchinson who's obviously running for president, saying that the president was focused too much on the past and on divisiveness, and we also heard from Tim Scott, the senator of South Carolina, who launched his own exploratory committee who went after Trump -- Biden, excuse me, and went after what he called left wing liberals saying that they wanted to take away your religious freedoms and again talking about that border. And just one thing to note here, again, before they can have any sort of cohesive strategy over what it's going to look like to take on President Biden. They're going to have to see who's actually going to be the candidate on the Republican side -- Bianna.",

He doesn't do the things that the way that you see the former president do them, so that's not expected.We saw President Obama actually do something similar. I think he held his first rally until maybe 13 months after he had announced he was running again. So it's not completely atypical. But what did this does kick off? And what is important here that you noted with Phil earlier is the fundraising, and that is really going to be President Biden strength when you talk to his advisers about what that's going to look like. His video in and of itself, though, did seem to set the tone for the argument he'll be making when he is on the campaign trail, when he is using these White House events to still put his message out there, because that's the power of the incumbency is you get to use that bully pulpit that the president has instead of just doing campaign events. But starting with January 6th, and starting by going after Republicans and as he's referred to them as the MAGA extremists, that is very clearly going to be the message he's using, saying, you know what he said in 2020 was, it's a battle for the soul of the nation, and that that is continuing in his view.",

They've actually been, you know, they've rebuffed a lot of the questions on age so far, Biden saying, watch me. I do think they understand that if it's a Governor Ron DeSantis or someone like that, on stage with President Biden, it looks a lot different than a President Trump. And so I do think that's part of it as well. The other thing that people are remembering today is, you know, Biden running in 2020 saying he wanted to be a bridge to other generations. And, of course, some assumed that that meant he might be a one term president.

They've got to make sure she's front and center.And you see it today in the events that they're doing. The president goes to union trades, right, and he's talked building trades, and he's talking to union members about the economy. The vice president of Howard University, she's talking to an African American audience about these big questions of freedom and liberty and women's health care. So you see to see this dividing up of the electorate and then going out and talking to their respective bases, and now they can go back and make the case. One more point about something Kaitlan just said. When you think about what's happening with Trump from a campaign perspective, it means it's a two step if Donald Trump is not the nominee. That means you got to -- you got to educate the American public about whoever the nominee is, and then you've got to attack them. With Donald Trump, there's no education required. Everybody knows exactly who Donald Trump is. He's 100 percent name ID, he'd just go out there and level the case and keep it moving.",

Kylie Atwood, thank you.In our national lead in Missouri, advocates are suing to block an emergency rule that restricts transgender medical treatments such as hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery for both children and adults. Now, the rule imposed by the state's Republican attorney general is expected to go into effect on Thursday. Some of the restrictions include prohibiting doctors from providing care to any patient that has not had 15 hourly therapy sessions over an 18 month period or been treated at least three years for gender dysphoria, which is the emotional harm caused by identifying as a different gender than the sex someone is born with. The attorney general has said that he is, quote, standing up to make sure that patients have the information they need to make informed healthcare decisions. Well, not every official in Missouri is on board with this emergency rule. That includes Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft who was running for governor as a Republican in the state secretary. Ashcroft joins us now. Thank you so much for your time. You're in favor of this rule when it comes to children, but not adults. Why? JAY ASHCROFT (R), MISSOURI SECRETARY OF STATE:  Well, first of all, I think that the state has the responsibility to protect those that can't protect themselves. The state has a responsibility to protect those that have no voice and our children don't, and virtually every -- every other aspect of life. We see that they are too young to consent, too young to make decisions. And yet, somehow just because some doctors want to earn extra money or allowing them to surgery, castrate or chemically castrate children. That's wrong. The idea that you can become a man if you're a woman or a woman if you're a man through surgery, it's just not true, and we need to help transgender individuals learn to agree with reality and be the best they can be. You know, when you're doing something stupid, your enemy will affirm you. They will tell you you're doing a great job. Continue doing that. It's only your friends that will come up, maybe slap you upside the head in a friendly way and say, look, you can be better, you can do better. I think it's great that we're trying to protect these kids to actually get to their root concerns, the root problem and make sure that they can be the best that they can be for the rest of their life.",

Imagine a coronavirus one day with the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2, COVID, but now, instead of killing less than one half of 1 percent of people kills 15 to 35 percent of people.
