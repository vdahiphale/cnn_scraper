Instead, it's getting cruise missiles from the UK, from France. But cruise missiles are easier to intercept.There are targets that the attackers would hit. The United States is not willing to give those. Ultimately the U.S. needs to sign off on the F-16 fighter jets, the training is going ahead. But has President Biden actually signed off on those aircraft ago, all of these would be sort of underlying frustrations. And you know, Zelenskyy gets that. NATO is a very step by step process. And what we've as Zelenskyy steps ahead of NATO. Think of the tanks that was the U.K. that that decided to give tanks first a Challenger, two tanks, and then Germany came along but that by -- but Germany did that, because it managed to convince the United States by them to give Abrams tanks. So, you know, the U.S. has a track record here that Zelenskyy will not be favorable of but recognizes and the tactics that he uses, seems to be -- it seems so far to be the ones that are working, which is be those steps ahead, be bellicose, but make up and talk a good game afterwards.

Ukrainian Defense Intelligence said they had nothing to do with it. But they knew a lot about it, saying he had been shot seven times with a Makarov pistol and heavy rain meant no witnesses. Rzhitsky commanded a Russian submarine accused of many attacks on civilians Ukraine also said although his family reportedly denied that. Ukraine added later perhaps sarcastically that he had been killed by his own men who refused to kill Ukrainian civilians. Russia was quick to respond with their own propaganda, claiming to have captured the gunman within hours, video we can't verify but it was a crude bid to show they are in control of the fate of their top brass after now weeks of chaos. Russian media said the killing hinged on a clumsy detail that Rzhitsky had made his daily run public on the running app Strava which has a long history of accidentally exposing the location of people who don't want to be found revealing U.S. military bases in Syria and Yemen five years ago.

He was the one who took power nine years ago in a coup. He is not seeking reelection, he will retire from politics. He was back in May when his party was defeated by the opposition in a general election. So that's why all eyes are on Pita, the leader of the progressive Move Forward Party. Pita Limjaroenrat He is the 42-year-old graduate of Harvard, the former executive of the Super App Grab. But to become Premier, he needs to grab around 60 more votes from rival parties from conservative senators and that is going to be really tough given his party stance on the monarchy on less measures stay on military reform. Now the party tells CNN that they are confident that Pita will be able to secure enough votes. But he faces another potential setback which could be the fact that he could be disqualified as a lawmaker over a media shareholding issue. A Thai Constitutional Court will be reviewing that case next week. And if Pita fails than another party in the coalition, this is pure Thai will nominate, excuse me, its own candidate. After a prime minister is elected, a government can be formed likely in early August. If no candidate wins a majority, then more candidates can be nominated on and on and it keeps the lawmakers will keep holding votes until a majority is reached. But since 1932, it's important to point out Thailand has seen a dozen successful coos take place including two in the past 17 years.

Swift has re-recorded and released three of her first six albums, the most recent \"Speak Now\" came out less than a week ago.The first two re-recorded albums have been huge hits, far more popular than the originals. The motivation for Swift has been widely reported, a private equity firm ended up with the recording rights to the first six albums after a contentious $300 million deal, which led to an acrimonious falling out with her manager at the time. Lesser known artists have tried this as well, recently (INAUDIBLE) and Phantom Planet re-recorded their earlier hits without the Taylor Swift-like success. But with private equity funds buying up entire catalogs, especially when the artist is still relatively young and well-known like 28-year- old Justin Bieber, paid $200 million in February this year for all of his work before 2021, it raises questions about the long term value of that investment if for example Bieber was legally allowed to pull a Swifty, and record his earlier work.

How rock-solid are they?Primack: We don't know the exact specifics of the Bieber deal in terms of whether there is a non re-record in there. Bieber's deal is kind of unusual because some of the rights of some of the masters actually remain with a recording contract. This is different for example than the Taylor Swift one. And it is also worth noting, often when artist record music for their record levels in the first place, regardless of private equity buying them later, there is kind of a grace period usually 10 to 12 years that the artist can't re-record any way, which is arguably the reason why we have seen Swift even record these albums gradually instead of, you know, putting all six out on day one. She's kind of waiting until she's able to. In terms of the legality, the non re-record should be legal, they haven't been challenged in court.

I will say in the case of Swift, so swift's portfolio or catalog has been sold twice. One to somebody named Scooter Braun kind of backed by private equity, and then Scooter sold it to another private equity firm called Shamrock Capital (INAUDIBLE).
