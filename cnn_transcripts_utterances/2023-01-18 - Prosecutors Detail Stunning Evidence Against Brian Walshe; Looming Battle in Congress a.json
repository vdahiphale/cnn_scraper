And they were able to locate a number of personal items in the trash collection center that belonged to Ana Walshe, very descriptive about what they found, including her COVID-19 card, a necklace, a Prada purse. They said there were DNA traces on a number of items that was both Ana Walshe or Brian or both.And, again, Google searches were also, according to prosecutors, prior to January 1st, they said Brian Walshe was Googling on December 27th which state is best to divorce -- is the best place to have a divorce. So, at that point, obviously, too emotive there. Guys, my colleague, Jason Carroll, he was inside the courtroom. He said that Brian Walshe essentially was just stoic through all of this, didn't really react to all of this evidence that was being laid out in front of him. He's now being held without bond. And, of course, he is now going to be in course in February. We, of course, will continue to follow this, guys.",

Brynn Gingras, thank you.Well, let's discuss all of this with Defense and Trial Attorney Misty Marris. So, Misty, before we heard all of these revelations, the big question we had asked is how can you charge someone with murder and improperly moving a body without that body? And now we know. This is a plethora of detail that they laid out, that the searches, the gruesome searches he made. What stood out to you the most?",

Some of the items he had placed in dumpsters, they say, had been destroyed or incinerated. That could be -- and the prosecutors seemed to lay this out there, this could be, they think, maybe the body itself. What they did find was some of the tools and they had blood with DNA on it. What rules, if any, exist in the prosecutor's case? Does the absence of a body harm their case?",

It's the single best piece of evidence for prosecutor to say establish that a murder occurred. However, in this particular case, now we have items that can be directly linked back to Ana in that dumpster.What prosecutors are going to have to show without a body is that a human being could not have survived whatever happened at the location in that basement, that the body parts are incinerated, that there was an actual death that occurred. And that's why we saw linking where that evidence was back to Brian Walshe being in the area linked back to the messages. So, yes, the answer is there's always going to be a problem for prosecutors with no body, but with the advancement in forensics, it's not an impossible hurdle.",

Without the body, though, I mean, clearly, this guy is not a genius in covering his tracks, but he did mislead investigators long enough that we believe the body had been incinerated. Does that make it harder for them given those few days that he was misleading and lying to them?",

So, it's a hurdle, but the messages, that really closes the gap there, because it tells the story and it links all of that forensic evidence. It gives a motive, which is something we did not necessarily expect to hear today, in writing from the defendant. So, only time will tell how that plays out, but I think right now we have a strong circumstantial case.",

So, that is the path forward if Speaker McCarthy and others are not going to do the rational thing, the right thing for the country, then we're just hoping for a few.

But, no, we're willing to vote today to do the right thing, to prevent any kind of economic catastrophe.What Republicans are saying, I just want everyone to understand, is that you have to enact our right-wing agenda.

I mean, as they've discovered new documents, they have reported that, they have provided the documents to the National Archives, as they should, and I expect that they will continue to make sure that we're provided with information. Of course, now the attorney general has appointed a special counsel to look into this. So, that will be the forum for review of the president and those documents. But, again, the question is what did they do when they discovered it? And they self-reported and they did the right thing. I mean, when you look at what the former president did, it was the opposite. He didn't self-report. He took the documents. And the big issue legally has been, what did he do when the government asked for the documents back, for the unauthorized documents to come back? That's the question. In the Biden case, they decided to provide them themselves. In the case of former President Trump, he resisted all efforts to get them returned, including a subpoena.

We've spoken to people, neighbors living around here who said that the fog was so thick they couldn't even see the crash right away, they could hear it first.We know, of course, now 14 people were killed, all nine on board, including, as you mentioned, the interior minister, his deputy, the secretary of state of the interior ministry and six others, but the others who were killed on the ground were basically parents dropping their kids off at the school. At least one child among the dead. We saw them moving the bodies out of the area, as they combed through the wreckage of the kindergarten behind me. The search-and-rescue component of this operation is now over, but you may be able to see occasionally in the background some spotlights and stuff, because out other side of the kindergarten, where the main helicopter actually hit, they are still combing through the wreckage. We know that they do have the black box. The hope is that they will be able to get some answers from this. But the sense on the ground, I would say, is that this is just an overwhelmingly tragic event, and frankly an event Ukraine just didn't need right now in the wake of all the suffering that people here have gone through for nearly a year.",
