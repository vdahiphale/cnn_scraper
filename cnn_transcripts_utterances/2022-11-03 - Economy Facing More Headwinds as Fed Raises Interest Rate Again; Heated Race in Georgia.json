Now, Honore revealed for the first time to our colleagues that he briefed Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, and told him about the need for new hires. And Honore tells us that after he briefed him, quote, his opinion was a, just need better management, they don't need more officers. Now, Honore wanted 854 new hires to the U.S. Capitol police. We've reached out to Kevin McCarthy's office to see what they had to say about Honore's claims. But this comes as we saw yesterday Zoe Lofgren, who is the head of the House Administration Committee, someone who oversees the U.S. Capitol police, sent out a letter to the Capitol police chief, asking what security protocols are under way at the department, particularly for people who are in line for presidential succession, like Nancy Pelosi, is, how to deal with family members and those individuals' homes. What was significant, what we have learned in this past week, was that for ten whole minutes, the U.S. Capitol police was not monitoring a live police camera feed outside the Pelosi San Francisco home as the attack at their home was under way last week. And it was because they don't actively monitor those feeds when the person, the leadership -- member of leadership is not at that home, Pelosi was in Washington at the time, not San Francisco, all leading to questions about what more resources are needed at this critical time of escalating violence and threats against politicians and their families.",

I mean, they may not put it that way but that's basically what they're saying. Women are going to be written off as complainers or told just told that it's all in their head.

But, again, tax cut, put money in people's pockets. We have got all the smart economists who told us inflation wasn't going to be a problem, now it's a problem. And now we need to make sure that the average worker has more money in their pockets. The supply chains are starting to loosen up.
