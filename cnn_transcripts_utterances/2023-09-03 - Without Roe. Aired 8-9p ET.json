Wade, taking away constitutional protections for abortion which had been in place for nearly half a century. The ruling left it up to states to determine whether the procedure would be legal within their borders. And since then at least 21 states have banned or restricted abortions. Tonight we take you inside a secretive network of pilots and volunteers who help transport women and doctors around the country so they can access legal abortion procedures. And we'll show you what it's like for some women facing a very tough decision. And some of this may be difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
