      "sentences": "Well, John, unfortunately, Bank of America does expect this housing market to remain stuck until 2026 or even later. It's a sobering forecast because we know a lot of Americans would like to buy right now but they can't, right, not at these prices and these mortgage rates.Three reasons why Bank of America is saying that it is going to stay this way for years to come. One, they're saying that prices are going to go even higher this year and next. They say that even if the Fed cuts interest rates there's probably not going to be much relief when it comes to mortgages, and that's a big problem because it means we're probably stuck with what's known as the lock-in effect. If you move right now -- if you own a home and you move, you can obviously take your furniture, but you can't take that ultra-low mortgage rate. So for a lot of people it just doesn't make any sense to move. And that's a big problem because it limits how much supply is on the market. Bank of America's top economist Michael Gapen -- he told me that it will take -- this will take many years to work itself out. He said, \"There isn't a magic fix.\" Now, if Bank of America is right -- and there's no guarantee that they are -- it means no relief on the affordability front. We know that housing affordability took a huge hit over the last two years. The lower that blue line is the least affordable that this housing market is. And right now, I mean, this is the most unaffordable housing market that we've seen since the 1980s. And unfortunately, Bank of America is saying no relief is coming -- John.",

The Supreme Court acknowledging it inadvertently and briefly posted a document on its website yesterday. The unsigned opinion indicated the court may temporarily allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho. In other words, leaving it status quo. It was swiftly removed but the justices are weighing a challenge by the Biden administration to Idaho's near total abortion ban. CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell joining me now. Give us some sense of when this decision comes down -- and if it is the same as what we saw on that document -- how this impacts -- would impact access to abortion.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, what this does is -- if it is the actual official opinion and whether we get that today or tomorrow or next week -- this would send this back to the lower courts in Idaho. But while it does that it would put back into effect the ability of hospitals in Idaho to provide abortions in emergency situations when it is deemed necessary to preserve the health of the pregnant patient.At issue in this case was whether Idaho's strict abortion ban, which provided an exception for the life of the person who is pregnant but not the health of the pregnant person -- whether that conflicted with a federal law called EMTALA, which requires that hospitals provide stabilizing care to all patients. The Supreme Court, if this decision ends up being final, didn't actually weigh in on that. What they did was say this shouldn't have gotten up to the court, actually, and we're going to send it back down to the lower courts. But while we do that, we're going to allow these hospital emergency abortions to continue if needed. However, that's going to work its way through the courts. And so, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in this document that was posted, said this isn't a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho; this is a delay. Also, legal scholars are looking to what this means for other states. Essentially, nothing. There is a similar challenge going on in Texas right now. I was talking with Elizabeth Sepper at the University of Texas at Austin, and she was saying the Biden administration has a challenge to that case. They've asked the Supreme Court to look at it. So we could see this get back up to the court, whether it's Idaho, whether it's Texas. Also, we know that the court had a second case on medication abortion they also tossed out on standing. So the court is really not focused on delivering opinions here that deal with these issues, guys -- particularly, as we approach an election. Back to you.",

Because I think if he talks about the border, if he talks about crime, foreign policy, the debacle in Afghanistan -- if he can stick to those issues, right -- inflation, real wage growth -- all those issues that people in America care about, then again, he goes -- comes home with the W.",

The protesters are marching still, even after Kenya's president said he would not sign the controversial finance bill that sparked days of protests on the streets. That even turned deadly. At least 23 people -- 23 people were killed in demonstrations Tuesday.CNN's Larry Madowo is in the streets of Nairobi, Kenya, once again. Larry, there's already been action around you.

And the police appear to be determined to make sure that there are no protesters today.Yesterday, President Ruto, in a surprise move and an embarrassing admission, had to pull this finance bill that led to a lot of these protests over the past few weeks. But the people here say they want more than that. I want to show you some of the scene of the action here. This is usually a busy street. I'm literally running into one of the officers. There's so many officers on the streets -- more than the protesters -- because every time they try to amass, the police throw tear gas and push them back. We just saw one over there. I'm going to try and show you what's happening there. Kenya has also deployed the military to help the police deal with the protesters. In this case, there are no protesters here. There are literally more journalists than any of the -- any of the protesters on the streets. But the police are being extra vigilant and a little reckless in how they are throwing these tear gas canisters, sometimes directly targeting protesters instead of up in the air. The best -- the determination, Kate, is to make sure that there are no protesters today. Many of them that I've spoken to tell me this is no longer about this controversial finance bill; it's about the high cost of living in the country. It's about President Ruto's legitimacy to run the country. And for a lot of them, it's also about corruption, which is one of the major issues that's come up throughout this finance bill protest. Just how much money that Kenya gets in aid from the United States, for instance, in loans from the International Monetary Fund, and from other agencies that just gets stolen in that process. So what you see here on the street is even more reinforcements back there. There's water cannons and trucks that are just getting pulled in here to try and clear the road, to clear the protesters, and keep the roads passable. But there's all these businesses around the city. Perhaps we can show this. All these businesses are closed because they expected another day of protests. What these protesters have called for is a one million march and they're trying to occupy the State House. That's where President William Ruto lives and works. But that's not been successful because a heavy military presence on the streets, heavy police presence, and they're trying to do everything to make sure that it's safe.",

Just in, new comments from Boeing about what they say led to the door plug incident on an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Boeing claims it is due to missing paperwork. After leaving the factory, the plane flew without critical bolts to hold the door plug in place for two months. CNN's Pete Muntean -- he had a tour of Boeing's 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington.

They have a four-point plan for fixes here. But they also dropped a really big bombshell on reporters here. That fateful door plug work that happened in the factory in Renton, Washington here happened without documentation. No paperwork meant workers at the end of the line did not know that work was still taking place, so that plane was essentially pulled out of the factory and flew away -- a ticking timebomb. Boeing says it has already cut down on that kind of work by half. It is called traveling work here at Boeing. Those are the unfinished jobs that begin at one place on the production line and continue moving down the production line. And we saw how Boeing is actually putting the brakes on that in a literal way. There was a blank in one step of the production line where the previous plane would have moved forward but it had unfinished jobs still to finish up on it. I want you to listen now to Elizabeth Lund. She is the head of quality control here at Boeing and likely, the next CEO. We will see. And I asked her if that kind of work -- if that kind of omission that happened on the fateful door plug plane could happen again -- listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
