Its spokesperson joins us live from Beirut. And Hurricane Milton is expected to cost insurers tens of billions of dollars. Our chief climate correspondent on the ground on the east coast of America. Plus Barack Obama hits the trail in Pennsylvania to try to shore up support amongst black men for Kamala Harris. Well, we begin with the deadliest Israeli strikes on central Beirut in almost two decades. Lebanese authorities say at least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured in an attack on a densely populated part of the capital late on Thursday. You are looking at new images of the aftermath of these strikes. The worst on the area since 2006, some near 20 years. This as Israel has still not reached a decision on how it will retaliate after last week's missile strikes by Iran. Well, a source tells CNN that the gaps between the U.S. and Israeli positions on what that strike or action might look like are narrowing. And against this backdrop of escalating warfare, the president of Iran and Russia have met in the past few hours. That meeting in Turkmenistan, where they said they share a, quote, \"very close view of the world.\" Well, we are covering all angles of what is a complex region and a very complex and developing story. We will speak to Fred Pleitgen in Tehran in a few minutes, get the perspective from there. First, though, I do want to get straight to Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut. And Ben, what more are we learning about this strike on central Beirut last night and on the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon?",

There was also a big poster of Hassan Nasrallah pretty much overlooking those Friday prayers and especially in the political part of the sermon a lot of references were made to that possible Israeli retaliatory strike, but also warning the United States and Israel. We spoke to some folks after the prayers and here's what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They will see a very harsh response from the IRGC, the army, and the people of Iran ensure that this will happen. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Israel has experienced this before. And if they repeat this experience, they will definitely be destroyed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They are brutally overseeing the bloodshed of innocent children which is taking place, and both America and Israel have a share in this crime.

Now calling on the U.S. to step in to defuse tensions. The diplomatic adviser to the president has said very specifically, quote, \"We need a ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza as soon as possible. At this critical juncture, the UAE believes a robust and effective American role is extremely necessary.\" Amwar Gargash added that there was a need for de-escalation along all fronts including Israel and Iran. Of course, the UAE has such strong economic ties with both countries. The reality on the ground, of course, anything but de-escalation at this point. The United Nations sounding the alarm after its peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon were hit twice in 48 hours. Now the latest incident happening Friday morning with two peacekeepers injured in explosions close to a U.N. observer tower that just hours after the U.N. peacekeeping chief said the safety of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon was increasingly in jeopardy. The U.N. observation post was hit by Israeli tank fire on Thursday. That incident, which also injured two peacekeepers, sparked condemnation from several countries.

We've been reporting it is almost impossible for civilians to know whether or not they are anywhere close to Hezbollah assets and infrastructure. You have said, we've read out the IDF statements suggesting that there were Hezbollah assets or infrastructure close to or in the area where the UNIFIL units are. But how much confidence do you have that you -- that you are going to continue to be a target at this point? I guess my point is very simple.

Meantime, the flooding hasn't stopped nearly two days after the storm hit. There are more rescues underway in the Tampa area. Well, the devastation from Hurricane Milton likely caused between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of insured losses, and that doesn't include uninsured losses of course. The estimate comes from Fitch Ratings, one of the biggest credit rating agencies in the U.S. And new analysis found climate change made Milton's wind speeds 10 percent stronger and increased rainfall by up to 30 percent. CNN's Bill Weir has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As earth overheats, these are the kinds of storms that take lives and livelihoods. But as families reel in private grief, it's the material loss that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County. From the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings, to Tropicana Field peeled like an orange by Milton's winds.

The whole ark of the message was that thechoice is clear between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, and that Harris is ready to do the job. This was a former president who was trying to draw that stark contrast not only on policy, but also on character. On policy, for example, he slammed Trump for taking credit for the economy, saying that it was Obama's economy, not that of the former president that he has been touting on the trail, also talking about a range of other issues. But what he kept coming back to and also went to a campaign office to talk about is men, especially appealing to male voters and to black men because there has been waning enthusiasm among this bloc of voters for the vice president and before her, President Joe Biden. In fact, the vice president has been working on trying to shore up that support for months now, but it continues to be a weak spot for Democrats. And this is what the foreign president had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And then on the other side you have the family saying, well, wait a minute, even though you're paying $487 million and spending $455 million on improving safety and compliance, you're not really taking accountability for what happened. The families are asking for $25 billion. They're also asking for executives to be personally held accountable for the death of their loved ones. Now, ultimately the judge today could listen to these oral arguments and then sort of take some time to figure out whether this deal is fair and just or tell the two parties to go back and try to work something out that would the more fair and just or the judge today could simply say yes, this deal is good and the families would have to accept it ultimately. Now, this really stems from the company Boeing defrauding the FAA. There was no charges brought initially. It was essentially Boeing accepting that they were in the wrong here and they offered to make this plea deal with the DOJ. And as you said, the DOJ is standing by this deal.",
