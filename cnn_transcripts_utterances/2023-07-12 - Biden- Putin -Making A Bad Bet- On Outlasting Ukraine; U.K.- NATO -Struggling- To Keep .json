That in fact, what he is doing is making NATO and the United States even more unified. It's actually empowering NATO. We're now adding both Finland and Sweden to their membership.

So here at the Rosenstiel School at the University of Miami, we're working on lots of different strategies to try to increase the heat tolerance of our corals. There are different ways that you can do that. So one of the problems with corals, the reason that they bleach is because they have a symbiotic relationship with algae. And what we're doing is priming them with a more heat tolerant type of algae that actually raises their bleaching threshold, that is to say, allows them to withstand more and more heat stress while remaining relatively healthy. And then another strategy that we're working on is actually doing lots of experiments to identify parents that are genetically more heat tolerant and using those parents to breed together and create new generations of corals that also have that heat tolerance and can survive, hopefully, these higher temperatures that we're seeing more frequently now.",

So, when it comes to this pending hurricane season and the fact that it might be worse because of these warmer waters. You've teamed up with Florida Republican Senators, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, both Republicans on the Disaster Relief Fund Replenishment Act which will ensure that FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has all the resources it needs to continue providing disaster relief. I want to ask you -- I mean, that's great for a bipartisan accomplishment there. Have you ever talked to them about legislative action to combat climate change? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ, (D-FL): Yes, thanks, Jake. I appreciate you talking about this. Well, first of all, the reason this is so important is because we're getting into a hurricane season and we're talking about the waters being warmer than ever, we're talking about, you know, record temperatures. And so I'm extremely worried about stronger storms, storms happening in areas perhaps that don't have the infrastructure or the ability to respond like some areas, like in Florida that are more used to it. And so, FEMA is going to run out of money, the Disaster Relief Fund is going to run out of money in August. And so, that will impact our ability to respond, our ability to recover. It'll impact reimbursement to local governments that can't afford it. And that's why I teamed up with them to get ahead of this, to be proactive. We shouldn't have to do a supplemental after the event, we should be doing it before. So look, I've talked to Senator Rubio and Senator Scott, obviously, when I was the director of emergency management, talked to them, you know, about climate change. Obviously we have disagreements on that. And so, what I'm trying to focus on now is I'm trying to focus on ways in which we make sure that cities and counties have the resources to not just respond, life saving measures to respond, but then also recover because obviously, as those resources get held up, we elongate the period for these communities to recover.",

Let's talk about all this with former South Carolina state Representative Bakari Sellers, along with former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, David Urban. They're both CNN political commentators. Bakari, Senator Manchin says this New Hampshire appearance is not necessarily about running as a third party candidate. But you heard the language. He's not ruling it in. He's not ruling it out. What do you think? How concerned should Biden be?",

We want Senator Manchin to be the Senator from West Virginia, but actually teasing and wanting people to adore you or ridicule you or be a part of this discussion for President of the United States, that it's really only arrogance. Joe Biden had a successful or has a successful tenure going as President. I think everybody should get behind him and support him.The Joe Manchins, the Robert F. Kennedy, Jrs, the Cornel Wests, they're all in the same bucket, and they are just running either to be here with David and I as political commentators or to try to find some exit realm.",

Former Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, David, told the Washington Post that that concern is much ado about nothing.He said, quote, the last thing that this group wants to be -- wants to do is be known as the group that elected Donald Trump.

He's the only one.Imagine if Ron DeSantis or Tim Scott or any of these other individuals who are running for President of the United States had the fortitude of Chris Christie in attacking Donald Trump and standing principally on whatever issues. I mean, the problem with Chris Christie is the fact, left the New Jersey, Governor's Manchin with a 12 percent approval rating thereabout, and so he's not going to be the nominee. But if somebody else had his type of tack or as some people may say, lack thereof, or his ability to punch a bully in the mouth, then maybe this race would be different.

This new image from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope shows about 50 young stars, many of them similar in mass to our sun. They are in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. That's a part of our universe where new stars are frequently born, ones that could be home to brand new solar systems.Joining us now to discuss is NASA's Dr. Amber Straughn. She's a deputy project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope program. Dr. Straughn, this is all just blowing my mind. Tell us more about what we're exactly seeing here. There's a lot of detail and some unusual colors. DR. AMBER STRAUGHN, ASTROPHYSICIST: Sure, yes. I mean, this beautiful new image is really just the latest example of how the Webb Telescope is delivering on its promise to reveal the universe in whole new ways. And so what we're seeing here is essentially a stellar nursery, a place where baby stars are being born. Those beautiful red jets that you see there in the image are the telltale signs of these baby stars bursting forth from their cosmic cocoons. And the dust that you see here is really reminiscent of how our own sun was born billions of years ago. And all the dust similar to what you see here eventually, of course, formed the planets, including the earth and us. And I think that's one of the most beautiful kind of concepts in astronomy. This idea that the iron in our blood and the calcium in our bones was forged inside of a star that exploded billions of years ago in a supernova. We're connected to the universe.

But we can't skip over the engineering that made this possible over two decades of work to build this telescope. That is one of the largest engineering challenges that NASA has ever faced. This telescope was so big, it had to unfold in space, and it's been really just a huge, huge technical achievement to get this telescope out there to get it working, and it's working better than we ever expected or predicted.",
