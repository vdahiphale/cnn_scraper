We begin in Nepal where search operations have resumed for two people who remain missing after the deadly crash of a Yeti Airlines flight.Authorities say rescuers have recovered 70 bodies so far and at least 41 of them have been identified. Many of them will be handed over to their families, while those of foreign nationals will be airlifted to the capital of Kathmandu. There were 72 people on board, including four crew members, when the plane crashed into a gorge on Sunday. Meanwhile, a candlelight vigil for all of the victims was held in Kathmandu. CNN's Ivan Watson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (CRYING AND WAILING) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A family in shock. Their son, Abhishek Kushwaha, was on vacation in Nepal with three of his friends when their plane suddenly crashed on Sunday. We lost our family's only breadwinner, says his father, in India. He was an accomplished, educated boy. An eyewitness happened to record the doomed Yeti Airlines plane abruptly banking seconds before it crashed. The aircraft slammed into a deep gorge, carrying 72 passengers and crew. A difficult search and rescue operation forcing emergency workers to use ropes and cranes. Most of those on board were Nepalis, as well as 15 passengers from India, Russia, Korea, Australia, Argentina, Ireland and France. Authorities say they lost communication with the plane 18 minutes into what was supposed to be a 25-minute flight from the capital of Kathmandu to Nepal's second largest city, Pokhara. GEOFFREY THOMAS, AIRLINERATINGS.COM:  It was a short flight. The workload is higher on the pilots. You've got to take off, to climb, you and crews, really for a minute or two, and then you are descending. WATSON (voice-over):  Nepal's prime minister announced a national day of mourning on Monday and formed a five-person committee to investigate the cause of the crash. Experts say the aircraft itself, a French-Italian made ATR 72 twin- engine turboprop, has a decent track record for safety unlike the aviation industry in Nepal.",

They do have the cockpit voice recorder as well. The black box has been found, which will help in their investigation. There is also that social media video where you see the plane banking significantly before disappearing behind a populated area and the building, and just a moment later, you hear the explosion. So, all of this will be used as evidence in this investigation. We also heard from an airport spokesperson saying that the pilot, in the moments just before the crash, requested to land at a different runway. We understand from the Civil Aviation Authority that there are two runways, and they gave that permission, but didn't ask why because they said there was no technical reason not to give the permission. They also said crucially -- quote -- \"No distress calls were reported from the pilot to the Pokhara Airport tower control.\" So, until the very last moment, there didn't appear to be any kind of distress call. All of this will be taken into consideration when they try and figure out exactly what led to this tragedy.

At least 25 people remain missing, and rescue crews continue the desperate search to find more survivors.

(On camera):  As you can see here, this building was completely annihilated all the way down to the ground floor. The Ukrainians say the reason why the damage is so extensive is that the Russians used a cruise missile called the Kh-22. The is designed to destroy whole aircraft carrier strike groups.

Andrei Medvedev says that he feared for his life after refusing to renew his contract with the private military company. He has accused the group of abusing prisoners who have often been recruited as mercenaries, saying some have been killed for refusing to fight. But Wagner's leader says it is Medvedev who attempted to mistreat prisoners, a claim he denies.

The kremlin denies that there is a rivalry, saying both are fighting for their homeland. And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now live from London with more on this.

He feared for his life. Prigozhin, the head of that Wagner group, apparently ordered all contracts, he says, to be automatically renewed in November. So, there is an element of coercion and threat behind this. He said he felt his life was in danger. Any allusion as well that this was just professional elite soldiers are also gone. We know that as well from a video that emerged in September of Prigozhin recruiting prisoners from Russian prisons. Andrei Medvedev said that fundamentally changed life in Wagner. He said when the prisoners started arriving, the situation really changed. They stopped treating us like humans. We were just thrown to fight like cannon fodder. This, of course, matters because, as you say, Wagner is now playing an outsized role in this battle. It has claimed credit for the advances in Soledar. It seems that Russia, ministry of defense and Kremlin, are not distancing themselves from this. The Kremlin saying on Monday that there is no rift. As you said, they are both fighting for their homeland. The ministry of defense even giving Wagner some credit for the advances in Soledar.

The man known as \"the last godfather\" of the Sicilian mafia is finally under arrest after three decades on the run. Matteo Messina Denaro was caught at a medical clinic in Palermo, Sicily on Monday. Denaro was considered Italy's most wanted man, yet he had been seemingly hiding in plain sight for the past 30 years.He is suspected in dozens of mafia-related murders and was convicted in absentia for deadly bombings, which killed two anti-mafia prosecutors in 1992. He was also convicted for the kidnapping and murder of a 12-year-old boy, the son of a former mobster-turned informant. The child's body was dissolved in acid. Over the years, Italian police have arrested more than 100 alleged accomplices of Denaro, including his brother and sister. They've seized assets worth more than $160 million. Denaro is likely to spend the rest of his life behind bars. Demands for reforms within London's metropolitan police are growing louder after an officer admitted to dozens of sexual assaults.

So, you don't have to feel like you are crossing some kind of red line vis-a-vis Russia. And so, this opens the door for re-exporting the German Leopard's which are out there in other allied countries of Ukraine, other countries that are willing to re-export it but they can't do so before Germany allows them. And that would give Ukraine much more support, much needed support that currently the U.K. basically just cannot provide because the numbers are not there. So, obviously, East European countries such as Poland are looking at the situation in Ukraine, and looking at this precarious state where Russians are mounting this war of attrition against Ukraine and they are saying, well, if Ukraine -- if Ukraine cannot achieve its goals, then what happens next, right? Putin is digging in. The Russians are digging into this conflict with Ukraine and which for them is also a conflict for the west. So, this is extremely concerning for them. It should be concerning for all of us.",

The National Bureau of Statistics is out with a slew of new information, including data that shows the economy grew by 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter. And fell well short of Beijing's official annual target of 5.5 percent.CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins us live from Hong Kong with more on all of this. Good to see you, Kristie.

      "sentences": "Yes, Rosemary, last year was a brutal year for China. First it was because of COVID zero at the very end of the year. It was because of COVID basically everywhere. For the year 2022, China posted a GDP growth of only 3 percent. It posted for the fourth quarter of last year GDP growth of only 2.9 percent year- on-year.And on top of that, China has revealed that its population is shrinking for the first time since the 1960s. And that means not just the entire population, but it's working age population as well. Right now, China is dealing with double whammy economically of a slowing property market. And on top of that, the after effects of its zero COVID policy which absolutely wrecked its economy last year. In fact, it caused provincial governments billions of dollars. For example, Guangdong province was forced to pay $22 billion throughout the pandemic on zero-COVID related expenses like mandatory mass testing, vaccination drives, et cetera. And that is one of the factors why China had that sudden reversal in policy. It abruptly ended zero- COVID in December. Since then, it's been gripped by this exit wave of runaway infection. But when you talk to economists, they say that the economic pain being caused by this exit wave is short lived. I want you to look at this, Aidan Yao, AXA Investment, and he's a senior economist there, tells CNN, quote, \"Q4 has likely marked the darkest before the dawn.\" He goes on to say, \"With the reopening timeline now significantly frontloaded, the economic outlook had brightened beyond the near- term.\" Now, looking ahead, China's economic growth is expected to rebound in 2023 because China will learn to live with COVID because China's authorities are now easing the regulatory crackdown on the property sector, the tech sector as well, and that's where we're anticipating a broader year ahead.

But is it enough to lift the global economy out of what is feared and anticipated to be and could be a global recession coming this next year?First, that's a very heavy lift. Secondly, it all depends on how quickly we can see the Chinese consumer rebound to start buying again, start buying products, start buying services, to start traveling and take part in domestic and international tourism. A lot remains to be seen, but that domestic spending cannot happen until after this brutal exit wave of infection. Back to you, Rosemary.",

Basically, Peru has always been divided between the capital, Lima, and the vast interior of the country. I mean, jungles to the north and the mountains to the east and the south. And those are largely indigenous populations, rural populations where a lot of the mining and the real basic economic activity in Peru takes place.But those populations haven't benefited from a real mining boom in the country. And so more and more, the political class have become discredited. The political system had become very fractured. Political parties basically ceased to exist. And what happened was basically is this population in a rural area just felt so disenfranchised. Left out of the national politics. So, when they elected Castillo, who was a completely -- complete unknown. He never held elected office before. He was from the rural area. He's indigenous. He'd been a teacher. He headed the teacher's union locally. It was sort as seen as giving them a representative voice for the first time in the country. Now, of course what happened was it's been a sort of a standoff between the congress and the executive. The country has had six presidents in five years because of impeachment processes and resignations. They attempted for the third time to impeach him. He basically tried, as you said, to legally dissolve the congress. It was removed and now those populations are back in with some indigenous populations, of rural populations, or rising up and demanding he be returned to office.",

Well, first of all, he attempted a coup d'etat so, he's in prison right now. Second, to amend the constitution to bring up new elections is going to require the congress voting that to happen and congress is really dead set against Castillo. And that can't even happen for about another year or so according to election authorities in Peru. They can't prepare for the elections. So, they're demands are not actually feasible. But at the same token, their -- so activity, their protests are ramping up and it's come at a really high cost. The crackdown, the state of emergency has now been extended as you said, Rosemary, has come to cost more than 50 lives. Fifty people have been killed, largely by security forces.
