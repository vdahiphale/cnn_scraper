And you know what makes a Pelosi effective and made a Tip O'Neill effective and Rayburn effective is that ability to bring the hammer down that you need to, make a deal that you need to. It is not a personality thing. It was how the speakership office was working as we have known it the last 100 years at least, and you have a group of people coming, especially since Boehner, and they have said, we don't want this anymore. We don't want the top-down anymore, and we don't want you to dole out a committeeship to this person or that person. And again, this is part of the existential debate, how should this place be run.

I spoke to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday, and she said, what if January 6th occurred and the lawmakers were not sworn in, and they could not count the votes for the presidential election because the speaker was not sworn in? And she said thank god that the Democrats were in charge, because she said that the Republicans are not showing themselves to be good at governing yet.

      "sentences": "Jake, we see them on the floor casting their votes. And let's map out and show where they come from. And why they might think this might hurt them politically back home, that it's safe for them to defy.To set the table, there are 222 House Republicans. That's a net gain of 10 from the election that was just shy of 60 days ago. Democrats' 213 here. And the number is 212 because one Democrat passed away after the election. Democrats are down to 212. This is the verdict on election day. You mentioned who are these holdouts? Let' take a look. 21 if you count Congresswoman Spartz of Indiana, who has voted present. She says Kevin McCarthy needs to close the deal. That's her form of protest. These others have voted for other candidates. And as you can see geographically, it's a diverse mix. They're Republicans from all across the country. Here's another way to look at it. This is their win  margin. If it's deep red, that means they won comfortably. If it's more of a pink, that means they were relatively close races. Lauren Boebert stands out among the holdouts in that when she won re- election, Jake, earlier this month, she just won re-election, 546 votes. She is taking the biggest political risk here, you could argue. The voters back in her district just sent her back to Congress. Is he taking a risk? Does she care? That's the question for Congresswoman Boebert. You come back up and look at the rest of the map. Most of these Republicans won big. Let's come down to Oklahoma. You have Congressman-Elect here Josh Firsch, and 72.4 percent of the vote. Yes, the country might not like what's happening, the chaos on the floor. He thinks he can go home. He got 72 percent of the vote. He thinks he is safe. Let's move around the country a little bit more. Scott Perry of the Freedom Caucus is one of those who is in a bit of a nippy district, a safe, but not blowout Republican district. He got 54 percent of the vote in the election 60 days ago. Is this a risk? He has decided it's worth taking. More of a marginal district but still a solid Republican district, just not by a blowout margin. You come down to Maryland and you see Andy Harris. Again 55, 54 percent if you want to round that out in the election there. This is a solid Republican district. Not a 60 percent or 70 percent district, but Andy Harris thinks he can be anti-establishment, anti-leader, anti-institution, chose caucus. Pick the term you like there. And that is what is interesting. If you look at the map and you pull it out, most of these are safe Republicans. Yes, they're defying their leadership, and they may be embarrassing their party. They may be embarrassing the institution. They might be ignoring the national will of the American people, Jake. But when they look at the districts back home -- and we'll go to Illinois. Remember we had Congressman Davis on. Former Congressman Davis. He was beaten in the primary by Mary Miller. She had Donald Trump's endorsement. She had 71 percent of the vote in that district. She is sticking it to the leader, yes. She thinks people back home will support her. This one, one more quick way to look at this. Here's the 21 of them here. If you look at the 21 of them, 16 of them received Donald Trump's endorsement back in their primary. So they got here, in part, thanks to Donald Trump. Donald Trump wants him to vote Kevin McCarthy, but, even to Doanld Trump, they say, no.",

And the reason being is that there are still conversations taking place.Kevin indicated that earlier today. He said himself, I don't think you're going to see much change in the vote count through today, but that doesn't mean that those lines are solid. It doesn't mean that there aren't conversations taking place. Nor does it mean that I don't think there's movement because I do believe that there is. I think Kevin McCarthy is going to be the speaker of the House. I think we'll get to that point in fairly short order. I hate to predict because, oh, my gosh, it's very difficult under the circumstances. But I certainly don't think it's going to be weeks. I think it's probably a matter of a few days, and we'll get to what we're anxious to do.",
