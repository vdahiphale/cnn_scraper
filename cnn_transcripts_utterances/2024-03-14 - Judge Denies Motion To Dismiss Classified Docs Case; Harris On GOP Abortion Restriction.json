The unexpected twist coming on the same day that Trump was in court, in Florida, trying to get another one of those cases thrown out, and failing. Also, Kamala Harris becoming the first sitting Vice President to visit an abortion clinic. Democrats are keeping this issue front and center, and trying to keep Republicans on their heels. A post-Roe reversal, but the question is will it drive enough Democratic turnout, come November? And striking revelations are in a new book, from one of the best- sourced foreign reporters, on those affairs. What former top Trump aides are warning that a second term of his could look like, including U.S. withdrawal from NATO, and abandoning Taiwan if China invades. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. They say that timing is everything. And for Donald Trump, that might as well be his campaign slogan, right now. He's been in day-to-day combat in court, to keep pushing his criminal cases, until after the 2024 election. And there are significant developments, tonight, concerning the timing of three of those cases, in New York, South Florida and Georgia. In New York, the one criminal trial that was supposed to happen, that everyone thought was going to start, 11 days from right now, now appears that it will be delayed by at least a month, after an unexpected announcement, from the Manhattan District Attorney himself. We'll dig into what that's all about, as Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen and Company are now waiting to see what the judge is going to decide, about the hush money case. It wasn't all good news, I should note, for the former President, today. He was denied one attempt, to get his charges dismissed, in the classified documents case, in Florida, as he sat there in court before Judge Aileen Cannon. But there's no trial date still, from that judge. And of course, that can't make the Special Counsel happy, or the witnesses, who are worried for their own safety, as all of this is being dragged out. I actually spoke with one of those central witnesses, in this case, a former Mar-a-Lago employee, who told me that he's prepared to testify.

We've talked about Florida.Now, we are also awaiting a decision that is expected tomorrow, in the State of Georgia, from the judge who is overseeing Trump's election case there, over whether or not to disqualify the Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis. Judge Scott McAfee said to a reporter, today, quote, \"I made a promise to everybody, these kind of orders take time to write, I need to make sure I say exactly what I want to and I plan to stick to the timeline I gave everyone.\" Here to help us break all of this down, tonight, is our most trusted CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig, who was an Assistant U.S. Attorney, for the Southern District of New York, the very office that is now caught up in this case. And also, of course, his book, \"Untouchable,\" where he uncovered conversations that got to the heart of this case. So Elie, obviously, you're the perfect person to talk about this with. I think, the question is why is this all happening, 11 days before this was set to begin? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Yes. So, this is about so much more than a likely 30 day or more postponement. This goes to the heart of the D.A.'s case. And it tells me that there's a real problem lurking here for the D.A.'s case. So, let's break this down. Three years ago, Donald Trump's getting ready to leave office in 2021. My former office, the Southern District of New York, has a series of internal conversations. What do we do? Do we charge Donald Trump for the hush money scheme? Ultimately, they come out, of course, no. And a big part of the reason why is they did not trust Michael Cohen. They were not willing to base a case on the testimony of Michael Cohen. OK. Now, you're Donald Trump's lawyers now. And you know this.",

She's saying, well let's get to it, when we're sifting through weighty issues of jury instructions, way downstream. So, I don't think that was anything that was particularly grievous, for the Trump team. I think the interesting thing is apparently, a lot of reporting says that she raised a number of questions, about selective prosecution, about whether President Trump is being treated differently, than any other president, or even vice president, that's a big note here, in history. And I think that means that what's normally, again, a fairly tough motion, to establish the DOJ, as selectively enforcing a law, has some traction with this judge. It wasn't on the table for today.

He's made it very clear that anybody that he disagreed with, or he has an adversarial relationship with, in the press, he wants to potentially threaten their FCC license. He said publicly he wants to persecute, using the Department of Justice, his political adversaries, and the list goes on and on. He's courting with dictators. He wants to be part of the axis of autocracy, with people like Vladimir Putin. And just to remind people, Vladimir Putin is tied very closely to Iran now.

I thought they were disgusting, Kaitlan. I think they've been talking about how they stand with our best ally in the Middle East, the free democracy of the State of Israel.

We sent that supplemental bill, off the House floor, over to the Senate, back in October. And Chuck Schumer has refused to act. He complained about a pay-for, because we were taking money away from the IRS, to pay for the $14.2 billion or $14.3 billion net that had been requested. So, guess what?

Of course, NATO is probably the most important security alliance that the U.S. is part of. And CNN Anchor and Chief National Security Analyst, Jim Sciutto, joins us, now with more reporting, on his new book, \"The Return of Great Powers: Russia, China, and the Next World War.\" Jim. And this book is full of fascinating insights from these people who worked with Trump. And at one point, John Bolton is quoted there, with this story about what he means basically his concerns, about what's going to happen to Taiwan, if Trump is back in office. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, CNN ANCHOR, AUTHOR, \"THE RETURN OF GREAT POWERS\": Add Taiwan to the list of countries alliances that his former advisers say the U.S. will abandon, effectively, under a second Trump administration. And what he would do? He would be in the Oval Office. He would hold up the tip of a Sharpie pen, at his desk, and say, and point to the tip of the pen, and say, this is Taiwan, and then point to the Resolute Desk, and say, this is China. The point being Taiwan is so small, too small to successfully defend itself, against a Chinese invasion, and crucially, therefore too small for the U.S. to care about or defend itself.
