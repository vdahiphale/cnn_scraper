And we begin with escalating tensions in the Middle East Israel says it has carried out air strikes in Syrian territory. Israel's defense forces releasing video it says shows strikes on a Syrian military compound, radar systems and artillery posts. The strikes were launched after Israel says rockets were fired from Syria toward the Golan Heights. And in the West Bank today, a funeral was held for two British-Israeli sisters who were killed in an attack on Friday. Days of violence erupted following an Israeli police raid on the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem last week. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Jerusalem. Scott McLean is in Beirut, Lebanon.

I would say it's still a very tense and a very volatile situation as well.And of course, one of the main reasons for that is what you were just mentioning is those rocket attacks that the Israelis say were launched from Syrian territory early this morning. That, of course, is a pretty big deal since Israeli territory was shot at or fired -- rockets fired from Lebanon earlier and then also from Gaza, now from Syrian territory as well. The Israelis are saying that at least one of those rockets landed. One was intercepted. They say six rockets were fired in total. Now the Israelis then launched those airstrikes. We're seeing one of them right there on our screen right now. Saying that they took out some compounds from the Syrian military is quite interesting because it's not clear whether or not this had anything to do with the Syrian military. However the Israelis are saying that they hold the Syrian state and, of course, the Syrian military as well accountable for any sort of attacks that happened onto Israeli territory or Israeli-held territory and then will retaliate accordingly. At the same time, the strategic affairs minister of Israel he came out here on CNN earlier today, and he warned what he called the enemies of Israel to not underestimate the unity of this country. Despite the fact that of course we know there are political divisions here. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At this point, there's no indication that there's going to be another attack, but in the meantime, it is the job of the Lebanese military now to make sure that there isn't.

This is an irrigation channel running through this banana field. This used to be a bridge over top of it, leading to a hotel by the sea. It obviously took a direct hit. Locals say the force was so intense that it shook their homes. They also insist that this would not have been a good place to store weapons. The aftermath attracted a crowd of local residents and farmhands among them Khalil Al Rajhi (ph), who makes no apologies for the rockets fired at Israel. \"This is a response,\" he says. \"This, at the very least, is a message that we as the Lebanese people stand for resistance.\" \"Do you want peace with Israel,\" I asked him. \"Of course not,\" he says. Just down the road, though it is a much different story. Abdul Khaled Abdul Sattar (ph), a Syrian refugee shows us the shrapnel he's collected from the blast that left a hole in the roof of his farmhouse. His kids were sleeping here at the time. \"Me and my wife and young kids,\" he says. \"I couldn't calm them down. We left Syria to flee the shelling. And now this.\" He walked us through the orange grove, passed more and more disturbed earth. The house that was hit by shrapnel is about 200 yards away from here, it seems far until you see the size of the crater. Abdul Sattar says there were no weapons here. Incredibly the only living casualties were the orange trees, some ripped apart at the trunk. Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for any of the rockets fired from Lebanon, neither has any Palestinian armed group. The Lebanese army vowed to stop the attacks and located and dismantled several rocket launchers and rockets hidden amongst the hillsides and terrorist orchards. On Saturday, they found one more though no sign a new attack was on the way. At least for now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, the district attorney in Travis County, saying that this was not self defense, saying that this was murder and their witnesses that say that this was intentional. Of course, the defense saying this was self defense, but the jury here agreed with the district attorney. He was convicted of murder on Friday. Then, a day later, just yesterday, Governor Greg Abbott taking to Twitter to say that he is already working on Daniel Perry's pardoned. He specifically said that he has working quickly, trying to expedite this process so that he can pardon Daniel Perry. Of course, this is not something that everyone agrees with.
