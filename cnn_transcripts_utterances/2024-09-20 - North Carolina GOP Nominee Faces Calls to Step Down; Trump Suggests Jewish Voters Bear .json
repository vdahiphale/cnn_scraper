It's wonderful to have you with us on this Friday morning. We made it to Friday. And we are just 46 days away from election day. And of course, the race is coming down to the wire in nearly every battleground state, including North Carolina. Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out in North Carolina today. It's a state Republicans have won every cycle since 2008. Recent polling does show that, with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, it is now incredibly close. And a scandal involving the state's Republican nominee for governor, the current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, is adding a new dimension to the race. This new CNN KFILE investigation uncovered dozens of inflammatory posts that Robinson wrote on a porn site message board over a decade ago. Some of the messages include Robinson calling himself, quote, \"a black Nazi.\" Other posts praised slavery or ridiculed Martin Luther King Jr. as a, quote, \"commie bastard,\" end quote. When confronted with the evidence of his writings, Robinson denied any responsibility. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
