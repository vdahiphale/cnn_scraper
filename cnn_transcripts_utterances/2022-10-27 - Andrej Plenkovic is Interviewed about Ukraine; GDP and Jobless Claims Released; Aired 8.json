Last week McCarthy said, I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. This week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in Croatia for an international summit on Russia's aggression against Ukraine and she pushed back on McCarthy's comment. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (R-CA): The support for Ukraine is bipartisan. It is bicameral. That means in the House and in the Senate. And it starts in the White House with our president. Someone made a statement of, we're not giving a blank check to Ukraine. We've never given a blank check to Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Unfortunately, we are in the midst of the aggression of the occupation of territories, of organizing sham referenda, of illegal annexations of another sovereign states territory and military operations ongoing with air raids, with alerts. So, I think political or diplomat conflicts are always useful. But the way I see the state of play today, I think we are not there yet.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Croatia, in the '90s, had a relatively similar situation, but on a much more smaller scale. We had our own occupied territories at the time. It was greater Serbia (INAUDIBLE), which is (INAUDIBLE), which occupied almost between one quarter and one-third of our territory. And we were very resolute at the time that we shall never abandon the objective of insuring the territorial integrity of our land, of our constitutional system. And what I hear and understand from my talks with President Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Shmyhal, or president of (INAUDIBLE) or any Ukrainian politicians I have spoken, I haven't seen even the remote opening that any of them would concede territorial gains after the military aggression and occupation. I don't think this is to be expected.So, I know it is a very difficult situation. Croatia was -- I was personally advocating for many years to try to maybe implement something like what Croatia did with United Nations transitional administration in our own occupied territories in eastern Slavonia between '95 and '98, where the territory was reintegrated and there wasn't one single bullet fired. So, there are models in previous situations, international relations, how the conflicts of -- I wouldn't say same, but a little bit similar nature, might be solved without further bloodshed and without further casualties. But I haven't seen an opening and what was absolutely clear during the parliamentary summit, none of delegations has even signaled at all that any of the Ukrainian occupied territories would be given away to Russia.",

      "sentences": "So, the economy bounced back in July, August and September. The third quarter of the economy grew 2.6 percent. Bouncing back from those two prior quarters where you had the economy actually shrinking here. If it weren't for a little bit of a drag from housing, those numbers would have been even stronger.So, looking at what's fueling this, consumers spending and exports. Although consumer spending starting to show some signs of weakness but, still, very good in that third quarter. And then housing was the little bit of the drag. Let's talk about the job market because we also got a look at layoffs in the most recent week, up a tiny bit, but still very low, 217,000 first-time jobless claims. I mean these are pre-pandemic kinds of levels. And the trend there is what's really important. So, this does not show yet that companies are laying people off in big numbers as the Fed is raising interest rates. In fact, the job market's still pretty strong, 3.8 million jobs have been created this year. Everyone's waiting for that tipping point when higher interest rates and these concerns about a potential recession in the future start to drag on company hiring plans. In terms of what this means about a recession, I mean it's less likely that you're in a recession now when you have a number like this. And 2.6 percent economic growth is not recessionary at all. What we're talking about now are these headwinds in the future. What happens in the next 12 to 18 months. That's where you're seeing all of these forecasts for trouble ahead. But for at least right now, you have a consumer that remains pretty resilient, a job market that is still robust and, in terms of economic growth, a third quarter growth bounce back, you guys.",

You are seeing, in the housing market, the Fed's medicine starting to work and to cool that red hot housing market. Actually slam the brakes on it to use a different metaphor. But you're not seeing it yet in the job market and in bigger parts of the overall economy.There's a lot happening all at the same time too. The European Central Bank just raised interest rates, you know, 40 minutes ago. We'll see how that -- what that say to the rest of the world. And you've got all these corporate earnings. We're really zeroing in on what these CEOs are saying about headwinds, especially global economic headwinds in the months ahead and what that - what that's doing to their - to their strategies. Are they going to be pulling back a little bit because they're worried about next year.
