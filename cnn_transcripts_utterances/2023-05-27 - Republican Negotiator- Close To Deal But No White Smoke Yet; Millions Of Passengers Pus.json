June 5th, the new date to avoid the first-ever debt default in the United States if Congress and the White House cannot agree on a deal to raise the national debt limit, which now stands at $31.4 trillion.Default could have drastic economic ramifications in the United States and around the world. And it starts with getting a deal between speaker McCarthy, his top allies and the White House. And at the moment, there is no deal yet. They are close to one though. They've been negotiating seriously for says, late into the night as they've horse traded on a whole wide range of issues. And as Republicans have pushed for spending cuts to be attached to any piece of legislation to raise the national debt limit, there are indications the White House is moving closer to the Republicans' position on that. And there are also some indications that the Republicans are getting a little bit more to the White House on how long to extend the national debt limit --debt limit for. The White House wants it done through the 2024 elections. Republicans initially proposed to do it just for one year so they can get back and have this fight again next year. The White House does not want to have this fight again. It appears Republicans are -- would allow for a two-year debt limit increase. The other major sticking points as well. Including over the issue of work requirements. That means actual -- for social safety net programs. Republicans want to impose on programs like food stamps, new work requirements for those beneficiaries. Democrats believe those -- that push will hurt needy families and could be detrimental to a lot of people who rely on that for their nutrition and for their daily lives.

I think this will ramp up speculation around the counteroffensive. The timing, of course, significant because it comes as we've seen a real increase in what appeared to be attacks, although mostly Ukraine does not claim responsibility for them, but attacks far behind Russian lines. Mariupol, as you showed there in your introduction hit on Friday, that was also heard a week earlier.

However, if the opposition does come into power, what will their economic policies look like on that front? That is a huge concern. But as you mentioned there, of course, many voters will be thinking about the aftermath of the devastating February earthquake. More than 50,000 people killed. Millions of people still display, still homeless. The government has faced criticism for its chaotic and delayed response to that earthquake as well as questions around liability and the preparations. And of course, we can't forget this is a key NATO ally, a key powerbroker in the region, particularly as the war in Ukraine continues.",

So, baseball put in the new rules, the biggest one was the pitch clock to try to -- try to make the game more exciting, make the game more faster.And this year, so far, the games are coming in at two hours and 39 minutes. That's almost a half an hour shorter than it was just last season. And it's about the same length the games were in the 80s. We haven't seen, you know, any of those marathon. Four, five-hour games at all this season. And also, stolen bases are way up. And this is because pitchers, they can no longer just throw over the first and second countless times with runners on. They can only do it twice now. If they do it a third time, they either have to get that out or the runners get to advance. So, you're not seeing these endless pickoff attempts that we used to see. Pickoff attempts way down. And that means stolen base attempts or basically their way up. You're getting 1.8 stolen base attempts per game. That's the most since 2012. The success rate is way up. So far this season, Paula, we get the most stolen bases we've seen since 1999. So, the game is faster, a lot more people running around the bases. All in all, the rule is really working.",
