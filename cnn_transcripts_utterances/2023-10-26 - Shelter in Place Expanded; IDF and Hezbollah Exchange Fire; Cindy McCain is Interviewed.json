And that's why you see additional shelter-in-place orders going into those towns that are a little further away from Lewiston. It's not clear where this suspect has gone. And that's the reason why you now see dozens of agents coming from the U.S. Marshals, from ATF, from the FBI.One of the things we heard this morning is the FBI has sent dozens of people in there, not only SWAT teams who are going to respond to wherever there might be sightings, but also evidence collection teams. Obviously, this is an area with police that don't deal with scenes like this. I mean not many places deal with scenes like this. And so even the basic things like the police work of evidence collection is something that the FBI is helping to assist both the state place and the Lewiston Police Department there. We know that they've also brought in victims assistance people who will help the victims who witnessed this horrific scene. But also to try to get a little bit of information from them. One of the big questions at this hour is why did this suspect go to these two locations? What happened? Was there something that brought this suspect to these two locations to carry out this shooting? At this hour, though, everybody is trying to figure out where this suspect is. Phil and Poppy.",

As of yesterday the U.S., so far, has seen more than 560 mass shootings this year alone. And it's not even the end of the year. That's according to the Gun Violence Archive.With us this morning, Democratic senator of Delaware, who has worked tirelessly on the issue of gun violence, Chris Coons. Let me ask you, Senator, a question that Phil just asked Representative Dusty Johnson, and that is, is this just what Americans are going to have to accept, that this is -- could happen to them any day? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Poppy, I certainly hope not. President Biden signed into law last year the biggest progress we've made forward on closing loopholes in the gun background check system and investing tens of billions of dollars more into community mental health. But yesterday we took a vote on the floor of the Senate on relaxing the standards for access to guns for veterans who have been adjudicated mentally ill -- actually, I may be wrong, that may be a vote coming up today. We do have a country that is sharply divided in terms of our understanding on the limits on gun rights. It was one of President Biden's big accomplishments, along with a bipartisan group here in the Senate last year that we moved forward on closing background check loopholes and improving gun safety. But there is so much more to do. No other advanced industrialized country has this challenge where day after day after day there are mass shootings all over our country. All of us should reflect on our willingness to commit ourselves to the safety of our children, our schools, our communities. If you can't go to a bowling alley or a movie theatre, a synagogue or a church without having to worry about an armed assault, then, frankly, we are not protecting our own people in the ways that we should.",

That's why I highlight the amendment by Senator Kennedy that's part of the mix of amendments we are going to have to vote on before we move forward on our appropriations bill. It explicitly reduces the restrictions on veterans who have been adjudicated mentally ill from being able to access guns.For decades that's been in place. If a court rules that you are to much of a danger to yourself and others to have access to guns, that strikes me as a pretty good predictor that you should not be involved in gun ownership or gun purchases. Yet there is a significant group of Republicans here in the Senate trying to roll that back. That would be the biggest reduction in gun safety. The biggest reduction from folks who are on the background check list in decades. So, it's alarming that we have such a deep division between our parties in the intersection of gun safety and mental health. And I think it is a bad predictor of our political direction soon. Some of the hardest meetings I've ever been in at home in Delaware was with the parents of young children who, in their first year of school, had to do active shooter drills. Something we did not grow up with. Something that now is a daily reminder to school children that their communities, their parents, their national leadership, is not doing enough to keep them safe.",
