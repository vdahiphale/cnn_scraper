This will be their first time on board as we're getting brand new details of what may have gone horribly wrong, including questions about whether dirty fuel played a role.An officer who was on the ship told the Wall Street Journal, one of the engines coughed and then stopped, the smell of burned fuel was everywhere in the engine room, and it was pitch black. This morning, more divers will join the difficult task of recovering six construction workers who are now presumed dead, some of them parents leaving behind several children. Also today, the threat of hazardous materials are a major concern. Federal officials are watching about 1.8 million gallons of diesel that might have spilled.

Some of them will be boarding the Dali to begin this investigation, really, to start speaking with the crew and collect any recorders or electronics that they can get their hands on.And as you mentioned, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that investigators are going to be looking at whether or not contaminated fuel inside the ship may have played a role in this, may have been a contributing factor to that near total blackout that the ship experienced just before the collision, losing control, losing operations, really, before hitting the column and sending that bridge into the river. And, look, it's going to be very difficult for the recovery crews that are out there because we are expecting rain, wind, choppy waters. So, it's not going to be easy to find those six missing crew members. But today is really when this investigation gets going, John. And as you mentioned, they're also concerned about potentially hazardous material that might have spilled out into the river from that ship when it collided with the bridge. And so, really, they're looking at a few different angles to this, and it could be a tricky day and a very busy day for those investigators.",

In 2018 in Australia, one person was killed on a ship elevator. In 2019, an officer went missing after likely falling overboard in Singapore. And then last year in the Philippines, one-person was killed when a tanker collided with a dredging ship. CNN's Ivan Watson is on board a vessel in Hong Kong.

It's after sunset, but I'm next to a container ship just to give our viewers a sense of the size of these gargantuan vessels.This ship here is actually shorter. It is not as long as the Dali. That's the 300-meter long, just under 1,000-foot long a container ship that took down the bridge in Baltimore this week, and we're dwarfed by it. The Dali itself had a capacity to carry up to 10,000 containers. The kind of things that are stacked up here, you may be able to see in the dark. It was carrying, according to the operating company, more than 4,700 containers at the time of the deadly collision. The ship itself is owned and operated by companies out of Singapore. It had a crew of 22 Indian nationals on board. They've all been reported as healthy. The track record of the ship, its safety record, well, it was inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard in September, and there were no problems. However, in June of 2023, Chilean authorities briefly held the ship. They had some concerns about gauges having to do with propulsion. Now, some experts that I've talked to say that's not really a big deal, but that may be something that the U.S. investigators will look into since the Singaporean maritime officials are saying that the crew had reported a loss of propulsion shortly before that collision took place. But just, again, these ships, these kinds of ships are massive. And one thing to keep in mind is when the Francis Scott Key Bridge was constructed in the late 1970s, container ships of this size were not being built by shipbuilders. This is a much more recent kind of development and they are integral to international trade. There's a good chance that some of the stuff you have in your home has been moved around on ships like this that constantly operate around the world. Back to you, Fredericka and John.",

I think, Fredericka, that those lawsuits, you'd have to believe, again, I'm just drawing reasonable inferences from the facts, but I would have to believe that those lawsuits would give authorities a roadmap into potential criminality just based on the nature of the allegations.I think it was a misstep by the Cassie lawsuit this past November of last year to even be released and then settled the day after. You're going to settle a lawsuit, why allow it to enter the public domain? Once that happened, there were a number of lawsuits that followed that, that gave explosive allegations with respect to all types of alleged misdeeds of Mr. Combs that now authorities can look into. And in looking into them, obviously, you're going to look at the sources who are giving that information, factually, what are they saying, factually, what was he allegedly doing as we look at the lawsuits there, right, what information is in them, the investigations in terms of whether he was videotaping things and what specifically he was doing. So, it gives authorities a bevy of information, Fredricka, with respect to go now and investigate. I think that they, those lawsuits serve as a large measure to what authorities are doing now. Again, they don't have the information yet to arrest. How do we know that? He would have been arrested. But they certainly have information to believe that there could be criminality. Whether there is will be predicated upon what authorities have found from the investigation of those homes.",
