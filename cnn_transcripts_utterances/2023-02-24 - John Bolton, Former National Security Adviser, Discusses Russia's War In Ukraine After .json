And if you look at the front lines right now in Ukraine, the Russians really haven't been very much in the way of progress, over the past couple of months even -- Abby?",

Ambassador Bolton, let's start with China here. China is really again the elephant in the room in this conflict. But today offered what they're calling a 12-point peace plan, trying to position Beijing as a more neutral actor here when the United States is actually saying that they are considering doing even more to help arm Russia in this conflict. What do you make of the so-called peace plan?",

      "sentences": "Well, I don't think that it is even handed at all, although that is what the Chinese are trying to say.I think that people need to recognize, and the administration may be recognizing it to an extent, that China here is engaged in a kind of partnership with Russia. And one might call it very much the senior partner. A reverse of the Cold War days when the Soviet Union was the senior partner. And the assistance that China has given Russia in this conflict, politically, economically and perhaps militarily, I think is already significant. So what China is trying to do here is bolster Russia's position. Their offer has been rejected by Ukraine, by the West as a whole, which I think makes sense. Let's not kid ourselves. This is not simply a Russia/Ukraine war. This is a global conflict at this point. And I think it's a measure of what lies ahead. May not be in Ukraine next time. Maybe it will be in Taiwan.",

I think that Zelenskyy has no incentive to talk with the Russians while the Russians still control 20 percent of his country.And just to be blunt about it, I think it is \"happy talk\" to say that Russia has lost this war. They have paid a huge price in terms of casualties. But they have doubled the amount of Ukrainian territory under their control. They have a different calculus than we do on the value of human life. And the war, to them, is still very much on. And so looking at the likely scenario, let's say, for the next six months or so, I think that it is almost certain to be more extensive conflict.",

But really, they also make it clear they're arming them based on what they believe their needs are today.What is behind that? Are they still concerned that if they go too far, that they might be seen by Russia or China or whoever as being even more of a party to this conflict? Are they worried about that or is there some other rationale for it?",

I think that the administration is very worried about that.I think the United States, having failed to deter Russia one year ago today, having failed to prevent the war by showing strength, unfortunately, has been intimidated by Russia for much of the past year. It was Ukraine that was invaded. It was Ukraine that has been suffering that grinding conflict for a year. To say we'll help Ukraine now make a more effective defense of their country against this invasion, to say that is escalation of the war I think is nonsensical. And the fear -- and I do think the administration fears a Russian conventional response. I'd just like to ask, where is the hidden Russian army that will conduct this escalation? And if it is such a good army, why is it not in Ukraine now? I think that Putin has been able to head-fake us in many respects that have allowed his really very poorly performing military to hold the ground that they've got.",

I mean, we have seen the snow steady the entire day.We're right along Interstate 5, this is essentially between San Francisco and Los Angeles. A major highway between the two cities. And it is shutdown. And even the side roads are closed at the moment. And so everybody in this area is stuck here. It's very inconvenient for a lot of the semi drivers. Look here. All of these trucks are parked because they are stuck. As long as the highway is closed, they will have to stay here. We actually had to come last night because we knew that this was a possibility. And authorities are saying that they're trying to do everything they can to reopen the highway, but, as of now, it has been impossible. You're seeing snow, rain in many areas. It is windy. It is foggy. Visibility is very low. We've heard reports of cars spinning out of control. And so they're telling people, look, it is safer to stay home. We have not seen a lot of people in this area. We've seen some trucks try to clear the snow here behind me. But they clear it up and, five minutes later, it is completely covered in snow again. So it is very dangerous and it's something that we're not used to seeing here in southern California. Weather forecasters and scientists saying that could be historic. And as you're seeing, we'll likely continue to have more snow throughout the day -- Abby?",

The power of the study is just how huge it was. Researchers looked at more than a million people in the U.S., U.K., and several other studies. Let's look at what they found. They found that during the course of the study 1.6 percent of the people who suffered from insomnia either had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. And 1.6 percent of them had heart attacks. But the people who did not have insomnia, only 1.2 percent. You might look at that and say, gosh, that is such a tiny difference. It is not that tiny of difference when you figure this is over more than a million people. It really shows that there could be come link there. We know that there is a link between insomnia and all sorts of other diseases. So the bottom line is try to get a good night's sleep. Do the best that you can -- Abby?",
