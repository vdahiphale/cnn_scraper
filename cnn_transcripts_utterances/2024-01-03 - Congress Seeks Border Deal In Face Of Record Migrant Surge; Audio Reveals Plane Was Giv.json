Sinema is and certainly they need to make sure that the people that live on the border have an input on this. And we're just going to accept what the Senate does, I don't think so. If there is, you know, they got to make sure they communicate with the House because it's not a unicameral, it's a bicameral decision. So as long as we are talking to each other, as long as we keep the border communities in mind, we can address this.But look, it all goes back to the pool factor, you can add more Border Patrol, you can talk about building a fence, which I don't support, you can talk about adding technology. But if you don't do something about the people coming in, and once they come in, they go into the interior, that's the pool factor. They go and they get processed, and they go into the interior and then wait four, five, six years for immigration hearing. If you know, and at the end of those, you know, four or five, six years, an immigration judge will reject about 87 percent. So why are we allowing all these people to come in when at the end of the time before an immigration judge, 13 percent will be accepted and everybody else be rejected? It's -- we're not doing this right. We got to make sure that we put the resources and make the right policy and not just do things that feel good about the border.",

And we got to make sure that people on the border like Sinema, and other folks get the input to get this job. Tony Gonzales, myself and other folks, Vicente Gonzalez, there's so many people that should be involved in this negotiation.So, we're going to wait to see what the Senate does, but I hope they don't think that they know it all.

You know, if we just listen to the immigration advocates, that's one thing. But who's listening to the border communities or county judges the sheriff's, the mayor's from the border? Nobody's listening to them. And you got to understand, you know, when you look at the polls, I think I'm not the outlier, I think during the outliers, and we're the ones, at least according to the polls, and certainly to the constituents that I represent that people want to have law and order at the border. They believe in illegal migration. They don't like what's happening right now at the border. And I think poll after poll to show that the greatest weakness that the President has right now is border security.So, he needs to make sure he does everything to work a deal out, because otherwise it will affect them, and it's going to affect other Democrats.",

I do want to get your thoughts on S.B. 4. Because the Department of Justice gave Texas a deadline of today to notify federal authorities whether that law will be enforced. That's the one that makes it essentially a crime in Texas for migrants to cross the border from Mexico. It gives local law enforcement, the ability to arrest people who they believe are undocumented.

We got to keep in mind, I understand the frustration that the Governor and other folks in Texas have, I understand that. But this type of action doesn't solve the problem. I think the Supreme Court has been very clear about this and the Arizona case 2010, 2012. They said that no matter how bad the frustration is, immigration belongs to the federal government and not to the local government, and not to the military, not to the local officials. It belongs to the federal government.And I think if the Supreme Court does do and follow their own precedent that they said some years ago, they're going to say no matter how big the frustration is, immigration enforcement belongs to the federal government. By the way, a lot of those local law enforcement officials don't have the training. And I worry about mistakes being done when they're not given the training, as Border Patrol is given under the immigration laws.",

So, Pete this transcript what are we learning from it? PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Well, really, we are getting more and more clues about how the holes in the Swiss cheese lined up that day, more links in the accident chain that led to this fatal accident at Haneda Airport in Tokyo. First, the air traffic control transcript that shows that the Coast Guard plane was not told to get onto the runway. And second that runway warning lights were not in use. They were broken at the time of this incident. That is the air traffic control transcript they're handed out by Japanese Airport -- Airline and Aviation Authorities that essentially lays out this tick tock where the tower at Haneda told the Japanese Coast Guard flight to hold short of the runway, but not go on to the runway and then two minutes and nine seconds later impact. I want to read you part of this transcript now where the tower told the plane Juliett Alpha 722, alpha that's the tail number. Good evening. Number one taxi to holding point C5. That short of the runway. And then the Coast Guard playing replied, taxi to holding point C5, number one. Thank you. So clearly, there was some confusion there. The Japanese airliner was already cleared to land. But I want to show you one more really telling image and we're getting daylight images here of the scene at Haneda airport that shows where the impact was of these two airplanes. You can see sort of at the 11 o'clock position there. That is the ground scar, that is where the Japanese Coast Guard plane was at the bottom of the screen that six o'clock position. That is where the Japanese A350 came to rest, sort of running like a runaway freight train down the runway. The other thing here is that that Japanese Coast Guard plane was told to hold short of the runway and there are typically warning lights there that make it so that the crew could see that the runway was in use. There are red lights that are embedded in the pavement. They're called runway stop bar lights. And it turns out according to publicly available notices to airmen that these lights were not in service, they were out of service and broken for six days prior to this incident, including the day of this crash. That could have been one potential way that this crew could have noticed that they were erroneously taxing onto the runway. They're used relatively en masse at major airports in the U.S. They're internationally recognized these lights essentially warn pilots, the runway is in use, there could be an airplane taking off or landing, there could be an airplane, still clearing the runway. And this is especially pertinent because this incident took place at night. So just one more factor in the chain of errors that took place here.",
