He was at a press conference last night, talking about the gratitude he has from President Biden, still the current president, who has offered federal assistance as much as he needs.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yeah. And the question is, you know, on the campaign trail, I think it was in October of 2024, Donald Trump was saying that if he got elected, re- elected, that he could withhold federal funds from California. Obviously, he has a sort of a feud with Gavin Newsom, a feud with almost every Democrat governor and senator and Democrat in general. And I think the question going forward is, could that happen? Is this something he's going to actually do when he assumes office? Because he does kind of see the federal government and the budget and the monies as his own, as to dole out as he wishes to his friends. And so, I think that's the real question going forward. But it is sort of sad that this is the same president we're getting again, that there are no lessons learned. There's no sense that Californians are Americans, right? That they are struggling in these areas. Two people have lost their lives, these fires haven't been contained at all. It looks like they're probably going to get worse before they get better, and that he doesn't have any sort of empathy and understanding about -- over what these folks are going through. People have families there, not only -- you might have families still there. I have family there and friends as well. So that's -- it's just -- it's just sad and still shocking.",

I mean, just talking to people, you've probably been talking to your family there. It's -- the winds are so -- the Santa Ana winds are so strong and they're so hot that it's impossible for them to contain now.At this point, it is just about taking cover and staying as safe as possible and as far away from that as possible.",

Although we were being told to evacuate, we were also being blocked by the road, by police. It was very confusing and we decided to risk it and to drive past the police.The plumes of smoke were just billowing up the road. There was burnt ash. There were flames on either side of us. The car was very quickly getting smoky. We had wet towels over our faces and the cars ahead of us were not moving. There's also, all of this debris had fallen on the road. There were rocks and small boulders. So that first attempt, I realized if I can't see, I might get caught. The second time we went down, we actually had a police escort and they had cleared the debris. And at the bottom of the road, there must have been 30 or 40 abandoned cars. So I'm really glad we didn't try that first time because I don't know if we would've gotten through. There were just vehicles on fire on the road burning. I would say half of the people I know, I have about 200 students, I think about half of the people I know have lost their homes. (END VIDEO CLIP) BASH:  Joining me now is Allison Chinchar. Allison, you are in our Weather Center and I know that, you are seeing scientifically, what officials are feeling on the ground there about conditions, which is that it's impossible for them to contain and it could get worse, not only with the fire spreading, but because of the winds and the dryness continuing to spread these fires even further than they already are.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, the wind has really been the key, Dana, because -- I mean, you -- we've both heard at some of these press conferences. They had to -- they had to bring the planes down. They wouldn't allow the planes to go up to deal with firefighting methods because the winds were simply too strong and you need those firefighting planes out there. They help make a huge difference in combating these fires and help bringing those containment numbers up.So the fact that we haven't really been able to have them up there, that has been a huge disadvantage in fighting these particular fires. And it's not just one, it's four. You look at the map here, again, you've got the Eaton Fire, the Hurst Fire, the Woodley Fire, and the Palisades Fire. Now, I understand for a lot of people, if you are not from this area, it's kind of hard to understand where we're talking about. So here are some kind of iconic things to let you know where we're talking about. So right here, this is where the Hollywood sign would be, the Griffith Observatory, Dodger Stadium down through here, Pasadena, the Rose Bowl Stadium. And now, when we talk about the Palisades Fire specifically, we do actually have a map to show you. This is the area that has been burned already. It's the red area you see here. Keep in mind this is several hours old, so it's likely expanded beyond what you are seeing here. But this just kind of goes to give you the scope of what has burned and what it's near, because this is the -- this is the downtown area of the city of Pacific Palisades. You see all of these structures here, homes, businesses, parks, all of this, not to mention the roadways that are so dangerously close to where these fires are. And again, keep in mind, I said this is several hours old. So this is likely spread into some of these communities since then, before we finally get that updated map. One of the biggest concerns, especially in the short term, is truly going to be the winds. You are still talking some of these areas, 50 to 70 miles per hour. Some of these have peaked at 70 to 100 miles per hour. Now, Dana, these numbers are going to drop to half. But when you think about that, you do the math, that's still 35 to 50 miles per hour. So it's not going to take much for these fires to spread and any new additional fires to be triggered and then spread into new areas as well.",
