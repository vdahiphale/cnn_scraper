Not now, not today anyway.By CNN's count, a majority of Republicans in the Senate are leaning against the border bill or actively planning to vote a big, old \"no\" in the very first vote on the deal, which is expected to happen this coming Wednesday. In fact, this doesn't look good. Senate GOP Whip John Thune tonight saying that a Wednesday vote would be too early. A clear sign that most Republicans would block it if the vote comes that day. Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson is vowing the bipartisan, I repeat, the bipartisan border deal is dead on arrival. If it even makes sense, it makes it to the House at all. Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee pronouncing it a bad deal. The conference adding the hashtag \"kill the bill,\" a bill which would also include aid for Ukraine and also for Israel. Montana Democratic Senator Jon Tester has had just about enough of all of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JON TESTER (D-MT):  People want to work in good faith and did it. Now, all of a sudden, good faith is out the window. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The former president saying the quiet part out loud again. Oh, there isn't really a quiet part when Donald Trump might be concerned, claiming that what he calls radical left Democrats are laying a trap for Republicans -- quote -- \"just in time for our most important ever election.\"Joining me now to break it all down is CNN Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona, who I look to help break down all of this tonight because it's confusing for so many people. You have a deal, you don't. There's text, there's not. There's the principle, there's objections. Where are we tonight? What are the lawmakers signaling when they don't have this ready to go?",

They huddled behind closed doors. It was about a little bit over an hour. We're told it was a very animated, robust discussion. But afterwards, those Republicans came out signaling that they don't think this deal is going to have the support it needs to advance through a procedural vote on Wednesday. Even James Lankford, he was the lead Republican negotiator, is expressing doubt that this is going to have the votes. So, just a remarkable blow and a huge embarrassment really for the Republicans who had initially demanded border security policy changes in exchange for Ukraine aid.",

That would become available once average daily migrant crossings reached 4,000 in a one-week span. It would only become mandatory, though, once that average daily migrant crossing reaches 5,000. So, Republicans had some issues with that. It's not an absolute authority. Biden also has the power to temporarily suspend that authority if he determines it's necessary. Asylum, that was another big point of contention, but they ultimately agreed to raise the threshold for those seeking asylum. They're also going to speed up that process from right now could take a few years down to a few months. So that was a big concession there from Democrats. It also would restrict presidential parole authority. It would also limit catch and release. Again, two big things that Republicans would push for. And then on the Democratic side, something they were pushing for, this would authorize 250,000 new visas over five years for families.",

Again, why it is a very conservative proposal on its face, and it's also why some Democrats are saying in the Senate that they can't vote for this deal. And there's also concern that going forward, this is the new marker, is that Democrats have said and Biden has said he would sign that Senate package into law.

They say the king will step back from his public-facing duties, but will keep carrying out his constitutional role. Here with me with more, Tricia Goddard, host of \"The week with Trisha Goddard.\" Trisha, thank you so much for being here today. We're hearing this news this morning. And today, this after the recent news, of course, about the procedure he had, Harry is going to visit his father, and we all are very familiar now with that very strained relationship. What does that say about the seriousness then of the king's condition? TRISHA GODDARD, HOST, \"THE WEEK WITH TRISHA GODDARD\":  Well, for one thing, any parent who announces, who tells their family, their children, that they've got cancer, the kids are going to, you know, want to be by their parents' side. I think what we'll be telling is whether other members of the royal family are increasingly involved in carrying out appointments that the king would otherwise make. This has been a really tumultuous time for the royal family because if you remember, the Duchess of York first had breast cancer. That turned out to be melanoma. And then we've had Princess Kate in a hospital for abdominal surgery. And initially, William was going to step back. So, he's more of a hands-on father, obviously, than his own dad was. And now, it has been announced, just before we got this cancer diagnosis talked about, announced that Prince William would be stepping in and actually doing more, you know, of the king's royal appointments.",
