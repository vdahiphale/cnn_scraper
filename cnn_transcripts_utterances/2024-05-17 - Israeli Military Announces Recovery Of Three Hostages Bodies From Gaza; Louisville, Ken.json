The families will listen to the accounts of all the other hostages who've been freed. The details are harrowing. They had managed, these three, according to Daniel Hagari, that these three had managed to escape the Hamas onslaught at the Nova Music Festival where there were hundreds and hundreds of people celebrating and they'd managed to get away to, he said, excuse me, which is about 10 or 15 minutes drive away from the Nova Music Festival. I was just looking on the map to remind myself and remembering that just a couple of days after those horrific events, the IDF took us down that road and the location he describes, it was just a scene of utter carnage. There were shot up motor vehicles at the side of the road, bonnets open. I remember seeing one of the vehicles had a pram by the side of it and just chaos. But what Daniel Hagari lays out is a scenario whereby Hamas didn't take them alive as hostages, but killed them and took their bodies back, essentially as hostages, as bargaining chips. The three of them, according to Hagari, were found in a tunnel. This operation, he said, was put together by the IDF, the military, and the intelligence services, the Shin Bet, acting on intelligence, he said, that they had. Shani Luke was 22 years old, a German-Israeli. She was a tattoo artist. Amit Bouskila was 28. She was a fashion stylist. And Eshtek Geller- Mitter was 53, a father. So, he leaves behind a family. This is just devastating news. And I think, you know, what we're hearing from the IDF here is that they prioritize the search for the hostages. But, of course, there's a massive amount of pressure politically and on the IDF to do more, to get the hostages freed, to take a deal even. That's the pressure on the government rather than have a military operation to bring the hostages back. So, this announcement comes at a moment of intensifying pressure on the government to prioritize the hostages and the government through the IDF, given the latest information they have.",

The Office of General Prosecutor now investigated more than 126,000. So, this is the first and probably the most challenge, because when you have plenty of cases, it's very difficult to investigate them properly. And second thing is how to make this justice implicable. I mean, not just investigate, but how to reach the people who committed these crimes by their own hands, how to reach people who gave orders to commit these crimes, how to reach the top political officials and high military command of Russian state who started this war.

Democrats were, after all those words were exchanged, Democrats were trying to get Greene to not be able to talk the rest of the hearing.
