I'm going to say that we would need an entirely new scale, because the problem here is that China's entire political economy is cheating if you say that the WTO rules have to stand for both sides. This is the great fallacy, John. I mean, we assumed that when China entered the WTO, that it was going to become more of a free market system. And while it became richer and more privatized, it didn't necessarily become freer in the sense that they still ring fence, the Chinese ring fence their major strategic industries, you have to have a joint venture to go into China if indeed you can go into any specific sectors at all. There's huge state subsidies, state-owned banks prop up state-owned businesses, and Chinese consumers and workers have their purchasing power artificially depressed. That is the nature of the Chinese economy.It was never going to be part of the free trade system as we know it. I've been saying that, frankly, for decades now. And the message is, I think, being widely adopted. Now, that's not to say that China doesn't have a system that works for China. But I think the idea that you can have a free trade liberal democracy and a state run autocracy, in the same system, playing by the same rules has always been incredibly naive.",
