I'll be there for that as well.But it's interesting that the fatality count was at about 115, for a few weeks. They modified that downward. It's now 97. They found some of the remains, where they're double-counted, or non-human remains. There were over 300 missing, for a while. That list is now down to 31. So, it's still the deadliest fire, in modern history. But thankfully, that's not as bad, as we feared, a few weeks ago, but.",
