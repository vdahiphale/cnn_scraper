Milton has strengthened to a Category One hurricane that's taking aim at Florida. Now, the state is bracing for yet another storm threat, just 10 days after Helene made landfall, and Governor Ron DeSantis is warning people in the hurricane's path to take this storm seriously. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): So please keep an eye on this storm. There's a bit -- I mean, the greater cone covers almost the entire west coast of Florida at this point, and so -- and even if you're not in the cone as it gets closer, certainly, if you're on that -- the dirty side of the storm, there's going to be surge that goes outside the cone, that's going to be significant. So just prepare for that and understand that's something that is likely to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I mean, we're worried about it rapidly intensifying again, and as it heads towards the West Coast of Florida, that will bring storm surge up and down the coast, damaging winds and heavy rain.It is, right now, a Category One hurricane, and already rapidly intensified from yesterday. We were dealing with a depression yesterday morning. It's got 80 mile per hour winds, now still sitting 800 miles west and southwest of Tampa, but it will continue its track in very warm waters here over the Gulf of Mexico, which will allow it to intensify again to that major Category Three hurricane. You heard the governor talking about the cone, yes, it doesn't include much of the west coast of Florida. We really need to focus on the coming days on where exactly that eye goes, because that will be really the determining factor for the worst of the storm surge. But regardless, the entire peninsula withstood the impacts of the wind and the rain. Again, ocean temperatures, middle and upper 80s. That's where we are finding it, feeding itself and fueling itself time and time again, you know, and intensifying and these oceans are just continuing to get warmer. So we see these hurricanes getting extremely stronger faster in recent decades, even surpassing the definition of rapid intensification. So it continues its track across the Gulf going into Monday and Tuesday. We're looking at impacts, possibly late Tuesday into Wednesday. Wednesday would be when that eye gets on shore and you get the landfall. I mean, look at these winds, it would be incredibly destructive if it's a Category Three hurricane. And again, where that eye goes will determine where the worst of the storm surge is. You know, if it's north of Tampa Bay, then you're going to feed all that storm surge into Tampa Bay; if it's to the south, then that's a better scenario for them. But either way, again, we're looking at very destructive waves along the coast. Now, it doesn't matter what the winds are, what category it is, it will squeeze out a ton of rain. We're looking at five to eight inches of rain, again, across the peninsula. You know, from Daytona Beach down to Miami. Some totals up to 10 to 12 inches are possible. So that gives you the urban and the flash flooding in communities even far inland for places like Orlando that are not as close to the coast. When you look at Tampa, I mean, the forecast there is five to 10 inches. They've got a front there now that's dumping rain. And then Milton comes, that is over three months' worth of rain from Milton, the October average is just over two inches for Tampa Bay. Again, you're talking about five to 10 inches in just a matter of days. On top of, you know, they already had flooding and storm surge from Helene last week. Again, this just is compounding factors here and insult to injury, you know, already with saturated grounds and with some debris still from Helene. Flood watches in effect again, for the peninsula, as we get heavy rain from a front. And then, of course, Milton coming through with all of that rain. And it's been such an active season. Look at all the landfalls that we've had. This is this year alone along the Gulf Coast. You know, you had Beryl in Texas. We had Francine in Louisiana, and then two so far in Florida, it looks like we're going to add another one -- Omar.",

They have to, for the most part, come through Hillsborough County to evacuate. So I started this afternoon telling our residents in the Zone A-Zone B, you know, just go now. Beat the traffic, and go now and just go to higher ground, as we say here in Florida that you hide from the wind, run from the water, so you don't have to go to another state, just get inland where you're not going to be susceptible to those storm surges.

At the time of the attack tomorrow morning, there will also be a big event here in Tel Aviv, marking the day. We are seeing the Israeli military adding security in Southern Israel. The Israeli military told me earlier today that they expect that Hamas could potentially try and fire rockets into Israel, noting the fact that they have previously tried to fire during symbolic days. And of course, we do have to remember that not only is this the anniversary of October 7th, but it also marks one year of war in Gaza, during which we have seen more than 41,000 Palestinians be killed. We have seen millions of people be displaced from their homes. And of course, that war, as we were just talking about, is continuing today, and in fact, intensifying once again in the northern part of the Gaza Strip -- Omar.",

I am going to start at home first and say a year from the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust, I do not think that antisemitism will be so rampant as it is, including recently released FBI statistics showing an over 300 percent increase in antisemitic incidents in the United States alone.A year out, I did not think that over 101 hostages would still remain in Hamas terror dungeons underneath the Gaza Strip, including five Americans, we must always remember that, and I don't think also that that for the number of 40,000 casualties would be parroted, even though it is a Hamas talking point and not actually verified statistics. But I do think that Israel would achieve its goal of defeating Hamas militarily, which it said it did about a few weeks ago, and is shifting its operations from kinetic more towards counterterrorism in Gaza and I did think that would be turning north towards Hezbollah to engage that far greater strategic threat. But of course, we saw twice now that Iran has launched ballistic missile attacks against Israel, first in April and now just about a week ago, we saw that 200 missiles, as was mentioned, but Israel now is going to be responding. Of course, in the last month or so, Israel certainly turned the tables against Iran and its regional proxies, and this is something we have to look forward to, to Israel taking the offensive.",

It is a standing army, and it is a terror army, numbers in the tens of thousands and has special forces for which they were actually planning their own October 7th style attack for years, to attack Israel from the north into the Galilee, the northern area of Israel.Not to mention they have a stockpile of 150,000 plus missiles, rockets, and other airborne projectiles, so they present a strategic threat to Israel. In mid-September, Israel's government stated that their new war aim is to return the 80,000 residents that have been internally displaced from their homes to the northern communities. That's another thing we cannot forget. On October 8th, Hezbollah started launching rockets into Israel unprovoked, and since then, 80,000 of Israelis have been forced to leave their homes along the northern communities. So his war aims to be able to restore security for those residents to return home, which is admittedly a fairly limited war aim, and it is trying to achieve that by pushing Hezbollah north to a topographical feature called the Litani River, about 20 miles north of the border. So I believe certainly it can achieve that, but it still leaves the question of Hezbollah being in power and in control and as a capable force in Lebanon, whether Israel will advance and try to defeat Hezbollah as a force remains to be seen.",

He is continuing to spread what some have said are baseless attacks about the response from FEMA. But other than that, it's been pretty standard Trump rally fair. He's been criticizing the administration's immigration policies and attacking Vice President Harris' competence. He said, \"I've been on a mission to rescue our country and to give you back the country that you live in, the country you were born in.\" He said, nothing will stop him, \"not even in the face of death,\" clearly referencing the multiple assassination attempts on his life. Now, he is delivering this message in Dodge County, Wisconsin. It's one of dozens of small rural counties in this state where his campaign is hoping to run up the score in this election. He won this county by about a two to one margin last time, and his campaign has been working aggressively to match that margin. And if you look at the polling in this state, you understand why they are concerned. He is well -- the latest poll from Marquette shows this race at 52 to 48 with Harris having the slight edge. Donald Trump is working hard to reverse that. He has been here four times in the last nine days, and I expect he'll be here quite a bit more -- Omar.",

That's never going to happen to the degree that those critics want. Let's just be honest.The Harris campaign is going to do what it believes it needs to do in order to win the race, and that means going on Stephen Colbert's show. That means going on \"The View\" on Tuesday. That means going on shows where she's going to be welcomed, where she's not going to be interrogated and that is just the reality of campaigning in the same way that Donald Trump usually mostly goes on right-wing shows, like on his friends at Fox News shows. So that's the reality here, but I do think it's notable that Harris is going out and doing a lot of TV this week. It is a sudden change in her strategy, and it aligns with the early voting schedule. She is now out there talking about registering to vote, getting your ballot early, and having a plan to vote, and that's the reason why she's doing all these TV appearances. By the way, that \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast just came out. That podcast is a very big deal, even though it usually is about sex and relationships. This is a 40-minute conversation where Harris talks about reproductive rights. She also opens up about her mom. So a lot of people, including from the Trump campaign, are going to ridicule Harris for going on a sex podcast, but it actually is one of the most in-depth interviews of Harris this year.",

And, you know, election day is not kind of the moment of our election, it is kind of the end of our election now, right? I mean, it's kind of a rolling process for several weeks.You know, Harris' campaign has been a pretty cautious one in a lot of different respects. As you said, they have not done a lot of conventional media appearances. Her messaging has not been that edgy. I think the underlying assumption of the campaign, as articulated to me by some people involved in it, is that particularly in the states that matter most, there is -- they believe there is a majority that does not want to reelect Donald Trump, does not want to put him in power for four more years, even though they thought he was good on the economy, they are resisting him as a threat to their rights and their values and to democracy. And that therefore her job is less to make the case against Trump than it is to reassure voters who are already inclined to vote against them, that she is an acceptable alternative. Now, there are Democrats who aren't easy with that approach, but I think this media strategy, by and large, reflect -- continues to reflect that. She is putting herself in front of audiences that they are hoping, obviously they can move over to their side, but I would be surprised if she is on \"The View\" with a really slashing message about Donald Trump. I think a lot of this is about introducing her and reassuring voters she thinks just need enough confidence not to vote for Trump again.",

You know, it's a special place when it's up and running to come and see it. But also, please don't take your attention away from our neighbors who need our help more. I think we can rally and build each other up, but I don't know what we can do for places where roads are washed out, and mules are carrying supplies right now. You know, just zoom out much larger.

Pope Francis is revealing that he has now chosen 21 new Cardinals in a move that could reshape the Catholic Church, cardinals who will eventually decide who will succeed the 87-year-old pontiff after his passing. CNN Vatican correspondent, Christopher Lamb is live in London for us now. So Christopher, I mean, how are these new Cardinals expected to impact the church going forward?",

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, choosing Cardinals is the closest thing a Pope has to succession planning, because, of course, it is from the Cardinals that the future Pope will be chosen, and the Cardinals will be electing Pope Francis' successor, and they hold a very influential role in the Catholic Church.And the Pope today pointed Cardinals from across the globe, including the Archbishop of Tehran in Iran, a very significant decision that shows the Pope's desire for dialogue with Islam, for pushing peace in the region. Before announcing the names of the Cardinals, he called for a ceasefire across the Middle East, including in Lebanon, and of course, commemorated the seventh of October Hamas attacks, the one-year anniversary of them. So using his appointments of Cardinals to try and influence things on the world stage. But more broadly, the Pope has really reshaped the body that will choose his successor. He chooses Cardinals from across the globe, from far-flung peripheries, if you like. He chose Cardinals today from Indonesia, from Japan, Ivory Coast, and Algeria. Now in the past, it was assumed that Bishops in certain parts of the world, mainly in Italy, would become Cardinals. That's no longer the case. The Pope has really reshaped it. It's almost as if he wants to choose the unsung heroes of the church to become Cardinals. Now that's very significant when you think about who might come after Pope Francis -- Omar.",
