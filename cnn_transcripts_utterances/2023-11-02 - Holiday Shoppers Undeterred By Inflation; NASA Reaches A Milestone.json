Lucy is the first mission to investigate the Trojan asteroid swarms, which are asteroid clusters along Jupiter`s orbital path. Armed with cameras, a thermometer and an infrared imaging spectrometer, Lucy will collect the first high resolution images of these asteroids. The spacecraft gets her name from the Lucy fossil, an ancient human ancestor whose remains transform the study of hominid evolution. NASA hopes its Lucy transforms the understanding of the evolution of the solar system. After making a few fly-bys of Earth for a gravity slingshot boost, Lucy`s expected to reach her first objective in the asteroid belt between Earth and Jupiter. She`ll then travel to the Trojan asteroids all named after the heroes of Homer`s \"Iliad\".",

We can construct allthese comparisons between all the different varieties and the diversity that we see in the Trojans, the unexpected diversity -- the different colors, the different collision histories. It`s really a repository of fossils, as we like to say, of things that happened at the earliest stages of solar system evolution.",
