And most of it is, well, it's probably not tethered to reality. The post-Roe universe has proven a lot of the concerns, a lot of the fears, a lot of the warnings accurate. And I think this has driven it to a whole another level.

And Republicans can't afford that. Now, there's some statistics here that are really important to understand. Eight in 10 Republicans actually support IVF and believe in it. And so now you've got something that they have to -- they're going to have to really wrestle to the ground. And when you look at already, we had a big faction of voters who are going to say, I want to vote on women's rights. Seven in 10 independent women said one of the primary reason that they're going to go the polls is because of abortion. Nine in 10 Democratic women said that that's going to drive them to the polls. I think you're going to see that even increase. And there was a huge faction of younger Republican women who are saying that abortion was important to them, too. Now this is becoming even more personal, especially as there's more and more awareness of how many women, including myself, have gone through fertility and would not have families otherwise. This is incredibly personal, and this is incredibly important. And I think it's going to be a big, big problem for Republicans.

They're all going to be treated as humans, and everything follows from that.And that is the logic, and that has always been the logic of trying to overturn Roe versus Wade. This is a social movement. It's lasted for decades. 4 And what happens to social movements when they succeed, I think, is what we're seeing play out here. That's, you know, a different way of what President Biden was talking about. When a movement succeeds, it either goes out of business or the extremists, which is what I think we see in this case, they continue with the logic. They want to relive the victory. They want to sort of move things forward. And you take the very next step, and you get this sort of chamber of horrors where all of a sudden, things that really were not entirely meant as actual policy to be played out are the logical extension of doing away with abortion. If you -- if you can't -- if you're saying that, from the moment of fertilization, this is an entity that now has all of the rights of a child, all kinds of absurdities are going to flow from it.

There are real policies that emanate from this; real people and families that are impacted. It certainly cuts along race and class.And I think over time, right after Wade -- as we started -- right after the overturn of Wade, we started to see all these draconian measures in different states start to pop up. What happened? We start to see a lot of Republicans start reducing the amount of conversation they had around this issue. They were running away from it. You saw that even in New York 3 with Tom Suozzi. It wasn't about reproductive rights and reproductive health news. It was about immigration. They've pivoted to that now. So the point being that, if you're a Democrat, you talk about and hit -- hit on the fact that all of these policies that you think are siloed will become nationalized if Republicans take back the House, if Republicans take back the Senate, if you've got Donald Trump back in the White House; that all of these things that you think you can move from state to state to run away from, guess what?

And they are degrading Russia's ability to finance its war machine. We know that they've lost thousands of pieces of equipment, military equipment, due directly to sanctions. And it appears -- and we don't know the full package yet -- but what -- what President Biden has said and what the deputy secretary, Wally Adeyemo said was that these sanctions are going to target Russia's military industrial complex. And these front companies and other outlets, they've placed in third -- third countries to facilitate the import of technology and equipment for that military. What that means is when you sanction a target, they always look for ways to evade sanctions. And they all do. They all do it. And so it's a little bit of a game of whack-a-mole. And Treasury's always following up to make sure they close those loopholes. And it looks like that's a lot of the targets today, are going to be how they circumvent those sanctions to import goods through third countries that aren't part of the international sanctions regime.

But at the same time, it's not that different from what Bibi has been saying for a while now. I mean, he's been saying -- he said it just a few weeks ago -- that Israel needs full security control from the river to the sea, right? He's -- he could not have been clearer with that. So it's disappointing, but he's kind of following through on what he's been laying out there publicly. The question is, how much can the U.S. influence that decision making? And while Israel pays attention to the U.S. perspective, and we can -- we are able to change a few things, the Israeli government has always, even when I was working with them, they go ahead with their plans.",
