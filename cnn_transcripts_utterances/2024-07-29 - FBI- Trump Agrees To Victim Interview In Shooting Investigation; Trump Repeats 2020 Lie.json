The former president has agreed to meet with the bureau for a victim interview. CNN senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, joins us now. I mean, Evan, this would be routine in the investigation.

And the FBI requested the interview, the foreign president has now agreed to it is a voluntary thing. And it is the standard part of -- of an investigation like this, right? He is considered to be a victim of a crime. And so therefore, they want to talk to him about what he experienced that day. Is there anything that they're missing about what -- anything that he saw or -- or witnessed before this shooting took place?So those are parts of the -- the -- the standard process. What is interesting, too, is -- is a lot -- a lot of new details that we got from this call with the senior officials of the -- of the FBI who are overseeing this investigation, and including the fact that they said that, again, no motive so far has been uncovered as part of this investigation. They've also found no co-conspirators, any accomplices. But they spent a lot of time trying to understand him. And they think, you know, again, he's a -- he was a loner, he was -- essentially his social circle was his family. And then he spent a significant amount of time preparing for this attack. He bought gun components and -- and he also bought chemicals to make his improvised devices. He bought those online using aliases, using encrypted e-mails. Those are the things that the FBI has been spending so much time trying to get into. We also know that, you know, he spent a lot of time, you know, that day visiting the site, doing essentially surveillance ahead of when the former president finally gets on stage. And one of the things that the FBI is still trying to -- the -- the behavioral analysis people are trying to understand is, you know, again, how does this fit with his mental state? Something we know, he researched depression and so on. The question is, you know, was he ever treated for that? They've found no indication of that yet right now.",

Her campaign has raised $200 million since her bid for the White House began with President Biden's endorsement. Two of three donors are giving to the campaign for the very first time, and more than 170,000 people have volunteered to work on the campaign.And as Harris considers her own running mate, she and her allies are ramping up attacks on Donald Trump. They will target J.D. Vance for his controversial comments and say he's too experienced to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Meanwhile, the former president is row testing his own attacks on Harris. Trump is rolling out new insults at his campaign events to find out what riles up his supporters most. He often does that. Let's discuss with CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein, Republican strategist, Doug Heye, and CNN political commentator, Jamal Simmons, he was also communications director for Vice President Harris. So we have an all-star lineup here with this panel. Ron, I'm going to kick it off with you. You had the DNC just three weeks away. The big question, can Vice President Harris maintain this incredible momentum by anyone's measure, and the run up to the convention?",

I mean, there is enormous energy in the Democratic Party for years now about preventing Trump from imposing his vision on America. But that was largely suppressed by the disillusionment and, you know, depression really about Democrat -- from Democrats about their prospects and Biden. The political strategist, Mike Patirizer (ph), using data from the Democratic firm, Catalyst, has calculated that there are 93 million separate people, individuals who have come out to vote against Trump, or Trumpism in 2018, 2020, and 2022. And what Harris has done, above all, she still has lots of challenges in the Electoral College and getting to 270. But what she's done is I think re-energize what that -- that coalition with Democrats called the anti-MAGA coalition, and it has put her and the party back in the game.",

But now we're getting to a different place where Democrats aren't talking about it in big lofty terms, talking about it in very straightforward words, like, it's just weird. It's odd.These people don't think people who haven't had kids ought to participate in the government or maybe people who do have kids, you get extra votes, or maybe, you know, whatever other MAGA Project 2025 oddity that the Trump people want to go along with. They're hearing about it. And I think people -- most people in America don't -- don't really like it. They don't want to hear about it. So, right now, you've got Donald Trump about to be investigated. We're not investigated, but we talk to you about the FBI because he's been a victim in crime.

And, you know, his -- his kind of, sometimes oblique comments about dictator on day one, or you never have to vote again, you don't even have to look at kind of parsing through those comments. You -- you -- you can -- you can explore what he has specifically proposed in terms of gutting the civil service or weaponizing the Justice Department or claiming the right to fire U.S. attorneys who will not investigate specific individuals that he -- that he targets or deploying federal force into blue jurisdictions over the objections of local officials.I mean, this -- this is why Democrats believe there is an anti-MAGA majority, based on the results of 2018 and 2022. The problem is, is that not everyone votes on those concerns, as we were talking about earlier, about democracy. Ultimately, there is a slice of the electorate, who doesn't see the choice in those terms, and are really focusing on who they believe will make life better for their family. So while Harris has enormous strengths, on prosecuting the case about democracy and rights more broadly. Ultimately, there -- there's going to have to be an economic message there too, to -- to push back against this threat, because -- because the evidence is that the voters worried about it are not quite enough on their own to win, particularly in the swing states that will decide the election.",

If she can't -- if she can't gain -- regain enough ground to -- to win Arizona, Nevada or Georgia, she's in the same position as Biden was, which is yes, across that rickety bridge of sweeping Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And if that's the case, the key group for her becomes I think, a working class white women who are more open to Democrats in the working class white men, she polled very well, among those women and the three \"Fox\" polls that came out this weekend, probably the best news for Democrats and, you know, on the polling front and the last few days.
