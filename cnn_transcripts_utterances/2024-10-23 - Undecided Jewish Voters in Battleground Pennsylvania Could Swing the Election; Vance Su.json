We were talking in the break that in polling has shown that voters generally support a pathway to citizenship.The business community, my second point, employs DACA recipients because they can legally work and live in the United States. We have seen them file to the supreme court support for this population. And third, the Trump Administration did try to end DACA. And without those protections, they can certainly be deported. But these are immigrants who are brought into the U.S. as children. They are no longer children or young adults, some of them are much older now. But certainly, it is remarkable only because Republicans and Democrats have at the very least agreed to protect this population of immigrants. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWS HOUR:  And I know DACA recipients who are married to U.S. citizens. They're a part of mixed status families. So if they're hearing this, how are their American citizen family members going to react to J.D. Vance saying that, because these are people that all they've ever known is America and being American essentially because they were brought here as children.

They have talked in really intense terms about what that would mean.They haven't really gotten into the specifics of what a plan would be, whether it be going door to door. They were asked that -- Trump was asked that rather in the second presidential debate. But this is going to be a priority of a Trump Administration and it's another thing that, it does seem worthwhile to think about for voters as they go forward here, this is what it would be.
