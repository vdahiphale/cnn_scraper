It didn't go well at all.Plus, legal machine guns, the Supreme Court undoes a Trump-era decision to ban bump stocks, the same bump stocks that a madman used to slaughter 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival. And an interview you're only going to see here, my nothing is off limits sit down with UFC's Dana White, including why he's choosing Donald Trump as his fighter in the 2024 election. Donald Trump coming up bigly short with Wall Street. Thursday, he received a kind of a hero's welcome, didn't he, inside of Congress, and who could forget that handshake with him and Mitch McConnell, but with the C-suite crowd, the corporate titans, they're not fully buying in, at least not yet. Wall Street was primed to go all-in on Trump. The headlines teased it over and over again. The New York Times a month ago, in about-face, Wall Street's big donors warmed to Trump. A couple weeks later, this from Yahoo!, prominent billionaires from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are warming up to Donald Trump. The Wall Street Journal had chatter about an Elon Musk bromance inside Donald Trump and Elon Musk's growing alliance. And just this week, Politico published this, never mind, Wall Street titans shake off qualms and embrace Trump. You already see that happening. Donations from the billionaire class have flowed into his campaign. People like JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon went from never Trump to it definitely maybe Trump. It makes sense, too. I mean, Trump has promised another round of corporate tax cuts, and it all led us to Thursday. That's the day that Trump spoke to a roomful of the top CEOs at the business roundtable meeting. Now, Trump, he probably hoped that it would play out like this the Wolf of Wall Street. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I know and I've all of us have really watched you on Shark Tank if I saw a contestant begin to meander and go in a different direction than the policy or the actual bare bones and brass tacks, you would have a problem with it.So, the meandering, that doesn't mean anything to you in this context? It's just one meeting. I mean, this was the meeting for the C-suite execs. O'LEARY: No, I think there's many meetings and particularly the debate coming up is really going to matter.

So, that's one data point. Talk to me about energy. I haven't heard enough about that. I want energy security. I think to solve our national debt. We can use the ANWR, like Norway did. I've talked about that already. Tell me which candidate is going to use a royalty off the ANWR to pay down a significant portion of the debt because we've never tapped one of the largest reserves of oil on Earth. And oil is around for years to come. I mean, some people don't like that, but it is what it is. So, I want to hear policy on that. I definitely want to hear border security. And I finally heard some policy on immigration, for example, at MIT, they're a third of the classes that I teach at Harvard and MIT are foreign nationals that get kicked out of the country after I spend to educate them, make them the best they can be as engineers at MIT, and then we kick them out? That's nuts. And so I would like to see policy on that. And I heard some of that out of Trump. I haven't heard out of Biden yet. I'm all ears. I am a policy guy. Give me policy.",

ASHLEY ETIENNE, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR V.P. HARRIS: I mean, I disagree with Kevin immensely, to use one of his words, in that I don't think Trump is serious about selecting someone who is a serious legislator. I mean, Donald Trump -- usually a president picks a V.P. that shores up their negatives, expands their base, that's why he chose Pence the last time. But he learns a lesson on January 6th. And he learned that the lesson he learned was that Pence put the country before Donald Trump. Donald Trump is not going to make that mistake again. I think the most important criteria for his selection is going to be loyalty to him, not to the country, not someone who gets things done. I mean, Trump is legendary for not getting anything done. I mean, in slowing everything down, even when he has the majority in both chambers. So that's my reaction is like, regrettably, he's not going to choose someone who's serious.

They remember how he tried to diminish Barack Obama, our first Black president, with a birtherism movement. They remember that Black male unemployment or black unemployment was double record high under Trump. So, they're not forgetting these. They're not falling for this rhetoric in all of these efforts.But -- but Kadia and I were talking backstage in the green room, and my point to her was, this focus on Black men and Black voters and all this polling, I really am enjoying because it is really having the reverse effect than what I think Trump wants.
