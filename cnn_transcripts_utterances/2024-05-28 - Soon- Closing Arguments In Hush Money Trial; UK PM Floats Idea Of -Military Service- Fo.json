We are nearing the conclusion of the first criminal trial ever brought against a former U.S. president. Today, closing arguments begin in Donald Trump's historic criminal hush money trial. Prosecutors from the Manhattan D.A.'s office will have to weave together weeks of evidence and salacious testimony as they tried to prove that Trump falsified business records in an attempt to silence a porn star during the lead up to his 2016 election victory. But first, it's the defense. CNN has learned they are expected to focus on the credibility of Michael Cohen during closing arguments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we've guessed wrong about that previously, but that is a piece of information that is kind of stuck out with me to feel, like if race is going to change very fundamentally, a conviction might be the thing to do it. But, of course, that's not a foregone conclusion. New reporting out this morning from \"The Bulwark\" shows that the Trump campaign is looking at one specific juror, an older, former financial professional, who they say is reacted favorably to some of the Trump campaign's -- that Trump -- the defense's witnesses who have come in.

You can see it's that portion of the Southern Plains, that's where we have the best chance for those strong to severe thunderstorms. Other thunderstorms expected across Florida, but not really to the level that we're seeing in the southern plains. You've already got a severe thunderstorm watch an effect right here, essentially, this area south of Oklahoma City, just to the northern suburbs of Dallas. That's because it's where we already have a lot of these ongoingthunderstorms. You can see a lot of lightning, some pretty gusty winds and the potential for some hail with some of those storms that will continue through the afternoon. You can see more of them beginning to fire up once we get past lunchtime today continuing through the evening, and then we really start to see that line form once we get close to around sunset tonight. That line will continue to slide into Dallas by overnight hours, and then gradually into Houston by the very early portion of tomorrow morning. So again, this is going to be pretty much an all day thing as that system races across to the east. Overall, the biggest concern is actually going to be very large hail. You're talking the size of golf balls, egg maybe even, perhaps even larger than that. Still some damaging winds? A yes, the potential for a tornado does exist and that's for Houston, Dallas over towards Midland, Amarillo and up into Oklahoma City. And again, we've had a tremendous amount of tornadoes already this year, looking at just since the last few days, again, towards 76 tornado reports courts, almost 1,000 damaging wind reports and over 300 hail reports. Remember some of those being the size of grapefruits or even larger. And yes, when we talk about the tornadoes, look yes, we get it, May is the peak. This is the time of year we would normally see it, but given that, this is still well above average for normal. Normally to this point, we would have maybe the about 721 tornadoes. We've had 989 and that's the preliminary total. So keep in mind that number could actually go out. There are still serving a lot of the damage and potential tornadoes from the last few days. So that number could even go higher. And again, just comparatively speaking to other years, Kasie, when you look back, this is the highest total we've had since 2011.",
