So they've had a lot of time to harden their facilities. They've had a lot of time to make things very difficult. But Iran is not invulnerable, so for the most part, the Israelis will probably seek to break them economically. That is attack, for example, oil terminals such as the major oil terminal around Kharg Island. Those are the kinds of things that could happen and probably the most likely, although I do think that this will be a much more severe response than the one the Israelis mounted back in April when they basically took out one facility in -- near Isfahan.

Qatar is the grand interlocutor, if you will, between Iran and the rest of the world. And that indicates to me that there is some movement on a diplomatic front where the Iranians are trying to de-escalate it from their point of view. Of course, the Israelis are very angry at what happened to them both from Hamas and from Hezbollah, and they are at the very least going to pursue those targets in both Gaza and Lebanon. As far as Iran is concerned, because of the latest attack, they believe that they have to do something against that. So there will be -- I think there will be some degree of conflict still coming.
