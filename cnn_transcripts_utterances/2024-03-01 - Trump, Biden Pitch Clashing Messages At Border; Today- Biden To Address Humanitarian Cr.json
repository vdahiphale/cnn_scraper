Instead of playing politics with this issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me, or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill.We can do it together. You know and I know it's the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country has ever seen. So, instead of playing politics with the issue, why don't we just get together and get it done? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, that's a good message to former President Trump because he's the person that's talking to Republican members of the House to block this bill from going on the floor. They want to -- they want chaos on the border that they can continue to campaign on into November. I had been one of the members that have been the most critical on the border with both administrations. And I support this bill because it addresses a lot of the critical issues that are impacting the country -- across the country with a mass migration that we're receiving on our southern border. And we would have been able to have 3000 -- 4000 more asylum officers, over a hundred new immigration judges to process these claims faster and be able to remove folks who don't qualify under the asylum laws now. We would have had 1100 new agents on the ground. These are all great proposals that will help fix and alleviate the problem on our southern border.",

They know we need resources on the border.I've been talking about this for three years now. We need more agents. We need more immigration judges. We need more asylum officers. We need better technology. We can fix this border problem. And we have proposals. I've been pushing for the Safe Zone Act, which creates safe zones in Guatemala and Panama and Colombia and places thousands of miles away from our southern border where migrants can process their claim at that juncture. And it removes cartels out of the equation. It takes the pressure off our southern border. But the border problem is not a Democratic or Republican problem. It's an American problem that requires bipartisan solutions. And we need everyone at the table, including Donald Trump's allies.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, and it also comes as we had been hearing that there were reports of progress over the course of the last week. But we know that events like this can impact those negotiations -- can complicate those negotiations. In fact, President Biden yesterday saying himself that he believes that it definitely will complicate those negotiations. A senior member of Hamas also saying that they will not allow these negotiations to be what he described as cover for what he said are Israel's crimes against the Palestinians.But what we are also hearing today, Wolf, are these growing calls for an investigation. The French and the German Foreign Ministers both calling for thorough investigations into what happened yesterday. The United States also making clear that they have more questions about what happened. There are, of course, those conflicting timelines as it relates to when the gunfire broke out between what eyewitnesses on the grounds have told us and what the Israeli military claims yesterday. But what's also still not clear is why Israeli troops opened fire. They have only said so far that it was because of threatening behavior by individuals who they say approached their forces. But what this is certainly doing, Wolf, is that it's shining a spotlight on the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. In particular, in northern Gaza. We know that over the course of the last month, aid going into Gaza, declined by half at a time when the humanitarian need was only growing. We know that that is partly due to the fact that there are these stringent inspections of aid trucks going into Gaza. There is a need -- a clear need for more border crossings to be opened, in particular in northern Gaza, according to humanitarian aid officials. And we also know that there is a lack of security for these aid trucks in particular after U.S. officials said that Hamas -- police -- that police officers in Gaza who are ultimately run by the Hamas government there that they were being targeted by the Israeli military. And so, all of those factors combining to result in what we saw yesterday. You see -- when you see these hundreds of people massing around these trucks, it is because of how dire the need for food and essential services has become. The World Food Program is now warning that more than half a million people in Gaza are on the brink of famine. And we are also, Wolf, getting incredibly sad and growing reports of children dying of dehydration and malnutrition. Just today, the Palestinian Ministry of Health saying that four more children in northern Gaza died as a result of dehydration and malnutrition, bringing the total number of children just in the past week in northern Gaza who have died of those causes to a total of 10 now, Wolf.",
