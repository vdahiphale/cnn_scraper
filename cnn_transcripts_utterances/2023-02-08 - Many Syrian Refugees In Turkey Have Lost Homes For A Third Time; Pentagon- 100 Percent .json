Amid all the horror and devastation, Turkey's government has restricted access to Twitter after 18 people were detained for making so called provocative posts about the quake. Some Turkish journalists are denouncing the restrictions, claiming rescue teams have been using Twitter to communicate. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Adana, Turkey, as the golden period for finding survivors, typically one to three days, rapidly comes to a close.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A five-year-old emerges from underneath the rubble in Turkey's hard hit Hatay, one of the youngest of thousands of life saved. But for too many, it was too late. In the town of Kalkan, they mourned one of the many who've not made it out alive. With the death toll rising by the hour, this is a race against time. How many are buried under the wreckage of this massive quake zone? No one really knows. Estimates in the tens of thousands. Here in Adana, search and rescue crews worked tirelessly around the clock, digging through what used to be a 14 storey residential building where families lay asleep when the monstrous earthquake hit. Survivors have gathered at the site of the rescue mission, their shelter and hot meals. In the bitter cold, they huddle around these fires, everyone with a story of the horror they've survived, the shock, the trauma, the pain visible on every face. Parents doing what they can to try and make their little ones forget. Many here are anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones and friends buried under what's left of their homes. (on camera): Get down. They're asking us to get down. And we believe this is because they're scanning the building, the wreckage. This is a very, very careful and delicate operation that's going on to try and see if they can locate any survivors, because so far they haven't been able to. (voice-over): No survivors yet, only lifeless body is pulled. It's been three days. Why can't they get my son out, this father wails. As night falls, the rest of the family wait desperately for any news of 25-year-old Cert (ph). They've been out here for three long nights.",

KRISHNAMOORTHIJust as an example, you know, over the Aleutian Islands, the balloon could have been shot down. It would have been shot down over waters that are almost 2 miles deep, Jake.

This is probably the last thing all of this tip it for tat, his own members of his party fighting with each other, making these accusations against each other. You know, Kevin McCarthy, he's been trying to focus, at least he says, the messaging of his party on the Biden administration, on trying to have this debate between big spending and whether or not these packages are fueling rising prices. None of the attention goes there when your own party is in disarray like this. This can't be what he wanted. It's probably the last thing that he wants today.
