      "sentences": "The current path of the storm is expected in the Tampa Bay area and cut directly across the state, east to west, all the way across the state, with the potential for this storm to both enter Florida as a hurricane and leave Florida as a hurricane on the Atlantic Coast.This could be the worst storm to hit Florida in over a century, and God willing it won't be, but that's what it's looking like right now. I immediately approved the pre-landfall emergency declarations in Florida. This is the second one in a week, the second time in a week, and there have been two before that, by the way. And I sent FEMA Administrator Criswell down to Florida yesterday to work intensively with the state and local partners as we prepare to deploy more resources. She will continue that work between Florida and North Carolina in the coming days. I'm calling on the airlines and other companies to provide as much service as possible to accommodate evacuations and not to engage in price gouging, to just do it on the level. And last night, I spoke again with the governor of Florida, DeSantis, and Tampa Mayor Castro and -- actually, Castor -- and I made it clear to them that they should reach out, including to me directly, with everything else they may need as they see this storm hits. I gave them my personal number to contact me here in the White House. Most importantly, I have heard everyone, everyone currently located in Hurricane Milton's path to listen to the local officials and follow safety instructions. You all have been reporting on the highways, shoulders being open. Everybody's heading out. And if you're under evacuation orders, you should evacuate now, now, now. You should have already evacuated. It's a matter of life and death, and that's not hyperbole. It's a matter of life and death. So, let me add that FEMA has provided 300 ambulances to move people who can't move themselves out of health care facilities. And while we prepare for Hurricane Milton, we're still surging resources in North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee to respond to Hurricane Helene. And it's real. The impact is still there. And we're going to leave -- we're not going to leave until the job is done. It's going to take time. And before it's over, it's going to take tens of billions of dollars to get it done. And Kamala and I are keeping all of you in our prayers out there. There's a lot of people. The good news is, just before we called you in, I received information that the number of missing persons has been significantly reduced lost from the first hurricane, but we will have more information on that later. So that's the situation, and we're not going to leave until the job is finished. It's going to take a while.",

It puts people in circumstances where they panic, where they're really, really, really worried, and they think now they're being taken care of.
