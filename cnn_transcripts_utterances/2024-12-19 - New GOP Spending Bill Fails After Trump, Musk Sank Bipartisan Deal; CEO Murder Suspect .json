And here on Capitol Hill tonight, things are quickly lurching toward disaster, or very well may already be there. 38 Republicans just bucked President-elect Donald Trump, voting no, alongside all but two Democrats, to torpedo a spending deal that Republicans cut not with Democrats, but among themselves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): We will regroup and we will come up with another solution. So stay tuned. Very disappointing to us that all but two Democrats voted against aid to farmers and ranchers, against disaster relief, against all these bipartisan measures that had already been negotiated and decided upon.

Democrats are pointing the finger directly at Trump and Musk, some even referring to President Musk and Vice President Trump.

Even though they can wait and deal with that next year, he wanted that off the table now. Well, that caused a major problem within his own ranks. 38 Republicans voted against him, in large measure, because they don't want to suspend the national debt limit. They want tax -- they want spending cuts instead. And Democrats say, they didn't want to give him that issue, because they want to use the debt limit as leverage, to try to push back against Donald Trump's efforts to push through tax cuts, next year. They believe this could help them fight that effort. Now, Speaker Johnson, as he walked off the House floor, came out and he attacked Democrats. But he did not say what is next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
