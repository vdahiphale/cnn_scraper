The breaching of these very secure defenses until now the Israelis had which put Gaza under siege for so many years.The Israeli now saying it is part of their next plan, they will cut the supplies of electricity, cut the supplies of fuel and goods into Gaza, which will just reinforce the siege that Palestinians have been living under for years. But now, you have the addition of, and we don't know the numbers here, but we're talking about multiple dozens of Israeli hostages which will be absolutely at the forefront of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's mind, as they look to what their plans might be going forward in Gaza itself. The IDF spokesperson wouldn't confirm that there would be a ground incursion. We're certainly seeing a buildup of troops around Gaza.

This is Israel Defense Forces making sure that they've secured that border fence, just a couple of kilometers from here through to Gaza, the defense that the Hamas militants breached massively and came out into Sderot and other places, secure that and make sure that they hit as many Hamas firing positions to stop the rockets coming and try to begin to target Hamas leaders as intelligence allows them to do, active real time intelligence.We're hearing multiple drones and they are also scouring the area. So in the immediate aftermath, that's what we're going to see. Because I think this area is still in a situation of being secured, you are not yet having this big expected military deployment of further forces into the area. You wouldn't want to put artillery units out in remote fields where there could be Hamas militants still around. All of this groundwork needs to be put in place first but real focus is on securing that border fence and making sure there are no more Hamas militants around, that's the immediate issue. But, of course, the deterrence of Hamas having a high number of hostages, dispersed across Gaza will be a very big political decision for Prime Minister Netanyahu. We've already, at CNN, heard from the families of those taken away. They've already seen the videos of their loved ones on social media taken away. It's very clear what is happening. It is very clear how the families feel about it. This is absolutely terrible for them. They're going through an absolute living hell at moment and there will be political pressure on the prime minister not to jeopardize the lives of those hostages, that my military action in Gaza as the prime minister is vowing to do potentially does that. There are off-ramps in that situation right now. That is really not clear at all. And up likely that Hamas is to give any ground. This is the strongest bargaining position Hamas has had, I think we could say, ever with the Israeli government. The stakes are high because the stakes are people's lives, Becky.",

We have seen some activity across that border, albeit relatively small at this point. Two, three, four, I think attacks from Hezbollah into the Shebaa Farms area in Israel which has been responded to in kind by the IDF.But how concerned, are you, Robin, that we could see an escalation, an escalation away from Gaza into the West Bank, on to the northern borders anon to the southern borders perhaps of Israel as well, and you talk about Israel now looking very vulnerable in the eyes of the Palestinians but also this region.

So, if you saw a wider war, there would be what military experts call a state of overmatch. Israel is very vulnerable because it has one major airport and one major electricity grid and there are certain installations that you took out that Israel could be crippled. But it also faces the kind of allies and militias that are deployed in Syria with their missiles and rockets.So there are three different fronts that Israel faces if it were to become a wider war. But the most important thing to note is that despite the -- the three or four little attacks on the Shebaa farms on the border with Israel, the fact is that Hezbollah did not act simultaneously and hasn't in the past and these are two different movements that have different agendas, they are different, one is Shiite and one is Sunni and they have their own rivalries, their own separate agendas. It would have been much more effective if the game plan was to do something together, from the start, not later on once Israel kind of understood that it was under attack and had begun planning to response. So one could only hope. And the reality is that down the road, Israel will face challenges on all three orders and Iran is aiding all three of those countries. So you have place the war in Gaza in a larger context of both Israel's immediate border and the larger picture of the shadow war Israel is playing out with Iran today in many places.",

You add to that the fact that they have seen, the Israelis have seen over the last several days their fellow citizens being brutalized, being murdered, being kidnapped. You know, that takes a toll, a psychological toll on the soldiers who are going to be conducting the operations.

They have had to know where the Israeli army was and obviously many of them weren't in their think base camps in and around the Gaza Strip. They were elsewhere. So the combination of intelligence, training the forces for what they have to do as infantry men or drone pilots or whatever and then attacking specific targets that are outside the Strip all require a lot of coordination and a lot of help. You can't just do that from inside of Gaza. You have to have intelligence. You have to have human sources in other places in Israel.

Where are they supposed to go?I mean, it is not like they're allowed to leave this area, there has to be a consideration as we've discussed in the context of U.S. missions, the collateral damage, the impact on civilians -- that's the primary concern.

I think, you know, when I heard Minister Netanyahu yesterday say they needed to get out of Gaza, the Palestinians who weren't involved in the fight, you know, I think everybody in the world said that is a ridiculous comment. That is ludicrous. Where are they going to go? This is a two-mile wide stretch of land that has two million people. But I think he was saying really was get away from any facilities you know tend to house Hamas because we're going to bomb them. We're going to do direct strikes against those facilities. So you could move about within the area but Victor, I don't think it is going to be very precise or very surgical in terms of surgical -- in terms of strikes by the Israelis in this area. They are going to go in and roll over much of Gaza. That is the kind of war this has become. And they see that the young people that came across the border yesterday, I mean, they're not wearing uniforms. This is not an army. This is a terrorist group. So it is very difficult to separate the so-called military-age male inside of Gaza from normal citizens.

So we -- we have heard just in the past hour or so that Israel has now declared that it is in a state of war. And the prime minister has been meeting with the security apparatus here. And ahead of that statement. We heard Benjamin Netanyahu describe this as war. A war he said that Israel would win. And it would be punishing and brutal the response to what he describes as the enemy's activities. We know that there has been a buildup of ground troops, movement towards the border, which of course has been breached. This is the border between Israel and Gaza that has been breached by some 1,000 militants yesterday morning, Saturday morning -- well breached. And the Israeli forces still trying to reassure Israelis living in the communities around that they are securing and protecting those communities. The community of Sderot where our colleague Nic Robertson is, he has witnessed the debris of a real fire fight which clearly happened yesterday. Israeli forces say that community is now secured and protected. But look, I mean, Israelis on the Israeli side of the border, those who haven't been taken hostage, of course, are massively concerned about the failure of intelligence, their security at this point. The IDF describing this as very early days to mean earlier on today, this is the beginning of the operation. And certainly the images that we're seeing now is the result of bombardment by Israeli forces from the air. Nic has been hearing those booms. We can even hear in Tel Aviv. Certainly we are hearing activities, booms of activity; whether or not that is coming from the actual bombing of Gaza or not remains to be seen. But you know, this is -- this is the security operation now in action on the part of the Israelis who have been caught extremely flat-footed when it comes to the securing of their border. The Palestinians, of course, describe this as a siege and that siege of Gaza now reinforced by the Israelis, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that they will cut the supplies of electricity, of fuel, of goods. So for those 2 million that you have just been discussing with Mark, Victor, you know, those 2 million people have a very worrying time ahead of them. And they are to all intents and purposes hostages in their own city. As there are -- as we know multiple dozens, the number is not yet being released by the Israeli, but multiple dozens of Israelis who have now been taken hostage, captured on the Israeli side of the border, taken back into Gaza and are now being held hostage. The Hamas militant group has said they are littered around Gaza and it will be with real concern that the Israeli forces now work out what their next moves are. The Palestinians who are living within Gaza, lest we forget already, more than 200 have lost their lives, thousands have been injured in this attack as we know now there are 500 deaths on the part of the Israeli, 44 of those as we understand it are IDF soldiers. Stay with us as we continue to monitor these images. (CROSSTALKING)",

JONATHAN GREENBLATT, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: Amara, I'm glad you asked. And I appreciate you having me on. I'd say a few things. Number one, Hamas should be seen as the hate group that it is. A hate group that has been promoting an ideology for years. Dehumanizing Jewish people and dehumanizing the Jewish state. As we've seen in America and around the world, when you dehumanize people, you create the conditions, you brainwash the public into thinking that acts of dehumanization are permissible. So we know that conflicts that they least have (INAUDIBLE) here in the United States and around the world.

Stop saying they made \"great gains\", \"spectacular gains\". It is a savage organization that we've seen the videos of them gleefully shooting elderly people at point blank range, kidnapping children after killing their parents.

And if I can segue just a second, Amara, because what you talked about in terms of missile strikes is Israel is saying there were 2,000 missiles launched from Hamas yesterday. Hamas said they launched 5,000 missiles. It doesn't matter. Between 2,000 and 5,000, that is a lot of missiles and in fact, it's more missiles than Hamas launched between the years 2002 and 2006 -- four years in one day.So it overwhelmed the Israeli defense systems. The Iron Domes were effective, but not as effective because of the mass attack. So again, if Mossad does not know the kinds of things that have been transferred into the Gaza from Iran on ships or some kinds of smuggling, it is going to be very difficult to counter that with conventional operations.",

But there are still high concern about the security in the countryside about infiltration from Hamas militants. We're hearing drones in the sky above us. We occasionally hear fighter jets above us as well. And I could see standing behind our cameraman here, John, the spokesperson from the Israeli Defense Forces. So I'm just going to wander up.
