Now, according to one U.S. official, this was a case of mistaken identity. The folks that attacked them didn't know who they were, presumably possibly didn't know that they were Americans. But according to that U.S. official, they were visiting that town for medical procedures. And that mirrors what we heard earlier today from Mexican president saying that the Americans were there to buy medicine.Of course, we're trying to learn more about those circumstances. But it's worth noting that the State Department has warned Americans against traveling to this state in Mexico specifically because of the criminal activity that takes place there, citing kidnappings that have taken place there on the State Department website. So, this is an area that has a history of being very violent and very dangerous for travelers. Now, what we are learning is that Mexico and the U.S. are working tremendously hard to try and figure out what exactly happened here. Where these Americans are? Because we still don't know where they are right now or what their identity is. And we heard earlier today from the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, saying officials from various U.S. law enforcement agencies are working with Mexican authorities at all levels of government to achieve the safe return of our compatriots. Obviously, we're watching that. And the FBI is also offering up to $50,000 for any information that could lead to arrests or the locations of these Americans.",

It is an area that has been overtaken as part of the drug war that has happened in Mexico over the last, you know, five to ten years or so. And so, that could presumably play into this. There could -- that could be part of the mistaken identity that they thought these Americans were related to some folks related to, you know, drug trades and the like. But we really just don't know yet. So, it's speculative to go there. And we'll wait to hear more information from the State Department, from the FBI, from the Mexican government.",

Listen to what he said here.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) I would not view that as a -- as an operational or strategic setback. I think it's more of a symbolic value than it is strategic and operational value. What I do see on a daily basis is the Russians continuing to pour in a lot of ill-trained and ill-equipped troops. And those troops are very quickly meeting their demise. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

So, it is Ukraine's decision to keep that fight going in Bakhmut. The cost incredibly high to Russia. And that's why we heard what Melissa just reported that the strategic objective of Bakhmut to deplete Russian resources is being achieved. GOLODRYGA: That we should note the cost is increasingly high for Ukrainians too in terms of manpower and ammunition as well. Oren, one more for you here because we're learning that some Ukrainian pilots have arrived in the U.S. for assessment -- for training.

What we've learned from three sources briefed on the matter is that there are two Ukrainian pilots in the U.S. being assessed on essentially, their flying abilities in flight simulators that can simulate a number of different U.S. aircraft including crucially, F-16. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has openly asked for F-16s for months now.The Department of Defense has indicated their position has not changed meaning they don't see it as a priority right now. But this certainly seems to indicate that there are considerations perhaps around that. Those two Ukrainian pilots are in simulators being evaluated, assessed on their abilities to fly aircraft. Crucially, this isn't flight training. They're not in actual aircraft doing any sort of operations or training. But if this goes well, the sources familiar with the matter of, say, there may be more Ukrainian pilots who come in for the same sort of assessment or evaluation to find out their own flying skills and what it would take for them to learn perhaps Western fighter jets, Bianna and Victor.",

If you think about this from the fall forward, it's been a pretty unending series of victories or at least stalemates for the Ukrainians.The fear that everyone that I talked to has is that at this point, even if the Russians don't have a good strategy and even if they too are running out of ammunition, they can just keep pouring resources and people at these battles in a way that the Ukrainians, they worry about may not. And that just the mass of the Russian force may turn the tide. And they -- the American fears, they don't want the narrative to change that Russia is beginning to take back the land.

No to the Patriot missile systems. OK, you can have the patriot.

Almost everything he's asked for ultimately has been delivered after the U.S. has said no, then maybe, then, OK, we're doing it. Their concern about the F-16s is twofold. The first is that don't need them right now. But this administration has not done a great job of anticipating what the Ukrainians might need six months or a year into the future.I think the second big concern is the F-16s when Putin looks at them, he'll say that's something that can reach anywhere in Moscow, any place around Russia, and that the escalation risk here is particularly high, including the possibility of nuclear escalation risk.

And I think the president realizes that. And he's an underdog. There are a lot of people who were saying that you know, this may not be his turn, or maybe it's Ron DeSantis's turn. And we've seen what happened when Donald Trump got counted out before. He beat everybody. He beat all the front runners. He beat everybody. And I think Donald Trump is gearing for fight. The other thing on the -- on the flip side with Ron DeSantis, I personally think he's more Scott Walker and Icarus than anything else. But he hasn't been -- he hasn't had to take a Trump punch preferably yet. And I think when you get in the ring with Donald Trump, it is a totally different animal. And Donald Trump is going to prove his prowess again. I think you'll have a rematch of Biden-Trump because Trump only needs a third of the Republican primary voters to win.

And McCarty's right, the rules do favor a plurality-type candidate with our winner take all system, but a third won't get it done.And I think DeSantis is far different than anybody who ran in 2016. His favorables are higher. And I think his ability to grow is higher. I think Trump is sitting at about what he's going to get. He dominates the non-college-educated crowd. It's hard to imagine him recovering the college-educated voters. DeSantis dominates the college-educated Republicans and I can easily see how he would grow into Trump's share of the non-college. So, I think DeSantis has a little bit higher of a ceiling than Bakari may give him credit for. The question is, are these other people going to continue on in the race? I think DeSantis and Trump are occupying almost all the room in the race right now. And these other folks who are interesting, and they're going to be around for a while, but I'll be shocked if most of them actually make it to when we start casting ballots. And at that point, if DeSantis is in and it comes down to a one-on-one fight, I think he has an excellent chance. I wouldn't count out Donald Trump. I mean, look, he's the establishment. He's run for president three times, serve one term, has all the money, has a cadre of political operatives who are fully dependent upon him for their livelihoods.
