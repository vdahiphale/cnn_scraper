      "sentences": "Good evening. Tonight on 360 --There is breaking news. New subpoenas go out as the first two defendants surrender in Atlanta and the former president prepares to upstage the Republican debate and turn himself in Thursday. Also tonight, what a new filing in the Mar-a-Lago documents case reveals about key witnesses -- a key witness apparently changing testimony. Later what could have been a cable car catastrophe. One of the cables snapped in the car full of kids was dangling hundreds of feet above ground for hours. The remarkable rescue caught on tape. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin in Georgia with breaking news and this week's surrender of 19 defendants. Late today, we learned that Rudy Giuliani, the man who once served as US attorney for the prestigious Southern District of New York has not been able to find a lawyer to represent him in Georgia.   So far two people have turned themselves in, John Eastman, an attorney who allegedly devised the fake electric scheme, and Scott Hall charged in connection with the voting machine breach by Trump's supporters in January 2021. The woman who let people in to breach those machines, Kathy Latham seen here on surveillance video, opening the door for them, she reached a bond agreement today. Eleven other defendants have now done the same. Two others took action today trying to derail the entire process. Former chief-of-staff, Mark Meadows asking a federal judge to put his surrender on hold, while deciding whether to move his trial to federal court, and former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, seeking the same, making a pretty remarkable argument in his filing. Clark, who the former president newly appointed acting attorney general asked for a stay of his surrender by 5:00 PM today, that way, and I'm quoting now from the filing which is full of grammatical mistakes: \"Mr. Clark would not need to be put the choice of making rush travel arrangements to fly into Atlanta or instead risking being labeled a fugitive.\" No word yet on that from the judge. Or if the judge could understand that grammar. Just as a point of fact, Clark was given the same two- week deadline to surrender as every other defendant, and as any traveler knows, no matter where you're going, you still have to kind of go through Atlanta. CNN's Katelyn Polantz starts us off right there. More than half of the defendants, Katelyn, have now reached bond terms. What else do you know about where this whole process stands tonight?",

      "sentences": "Well, the process is in the middle of where it will need to be by the end of the week, that's because at the end of this week, at noon, that is the deadline for all of the 19 defendants to go through the process of being arrested after this indictment last week.So Anderson, more than half have done what was largely expected and what Donald Trump himself did in this case. They had their lawyers come in and talk to the prosecutors to negotiate some terms. This is not a violent crime case. This is a white collar case. And so, it is the type of case where criminal defendants typically would be bonded out, meaning they would, they would have some sort of monetary value to assure that they would make -- they would come back to court for a trial, but they wouldn't be held in jail for a long time. They instead would post those bonds and then go to the jail to be arrested, to be processed here, and then released as quickly as they could get through the system. We did see some of that beginning to happen today. Donald Trump has not gone through the full process of this yet. He does have a $200,000.00 bond set, a little bit different, a little bit more strict than the bond terms he's had in the other criminal cases that he has now been charged with. But here in Georgia, he does have that negotiation and there are other leaders around him, both lawyers who had worked for him, people in the campaign. They also have six figure bond terms, and some are very likely to be coming into the jail just like John Eastman did earlier this morning to go through the arrest process.",

He is not able to intimidate witnesses or discuss the facts of thiscase with others who might be involved in this case, either as defendants or witnesses. And so watching what Donald Trump is saying and also what he's doing if those two things diverge, that's very important to watch in the coming days. We are going to be looking forward to see exactly when the former president will be coming into the state of Georgia to face these charges. But right now, we know Thursday, is it.

Stan Woodward is someone who represents, it's not just people in this case, he's representing people and other investigations surrounding Donald Trump as well. He is someone who is very close and very involved. I don't see him leaving all of this. We'll see if the judge rules that it is a conflict for him to represent Walt Nauta as well, because essentially what prosecutors are saying is that, if Yuscil Taveras, this employee who used to be represented by Stan Woodward gets on the stand, then Stan Woodward would be questioning him under cross examination.

So it's possible though, if this happens, by the way, this could be a tactical play, because it would help Donald Trump to see De Oliveira tried first, because then the government is going to have to put all their witnesses on.

What they were doing was not carrying out federal policies. They were carrying out Trump's campaign policies. They were not dealing with the president's official duties, which might have to do with the integrity of elections. The president has no official duties with respect to the Electoral College. That's completely a state function. So the question is how strict the judge will be about applying the federal removal statute. And then Meadows and the others are also trying to say we were federal officials, federal policy should trump -- not a good verb -- state policies that they should have immunity from state prosecutions, and the cases have gone in both directions.

And I say that to mean, he has answered -- he has responded to asubpoena. He's very clearly at least claiming he has not flipped there. But Fulton County was always kind of this X factor, because Fani Willis didn't give him some kind of an angle where he could basically quietly cooperate and not get wrapped up in the indictment. I think it was so clear cut, his actions there. So, I'm not sure how this was going to work out. I would also just note to the judge's point. There's this specific line in the Georgia indictment where it talks about Meadows actually offering money to speed up a recount that was going to come from the Trump campaign.

You can cite him for contempt. You could wind up -- there could be sanctions for that.You could wind up revoking bail. There is a whole continuum. But you know, given the collision here between a campaign on the one hand, and these requirements on the other, I would imagine that a judge is going to go through that continuum and not, you know, throw him in prison -- throw him in jail rather immediately after he crosses the line.

There's no market, really, for an alternative to Donald Trump. So the argument that was used against Trump in a lot of these cases, like after the '22 elections is he's not winning. There's no substantive argument against him. No one is saying in the Republican Party that someone who tried to overthrow the government of the United States maybe shouldn't be president.
