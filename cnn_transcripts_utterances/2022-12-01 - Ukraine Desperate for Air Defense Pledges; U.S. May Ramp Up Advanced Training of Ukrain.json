Spanish officials say a Ukrainian employee was slightly injured. The letter was addressed to Ukraine's ambassador to Spain. A separate letter bomb was also delivered to a company that reportedly made some of the weapons Spain has sent to Ukraine. That device was safely deactivated. Spanish officials say the second envelope apparently came from Ukraine and investigators believe that may be the case with the first one as well. She says both letters have the same return address.

This, if approved, would be far greater than the training that's currently going on in terms of scope, scale, and the complexity of what the U.S. is trying to accomplish.Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. training of Ukraine forces has been in small groups and focused on individual systems. So, for example, 60 U.S. so troops will be trained on how to use the HIMARS rocket launcher or the NASAM air defense system. This, again, if approved, would see the dramatically expand, the hundreds or low thousands of soldiers at a time, and not just on an individual system but on how to fight as a cohesive unit. So, for example, how to make artillery work with infantry, work with tanks, and fight cohesively to achieve an advantage on the battlefield. And that is one of the big goals here. If approved, this training would take place at Grafenwoehr where the U.S. conducts its own combined arms training of U.S. army forces in both Europe and Africa. This is according to multiple officials who have been briefed and are familiar to plans here. Now, an administration official says the White House is looking at how to ramp up the current training efforts and turn that into this larger scale effort. Now, it's not the only country that is looking at doing this sort of training. The U.K. has since summer made its goal to train 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers. But there is a fundamental difference here. That's more basic training for soldiers who don't have much experience on the front lines. This goes well beyond that, trying to teach an army or large parts of an army at the battalion level how to fight as a cohesive unit to gain an advantage against Russia. What about the timing? Well, this may be the perfect time for that. As winter sets in with a slowdown in fighting there, this potentially is an opportunity for Ukraine to pull some soldiers off of the frontline, out of combat, and to send them out of country to gain this training so they can go back in and achieve the success they're looking for off of those counteroffensives that we've seen taking place in eastern and southern Ukraine.

He earlier survived the poisoning, which he also blamed on the Kremlin. Meanwhile, an American citizen also behind bars in Russia has been unable to contact his family for a week. That is according to the brother of Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for alleged espionage. The family was told Paul was moved to a prison hospital on November 18th.

We understand that in 2023, it might be more difficult for the U.S. Congress to boost (ph) the kind of aid that was decided in 2022, but the Europeans will not probably be able to compensate entirely for potential decrease in U.S. aid.

And not one woman, not two, but three. I think it's, great I think is also very smart move, because to grow the game you want more woman to play it around the world.It's a real message that women can have various roles in soccer, not just as players, of course. The women's World Cup is a perfect example of the success of women's soccer, women's football around the world. But also, you could, you know, you can coach, you can referee, you can have a long career in the sport. And that's just a really smart move business-wise, to grow your game, and continue to encourage not only men but women, boys, and girls to be able to play the sport. I remember, a generation or so ago, when Sepp Blatter, then the president of FIFA said that the future of football is feminine. And it's taken a long, time and there's a lot of misogyny, a lot of sexism to cut through, for sure. But a day like this with this refereeing team, I think, Rosemary, it does show us that change is possible, and that there are opportunities for women now that we would have never thought possible even say 10 or so years ago.",
