Tymofiy (ph) was four months old. Mark would have been three Sunday had he lived to see that moment. And were now hearing of a 10-year-old also killed during these attacks. Now, all of this, the backdrop to an urgent situation here on the eastern frontlines. We've been seeing ourselves the intensity of the fighting around some of these frontline towns. Remember, this all started with a Ukrainian decision to pull out of Avdiivka weekends ago. That said, it was planned, but it appears that their departure and the defensive lines were less well planned from what we're hearing. Too early to tell right now, but things are absolutely not what Ukraine hoped they would be on the battlefield. They're certainly not what they hoped there would be in terms of supply and assistance from the West. And it begins to feel as though Russia has the capacity to move forwards. Videos of their assault show them exceptionally callous about the use of their troops, very blunt and clumsy in their tactics but still relentless and apparently moving forward even though it's meter by meter. So a troubling time we're seeing here certainly. And I think a feeling amongst the Ukrainian frontlines that things are really not good. And it's not quite clear how long they can keep the status quo as it is. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, let's get more now on where the war stands today with CNN military analyst, retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling.General, what is your assessment of how Russia is making its advance after taking the strategically important city of Avdiivka and how Ukraine is able or not to stop it? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: What, Brianna, we've been talking about, the different sides since the beginning of this conflict, Let's roll down some of the things that are happening on the Russian side. Massive number of mobilized forces, but still poorly trained. Indicators are between 47,000 Russian soldiers were killed and 1,000 armored vehicles were destroyed during that a couple of months in Avdiivka. But Russia has more artillery and ammo supplies coming from North Korea, drones coming from Iran. They have transitioned from the defense to the offense, as Nick just said. They are starting to try and use some counterattacks against Ukraine, but they have decreasing numbers of air support. Ukraine has been very effective in terms of knocking down not only their fighter aircraft, but also some of their command-and-control aircraft. Switching over to the Ukrainian side, yes, they're second line of defense is not as well prepared as they're first line of defense was as they were fighting the Russians. That's typical. In an army, you don't pay as much attention to your fallback positions, but it's unfortunate. They have a shorter frontage because they are collapsing their lines, but they are also extremely low on ammunition because of the pause in the supply chain. But they still maintain effective intelligence and Special Operations activity as well as increasing their -- both their air and their naval drone capability. So, yes, the next couple of weeks, I'm interested to see what's going to happen. Ukraine is certainly being pushed back because of that breakage of almost four months in their supply chains. And it's very difficult for them to continue with their fighting as they have over the last two years.",

He's been talking to Ukrainian forces.And they're lamenting that very thing you're talking about, which is the lack of ammo, the weapons they do not have that they need, and the fact that Russia does have them. So as they need that, and there's this debate going on in Congress here in the U.S., how long, ultimately, if that is supplied, would it even take to get to them? And what is that going to do to the fight?",

      "sentences": "That's really interesting what you said about the break in supply and how it's just not easily recoverable.And for so long in this war, we've been marveling at the resolve of the Ukrainian soldiers as they are fighting for their homeland. When they're facing those tough circumstances, what does that do to morale which is already taking a hit because of what they're enduring here?",

      "sentences": "Yes, what two things on the morale point, Brianna, and that's important that you mentioned it.Russia has been replacing their frontline troops with what I've said are ill-trained, but a hugely mobilized effort. So they have fresh troops coming into the frontline. Ukraine is debating on how they're going to mobilize more soldiers because their soldiers who have been fighting on the frontlines have been there for months. They're tired, they're hungry. They've been battle fatigued. So you combine that with the fact that there are hearing about the lack of support from their key supporter, the United States, and that -- I've got to tell you, from a frontline soldier's perspective, that will only further diminish the morale. And we've counted on morale of Ukraine since the very beginning of this -- this war, their will to fight and the will of the people to support them. But when they are experiencing these kinds of things on the frontline and also seeing in their reports what they're not getting and how they desperately need ammunition and arms, and it's not coming for a long time, it certainly deteriorates their morale. So we are certainly at fault for some of this, and it's really, really unfortunate because Ukrainian forces have put up a tremendous fight since the beginning of this conflict.",

It uses progestin only to prevent pregnancy. And when it's used as instructed, so when it's taken around the same time every day, it's up to 98 percent effective.
