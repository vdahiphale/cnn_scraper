The same with Georgia, there is a lot -- there's more Republicans than Republicans usually have an early voting. In 2020, Donald Trump told voters don't vote early, you should go on election day. So, I don't know if we are reverting to pre-COVID patterns or if every Democrat is voting Democratic and every Republican is -- I have no idea where this race is -- this was obviously a big night for Kamala Harris. I should note that I am an avowed Bruce Springsteen fan. I've been very public about that. So, take that what you will, but she is trying to energize voters to go out. Barack Obama remains the most popular Democratic politician out there. So, I understand why she's doing this? Will it be enough? It may not be. It comes down to the candidates themselves.

I mean, as you noticed when she came out on the stage with you last night, she focused at least nine minutes talking about this and really attacking Trump. Now you have to also take into consideration Trump was not there. And so, I think she was also trying to prop him up to be in place because he decided not to show up. And that's the way in which she attacked him. But Jamal would know more about the internal polling. It has to be happening.

I think people actually had a pretty good sense of who he was and he said many of the same things then. The language is darker now.

She's got problems in Michigan. They have Arab-American leaders calling around saying don't vote for Trump or for Harris right now in Michigan.
