There you see the closing bell and the gavel. The markets and the main events that we are following for you today. \"Just do it\" -- those are the words Michael Cohen said Donald Trump directed him personally to pay off Stormy Daniels. Vladimir Putin appoints an economist to replace his longstanding defense minister. And GameStop shares were back to memes. Memes and all, up 70 percent. It is a flashback some years to the stock mania. Live from New York. Good day to you. Back in New York. Monday, May the 13th. I'm Richard Quest, back from my travels and I mean business. And a very good day to you, it is good to be back. The long running feud between Donald Trump and his former lawyer is now playing out in a New York courtroom. Michael Cohen has been on the stand for several hours. The star witness in the prosecution's criminal hush money case, his testimony is crucial to this case, if the prosecution is to claim victory. Cohen has testified that Donald Trump told him to take care of it when Stormy Daniels was shopping her story of an alleged affair with Donald Trump. Cohen paid her $130,000.00 and said it was done in a way to keep Trump's name out of it and Cohen says the deal was made to protect Trump's campaign, not his family. Jessica Schneider is in Washington. So much of what we know we've already heard from Cohen in different shapes, forms, and guises, but that doesn't in any way, lessen the significance of this man on the stand today.",

      "sentences": "And Richard, I would say today was very significant because with today's testimony, Michael Cohenhas gotten to the heart of it and he has testified repeatedly, especially this afternoon, that Donald Trump knew about the hush money scheme, that Trump directed the payoff, and that Trump was closely involved in that scheme to repay Michael Cohen and then label it as legal expenses as opposed to what it really was, a reimbursement for the hush money deal, and that is at the core of the prosecution's case. The question is, none of us were in the courtroom, except our reporters there, were not sure how the jury is reacting. You know, will this testimony be enough for the jury to convict Donald Trump on these 34 counts of falsifications of business records because we are hearing this is the key testimony from Michael Cohen. Other witnesses have sort of backed him up, but will Michael Cohen be believable enough for this jury? You know, Michael Cohen today, he was just one of several witnesses over the past few days who had testified that Trump was paying off Stormy Daniels solely because of the presidential campaign, and that is another assertion that is also at the heart of these charges that prosecutors have brought. The prosecutors have said that the deal was to influence the election. So Michael Cohen, we have a full screen for you, at some point today during his testimony, he put it this way. He said he, Donald Trump wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign. So again, going to the fact that this was to help the campaign out by paying this money to Stormy Daniels, and Richard, I'll tell you, this afternoon, I counted at least six times where Michael Cohen said that Donald Trump was told about the hush money deal. You know, Trump said to Cohen, don't worry, you'll get your money back, and Cohen kept Trump posted through every minute of this back-and-forth with Stormy Daniels' lawyer until the $130,000.00 was paid. So again, we are finally seeing that testimony about this link between the payment and Donald Trump. I think the question is, Richard, is it enough? Will the jury thoroughly believe this especially after we see Michael Cohen in cross-examination where the defense team is expected to completely take him down and majorly question his credibility. So the facts are out there now with Michael Cohen. We've got into evidence. It'll be interesting to see what happens next.",

It has all been for this moment, right? Because listen, Richard, this is not the first time a prosecutor has put on a less than, let's say a likable witness whose credibility might be in doubt, right? The major violent criminal cases have built around rats, so to speak who do terrible, awful things, right?

They are traveling to China and they are asking Chinese banks to think twice when they help Russian defense industry to buy those components through third, fourth, fifth countries, because eventually there is a financial part of this shadow economy and the West has successfully played the secondary sanction tool. If the big Chinese banks help Russia to circumvent sanctions, they may lose access to dollar transactions and then the question is, what to do with small Chinese banks or small Turkish banks? And the American officials are saying, well, if there are banks, which are helping Russia, the big Chinese banks should be worried not to touch those small banks. So it will take a lot of effort to actually enforce those sanctions, but it is not hopeless. It just needs to be monitored and enforced and we see that since December, when President Biden signed executive order on circumvention of sanctions, we've seen the Chinese banks, Turkish banks, Emirati banks started to reject financial transactions with Russian counterparts or started to ask to guarantee that those transactions are not linked to Russian defense industry.

But the fact that they are now returning with ground forces to the Jabalia Refugee Camp in Northern Gaza, which was the site of some of the most intense fighting of the early months of the war, it does raise some questions about the Israeli military and the Israeli government's broader military strategy in Gaza, because essentially, what happened is they withdrew from this area months ago. And now, it appears that the Israeli military felt compelled to go back in because Hamas fighters, Hamas militants had returned to those very same areas. And we know that the United States, among others, has been pressing the Israeli government for a long-term strategy in Gaza for a day after the war in Gaza. And so far what has happened is the Israeli military has simply gone in, fought, dropped bombs and then withdrawn from certain areas leaving a total power vacuum, which now appears to be being filled once again by Hamas.",

However, the price was already rising, which had last week. So, I think he's -- when things get serious perhaps he's also just him watching this once again.
