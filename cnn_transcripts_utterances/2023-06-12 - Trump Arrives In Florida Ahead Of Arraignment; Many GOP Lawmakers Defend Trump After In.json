His legal team, though, I should emphasize is not finalized because he is still searching for lawyers to represent him in Florida even though, of course, he has his arraignment tomorrow.Right now, law enforcement officials are ramping up security around the federal courthouse in Miami ahead of that and they are preparing for the possibility of large protests by Trump supporters. CNN's Evan Perez is outside that federal court in Miami and our own Carlos Suarez is near Trump's club in Doral, Florida, where as I mentioned, he'll be spending the night. Evan, let me start with you first, though, because I know you've got new reporting on how the Special Counsel got everyone in this position, right, where the former president is coming down to Florida to face those challenges in Miami, instead of Washington, D.C.",

And the issue here is the venue. The fact is Mar-A-Lago is located in this traditional district in the Southern District of Florida. And that's where the alleged crimes took place. And so that's one reason why prosecutors confronted that issue. It's something that the Trump team had raised that if the case were brought in Washington, that that would be something that they might be able to challenge. And so certainly for prosecutors, they're facing now a couple of challenges as a result. This is a jurisdiction that is probably going to be a little bit friendlier of a jury pool for the former president, certainly friendlier than one in Washington, D.C. where a lot of the - or most of the testimony was taken by the grand jury there. The second thing is one of the big pieces of evidence, which is those notes from Evan Corcoran, the Trump attorney. He provided testimony to the grand jury again in Washington. All of that was litigated by judges in Washington. The question is, at what point will Trump's legal team tried to challenge that here down in the Southern District of Florida, which is a totally different set of courts. And will they have any luck in trying to exclude some of that very damaging testimony from Evan Corcoran. Again, challenges that prosecutors knew going in, in the last few months they were going to be confronted by bringing the case down here in the Southern District of Florida. Erin?",

I don't know whether they will do either of those things for Donald Trump. They gave a pass on those things in Manhattan. He'll be advised of the charges. He'll enter his plea. Surely he will plead not guilty. The most important thing I'm watching, of course, is the schedule, how quickly is the judge going to move this case. Sometimes judges set trial dates at the first appearance. But usually in federal court, they don't.

It is a constant pursuit of advantage. He is fundamentally transactional in nature and he is always looking for the edge over his political rival, over his business rival, over the person he's conversing with. And so my guess - and it's a speculation - is that he saw in this material information that might be useful to him at some point in the future.

It is true there were things he liked to show off, like the Kim Jong-un letters or his - the sharpie hurricane map. But to me what was most interesting and revealing about the indictment is that he was personally going through these boxes. If you look at the indictment, they have a text exchange between Trump employee to Walt Nauta: \"I delivered some but I think he may need more. Knocked out two boxes. He's tracking the boxes.\" This shows a level of interest in what was in there. Andy McCabe just mouthed the words intent, so I will take intent.
