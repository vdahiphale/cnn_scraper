Eight patients were taken to three different hospitals. That does include, as you say, a children's hospital called Alder Hey Children's Hospital. That hospital has now itself declared a major incident, and is urging people not to bring their children there unless they absolutely need sort of immediate and urgent attention. A local business owner spoke to PA Media. They say they witnessed the scene. They said it was something like from a horror movie. They said multiple young girls had been stabbed and that mothers had arrived on the scene and were screaming. Events are still very much unfolding at this stage. We do know a man was arrested at the scene, a knife, has been seized, and that there is no broader risk to the public right now. This is, of course, being taken very seriously right through to the British Prime Minister, who spoke about this in Parliament just recently. He also tweeted to say \"Horrendous and deeply shocking news emerging from Southport. My thoughts are with all those affected. I would like to thank the police and emergency services for their swift response. I am being kept updated as the situation develops.\" And we will bring you more news as and when we get it.",

We are now less than 100 days from a critical showdown between former U.S. President Donald Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Both candidates were on the campaign trail this weekend, testing out new lines of attack against each other. Harris' fundraising war chest has also grown very quickly, raking in more than $200 million since President Biden dropped out of the race. Remember, that was essentially a week ago.

Before she was picked to lead the party's ticket, they were already looking at his accolades and trying to decipher and determine what her lines of attack were going to be against him, as also the running mate at the time. And on that front, they were going to paint her as the \"yes\" man and another MAGA man basically, putting the stamp of approval on anything that former President Donald Trump does. And a lot of that is going to spill into how they attack him now, especially in choosing who her running is going to be.They also think that they can go after him for being underqualified, so, essentially saying that he does not have enough experience to govern, and using the former President's advanced age to make that point. Essentially, J.D. Vance could be the President, if the former President couldn't fulfill another four years.

They have been trying to target low propensity voters, especially people who may not have voted in previous elections but consider themselves Trump supporters. They've been also trying to take advantage of demographic shifts that we've seen in recent years, black voters, Hispanic voters, union households. They have been trending more and more conservative, still overwhelmingly Democratic, but inching more Republican. So, the Trump campaign has sort of acknowledged for some time now that there are people who voted for him in 2016 but didn't vote for him in 2020, and never will again, and those individuals are a lost cause.

And what they're really trying to do is identify and highlight each other as we move into the last 100 days here. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Everybody knew who Joe Biden was. And so, what the Democrats are doing now is not trying to make this a much about don't vote against Donald Trump, but now you have something to vote for, which is the Vice President.

You go to inflation. You go to the economy. You talk about the cost of living. You speak about immigration. And you attach all of those things in terms of the Biden-Harris record directly to Vice President Harris, and you also make the delineation between what Republicans would argue are the failures of Vice President Harris in terms of what she was previously tasked with and her portfolio in her current role.

And I'm also looking at men, broadly speaking. In 2016, Donald Trump had an 11-point lead over Hillary Clinton with men. In 2020, President Biden closed that gap. It was nearly even. And so, those are two groups that I think could potentially make a difference in a place like Georgia, 10,000 to 11,000 votes.

The acting deputy -- acting Director of the Secret Service, the newly minted Acting Director, will appear on Capitol Hill for two Senate hearings this week, and I'm sure he will be pressed for answers.",

Zach Cohen, really appreciate it.I want to stay in presidential politics, in this case, I guess policy. President Joe Biden has plans for major reforms at the U.S. Supreme Court. He plans to propose term limits for Supreme Court justices who currently have lifetime appointments. Now, he also wants a binding code of conduct for the court and is calling for a constitutional amendment that would strip presidents of broad immunity for crimes committed while in office, which, of course, is even more relevant, given recent Supreme Court rulings. Now, Biden will unveil his proposals during an event commemorating the Civil Rights Act later today in Austin, Texas. But, for more on this, I want to bring in CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid, who joins us from Washington, D.C. All right, Paula. So, these major, major potentially policies and at least proposals for now that are expected to be announced later today, what is he proposing? Why now?",

So, that contributed to a lot of the grass and brush and trees to grow significantly. Then you have another year of dry weather and more heat. So, that really dries up all of that fuel for the fires. So, when something ignites, and in this case, when a person pushes a burning car into an embarkment, all of that brush is really easily ignited and it moves extremely fast because the temperatures were very high. It was very dry here a couple of days ago when this 42-year-old man pushed the car. So, it moves really, really fast, and that really was what caused the explosion of this fire, and it's concerning because it's very early in the fire season.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's one of the key factors in this explosive fire growth that she mentioned the firefighters have to deal with, and what is happening and what happened, I should say, with the Park Fire in its initial stages and how rapidly it grew from such a small fire to such a large expensive fire. Right now, 12 percent containment. So, as Camilla mentioned, that is some very good progress. But still, we're getting our new numbers in, over 350,000 acres that have been burned. There are other fires across California as well.But, the temperature and the wind profile is going to change, and it's all because of this catalyst right here, it's tough to see, but it is a cold front. And there is some precipitation associated with it, mainly to the north and west of Butte County, where the fire is currently located. But, there are other fires that this is going to help contain as well, mainly across portions of Oregon. You can see Spokane, Washington, expecting temperatures in the lower 80s. That's a far cry from the 90s and triple digit heat that some locations across the Northwest have experienced lately. Nonetheless, there still is fire, red flag warnings in place for places in advance of that approaching cold front. So, in advance of that, we still have the dry air, but behind it, things change still unless there is 102 active large wildfires emitting a lot of smoke into the atmosphere. So, this is degrading the quality of the air. It's kind of the combo effect here, not only the fire on the ground, but the bad quality of the air because of the smoke that billows from fires, just like the Park Fire in Butte County. Omar.",

According to some locals that I've spoken to, they even pulled entire vehicles out of the River Seine to prepare this river for the moment.But, here we are a day before the first triathlon, and competition organizers, reps of World Triathlon, they met. They canceled today's swimming practice for a second straight day after they met. The water quality test showed that the bacteria levels were just too high. Two straight days of rain pummeling Paris, overwhelming the city's sewage system, sending untreated water with E. coli there into the river. Organizers say that with higher temperatures and more sunshine that they are confident that these events will be able to go on. Now, if they do have to cancel tomorrow's triathlon, the swim portion, they're going to go run cycle run for the triathlon. So that, we will keep our eye on that and let you know here in the coming hours. Bur, we will now go to swimming. France's Leon Marchand has broken Michael Phelps' Olympic record, crushing the field in a 400-meter individual relay. The host nation's speedboat, Omar, leaving the competition in the whitewater, finishing about five, six seconds ahead of the competition. He'd already beaten Phelps' world record. The host nation's fans made that atmosphere in the arena absolutely electric. More swimming tonight, five swimming medals up for grabs today with America's Emma Weyant and Katie Grimes in the 400 IM, Luke Hobson in the 200 free, Ryan Murphy in the 100 backstroke, Lily King, 100 breast, and Claire Weinstein in the 200 free. Now, in one of the greatest rivalries in all of the sports, the 65th installment of Nadal-Djokovic in Roland Garros, it is Nadal taking the winning in the best of three sets match. Djokovic has the slight edge, 31 to 29 in this rivalry with that last win, sending him through to the third round here of these Paris Olympics. He is chasing his first ever Olympic goal. Now, so many of the Olympic dreams for these athletes starts when they're just a young kid, right, Omar. I asked Team USA fencer Lee Kiefer, what would you go back and tell your younger self?
