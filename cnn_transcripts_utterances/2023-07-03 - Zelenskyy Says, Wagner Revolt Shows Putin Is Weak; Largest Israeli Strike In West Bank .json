VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTafter certain Wagner steps. We see Putin's reaction. It's weak. Firstly, we see he doesn't control everything. Wagner's moving deep into Russia and taking certain regions shows how easy it is to do. Putin doesn't control the situation in the regions. He doesn't control the security situation. All of us understand that his whole army is in Ukraine. Almost entire army is there. That's why it's so easy for the Wagner troops to march through Russia. Who could have stopped them? We understand that Putin doesn't control the regional policy and he doesn't control all those people in the regions. So, all that vertical of power he used to have just got crumbling down.",

I thought the two important things about Prigozhin's march toward Moscow that Saturday were, one, that nobody joined Prigozhin, which I think he underestimated the support that he had, but the second thing is also no Russian generals, no units, came out to defend Putin in that march along the way.

They are trying to reach out to those evangelical voters, those social conservative voters perhaps, or they're just trying to get attention or there are younger people on the campaign who are trying to boost their guy when he's had a very difficult summer.

How do you fear that the next few hours or days could unfold? MARTIN INDYK, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Well, we've seen now hundreds of Israeli troops moving into the refugee camp, so the violence on both sides is going to escalate. The problem the Israelis have is if they want to achieve a safe haven in this refugee camp, they're going to have to stay there. And they don't have any force that they can leave in favor of the Palestinian Security Forces. The Palestinian authority are crumbling. They're not prepared to do that job. And so the Israelis have a real dilemma. They can mow the grass, as they call it, or in this case, uproot the grass, but it will grow back. And as they get more and more involved with these kinds of operations, it's more and more likely to create greater friction. And that's where the reoccupation of these cities in the north of the West Bank is likely to happen. And that will breed a third intifada, I fear.",
