The good news for Joe Biden is that the first debate in 2020 was watched by just over 70 million people. So, clearly some people aren't paying attention. That said, the split screen, seeing Donald Trump here and Joe Biden here and watching it side by side, the damage that does to Biden's perceptions, to his reputation is significant. And in the end, you can fix a misstatement, you can even fix a mistake, but you cannot fix age. It's with you, whether you like it or not. And from walking on stage, like you see him do right there compared to Donald Trump. And the times when I did not understand a word that he was saying, that's significant. Every time Biden spoke, he dropped. And here's what's interesting, last point. Many of the times that Donald Trump spoke, he dropped as well. If Trump says less, Trump actually does better.

There are only three states that matter, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. And I expect Donald Trump to go up a couple points, that's it in those states. But that's going to put Trump in the lead in every single swing state. If Trump wins none of those states, he still gets 268 electoral votes, but that's two votes short of a majority. He has to win one of those three. Based on the debate performance, I'm expecting Trump to be leading in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, but within the margin of error and still too close to call. No one is undecided.

But the other thing I want to point out here is that Trump went on to say that this wasn't about age, that this was about Biden not being a good president, not being mentally fit for office, which is different from what we heard from his advisers. They were watching very closely the reaction on social media, part of that being the fact that Donald Trump is very hesitant to talk about Biden's age in relation to anything because he is just right behind him when it comes to terms to those -- that age. And he knows that. The other thing about this that he mentioned was that he thought that Biden would stay in office, that these rumors of him leaving or leaving the race were true. That he thinks he actually pulls better than some of these other Democratic names that were being floated around. But as you mentioned, when it comes to tone, it was very clear his team is celebrating right now. They have been since last night, and they will probably do so through the next week.",

What has happened here in Donald Trump's criminal case related to the 2020 election, the January 6th riots, is that he has claimed that there should be vast protections around things he was doing and saying while he was president. It's gone the whole way to the Supreme Court and the justices have been considering, behind closed doors, exactly where they should draw the line of those protections. Should everything the president does be protected and thus, should the case against Donald Trump be dismissed from the court system? Or are there limits to the protections around that office of the U.S. president? Where they draw that line is going to be very important in this decision, and it will dictate how everyone has to respond to it moving forward. Will the case go to trial this year? And will the Special Counsel's office that's prosecuting Donald Trump within the U.S. Department of Justice, will they have a route to continue this case in a speedy way, or will there just be more and more appeals ahead?

A strong showing by the hard right or hard left could force President Emmanuel Macron to share power with a prime minister of another party, creating numerous uncertainties. And voters in Iran went to the polls on Friday to choose a successor to Ebrahim Raisi. The former president was killed last month in a helicopter crash. Four candidates are on the ballot, three of them are considered hardliners. They've all vowed to improve the economy though, which has been crippled by western sanctions, mismanagement, and corruption. A 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the coast of Southern Peru early Friday.

And, youknow, one of my theories of the case on this all along has been that Biden needs to -- the conventional wisdom was that Biden needs to prove that he's up to the job and capable of handling it in this debate. And, you know, then that'll be fine. My theory has always been, he's going to need to prove that, pretty much every day between, you know, the debate and the election. That's still true. But I think it's not irretrievable. But obviously, he's dug himself a hole. The other thing is that, interestingly, this from Larry Sabato, the election whisperer at the University of Virginia. Sabato found this week, before the debate, that something like -- people that were, you know, marginally OK with Biden's performance as president preferred Biden over Trump by 42 percent, and people that were marginally dissatisfied with Biden's performance still preferred Biden to Trump by 77 percent. That's the -- those weren't typos. What that tells you is that there's an awful lot of soft support for Biden, but that there's a hard -- that there's a ceiling and a cliff for Trump. You know, people are not -- if it was any other Republican, you'd see migrations from Biden to that Republican if, in this particular case, there's a conundrum, there's -- you know, there's nowhere for the Biden people to go, they certainly don't want to go to Trump. That, you know, in a backhanded way provides Biden an opportunity, I think.",

Well, first of all, let me say real quick and address this real quick, like I was very humbled and happy about the reaction of theorganizers who were very supportive of my stunt, actually, which was not necessarily what I had expected and that really made my day. So, I was really glad that we're on the same page about this. And so, yes, what it means for me personally, if I'm being honest, I don't fear it all that much, for me personally. Like, I think, I have developed a creative personal language that the machine simply does not speak. Like, I'm a writer and photographer. I combine these two mediums, and I think it's a very unique and personal thing. It's very candid. It's documentary. And so, it is something that A.I. cannot really replicate. That being said, of course, there are large implications for creatives out there. And we'll have to see how, on one hand, we can adapt to this as creatives, how we can maybe even leverage this technology, use it to our advantage, maybe help along our workflow, free up resources for more creative tasks and all of that. But at the same time, like, I think we need to take the conversation around A.I. to the point of action now, where we also install some guardrails that not only protect the livelihoods of creatives out there, but also help along with -- yes, like, in the fight against the spreading of misinformation, for example, which I think is a huge topic. Like, you guys covered the presidential debate last night. It's election year, not just in the U.S. And we have seen what social media and, like, the spreading of fake news on social media, how it contributed to the 2016 presidential election, how it impacted it. And so, I think A.I., as a technology, can be, in the hands of the wrong people, a weapon of mass misinformation. And so, I think we have to get ahead of its light speed development right now, or we'll have a hard time catching up with it later. And I think --",

Some of our audience members will recognize the name Boris Eldagsen, who won the Sony World Photo Awards in the creative category because he created an A.I. generated image that was obviously meant to be not A.I. generated. So, he came at it in the opposite direction as you, but also making a similar point, I think, Miles. And now, I believe you're working with him just to -- again, to your point about raising awareness of A.I. and the challenges and the risks at this moment. Can I ask what you're working on, and to your point about putting in more protections, what protections, how, and who needs to be doing this?",
