Antony Blinken and Benjamin Netanyahu have been meeting after a surge in violence that has led to some of the worst bloodshed in years in the Palestinian territories and in Israel. In an earlier meeting today with Egypt's President in Cairo Blinken appealed for calm. He condemned the terrorist attack outside of Jerusalem's synagogue that killed seven people last Friday, while also cautioning against any revenge attacks as he described them. Well, Blinken will meet Palestinian leaders in the West Bank on Tuesday. His tour of this region, the Middle East is happening amid simmering tensions and bloodshed that some observers in the area of fear will only get worse. Nic Robertson has the details.

Antony Blinken there expresses his condolences, once again for the loss of Israeli life on Friday. He said it is important that the government and the people of Israel know that the U.S. is committed to Israel. And that commitment is ironclad, he said, and he urged calm. He also spoke about Iran.

But he made sure to say that in front of the Prime Minister, and he said that their peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians is sorely lacking, making it clear that what we have seen with the cycle of violence in the last few days here is something that is highly concerning to the Biden Administration. But as that all said, the Secretary of State making very clear that the U.S.-Israeli relationship is an ironclad commitment, and that the Secretary of State plans to keep it that way, you know, mirroring some of that language that we heard from Netanyahu on Iran.

Obviously the Secretary of State is arriving at a veryfraught time in the Israeli Palestinian relationship with the violence on both sides reaching heights that haven't been known for years. And that is his major concern in terms of trying to find ways to get all sides to calm things down. There wasn't a lot of that in this press conference. But there were some interesting nuances. I think, that were important. First of all, Netanyahu basically didn't refer to the Palestinian issue. He's focused on Iran. And on, of course, Saudi Arabia, where he wants to, \"Achieve dramatic breakthroughs\". Those are I think his priorities. But they can be easily overwhelmed if things get out of control in Jerusalem and the West Bank. And that's what Secretary of State Blinken was carefully warning about. I thought it was particularly important that he referred to their cabinet discussions meeting they weren't exactly agreed on everything. And that he warned that anything that moves the way from achieving a two state solution is something that the United States will oppose a way of signaling that the far right agenda of some of Netanyahu's partners in the government will be opposed by the United States.",

Stop it from distracting them from the higher priorities that they have in dealing with Russian aggression and China's assertiveness. And essentially, that's their approach to the whole Middle East. Let's just calm everything down. Well, it's clear that all the trends are pointing in the opposite direction when it comes to the interaction between Israelis and Palestinians, as we've seen in the last few days. And so, I think, against his will, and even his better judgment, he's going to be dragged into this. And his exposure now first in Cairo yesterday, now in Jerusalem and next in Ramallah tomorrow, is I think, going to give him the ability to sense how to move forward beyond the calls for avoiding escalation and violence to some kind of gradual, incremental, modest political process that gives some hope to the people on both sides who are now mired in misery.",

And so, I think that that side of things, they're pretty well coordinated Bill Burns, the Director of the CIA, has just left Israel was there for his own visit. But I think what's important is, is what Netanyahu said in his press conference about the desire to forge a common policy between the United States and Israel. Let's remember that there was no common policy when it came to dealing with the Iran nuclear program. Netanyahu was strongly opposed to the deal that, that President Obama negotiated what's called the JCPOA to restrict Iran's nuclear program and encouraged Donald Trump to rip it up. As a result of that it's proved impossible for the prime administration to get the Iranians back into the agreement, that agreement for all intents and purposes now dead. And so there is a chance to forge a common policy, rather than the one that had them at loggerheads before, that's an opportunity for Netanyahu, but it's not going to come without a price. If he wants the United States on board, he's going to have to pay attention to American concerns and preferences.",

We've also been told that they are funerals taking place. The Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted out saying that terrorism is now the direct the biggest threat to Pakistan security. There is of course, an investigation underway; there has been an increase in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban at different military checkpoints and state institutions. Since the ceasefire between the two between the Pakistani Taliban and the Pakistani government and army fellows spot in November of last year, there are concerns that these attacks will continue. Islamabad, for example, has been on high alert. For the past couple of weeks, there was an attempted suicide attack in the city of Islamabad in the last week of December, so there is an investigation underway. The politicians of this country are repeating the same messages of condolence that they have repeated over the many, many years when similar attacks have taken place in Pakistan. There are accusations flying that this is because the Pakistani Taliban is situated in Afghanistan where they're finding safe havens, but we're still waiting to see how this unfolds and whether things will get worse here in Pakistan.

As seen in the police body camera video, Nichols was actually pulled out of the car and thrown to the ground tased and beaten.

Well, authorities also report more casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, including this attack in Kharkiv. Well, at least one person reportedly killed after a missile turned parts of this residential building into a pile of rubble.

One American volunteer says description that has now become the kind of synonymous almost with Bakhmut as a meat grinder really doesn't do the level of violence there justice. The levels of violence are very extreme. They're also very peculiar in to this piece of the frontline, Becky, because the Wagner mercenary group, which has been dominant there in terms of the Russian effort, has been sending very large numbers of soldiers against Ukrainian forces without the support of heavy Armor. No tanks, no armored personnel carriers really getting heavily involved there very often, but these huge human waves were trying to overwhelm the Ukrainians with force of numbers. And it has been partly successful. It has been combined, though with these artillery barrages, that the commander that you referenced there in your introduction, Becky is talking about there being no buildings will be left in Bakhmut at all. There are still several thousand amazingly several thousand civilians still living in Bakhmut, but they're saying that's impossible to get them out. Anybody who wants to be evacuated has been evacuated. And all of the civilians now have to live underground as the city gets steadily more and more bombarded. Now there's also quite a lot of fighting in Bulevar, which is to the south that is a town that they believe the Ukrainians believes is part of a Russian effort to encircle Bakhmut. And it may well come a point in the not too distant future when the Ukrainians elect to withdraw from that city, not least because as far as they're concerned, it doesn't really represent a great deal of strategic importance. They don't really understand quite why the Russians are focusing so much of their energies there apart from perhaps the very important symbolic nature of trying to get some kind of a victory in the Ukrainian war after a number of losses that they've suffered as the Ukrainians launch counter offensives around Kharkiv and then more recently, when they recaptured large amount of Kherson province and indeed the provincial capital, Becky.",
