A group of Russian warships, including the Gorshkov and the nuclear-powered submarine the Kazan, have been deployed to Cuba. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: These are Russia's most modern naval weapons systems that they're deploying very close to the U.S. coast. TODD (voice-over): A U.S. official tells CNN there are no nuclear weapons aboard, but Russia's military says the flagship of Russia's Northern Fleet is usually equipped with hypersonic Zircon missiles.",

Mr. Orban is saying that his country would not block NATO decisions on giving support to Ukraine. In return, he says Stoltenberg promised that Hungary would not have to provide funding for assistance to Kyiv. Meanwhile, Ukraine expected to get about $50 billion in a new loan from its G7 allies. Their leaders are meeting in Italy this morning, and the announcement could come within hours. Clare Sebastian joins me now with more. Just explain where this money's coming from.",

There is a sense, I think, that they're trying to future-proof Ukraine aid, certainly if we see a change of the guard in the U.S., we see with the sanctions that have come in with this loan backed by Russian assets, and the discussions around a long-term pledge by NATO that could be rubber-stamped at that meeting in July.

Just after an investigation found that Chinese state subsidies for EV makers keep their prices unnaturally low and hurt European carmakers. The EU tariff spike drew a sharp rebuke from China, which sees Europe as a vital and growing market for its auto industry. Let's bring in CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Steven Jiang. We saw a similar thing with the U.S., didn't we? So these are, you know, it's basically a lot of the West is no longer going to be the market it was for China.",

But Max, the difference is when President Biden announced the U.S. tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese EVs, you realize the Chinese EVs have almost no presence in the U.S. market, but they have a 20 percent market share in the EU. That's why this decision by Brussels may actually have some real impact.Now, the European economies and many of the country's auto industry is actually a lot more entwined with the Chinese EV sector compared to their U.S. counterparts. Germany, for example, their auto suppliers, their carmakers have a huge presence here, not only just selling cars and parts, but also making EVs here cheaply and efficiently before selling them back to their home markets. So that's why people think there are a lot more real concerns and fears from Europe about potential Chinese retaliations. Of course, that's something they have been promising for weeks and months and reiterated again after the EU decision was made yesterday. Now, we have heard German Chancellor Schultz and the likes of Volkswagen already coming out publicly to oppose these new tariffs. That obviously plays well into the Chinese playbook of divide and conquer in dealing with the EU. But the bigger question here is whether or not these tariffs would even be effective. The biggest Chinese EV maker, BYD, for example, facing a new tariff, potentially 17 percent. But a lot of experts say it has to be something around 50 percent to actually affect BYD's ability to maintain a comfortable profit margin in the EU. So that's why now allies are on Beijing to see what they would do after months of threats. They may want to, they may have to do something if this decision becomes final, but they may want to exercise some restraints given how complex and nuanced the picture is in the EU -- Max.",
