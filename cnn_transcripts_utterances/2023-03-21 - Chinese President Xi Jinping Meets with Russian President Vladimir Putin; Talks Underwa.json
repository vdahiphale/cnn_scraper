This just into CNN, a senior Ukrainian official says discussions are underway to organize a call between Xi and CNN President Zelenskyy. That would be the first conversation between those two leaders. And in a competing display of support, we are also seeing the Japanese prime minister on the ground in Kyiv right now as this meeting in Russia is going on.We have live team coverage with correspondents in Russia, Ukraine, and Taiwan. We want to start this morning with CNN's senior international correspondent Matthew Chance in Moscow. Matthew, you have this new reporting about a potential call between the leader of China and President Zelenskyy. This is something the White House had been wanting to make happen. What else are you learning about when this call could happen?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's going to be pretty soon, according to the sources I have spoken to inside Ukraine. But nothing concrete, I have been told, by a senior official, has yet been scheduled. And so look, it's still very much in the it could possibly happen stage. If it does happen, as you mentioned, it would be the first time that President Zelenskyy of Ukraine has spoken with Xi Jinping.And that contrasts starkly with the amount of contact there has been between the Chinese and Russian presidents. It's been more than 40 occasions that they have had face-to-face meetings. The latest one of those occasions is scheduled to take place anytime now within the next few minutes they are expected to meet inside the Kremlin for formal negotiations how to bring these two increasingly autocratic countries even closer together. Remember, Russia is an important resource for China's economy. It's got massive reserves of oil and gas and a forestry of minerals and things like that that it is supplying increasingly to China. And for Russia, China is an economic lifeline at a time when international sanctions have cut off supply routes to the westerly directions. So they are in this sort of increasingly close alliance between these two countries. Military aid is something the Russians desperately need from China, ammunition for the battlefield to push the front lines forward from their point of view. That's something China has held back from so far, but behind closed doors, there is suspicion that that could still be discussed. But front and center of the diplomatic meeting on this occasion is this Chinese proposal for a peace plan to end what they call the crisis in Ukraine. It calls for talks between Ukraine and Russia, but it does stop short of demanding that Russia pull out of the territories that it's already conquered. And that's why there is so much skepticism in Ukraine and the west.",

That Japan is condemning Russia's invasion a little bit more than a year ago and its declared annexation of territories that it has occupied here.And I think what we're seeing here is that while the Chinese leader is declaring his friendship with the Russian president and also talking about peace, that Ukraine's western allies, which include countries like Japan, are saying we are all in with Ukraine. You want to support Russia? We are going to keep running weapons and finances to Ukraine in this existential war against Russia.",

Meanwhile, President Xi on the phone with President Zelenskyy will have to convince him that China's 12-point peace plan is somehow a good deal for Ukraine even though it involves, it ends western sanctions, negotiations that would see Ukraine giving up territory that Russia stole, and even a NATO pullback from eastern borders along with reconstruction efforts that probably would benefit the Chinese themselves, Chinese contractors.And so that's going to be a hard sell. But as Ivan mentioned and others have mentioned, Ukraine does need China on its side because there are huge trading partner. So it really does put Ukraine in a pretty difficult position. They get a lot of support from democracies, certainly they have support from here in Taiwan where the foreign minister just today tweeted out that this is really hypocrisy that Putin and Xi claim to talk about peace when Putin is doing what he is doing in Ukraine and Xi has his ambitions for Taiwan. COLLINS:  Remarkable scene setting there, also that split screen. Will, Ivan, we want you to stay with us, stay close, because we are going to wait for this meeting to start. We're going to be tracking that live. Also here this morning, as Don was noting, police are on high alert not just in New York City, also in Washington after former President Trump called on his supporters to protest and, quote, take our nation back. Trump claimed he would be indicted and arrested today in the investigation of the hush-money payments to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. No indication yet that is actually happening today, but it does come as the New York Police Department has told all of its officers to be in uniform and ready to deploy starting today. That's according to an internal memo that was obtained by CNN. Manhattan's district attorney hasn't actually said if and when criminal charges are coming, but a source close to the Trump legal team says they doesn't expect it to actually happen or an initial appearance before next week. So joining us now is CNN legal analyst and former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, who knows this well, Elie Honig. He's also the author of the book, \"Untouchable, How Powerful People Get Away with It,\" which is out now and highly relevant, obviously, to everything we are talking about. (LAUGHTER)",

Here the paper trail can show us exactly how this payment was made, exactly how Michael Cohen was reimbursed, and exactly how they booked it. But I would be shocked if the paperwork showed is a direct link to Donald Trump. If there is an email, text, or memo where Donald Trump says, yes, guys, do it this way, or I'd like you to do it this way, that's a smoking gun. But short of that, the paperwork is an important part of the story, but just saying it's a paper case, there's a paper trail, doesn't necessarily get you to the core issue of the defendant or the potential defendant's criminal liability.",

There's a high degree of ceremony around this, it is such a symbolic moment for Russia. Because this comes, you know, it's the first time Xi Jinping has been here since then -- since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. It's just a few days since Vladimir Putin was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes.And so, this is very symbolic show of support for China -- from China, for Russia. Russia is an important resource for China. It gets its oil and gas from here increasingly and, you know, has a growing trade relationship with Russia. It's an important lifeline from Moscow's point of view, particularly because the sanctions trying to strangle the Russian economy from elsewhere in the world. And so, these two people have been countries have been thrust together in this increasingly deepening alliance. Behind closed doors, is expected to be discussions about further economic development between the two countries bringing them closer together with more economic ties. But also, possibly the provision of Chinese military aid to Russia, it needs weapons, it needs ammunition on the battlefield to Ukraine, where it's been running short. China has stopped short of providing that so far, but, you know, that could change something people are very closely watching. But also, this issue of the Chinese peace plan for Ukraine, which has been discussed already during a four-hour meeting yesterday between the two leaders here in Moscow. We've learned from a senior Ukrainian official this morning, that discussions are now underway between the Chinese and Ukrainian governments for a phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders to discuss that peace proposal. It's nothing's concrete yet we're told but if it goes ahead, it would be the first time that Chinese and Ukrainian presidents have had a conversation that contrasts starkly with the relationship between the two leaders. We can see on our screens right now, they've met each other face to face more than 40 times. It is one of the closest international relationships, if not the closest that Russia actually has right now. And so, again, very symbolic that Russia from his point of view here with Xi Jinping, at the side of its president, showing the world that it's not isolated, at least it has China on its side.",

Something John Kirby at the White House is encouraged, as well. But it's interesting to watch, this is more than just it's about support optically. Obviously, Vladimir Putin wants to see support on an international level for himself. He's not getting that obviously from NATO and Western nations, but also, they need the money, they need the resources as well that China could possibly provide. Matthew Chance, thank you so much.",
