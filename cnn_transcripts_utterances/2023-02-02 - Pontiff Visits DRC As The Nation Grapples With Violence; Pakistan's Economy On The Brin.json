Trade Unions say the public sector is in a crisis. And this has only been exacerbated by record high inflation and a deepening cost of living crisis.

And the Fed is changing its tune on inflation a bit. The Fed statement acknowledged that inflation has eased and during the press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he declared that the disinflationary process has begun. He also sort of shrugged off the January boom in financial markets, even though soaring stock prices actually makes the job of the Fed to get inflation down that much harder. Now, markets seem to like the power that sets the say with stocks rallying during the press conference. But no, I would note that Powell did not mince words when it comes to inflation.

We have seen the devastation of civil war in Congo, we've seen a similar strife in South Sudan. He spent some time, for example, listening to the harrowing stories of the victims of violence, and bloodshed, and rape, and murder, in whole parts of Congo, especially in the eastern regions.So, I think he's trying to push for peace in the country, unity in the country, and what has, I think, about 250 dialects, different languages. But above all, I think he's very concerned about the interference in the development of Congo and its ultimate prosperity or lack of it, as a result of direct interference by certainly Western economic interests, and those who seek to make trouble in the country from surrounding countries, as well as those who would seek religious strife in the country as well.

In terms of the results, we can see in different places such as the Central African Republic and elsewhere in Africa, some success in shining that light, but also really bringing a memory for the people there to have hope that, yes, it is possible to have reconciliation, it is possible to have peace, starting with what Pope Francis calls within those countries, the importance of forgiveness, and that peace and reconciliation that certainly the people of the Congo desperately want.",

A delegation from the International Monetary Fund is in Pakistan right now as sore inflation and the impact of climate change have left the country's economy in freefall. CNN's Sophia Saifi joins us now live from Islamabad. So, Sophia, how desperate is the economic situation in Pakistan? And what will the IMF likely do in terms of a bailout for the country?[02:40:19] SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER: Rosemary, it's an extreme situation right now, the Pakistan's economy is struggling. The cost of living crisis is dramatically impacting the lives of ordinary people in this country. I went out and spoke to a few of them, people who are tradesmen, greengrocers, customers. Let's have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IMRAN ULLAH YOUSAFZAI, BAKER (through translator): You look at everything, flour, gas cylinders, electricity, the rates of everything have shot up. Because of that, our earnings have come down, it's become very difficult to keep surviving like this. SYED JAMSHED BUKHARI, DRIVER (through translator): Since onions became expensive, I've stopped buying them. I've left them. But this is not just stopping at onions, anything we buy to eat. If we bought one kilo, we buy a quarter of that now. This is the story of every home, not just mine. It's so hard to survive right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's only about $3.75 billion left in Pakistan's Foreign Exchange Reserves, that's just enough for about three weeks of imports. Pakistan's talks with the IMF have been stalled since last November, they're finally here. We've had three finance ministers in the past year alone with different economic policies. They finally agreed. Ishaq Dar is the current finance minister, has made changes to his -- to his policies to appease the IMF. And hopefully, those funds will soon come in.There's a bit of optimism here that the IMF talks which end towards the beginning of next week will be positive. But keeping that in mind, we're also being told by economic -- economists and by analysts that going to the IMF again and again for Pakistan is merely just a band- aid. There are bigger structural issues that need to be addressed when it comes to Pakistan's economy and cannot be pinpointed to one government alone. This is a mess that's been a long time coming. And we're not finding solutions quick enough in this country, and the people themselves are suffering. Rosemary?",
