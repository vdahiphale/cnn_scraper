So, we're seeing measures between local courts and prosecutors and Congress play out on a field that we've never really seen before.And this is a huge escalation in this back and forth. I mean, for weeks now, we've seen the tensions between Jim Jordan and the Judiciary Committee and the Republicans and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office reached a fever pitch. And this lawsuit is finally Alvin Bragg hitting backs for a while. He has just been letting some of these requests come out, and he has been engaging with them but saying that he does not want to sit down. I mean, they asked for his testimony weeks ago even before Donald Trump was indicted. Um, and so, this is now finally, Alvin Bragg is issuing, you know, a lawsuit of his own and starting to go after Republicans, and he's really saying that this is an intimidation effort. And one of the key things in this lawsuit is that he doesn't think that this committee has any legislative purpose to be going after the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, that it's all political and that they're just trying to get involved because Donald Trump was indicted. And he cited a lot of -- Kevin McCarthy, even the speaker of the House, cited his response to the indictment. He said that Jim Jordan tweeting that the indictment was outrageous even before a lot of these people -- these people were weighing in before they saw the charges against the former president. And so, it's going to be fascinating to watch this in the coming weeks. And I do think Monday is when we'll really see it all come to a head in New York where the Judiciary Committee is holding this field hearing just blocks from where Donald Trump was arraigned in court last week. And so, I think this is going to be a very big topic for the weeks to come.",

She said and she told us, uh, that she called Trump after the committee issued this letter to Alvin Bragg and walked him through why they were doing this and what the process would look like. Um, and that to me just shows the power that Donald Trump still has over the Republican Party and Congress. He's no longer president, he's not in the White House, and yet they're all trying to play defense for him on Capitol Hill. And so, um, the one thing I do want to point out, though, about these backchannels is that Joe Tacopina, Donald Trump's lawyer, one of his lawyers, um, weeks before, even a month or so before the indictment was starting to, you know, play out and they knew that they were going to be issuing it, Joe Tacopina issued a letter to Jim Jordan and said, we want you to investigate Alvin Bragg, we think that you need to investigate Alvin Bragg. And I think that just shows the extent of some of these communications and the extent of really how involved Donald Trump and his team still are in a lot of what Congress is doing and investigating.",

And he said that it would be for current presidents, former presidents if they are facing issues like this, that they can move that case to federal court and not have it being a local court.And that's one of the key things that Republicans and Jim Jordan are arguing against Alvin Bragg, is that you're a state and local prosecutor, this is a federal case, and this shouldn't be your territory, that this should be a federal prosecution that we're seeing. And so, that's one of the things that the committee is going to be proposing. You know, as early as this week, definitely, I think by the time they get back into session next week, that's the other thing. I mean, this lawsuit came -- Congress is out. They are out this week. We haven't -- we didn't see them last week either when all of the Trump indictment stuff was playing out. I mean, I think a lot of Republicans were relieved by that, that they weren't facing questions from me and other reporters on this, but I do think it's going to be right back into the center of everything once they're back in town.",

He has had to deal with a lot of huge things. Nothing as big as indicting a former president, of course, but that's when you signed up for the job, that's why you took it.

I've been in a bunch of these court cases, by the way. Sometimes, they say they're five weeks, they last two months, they could go on longer, so he's trying to basically keep it very narrow and very focused. Big take away from me and what the judge laid out here is that Fox cannot use anything that its host said on its air to push back on defamation claims as part of the case. And that matters because I don't know how Fox has been preparing for this lawsuit for the past few months, but I presume it has been a huge part of their preparation to push back part of their defense.

And by the way, we know that that's how they're thinking was because in previous depositions, text messages, email exchanges between employees, hosts and producers show that this is how they were thinking.

And it is a dramatic change in just the span of two weeks because initially after the tragedy, he indicated that there wasn't a legislative solution to all of this. Now, he's signing or signed today an executive order. He is also leaning on the republican state legislature to get involved as well to pass a red flag law. He's not going to get support from every Republican in his state. We have certainly seen the dominance of the Republican Party in that state in the fallout over this tragedy in the last several weeks. But he may get some. And it is just really a remarkable shift. I spoke to some Democrats in the state today and one staffer told me that it is appropriate to celebrate the small victories, that some folks might be cynical about this and say this has no impact. But when you see this type of reversal, it is clear that this sort of historic pressure, the protests that they've seen, is -- does seem to be weighing on the governor.",

Apparently, we no longer want the Pintos. Apparently, we want larger cars because of families and et cetera, etcetera. So, part of this is preference. And part of this is that the utility vehicles and larger trucks have gotten a lot more comfortable. They've advanced certainly with technology.

One, you have to own your home, and two, you have to have this space enough to actually have a charging station. And so, for a lot of people, that may not be the case.

I mean, President Biden himself wants Americans to go big on EVs. And they're actually going to be rolling out new policies around some of the electric emissions tomorrow. The EPA will be doing this. And so, I think that if it's successful, if Congress doesn't get involved and tries to roll it back, which I know Republicans already talking about, it's not even out there yet, if that happens, I mean, if they're successful with this in the next 10 years or so, I think it will create a better environment for a lot of these electric vehicles.
