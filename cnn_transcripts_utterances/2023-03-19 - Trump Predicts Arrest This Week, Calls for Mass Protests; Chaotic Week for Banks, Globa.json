I'm Abby Philip. Buckle up for what could be an extraordinary week and the life of this nation. Former President Donald Trump says that he expects to be arrested on charges of hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Now, Trump dropped that bombshell on his truth social website yesterday, writing, quote, the foreign away leading Republican candidate, and the former president of the United States, will be arrested on Tuesday of next week. Protests take our nation back. He followed up with another post saying, we can't let them allow this anymore. We must save America. Protest, protest, protest. Both posts, eerily, reminiscent of his call to his supporters to come to Washington on January 6th in 2021. He wrote than, will be wild. His former vice president, who broke with Trump over January 6, said that he agrees that it is a politically motivated prosecution, but, he condemned any threat of violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Yes, there's a misdemeanor at the heart of this, possibly falsifying business records could be what he's charged with. Sex offenses are misdemeanors. Violent crimes can often be misdemeanors. It's still a crime that's prosecutable, is just a question of whether the evidence is there, and the prosecutors are confident they can move forward with it.

If it's the federal government could've charged and didn't, if it's something that the New York D.A. just seem to be dropping, and then resumed after criticism, all of these things are going to factor into this as well.",

There's no way around that when you have two different parties, and a defendant of one party be prosecuted by another.

What I can tell you is that Biden and his allies, very strongly believe that if it ends up being another Biden versus Trump rematch in 2024, there was a very clear, real path up to have President Biden win a second term. They believe that 2020 might show that the majority of the country believes that President Trump, Donald Trump, is simply unacceptable. Not to mention in 2024, presumably President Biden would not have gone through the wringer of the primary process, running with all of the advantages that come with being the incumbent president, and then, yeah, if you're running against somebody who's not just under investigation, but has been actively indicted, then I think that the unacceptability case ends up being an easier one for them to maintain, they'd argue.",

ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, NEW YORK TIMES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That concern that Julie was describing was also among Americans I think factors directly into how much President Biden was talking about holding the executives of these banks accountable. Whether or not he was going to be able to do that remains an open question. But we did see him asking for financial regulators to have new powers to basically regain those gains from different executives who may have traded different shares before these banks failed as well, trying to empower, and increased different oversight mechanisms and increases accountability. I think that directly connects to the concerns that Americans, and frustrations Americans will have, seen what's happening over the past two weeks.

And abortion pills have now become the next legal battleground in this fight over reproductive rights. And joining me now to discuss this is NPR's national correspondent Sarah McCammon who's joining our round table. So Sarah, you were in the courtroom this week for this case. Lots of drama and controversy surrounding this hearing. What went on inside?",

It's used in most medication abortions in this country. And medication abortion is the dominant form of abortion in this country today.So there are two sides in this case. There's a group of antiabortion rights advocates, medical groups and doctors primarily who oppose abortion who are suing the FDA on the other side challenging the way that the FDA, the particulars of the way that FDA approved mifepristone more than 20 years ago and some for the rule changes they've made since that has made it easier for people to get access to that pill. And so in the courtroom, we heard lawyers for the anti-abortion groups argue that -- about some of those particulars but also argue I think interestingly Abby that widespread access to medication abortions is making it harder for red states that has banned abortion since the overturning of Roe v Wade to enforce those laws.",

The other interesting thing this judge -- a very conservative judgenot only has this case before him but he ruled back in December on abortion. He also ruled on halting efforts to end Trump's remain in Mexico program and he rejected rules that would have protected LGBTQ people from discrimination on healthcare. The bigger question here though that I have just on principle is I don't recall any other scenario in which a judge has been asked to rule on the science of the safety of medication.

It seeks a radical redefinition of society in which equality of group result is the end point enforced by an angry mob.\" Now to me, one of the issues here isn't so much that she couldn't do it in that moment. It's really that the definition that she's putting forward is one that has been created by conservatives in the last couple of -- I mean, let's call it 18 to 20 months, since the summer of 2020. And it's been created in order to sort of attack the idea of social injustice as a concept, it seems. KANNO-YOUNGS: I always understood -- well initially when this term came about, I understood it to be understanding our nation's history to inform us about societal barriers currently. It seems, however, that's sort of become a catch-all for certain politicians to appeal to the grievances and anger of certain voters in times that are convenient to those certain politicians.
