If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.It's been four hours since the controversial U.S. border rule known as Title 42 expired. The head of the U.S. homeland security released a statement saying the border is not open. Tens of thousands of migrants are currently camped out in border towns. A surge of arrivals is expected in the U.S., although it's been quiet overnight. Today's debt ceiling meeting between U.S. President Biden and Congressional leaders has been postponed. Lawmakers remain deadlocked in talks over raising the 31 trillion-dollar limit. China and the U.S. have signaled that they want to move past the diplomatic crisis over the alleged Chinese spy balloon incident. The two sides held high-level talks this week for the first time since the U.S. shot the balloon out of the sky in February off South Carolina, after it spent days floating across the country. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is live for us in Hong Kong. Kristie, what impact did this meeting have on the tensions in the relationship between these two superpowers?",

The Dutch citizen was one of the last people to see American teenager Natalee Holloway alive before she disappeared in Aruba nearly two decades ago. A prime suspect in her disappearance, he'll face charges of extortion and fraud in the U.S. As CNN's Jean Casarez reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): 18 years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway vanished on a school trip in Aruba, the prime suspect in her disappearance is being extradited to the United States.

He knows the answers.CASAREZ (voice-over): He is accused of extorting thousands from Holloway's mother Beth, in exchange for details on the location of her daughter's remains. According to legal documents in March 2010, van der Sloot quote, offered to take the cooperating witness to the location of Natalee Holloway's body, advise as to the circumstances of her death, and identify those in her death and disappearance in return for a payment of $250,000. Papers were signed, a total of $25,000 was given to van der Sloot, and Holloway's attorney flew to Aruba. Van der Sloot took the attorney to a house saying her body was buried within the foundation. Soon after fleeing to Peru with the $25,000, he emailed the Holloway saying quote, he had lied about the location of Natalee's remains. Extortion charges were filed a short time later. In May 2005, the 18-year-old Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub in Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men. All three were charged by Aruban prosecutors in 2007 for involvement in manslaughter, but a judge ordered their release, citing a lack of direct evidence. Her body was never found. Beth Holloway said in a statement, she would be 36 years old now. It has been a very long and painful journey, but the persistence of many is going to pay off. Together, we are finally getting justice for Natalee. After the U.S. legal proceedings conclude, van der Sloot will be sent back to Peru according to a statement from Peru's judiciary. To a Peruvian prison where he is serving time for the murder of 21-year-old Stephanie Flores. She was murdered five years after Holloway's disappearance. CNN was allowed exclusive access to van der Sloot's cell shortly after his arrest, and in 2012, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison for that murder.",

There is a high level of security outside the Islamabad high court where Imran Khan is currently inside with a lot of lawyers. The media is inside as well. Outside is a high security paramilitary contingent. They've been troops that have been called in to keep a secure situation within the capital.We're being told by a reporter on the ground who actually managed to speak to Imran Khan. And Imran Khan has told him that he is 100 percent sure that he might actually be arrested again. Khan is also accused the military, the head of military, for putting him in this situation. He said there's only one man who is doing this and he is named the chief of Army staff as the person behind his leading the charge behind his arrest. Now Imran Khan's arrest was called illegal by the Supreme Court yesterday. And we are waiting to see what's going to happen after court resumes, after this interval that's going to restart in about half an hour from now. Imran Khan's protesters are gathering in the capital, that like you said, there's a ban on gatherings. So, there is a seeming set for potential clashes. Pakistan's Prime Minister has called Imran Khan's supporters terrorists. A lot of the senior leadership of Imran Khan's party, the very familiar faces, are barred from (INAUDIBLE), where people look up to, are behind bars. They are in police custody. There is a complete lockdown of the internet. There is no data. There's no WhatsApp. There's no Facebook. There's no YouTube. There's no Twitter for the past four days here in Pakistan. So, there is a lot of uncertainty, perhaps Khan will get bail. Perhaps he'll be reprimanded and apprehended again. We just have to wait and see -- Bianca.",
