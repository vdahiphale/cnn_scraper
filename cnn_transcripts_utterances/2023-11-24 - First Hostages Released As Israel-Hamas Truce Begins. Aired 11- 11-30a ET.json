They have had contacts with the Israeli government, but most of what they have learned, these families have told me has been through public reports. And they have watched as these talks have gotten close to the possibility of a deal before falling apart again. And this week, they watched as just a couple of days ago, this process was delayed by nearly 24 hours. And now finally, perhaps a point where they will get to embrace their loved ones, at least those families of the 13 hostages released today, and providing some hope for the families of those who still remain in Gaza, that a deal is possible to release them, that Hamas can indeed deliver on its side of the bargain to deliver these hostages to the Red Cross into Egypt, and eventually, hopefully soon into Israel.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and Jeremy just a note in a testament to their selflessness, we've heard from so many of these hostage families that even though it's not their loved ones coming home because they got a call from the Israeli government yesterday telling them whether or not it was their family members, they said they're still so happy for those 13 families that are getting their family members back in just a short time. Jeremy Diamond, thank you.John, I mean, one remarkable aspect of this as we were, you know, hearing officials approach it with a lot of caution, a lot of trepidation from the U.S. to Israel, to all over is this is unfolding pretty much as we had expected. Obviously, this is the lengthiest part right here, this actual transfer of the hostages. But so far it has gone as we had been expecting and hearing from officials that they expected it to go.",

      "sentences": "Yes, John, as we are watching all of this unfold minute by minute here, officials in Israel are doing the same thing. The Prime Minister, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defense minister, they are watching as well from a military intelligence office space, that is where they're keeping a close eye to make sure what they have been facilitating and negotiating this deal with Hamas through an intermediary, Qatar, making sure that it goes according to plan because they're watching just as closely as we are to see that this day, this day is a template really, for further hostage releases. Because these are 13 of them, we believe there are 50 total expected, so how does it work for the other 37 here.All of this is being carefully monitored. One big unknown is also the condition of these hostages. We have not gotten any kind of medical update. We don't know what condition they're in. That is something that they have been bracing for here in Israel trying to prepare for really, any scenario with all of this. CNN's chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, is outside of a children's hospital that couldn't be receiving some of these hostages. We do expect there to be children among them that we do not have any official confirmation of who exactly is in this group yet. Clarissa, has there been any new activity at the hospital? This is a lengthy process as we're seeing these hostages make their way eventually to Israel? What are you seeing at the hospital right now?",

      "sentences": "So behind me, and I don't know if you can see there's some flashing lights. That is the hospital's helipad. In the last few hours, we've seen a number of ambulances sort of park up alongside that helipad. Again, we don't know if that's where the hostages would arrive. But the assumption is that the children who are released and if they are with their mothers, their mothers, and they are in reasonable physical condition that they will be brought here to the Schneider Children's Medical Center, if they are in more serious condition, if they require lengthy or extensive medical care, they will likely be taken to another hospital called Soraka.But here at Schneider Medical Center for Children, they have gone to great pains, Kaitlan, to make sure that they have done the best job they possibly can of preparing for the arrival of these hostages. They have taken over an entire area of the hospital and really gone to lengths to make sure that it doesn't look like a hospital. They want to create what one staff member told us was the feeling of a beautiful hotel. There's a lot of thought that's gone into having a lot of toys so that it feels warm, that it feels intimate. The hospital has gone to great pains as well, Kaitlan, to handpick the staff, who will be working with the hostages who will be arriving. Obviously they want to ensure that they have the top psychiatrists, social workers ready to greet them. Kaitlan?",

But certainly these are military helicopters that have landed about two kilometers from this Kerem Shalom crossing. We have Israeli military officials who are at this location where we are. We actually happen to be here already, because we knew it was vantage over Kerem Shalom. But Israeli military officials brought some photographers and Israeli journalists to this point, in order to witness the possible crossing.Again, we have not fully officially confirmed that they are coming through Kerem Shalom crossing. But obviously this kind of activity would suggest that that is very, very possible. I think with the light now you might be able to get a little bit of a better look at some of these helicopters, not clear if they're picking somebody up here, if they're moving on. But again, certainly the most activity that we have seen at our location, as we know, at this moment, that convoy of hostages is in Egypt, making their way, it would appear, towards Israel. Which crossing? We don't know. This is certainly the closest one to the Rafah crossing. This will be the closest point for them to drive to. And so I suspect that in the next, you know, half hour or so, we may get a clearer picture of exactly what is happening and whether or not they're in fact crossing here.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And she appeared to be with a woman. We had been told by Israeli officials who would not confirm identities for obvious reasons that they did expect families to be included in this group of hostages not to be separated as they were released by Hamas.I will say, John, we have just now official confirmation on the actual numbers that we've been talking about. There had been some questions about how many Thai nationals were included in this group. The Red Cross, which of course facilitated that transfer, there's that moment again, there, John, with the little girl in the yellow shirt that you can see at the bottom of your screen. The Red Cross is saying that they are relieved to confirm I'm quoting them now the safe release of 24 hostages. We do still believe that 13 of those are the Israeli hostages that were negotiated as part of this deal. So that raises the question of the numbers of the rest are those Thai nationals that we had heard from the Egyptians. They say they facilitated this by transporting them from Gaza to what you're looking at right now. That is the Rafah border and the Rafah crossing that we saw them come through in that convoy that we believe was holding these hostages earlier. Obviously, John, still a lot of questions to come. And I think when you noted the number of ambulances here, it's also it was a big question mark for these officials, the condition of the -- these hostages and what they were going to be greeted with upon arrival. They didn't know. And so I think that is one thing here. And of course, you have seen some elderly people as well in this group that we are looking at that we are still waiting for that official list from the Israeli government. There's another woman going inside the door into what we believe is this medical facility.",

I'm not exactly clear who the stewards are here, presumably with the Red Cross, the International Committee of the Red Cross, helping these people out or through.But again, at this point, it does appear that we've had a look at, at least two of the hostages that have been released, a young girl and an older woman. This process playing out before our eyes at the Rafah crossing. This is Egypt now. So they are free, whatever you want to call it, they're free, no longer in the hands of Hamas terrorists. But in safety inside Egypt for the first time in 48 days impossible to know, Kaitlan, what's going through their minds, impossible to know how they are physically, although both people we just saw there the young woman and the older, the young girl and the older woman were walking without aid. And they were moving along right there. Remarkable to see that video, the first look we've had we believe at any of these hostages now for 48 days. Kaitlan?",

It's also remarkable, John, how we're watching this all play out minute by minute by minute live before our very eyes because previously when we had seen some of the hostages being released, I'm thinking of Judith and Natalie Raanan. They were released. We got a photo of them as they were being walked across by Israeli soldiers. We did not see an actual video of them.There was one I believe released by Hamas, one video that we chose not to show for obvious reasons. We're watching this all play out as they have been making this trip. We saw where Jeremy was where those two helicopters are. That's still a question of what those helicopters are intended for, who's going to be getting on them at Kerem Shalom and then of course here at the Rafah crossing, where we're seeing this line of ambulances. Clarissa Ward is at a children's hospital here in Israel. They've been bracing for the potential arrival of some of these hostages as they are being released. Clarissa, obviously, where John and I are just seeing a few of these what we believe to be hostages, it still remains to be seen exactly who the identities of these people are. What are you seeing from your vantage point?",

And just remarkable to see these images that we were seeing earlier. That's Petah Tikva, where Clarissa is in Israel outside of that Children's Hospital. But we've also been watching at the Rafah crossing as a line of ambulances and what appear to be hostages going in.And just what is a major moment the fact that this deal that has been brokered between Hamas and Israel is playing out as they had hoped it would. There are still a lot of hostages to go 37 as a part of this deal, but obviously more than 200 still being held by Hamas in Gaza. But to see these hostages in this moment being brought to safety and eventually being brought back to Israel is just -- it's a breakthrough of a moment that, you know, there haven't been many of those since October 7th happened?",
