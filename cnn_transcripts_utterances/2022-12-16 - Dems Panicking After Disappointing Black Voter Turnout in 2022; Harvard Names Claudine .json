DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTNow, look, according to both the school and a student who shot video there, they say that this all started over an assignment. This was the final exam day, according to that student. That same student tells us at no point where there physical threats, and their classmate and the professor were on different sides of the classroom. They weren't near each other. According to the school, it was actually a different faculty member who called the police. But, look, there is this additional layer here. This is in HBCU, and look, the chancellor issued a statement saying in part, \"In accordance with law enforcement procedures, our officers' first priority is to assess the situation and provide every opportunity for a positive resolution. We understand that the weaponization of police is a prevalent problem in our community.
