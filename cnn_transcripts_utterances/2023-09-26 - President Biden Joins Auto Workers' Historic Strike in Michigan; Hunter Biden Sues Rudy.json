So Biden has a lot of triangular work to do environmental community of tomorrow, climate activists, labor unions, and why I mentioned the name Walter Reuther quite forgotten today, but in the 1960s, Reuther created an environmentalist labor alliance.It's Walter Reuther, who funded the first Earth Day in 1970. And you have an opportunity here for buying to use Michigan as a laboratory to try and convince working Americans that turning green or going to electric vehicles isn't going to hurt their pocketbooks. So I think a lot's at stake, like the entire Biden economic agenda. And we also instead of just applying UAW, we're so proud that as Americans to have these big three automakers, they often do the right things. Let's hope they'll negotiate in good spirit.

Cory Booker stood by Menendez in the last indictment, the last trial proceedings, testified, was a character witness for Menendez, and I know that they have a very strong bond.I don't think that Bob Menendez sees resigning. And I've known the guy for 30 years. He's tough. He hails from one of the toughest districts in America, Hudson County, New Jersey. These people eat nails for breakfast. And so I don't think he sees resigning as anything but giving up and an admission of guilt. Also, it would tie his hands and it would severely limit his ability to raise funds.

And that was a violation of state and federal law, according to their allegations.Now, as you know, Costello and Giuliani, they have played a very public role in sharing data from a laptop that Hunter is said to have left at a Delaware repair shop. Costello, we were told, received this data and then Giuliani helped to publicize this. Hunter's lawyers described this as, quote, an annihilation of Hunter Biden's digital privacy. And even though Hunter Biden is now facing a criminal case of his own in Delaware, a lawyer on his team told me earlier today that anyone who is involved in sharing his data should be hearing, quote, footsteps. Now, Giuliani shot back in a statement today from his spokesman, saying that he was surprised that he would be accused of manipulating any of this data that was on this laptop and also suggested there were evidence of crimes on that laptop. But it's clear, even though Hunter Biden is facing criminal charges now and this more aggressive strategy began when they thought that whole investigation was going to be put behind them, it's going to be resolved with a plea deal.
