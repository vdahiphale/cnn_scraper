That bullet fractured his ribs, lacerated his liver, and made his lung collapse, which meant he then had to be put on a ventilator.

Here's a look at some of the other headlines we're following this hour.A Virginia cruise ship is returning to Norfolk, following an unsuccessful search for a passenger who went overboard. Carnival Cruise says its security footage shows the passenger falling over the water after leaning over his balcony in a state room around 4:00 a.m. But he wasn't reported missing until late Monday afternoon. The incident took place nearly 200 miles off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. Also, China has successfully sent another manned mission into space. The rocket docked at China's space station this morning after a six- and-a-half-hour flight. The crew includes an aeronautics professor, the first civilian that China has sent into space. They're going to be relieving astronauts who have been at the recently built station since last November. Just as China is heading out into space, the capsule carrying a private Axiom-2 mission is on its way back to earth, returning to the International Space Station. The crew was made up of a former NASA astronaut and three paying customers, including the first two Saudi astronauts in space. They spent much of the last eight days conducting experiments and working on plans to build private modules on the space station. Jim?",

Our cameras were rolling, Jim, when she turned herself in.It was 12:17 when an SUV drove up to the gates of the federal facility that you see behind me. They parked in a -- visitor parking. Shortly thereafter, Elizabeth Holmes walked out of that vehicle, turning herself into authorities. If you look closely behind me, you'll see, there's no barbed wire in the front of this facility. This is a minimum-security facility for female inmates. The population is just over 600. Now, Holmes had delayed her surrender to authorities for weeks. We know that she was supposed to surrender on April 27th. But just a few days before that, she filed an appeal through her attorneys asking that a judge allow her to be free on bail while she fought her conviction. Well, that was denied. Her attorneys reset her surrender date to May 30th. And that's why we are here today. We were able to witness Elizabeth Holmes walking into this federal facility. Now, what can she expect while she's here? There's an 82-page handbook that kind of spells out what she will be doing from now on. The first thing, according to this handbook, happens is she will get a social and medical screening. It also says that every inmate has to maintain a job. The pay is up to 40 cents. It appears to be per hour. It is not clear, based on that handbook. It also says that inmates who are first admitted into this facility will first serve in the food service area of the facility. It goes on to say, Jim, a lot of the things that she will be experiencing. Like she will have to wake up at 6:00 a.m. every morning, make her bed. Mop her floor, take out her own trash. She'll be wearing an I.D. that has her name, that identifies her at any point in time. She does -- she is allowed to have some personal property, like photographs and magazines. She'll be able to have a radio, an MP3 player and a few other items, but not a lot of items, according to this handbook. And lastly, she can also wear some jewelry. According to this handbook, Jim, she can wear a wedding band. But the value of that wedding band has to be under $100. But again, the breaking news here out of Bryan, Texas, is that Elizabeth Holmes has turned herself into a federal facility -- Jim?",
