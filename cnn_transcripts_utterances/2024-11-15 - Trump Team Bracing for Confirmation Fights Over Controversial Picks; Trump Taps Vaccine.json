That is simply not happening because the Trump team has, at least so far, decided that they don't need it, that they're using private sector companies to go through these names, to go through these names, to go through the backgrounds of these people. And this has been something that has been in the works for a long time.There are people around the former president, the incoming President- elect, who have been circulating a memo calling for bypassing the FBI background checks, taking issue with some of the problems that they say the FBI and the intelligence community had during Trump's former first term. You remember there were a number of people, including Jared Kushner, who could not get a security clearance, and Trump had to order the intelligence community to grant that clearance. And so what we know right now is that, you know, obviously, as you pointed out, there are people who are traditionally part of this who say that the purpose here is to take a hammer to the process that exists.

All right, let's first jump into what we just heard from Evan and his reporting. Trump is clearly avoiding these FBI background checks, and the question is why? Could it be that his picks just simply wouldn't pass? Joseph, to you. JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; COMMUNITY ACTIVIST: Well, look, I think, first and foremost, the President has the right to choose who he wants to in his cabinet. I think it is important that we have transparency in the process, particularly for some of these more marquee positions. But I will say that part of that skepticism has been rightfully earned. I think we have to remember that this is an FBI that had a rogue attorney that used false information to procure a FISA warrant to investigate the president when he was the nominee, and then continued to -- continue spying on him through that presidency for an extended period of time. It's the same FBI that had members of former intelligence who were key card access to Langley, and then allowed those individuals to put out a letter saying that the laptop was Russian disinformation when the FBI had authenticated that laptop 11 months prior. So, yes, the skepticism has been earned. We, as the American people, should demand that we have a thorough investigation. The mechanism for how the investigation takes place, I think, though, could be left up to debate.",

I mean, we saw that in 2017, 2018, when, as mentioned in the previous reporting, when Jared Kushner couldn't get a clearance and Trump essentially had to strong-arm them into giving him one. So, it's pretty clear what he's doing here.And yes, there's potential danger here. I mean, the FBI investigation is somebody who was involved in the transition in, you know, in 2020 and 2021. These questions get at the bottom of whether there is information that you could be blackmailed over. They get at -- you know, whether you've had issues, moments in your background that potentially make you vulnerable to our adversaries. So, you know, it's not intended as a punishment. It is intended as a genuine exploration of issues that could create a problem and could allow somebody in a position where they have access to incredibly sensitive information to be, you know, to be abused. So, yes, it is potentially dangerous. It is, unfortunately, typical Donald Trump. This is not, to my mind, this isn't about some righteous crusade against the deep state.

I was just in this building last night listening to Senator Coons explain how there are certainly people who are not going to need a robust FBI background check.

And yes, I do think that if you look at even what happened to General Flynn, who had his entire life destroyed by allegations coming from within the Department of Justice, many of which turned out to be fabricated or greatly exaggerated, there is a very real concern that the agenda that a nationwide mandate has set forth by electing President Trump could be thwarted by individuals simply looking to tank the people that he has decided are going to be the tip of the spear to get this country back on track.",

The White House National Security Advisor says that President Biden will put forth a public message, as he has for years, that allies are vital to America's national security. But the unspoken message here is that those alliances are set to be upended come January when President- elect Donald Trump begins his second term.And U.S. officials say that that acknowledgement is pervasive here in South America. While these leaders might be physically here to talk about ways that they can advance the economies of 21 Asian Pacific nations, that really everyone's minds are back on what's happening in Palm Beach and in Washington. And that the Biden administration, to a certain extent, is powerless to try to safeguard any of these partnerships or agreements with these allies, who are now trying to figure out how to insulate their economies from the threat of another trade war or other threats that Trump has levied against their countries. We do know that President Biden is going to be holding that high- stakes, closely-watched bilateral meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, important because of the position of the U.S. and China as the two global economic superpowers and a relationship that Biden has sought to keep from simmering over in the last four years. But it's unclear what, if anything, the two leaders will be able to advance. They did meet this time last year to talk about military-level communication and curbing illicit fentanyl trafficking. But as of right now, China experts expect that President Xi will withhold any of his personal bargaining chips for when Trump takes office and threatens that new trade war. Even so, officials expect that to be a bookend discussion as a way for President Biden to close out his term and recognize that relationship, the healthy competition that they've tried to foster. But, of course, the expectations are fairly low for this trip as President Biden makes his final swan song on the world stage quietly. Guys.",
