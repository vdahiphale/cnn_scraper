He announced a list of new picks for key health and economic roles in his administration. That includes hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, Treasury Secretary, Oregon Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor, and Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, family practice doctor who's also appeared as a contributor to Fox News, as U.S. Surgeon General.

Last night, Gaetz announced he will not be returning to Congress next year. However, another pick is making headlines. Sources tell CNN that Tulsi Gabbard, who Trump selected to lead the intelligence community, briefly landed on a TSA watch list, but she was quickly removed after going public with the claims.Federal sources say public statements have no influence on who is or is not on the list. CNN's Arit John is here with more details on these key administration picks. Arit, Lori Chavez-DeRemer came as somewhat of a surprise, didn't she? Why is that? ARIT JOHN, CNN REPORTER Well, if you're a Democrat, you're probably pretty happy with this pick compared to a lot of the other nominees of President-elect Trump. Lori Chavez-DeRemer is somebody who recently lost her reelection bid for a seat in the Portland area. And one of the things she really emphasized in that bid was her union ties, that she had been endorsed by some unions, that she had sought out union support. She's the daughter of a union member and she also was one of the few co-sponsors of the PRO Act, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which was introduced in the Senate by Senator Bernie Sanders. So this is somebody with really strong labor ties, somebody who is supportive of unions and who was back by Teamster President Sean O'Brien. If you'll remember, Sean O'Brien spoke at the RNC, tried to reach across the aisle in terms of building up Republican union support and famously did not endorse in the presidential election when in the past the Teamsters have been have endorsed Democrats. So Sean O'Brien, this is a real victory for him because he was able to boost somebody who would be supportive of labor in a Republican administration. And I believe that's why this is such a surprise for sort of the business community because typically you don't expect Republicans to pick somebody who's against right to work laws, who is for bills like the PRO Act to be the Republicans labor secretary.",

But one thing they're not going to allow is for this case to be dismissed. Prosecutors say they will continue to fight that even though Trump's lawyers are trying multiple different paths to try to get the entire case tossed out. Judge Juan Merchan gave Trump attorneys until December 2nd to lay out their arguments. Why? They think that because Trump is now president elect that his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records should be tossed out. Prosecutors have a week to respond. So it's possible that Juan Merchan could potentially give us answer on the fate of this historic case before the new year. Amara. Victor. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He's an interesting pick, isn't he? I mean, he once worked for George Soros. He would be the first only gay treasury secretary and President-elect Trump took more time with this decision, didn't he?

He's been on the campaign trail. Even during rally speeches during the campaign, you would hear Trump talk about Scott Bessent, calling him the most brilliant guy on Wall Street.So this is someone who is more of a conventional pick. He's not going to be a disruptor. But this was somewhat of a knife fight to get through this treasury selection process. There were several other people who were interested in the job, including Howard Lutnick, who ultimate to the Commerce Department. There were other figures in the mix, including Scott Haggerty or Bill Haggerty, rather, the Senator from Tennessee, Mark Rowan. This was somewhat of a controversial pick within Trump's orbit. He's the CEO of Apollo, which is a big private equity firm. And even some of Trump's close allies like Steve Bannon came out and said that it's people like Mark Rowan who have really disrupted companies in the middle of the country and have left people worse off economically. So Bessent was sort of a choice that was both palatable to Trump's team as well as Wall Street. The Treasury Secretary serves as a key liaison between markets and the central bank. So this is someone that we should be able to see a positive reaction for in the markets.",

We've really seen this transformation, including at RNC, when Sean O'Brien, who's the president of the Teamsters, came out and addressed the RNC. He was the keynote speaker one night.And in the room it was very interesting because there were some people who, particularly delegates on the floor who were very much interested in his speech, what he had to say about rights for workers. But others who were also a little bit concerned of, hey, is this where the Republican Party is on this issue? But it's clear that blue collar workers and union workers were really key to Donald Trump's victory in the blue wall states and elsewhere. So you start to see sort of the parties realigning here. Labor is one of those issues where we're seeing rank and file members of unions support Trump versus Democrats who they've supported for years.",

And she doesn't have all the personal baggage and investigations in the same way that Matt Gaetz had where he was just sort of uniquely opposed by both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.Bondi, you know, if confirmed, she will certainly be, you know, a very loyal Trump ally in the Justice Department. But this question of background checks is one that has been percolating around Capitol Hill and really set up to be a showdown between Senate Republicans and the Trump -- incoming Trump administration. Trump has said he doesn't necessarily want to have the FBI investigating and doing background checks on people. This is, however, a long standing practice. This is happened before. And this is, you know, something that generally with the incoming president would really join forces with the federal government. Trump has really resisted that. He's not running the transition out of a federal building. He's not taking federal money. He's doing it all on his own at his private Mar-a-Lago club.

When you look at some of these totals, this was definitely an overachiever of a storm. 20 inches topping out at High Point, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, also getting well over a foot of snow, and it's not done just yet. You still have it. Not nearly as heavy anymore, but you've got some rain across western Pennsylvania.The snow into the mountains there, but also into portions of New England. It is still raining as we speak in Boston. Portland, you've also got some snow into the White and Green Mountains. But that snow is likely going to melt the next few days because the temperatures are going to start to rebound. Look at St. Louis, 51 back into the 60s by tomorrow. Memphis, it takes a little bit longer, but we get back into the 70s by Monday. Same thing for Richmond and New York. It's going to be a bit more of a delay. The temperatures really don't warm up that much until Monday and into Tuesday of this week, but they will get much warmer, melting a lot of that snow that just fell. If you have some travel plans today, the most ideal spots are really going to be the Southeast and pretty much of the central U.S. no issues there whatsoever. The only other rough spot is still going to be out into the West. That bomb cyclone has moved off, but we still have that atmospheric river kind of funneling some more moisture back into the Pacific Northwest and especially into north and Central California for today, again, you can see still some of that moisture. But finally, once we get past today, that atmospheric river is going to shift away from these areas, finally giving them at least a little bit of a reprieve before the next system begins to arrive. So as you look over the next several days, you're still looking at several more inches of rain in some of these spots and feet of snow into the Sierras.

This week, the White House authorized Ukraine to use long range missiles against targets inside Russia. And Ukraine also used bridge British supplied missiles for the first time. Joining me now, CNN military analyst Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling and CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger. Welcome to you both. General, let me start with you. And this statement from Putin also that he says Russia now has the right to use weapons against countries that allowed Ukraine to use theirs to attack Russian facilities. Is this bluster? I mean, the U.S. and European countries have been aiding Ukraine for 1,000 days now. Should this be considered any different than statements he's made over the last year plus of this war? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a little worse than the statements he's made in the past, Victor. And I'd say it is certainly bluster because Mr. Putin is in very bad shape. The state of Russia, the Federation of Russia is in very bad economic and military shape right now after almost three years of war. And what I would say is he knows he has not made very smart decisions since the start of this conflict, but he knows involving potentially attacking other countries that have been supplying Ukraine with weapons and ammunition would only lead to more disaster to him if NATO were to vote on whether or not to pull an Article 5 approach to this thing and any attack on any NATO element. And he's mentioned Poland and he's implied other countries would certainly result in a vote of an Article 5 in which all of NATO's countries would counter Russia's aggression inside of Ukraine.",

We've seen a new nuclear doctrine in recent days out of Russia, one that would loosen the conditions under which he could use nuclear weapons. This short range missile that was fired in is designed to take nuclear weapons and even can have multiple warheads on it. Obviously, it was not armed that way when they shot it at a not very strategic target in Ukraine.But I do think a good deal of what you're seeing going on right now is to ramp up the sense of escalation and then create a condition in which President-Elect Trump could come in and say, I just want an end of the war. Let's have a negotiation. This has gone on too far. It's too dangerous. And the thing that you hear Putin and Trump both say is this could lead to World War III. So, if they did that, then I imagine you could see a negotiation in which President Trump argued for giving the Russians the 20 percent of the country they now hold, keeping Ukraine out of NATO, and then forcing that decision on President Zelenskyy.",

This is the interesting piece that you can never depend on Russia and especially Mr. Putin telling the truth. The other factor that's involved that I'm glad to hear you mention it and David as well implied it, that any kind of attack on any NATO nation or any kind of negotiation by Mr. Trump to parcel away part of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty would only have massive repercussions across the continent and around the world. And certainly it could seem to be a quick fix and a 25 meter target, as we call it in the military. But I got to tell you, any kind of negotiation that would create that kind of condition without the incorporation of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian authorities would just be devastating, increasingly devastating to our standing in the world.",

You know, this is his third bail hearing, and then the other two hearings, he was summarily denied an opportunity to leave that Brooklyn facility. This judge, at least, is willing to consider what some kind of home detention would look like. And he is asking both sides to lay out what would occur if Combs was indeed released from detention.
