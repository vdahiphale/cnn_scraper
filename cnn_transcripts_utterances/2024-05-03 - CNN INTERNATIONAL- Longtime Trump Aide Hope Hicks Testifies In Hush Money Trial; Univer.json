Hicks, of course was at the center of the Trump universe. She started out working for the Trump Organization, then was one of the first staffers to join the campaign. In fact, she served as campaign press secretary in 2016. CNN's justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider is joining us with more of those details. A lot happening on the stand today, a lot for the prosecution, but also for the defense here -- Jessica.",

It didn't seem like anything in particular, maybe just the weight of the moment.You know, she was on the stand for a little under three hours total, and Erica, you mentioned the cross. It was a relatively short cross- examination, but there was this focus from the defense attorneys to get Hope Hicks to speak negatively about Michael Cohen and she did that. She detailed how Cohen would just insert himself into the campaign, you know, much to the chagrin of the campaign staff. Hicks stressed Cohen did not have an official role in the campaign, and she also talked about how even though Cohen is this self-described fixer, it was her belief that he was a fixer because he was the one who actually broke things in the first place. So the defense during their cross able to elicit some negativity about Cohen and his character. Maybe they'll try to build on that with the jury later, and the defense at the end of cross, they also stressed one of their last questions to Hicks was that, you know, she knew nothing about any of the business records of the Trump Organization, so really trying to distance her from anything related to the actual charges in this case, which were the falsification of business records. So the takeaway for the prosecution probably is that Hope Hicks, she was able to give that inside look at the campaign and the utter chaos that followed, the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, but, you know, Erica, she really didn't draw any direct links between Trump and any of these hush money payments other than just painting the picture generally that Trump was always very involved in all aspects of his campaign. So no direct link there, but leaving that thought in the jurors' minds that Donald Trump was very involved, so stay tuned as we give you more evidence as to just how involved he was.",

She was asked, you know, would he have done this out of the kindness of his heart? She said, no, she thought it would be out of character for him to just make a payment and that he is not an especially charitable person or a selfless person. And the fact that they ended on, and I am going to quote this here, \"It was Mr. Trump's opinion, she said that it was better to be dealing with it now,\" meaning after the election, \"... and then it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election.\" The fact that the prosecution ended on that statement and also an emotional moment for Hope Hicks.

She has had kind of a chilled relationship with the former president over the last couple of years, really since the January 6 hearings where under subpoena, she had to provide evidence and testimony just as she did here.But the fact that she is still so loyal to the president, the fact that there are still warm feelings and that she is able to provide important factual details, details like the fact that as you mentioned, that one of the significant concerns prior to the election is if the information about Stormy Daniels were to come out, especially on the heels of the Access Hollywood tape, it would have been damaging to the election. Now, the defense paints a counter narrative that Mr. Trump is a family man and that Michael Cohen was just going rogue as it were, but I think that as you point out, that exchange in which she says it would have been out of character for Cohen to do this out of the goodness of his heart speaks to Mr. Trump's involvement and her sort of sense of his micro managerial -- he was in control. Everyone reported to him. Michael Cohen reported to him. She reported to him and in a sense, he didn't necessarily have to have his fingerprints on the actual documents for him to be the one who was responsible for them.",

I think they are on the defense today. You saw that the defense counsel recognizes that Hope Hicks is a reluctant witness, that she is on some level of friendly witness. They were much gentler with her especially after she broke down and then on the prosecution side, they have been continually sort of -- it is almost a staccato presentation. They go with a big bombshell witness and then they bring in evidence through essentially a custodial witness who is a relatively unknown player, but allows them to bring in evidence like yesterday's secretive recording that Michael Cohen had made of their meeting discussing the payments to Karen McDougal.",

Some US colleges and universities are expected to have designated protest areas at commencement ceremonies as well, of course, heightened security. Now, this comes after weeks of student protests. They are protesting the war in Gaza. Since mid-April, more than 2,000 people have now been arrested. New York, of course, the epicenter and just hours ago, police arrested dozens of people as they cleared encampments near the new school and New York University. Now these protests continue, as I said, right around the globe, including Paris and where students supporting Palestinians rallied outside the Pantheon.

Earlier, I counted 16, it is less than that now. But let me tell you, Paula, it has been a very significant day here at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Earlier today, the Colleges of Business and Nursing had their recognition ceremonies and later tonight, UF will hold the university-wide commencement ceremony. This event, together with others over the course of the weekend, are expected to be attended by as many as 50,000 people according to a university spokesperson, at least 10,500 people from 86 countries, including of course, the United States will be graduating, but it has been a tense week here as we were discussing at the beginning, although probably not as much as what we have seen in places like Columbia University and UCLA. Now let me tell you why. Nine pro-Palestine protesters were arrested here Monday evening on campus, a group that calls itself UF Divestment Coalition published a list of very specific demands, Paula, including listen to this, the disclosure the university's investment portfolio for the last 10 years and divesting from what they call funding and partnering with weapons manufacturers implicated in the war in Gaza. They are also demanding that you have President Ben Sass publicly denounce what they call violence and discrimination against pro- Palestinian students, as well as a call for a ceasefire in Gaza. In response to the students' actions, a university spokesperson published a statement earlier this week saying the following, i['d like to share this with you, Paula, it says: \"This is not complicated. The University of Florida is not a daycare and we do not treat protesters like children. They knew the rules. They broke the rules and they will face the consequences.\" The spokesperson also said that some of the protesters were outside agitators, but according to local media, at least seven of the nine protesters arrested Monday were current or recent UF students. Now, this has become a political issue at the state level. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican issued a warning Thursday to protesters. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): People try to pitch a tent at our universities, they are shown the door very quickly on that. We are not putting up with it. This is not New York. This is not California. We are going to enforce appropriate standards of conduct and simply commandeering a lawn with a tent and harassing other people, that does not pass, that does not fly in the state of Florida.

She was able to corroborate today that she was in touch with Michael Cohen as the campaign was in crisis mode. After the Access Hollywood tape came out, as there was news that was breaking about a -- alleged affair with Karen McDougal that Donald Trump had. And then, there was her testimony that everything Trump was thinking about at that time was something he realized had an impact on the campaign. She said two things quite important to that effect. She said, verbatim, from our reporters in the courtroom hearing her testify, everything we talked about, in the context of this time period in this timeframe was about whether or not there was an impact on the campaign. That's an important narrative that the prosecutors are trying to show to the jury. And then, in addition to that, she ended some of her testimony as the prosecutors were asking her questions that it was better. And she understood that Trump knew it was better to be dealing with the hush money stories about Stormy Daniels coming out in 2018. Once he was one in the White House, then, at a time that he was on the campaign trail. So, she might not have had a window into every single transaction or even these things that were happening with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump in 2016.

Your information this past week, it has been invaluable.Thanks, Julio. We will continue to keep up with what goes on at Rutgers campus. Thanks so much. Now, the Biden administration is ramping up its direct response to the campus protests. The U.S. education secretary sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning what he calls abhorrent incidents of anti-Semitism. Ron Brownstein is a CNN senior political analyst and senior editor at The Atlantic. He joins me now. And Ron, am I glad to see you. Could you, in your wisdom, kind of sum up the week for us? That was, of course, it is political. But it is also generational.

Well, look, good to be with you, Paula.You know, first, I think, the first thing to keep in mind is that whatever problems Biden has on this, and they are real, Israel's problem under Netanyahu's leadership. And the extent to which, it is alienating young people, not only in the U.S., but kind of around the world with the way it has conducted this war, is something we can't lose sight of, especially given those earlier segments, you were talking about. Joe Biden is in a very difficult position. I mean, this is one -- this is an issue that really, I think, underscores the extent to which he is kind of a bridge or a holdover of an earlier generation of Democrats. His instinct, his first instinct is to lock arms with Israel. He's become more critical of them over time and over Netanyahu over time, but he has drawn an absolute line against imposing actual consequences, as they have resisted what he has wanted -- you know, the way he has wanted this to unfold, and certainly his vision of what would -- of what would come after. And that posture is putting him crosswise with the dominant opinion, not only among younger Democrats, but Democrats in general. I mean, over the last 25 years, as Israel has been governed mostly by right leaning governments, and more often than not by Netanyahu himself. Democratic sympathy for Israel has steadily declined, because it has gone up among Republicans. It was once a bipartisan issue in the U.S., it's become much more of an intensely partisan issue. And so, now, that kind of long-term trend comes to a point with these college demonstrations that are at risk -- hurting Biden from both directions, both in terms of exacerbating the conflicts within the Democratic coalition over the war itself, but also with swing voters who may view this as evidence of the Republican case that events are simply over running Biden of the world is careening toward disorder, and he lacks the leadership strength to contain it.",
