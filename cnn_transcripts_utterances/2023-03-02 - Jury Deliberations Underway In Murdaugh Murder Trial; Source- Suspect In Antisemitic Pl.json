So just imagine the jury, the most important people in the courtroom at this time that now have to digest all that information that's been given through the last six weeks. So, a major reason why a judge doesn't allow a jury to take notes is because they want the jury to focus on the witnesses, focus on their demeanor, focus on what is being said and how it's being said because they are the judges of the facts, and they are to deliberate as to the credibility and believability of each of these witnesses.

It's a crisis. It's a crisis nationwide.So from the defense perspective, raising the specter that his opioid addiction could have led him to act irrationally and that he lied and was paranoid, this is something they believe will resonate with one or two jurors who have perhaps had personal experience either with themselves or a loved one or friend with opioid abuse. However, I say it's a slippery slope because on the flip side you're talking about somebody acting rationally, act reasonably and the defense was saying Alex Murdaugh was not able to do that. He was paranoid. That's why he lied so long. And so, doesn't that equate -- take it a step further -- doesn't that equate to couldn't he have acted in other ways that are out of character for him, i.e., killing his family? So, I'm not sure that the drug addiction argument really moves the needle either way because it has a positive and negative effect for the defense in the context of how the jury takes in that information and digests it and ultimately comes to a conclusion.",

But you know, the way they portray it, it will be one out of 50 commentators, and then they'll put some other lie up against them and do he said she said. They never do it fairly.I don't have a problem if people want to go on, but they're way beyond that. They're way beyond even -- they're even what the chickens came home to roost. It was very good you brought that quote up, John. They said favor the 22 Republicans. That doesn't mean lying. That doesn't mean deliberately distorting the truth, especially when it's so near and dear to our democracy. You know, I feel this passionately. This is not a political thing, it's something that I feel, I love this democracy. We line up every November for 200 years and change. We go vote and the next day everyone abided by the election, whether we won or lost. Even remember Bush v. Gore. And now, all of a sudden, you have this network spreading the lies, doing it very effectively, and making a third of the people, two- thirds of the Republican Party believe this democracy ain't on the level. You know, when you study dictatorship, this is the beginning of the end. I don't think it will be that year because the American roots of democracy are strong, but I worry about it, and there's a demand to push back.",

We know how horrible default would be.So the onus is on Kevin McCarthy. He says he wants cuts. Tell us what the cuts are. Leader McCarthy, we need to see your plan. Where is your plan? You say you want cuts, you have an obligation to show it. And you know why he hasn't done it, John? I don't think he can pass anything in his caucus, so he's trying to deflect by saying let's negotiate, the president met with him once and said what I'm telling you, we need to see your plan. He said it at our caucus lunch today, we're waiting to see their plan. If they can't come up with a plan, let them join us what we did under three presidents, twice under Donald Trump, once under Joe Biden in a bipartisan way and passed and raised the debt ceiling, debts we've already incurred, a lot of them incurred by Republican votes, a lot of them incurred by Donald Trump, but just raise that debt ceiling without brinksmanship, without the risk of the terror of default.",

She told me she is all for it but she also left an owning for him should he decide against a run, saying that they would be there to support him if he decides to do something else.Now, we also pressed her on questions relating to the president's age. Of course he is 80 years old now. He would be 82 if he wins re- election and is inaugurated. And that's a concern that some voters have heading into this next election. She pushed back on those concerns that people have.
