      "sentences": "Well, there's a few things they wanted to accomplish, Sara. One is that it's been no secret that Donald Trump has been eager to steal the spotlight back from Harris' campaign. We've been reporting, and you and I have been talking about this, that he's been frustrated over the last several weeks with the amount of enthusiasm he's seen Harris enjoy, and that it's been sustained longer than I think the campaign had anticipated. So, that was one - a part of this.The other part, of course, is this was Donald Trump's triumphant return to X. He was initially banned in the aftermath of January 6th. Elon Musk was the one who reinstated Donald Trump's Twitter account once he took over. But this was really Donald Trump's first foray back onto the website. And I'm told part of that is they are trying as hard as they can to attract all different voters. And X is one way to further amplify his message ahead of November. And you could see him trying to court this part of the internet. And then, of course, he's also been fostering this relationship with Elon Musk, who recently endorsed him. He's one of the wealthiest people in the world. And so, there's benefits to that as well. And what we really saw happen last night in this conversation was the two of them bro out. You know, we -- I talked to many people on Donald Trump's campaign, but also many of his allies, and they said, this is what Donald Trump sounds like when you're having a phone conversation with him. It was very clear that he was comfortable. It was a casual setting. I mean it was two hours long, so a very long phone conversation if we're going to relate it to that. But they talked about a number of things. The only thing that I found - you know, my big takeaway was that, we didn't learn anything new. I think that they were billing this as, you know, some sort of, you know, once in a lifetime conversation, something that could make a lot of news. Donald Trump didn't make news. Instead, he aired a lot of the same grievances and attacks that we've heard him make repeatedly on the campaign trail. He went after Harris. He criticized her on the border. He called her not that smart. He also attacked Joe Biden frequently, even though Biden is no longer his opponent. I want you to take a listen to just a little bit of what he said.

But the big one is that, you know, when I've been reporting this out, it's clear that regardless of Donald Trump saying on the campaign trail that he thinks Harris might be easier to beat, there's no question that Donald Trump has been repeatedly frustrated with this change with the top of the ticket, that Joe Biden is no longer the one he is facing off with.And we heard some of that come out last night. But I think major takeaways from my point of view is we really didn't learn anything new. Musk through softball questions at him, even at some points tried to guide him toward answering certain campaign lines. And Donald Trump, instead, went on and talked about the same grievances we've all heard. So, not much new, but we definitely got a glimpse into the relationship between these two men.",

Not a hard-hitting interview, but as Trump made the point to say he is doing interviews, Kamala Harris has not yet. Do you think that is becoming a problem for everyone's - for you all supporting Kamala Harris in that it's not just a scheduling issue? GOV. PHIL MURPHY (D-NJ): You won't be surprised to hear, I had no time for the Musk-Trump interviews. So, I can't comment on any content. But, no, not at all. I think she's had an extraordinary several weeks. Tim Walz is an inspired pick. She's on a roll. She is - as he has said, she's brought joy back into the whole arena of politics. There'll be plenty of time to do interviews. And God knows one thing about last night, without having heard it, that was no interview.

Here we go.No, the new poll - I do want to ask you about the new polling out of \"The New York Times\" in the Siena College. It shows that there is momentum behind the Harris campaign right now. This poll also shows the voters in battlegrounds still rank the economy, abortion, immigration as top issues, and that Donald Trump still leads on the economy and immigration in these key states. Despite any data that has been put out there by Biden before Harris and now it would be coming from Harris and this administration, at this point can Kamala Harris say anything to make people feel differently about their economy because this is a big problem for the Harris campaign.",

I think the \"Financial Times\" had her slightly ahead, and for good reason. She stands, as does Tim, for middle-class out, bottom up, believing in capitalism, period, full stop, but also believing that government can help at the edges. Whether its Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security. It can cushion what can sometimes be the brutal impacts of capitalism.Kamala Harris and Tim Walz believe that with all of their hearts. They've proven it and they will continue to prove it. And I think with the benefit of time over the next several months, I think you're going to see them prosecutor a very compelling case on the economy. That's not to say that they will ignore the hurt out there because the hurt is real. Inflation has been real. It's coming down. It's going in the right direction. But there's also the reality that stuff still costs more than people feel like it should. And so I think the message they will deliver is, the economy is better in our hands. It's a pair of safe hands. The one thing you don't want if you're at the kitchen table or at the boardroom table is uncertainty or volatility. The other guys will bring you plenty of that. The Harris-Walz ticket will bring you a safe pair of hands, stability, exactly what America's kitchen table needs.",

Is this the record of a guy who believes government can play a role, particularly to cushion, as I mentioned, the bad side of capitalism? You betcha. But Minnesota has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire United States of America. That's not by accident. That's because of policies and laws that Tim Walz has led and signed.

And that's why there have been so many concerns about what weapons systems are supplied to Ukraine and what Ukraine can do with those weapon systems.As you know, one of the restrictions has been, don't strike inside Russian territory, for instance, with long-range HIMARS or other missiles that have been supplied by NATO and its allies. Now, other NATO allies, they've been fine with it. The U.S. has been particularly trepidatious. So, now you have a large cross-border incursion on the ground by Ukrainian forces. It's not clear that U.S. supplied weapons have been central to this effort here, but there's no question that Putin will attempt to pin this, of course, on Ukraine's supporters, so there is that risk. On the flip side I will say, I don't know anyone who is upset by this, right, because, listen, Ukraine has been getting pummeled, particularly in the eastern front. The losses have been enormous. Russia has been making some incremental ground gains there. And if you and I were talking two weeks ago, the read from inside the Pentagon would have been, we don't see this front changing really at all for the foreseeable future. But the front has changed. And you have Ukrainian forces now inside Russia. And I spoke to a Ukrainian official yesterday who said, this is clearly no longer a raid, like a quick jump across the border and back. They're going to be there for some time. It doesn't mean they're there forever. Perhaps it is, as Putin says, a gambit to provide some leverage. But also it is certainly intended to show force to demoralize Russia and to draw some forces from elsewhere on the front.",
