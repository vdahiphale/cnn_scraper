We begin with the aftermath of Russia's short lived armed rebellion and growing questions about Vladimir Putin's absolute grip on power. Calm appears to return to Moscow this Monday for an open military rebellion as Wagner group mercenaries marched on the Capitol.The uprising, though came to a sudden end Saturday, after an 11th hour deal brokered by Belarus. And since then, there has been no sign of Wagner group head Yevgeny Prigozhin. His news service tells CNN he will answer questions when he has proper communication. One thing though, is clear. This insurrection marks the most profound threat we've seen to Putin's 23-year-long rule. And the U.S. Secretary of State says the turmoil may not be over yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It's too soon to tell exactly where this is going to go. And I suspect that this is a moving picture. And we haven't seen the last act yet. But we can say this. First of all, what we've seen is extraordinary. And I think you've seen cracks emerge that that weren't there before. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: The Military revolt lasted less than 24 hours but it was long enough to bring into question Vladimir Putin's aura of invincibility and stability. Damage to his self-proclaimed reputation as a leader who never forgets a slide, never tolerates disloyalty. CNN Senior International Correspondent Ivan Watson reports on how those crucial hours played out from beginning to end. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One of the things, of course, that we've heard from the Kremlin is that they say that the fighters for Wagner, because of their military achievements on the battlefield, will be able to apply to join the Russian Military.That's something that's been in the cards for a while. There was a decree by the Russian Defense Minister a couple of weeks ago, where he said that all of the private Military companies needed to have contracts with the Russian army if they wanted to operate in the future. Now, Yevgeny Prigozhin of the Wagner private military company had always said if they were not going to do that, and that was of course, also one of the things that escalated the feud between progression and the Russian military leadership. But all this is about a lot more than that. The private military company Wagner is one thing but Yevgeny Prigozhin owns a lot more than that. He has media holdings, so like, for instance, the Internet Research Agency, which the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election, Prigozhin was indicted for that. What happens to his media empire? Then, of course, there's all his dealings in the Middle East. Oil fields in Syria in Africa, exploiting things like gold and diamonds also training local forces there. So there are definitely still a lot of questions about whether or not Yevgeny Prigozhin, when he goes to exile in Belarus will retain any sort of control over that, or if other solutions will be found by the Russian leadership.
