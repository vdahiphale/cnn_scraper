The besieged city in Eastern Ukraine has been seeing heavy fighting for months now.And now the Wagner paramilitary group says a body has been found with U.S. identification documents. The State Department says it needs additional information and needs that in order to determine what happened here. We are hearing from the Ukrainian air defense saying that it has staved off a major aerial Russian attack. But the air defenses made by the Western world took out the Russian weapons. Nic Robertson is joining us from Eastern Ukraine. Is there any evidence suggesting that an American has died now in this war, this late in this war?",

The evidence put forward by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner boss.It is hard to take at face value because he is known for fabrication and propaganda, so difficult to know if what he is saying is true. He says the American citizen, his body, the troops have died fighting for the Ukrainians in Bakhmut. We know that the fighting is intense. It's going on at the moment. The fighting in the center of the city is some of the worse in terms of casualties for Ukrainians and Russian forces. And Prigozhin is saying that he is going to repatriate the American citizen's body and do it with respect, in a casket with American flag, because he said that the citizen died fighting, which, in his view is an honorable thing to do.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy's office says he has empowered the House's top law enforcement official to work with them on this. And this is coming as we are learning more of the suspect of that brazen attack at Representative Connolly's office. The suspect is 49 and, according to his father, he is schizophrenic and he has not been taking his medication for three months. The representative says the suspect had contacted his office in the past and reached out for help on a particular issue. And the staff said he made some strange statements but never made any threats like yesterday's attack. The congressman was not in the office at the time but said the suspect entered the office filled with out of control rage and demanded to see him. And this is more of what he said.
