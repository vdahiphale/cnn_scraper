It's a lot different when Social Security checks don't go out, when military pay is in jeopardy, because the -- because they're going right up to the line with the debt ceiling. And we've seen this. We've actually seen this play out.Now, the difference is Republicans haven't really ever paid a political price for that because it's always happened at a time when young voters move on. So the question is, is whether they decide that it's worth it to play, to do that kind of performative stuff, even if it doesn't change anything, in order to, you know, look like they're, they're doing something, but having the majority is different than having a governing majority. So we'll have to see, and McCarthy has some really strong personalities already in that caucus, and we'll see who get that.",

We talked earlier about can you make it a choice because he did not give a clear answer about that. And the Rick Scott plan over on the Senate side opens the door to entitlement reforms, which many things would mean cuts.Let's come back to the impeachment question. He says the country doesn't like impeachment for political purposes. That's what Kevin McCarthy says. And that's probably the very smart political thing to say before the election. But we also understand that within his house caucus conference, you have people saying let's -- some say impeach Biden, others say impeach the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas. Marjorie Taylor Greene, among those more restless members of the caucus, in this great new book by Robert Draper says this, I think that to be the best speaker of the House and to please the base, he's going to give me a lot of power, and a lot of leeway. That's interesting. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: I found it very interesting that New York Times Magazine had a long excerpt. And in that excerpt, Marjorie Taylor Greene said things like she's asked to be on the Oversight and the Judiciary Committee, very powerful committees. She said she talked to Donald Trump about possibly being his running mate in 2024. He talked to Kevin McCarthy and that, that she -- that he had actually started bringing her into top level discussions on things like the defense policy bill, the NDAA. So we're talking about an empowered Marjorie Taylor Greene, if Republicans retake control of the House, and again, she has pushed very far right initiatives, she's anti-LGBTQ on trans issues and things like that, impeaching the president. And we know Marjorie Taylor Greene is not the kind of person to fall in line once everything is said and done, you know, she's not going to just go quietly and say, well, you know, now that we're in the majority, maybe I don't want to do that anymore. That just hasn't been what we've seen from her.",

There was a pretty big recession during the Ronald Reagan presidency, Republican presidents serve two terms. He didn't say let's stop the military buildup. Let's go easy on the Soviets. Forget the commies. We're in a recession. We didn't hear that from Ronald Reagan. Kevin McCarthy says I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won't do it. That is a big shift. Adam Kinzinger, one of the Republican members who is retiring, who is not a fan of Kevin McCarthy says what in the absolute bloody hell is happening to GOP leader.DANA BASH, CNN CO-ANCHOR, STATE OF THE UNION: This is, to me one of the more fascinating things that we are going to see if in fact, Republicans take over because the very real divide inside the GOP on the question of foreign policy and particular thing -- all things related to Putin or pick your, you know, your strongman leader out there in the world. The divide has been masked by, understandably, all the focus on the Democrats who are running Washington right now. That mask will be ripped off if the Republicans take the House or even the Senate. But even if it's just the House, you are going to see the older school Republicans, Adam Kinzinger, obviously, is part of that who say fund as much as you can to try to get rid of Putin and those who are following the Tucker Carlson's of the world, who are apologists for Vladimir Putin and even questioning the notion of what's going on in Ukraine.

      "sentences": "Well for those four regions inside Ukraine which Russia has, you know, of course attempted to annex, it means quite a lot. It means that, you know, the civilian authorities and the military authorities will work hand in hand, will be very tight restrictions in those areas that Russia still controls, even as Russian forces are pushed out of those areas, particularly the Kherson region to the south by an offensive by the Ukrainian military.But the other parts of the announcement today are equally important from the Kremlin, because he's imposing tightened security measures on the border areas inside Russia as well, where there'll be much more close military checks, travel restrictions will be in force, there'll be a lot more of a military presence in those border regions, or where there have been an upsurge in attacks emanating from Ukraine over the past couple of weeks and months in particular, but also beyond that further, deeper into the country as well. Regional governors are being given on undefined powers to impose certain restrictions, including increased checks of individuals in the country as well. The Moscow mayor, for instance, it falls under this area says it's not going to interrupt the rhythm of normal life in the country. But that's altogether not clear. And I think what this is doing is really showing, you know, the country that Vladimir Putin is not backing down, he's doubling down, he's not apologizing for the setbacks that have taken place inside Ukraine. Instead, he's like really sort of positioning the authorities to have a much tighter grip, much greater control on the country as he moves deeper into what he calls his special military operation.

Matthew, thank you very much.Back home now, two important data points from the frontlines of the migrant crisis here in the United States. New York City opening Emergency Relief Center for asylum seekers at Randall's Island, some 20,000 Migrants have arrived in New York, and the city declared a state of emergency. We're also now learning the White House asked one city, El Paso, to not make an emergency declaration of its own. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is here to walk us through this important story. The New York City Mayor said we have a crisis declares a state of emergency. El Paso was on the verge and what happened?",

To rewind here, El Paso mayor had said late last month in a public meeting that the White House and asked him to hold off but he supported that. He didn't believe that they needed to declare a state of emergency at that time.And we asked the White House about those discussions. They -- an official told us that they did happen, there was no requests made and that they would continue to stand by El Paso. Now, John, to be clear here, it is not unusual for the federal government and border cities to be in touch, especially when there's an influx of migrants. And that is what's happening in El Paso. Now we've seen thousands of Venezuelan migrants crossing into that city and straining their resources. And the mayor told us in a statement that he quote, doesn't bow to pressure and went on to say that it is quote, critical to work not only with the federal government, but with regional elected leaders and multiple partners when facing what he called a humanitarian crisis of this level. Now, we should also note the administration did say last week, they're going to start turning Venezuelans back into Mexico. They expect that to drive down the numbers. And the city officials have also noticed that numbers have subsided and they don't need to declare a state of emergency at this time.",

That's our clarification there.So help me, we're 20 days out. You can find a lot of conflicting data points, although in the last several days, when you look at polls, you do see at least most of the trends shifting toward a more favorable climate for the Republicans. The New York Times/Siena College Poll, one of the top issues, the economy 26 percent inflation, 18 percent abortion, 5 percent well behind it right there. If you look at it from that perspective, Margie, what we saw as Democratic momentum right after the Dobbs decision in July, in August seems to have faded some, fair?",

And you see there, the Democrats are having more money promised, but if you will, in Georgia, in Pennsylvania, and in Nevada, but in the Pennsylvania Senate race to Margie's point, Republicans up to this point about spent the Democrat by $14 million, 107 million to $67 million.So how much can you use T.V. ad spending to bend what people, you know, if people might answer the poll, I care about this, then you as a strategist say, well, that's changed their mind?",

Donald Trump made gains among Latino voters, particularly men, in the 2020 election. The question is, you know, was that an aberration?

And so as a result, Republicans have an opportunity to talk to voters who may in previous cycles have said no way this -- that party is not for me.Now, do I think Republicans are going to win Latino voters outright, nationally? No, I don't think so. But do I think they can do better than they have done in previous cycles? Absolutely.

And so Latino voters, disproportionately vote Democratic. But that margin, according to a lot of national polls has been shrinking a little bit. That means they're both a GOTV get out the vote turnout audience and a persuasion audience. You need to make the case not as well as boosting enthusiasm and motivation and making sure people made a plan to vote and so on.And so that means talking about a variety of issues.
