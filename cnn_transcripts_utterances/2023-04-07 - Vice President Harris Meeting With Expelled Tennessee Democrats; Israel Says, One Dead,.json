We will have details on her meeting and the vice president's message.Also tonight, Israel reeling from an apparent terror attack, killing at least one person and wounding six in Tel Aviv. There are new fears right now that the conflict could escalate and spread. CNN is on the ground in the Middle East as violence in the region heats up. And Justice Clarence Thomas firing back, claiming his luxurious vacations with a conservative mega donor were personal hospitality. But even some Republican judges aren't buying his explanation. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin our coverage tonight in Tennessee, where Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting with two Democratic lawmakers who were expelled from the statehouse by Republicans. CNN's Gary Tuchman is on the scene in Nashville. Gary, this is a major show of support by the vice president, a chance to reiterate the Biden administration's calls for gun control. What is the latest in Nashville?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Alex. This is a local political story that has gone extremely national, last-minute visit here in Nashville, Tennessee, by the Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris. She arrived at the Nashville airport a short time ago, and she is now attending a meeting at Fisk University, which is an historically black liberal arts college.He did invite the two legislators who were expelled from the state legislature yesterday after last week protesting against the wishes of the Republican majority. They violated rules, the Republicans said, and they decided to expel those two state legislators. So, she'll be meeting with them, but she's also invited every Democratic state legislators here in the state of Tennessee over at Fisk University. It is expected that she will call for an assault- style weapons ban during this meeting with state legislators. Now, there's a very interesting component to the story. The names of the two members of the House of Representatives here in Tennessee who were expelled are Justin Jones and Justin Pearson. Under Tennessee state law, the counties that they represent in the state legislature have to have a meeting. And in that meeting, they will appoint a temporary House of Representative member to represent their county. So, what we know about this Monday? Is that here in Nashville, Davidson County, there's one metropolitan government entity for this city and this county, they have announced they are going to have a meeting this Monday where they will vote on who should temporarily represent them in the state capital until a special election is held, and it's very possible that the person they vote on will be Justin Jones. So, what will happen if these two legislators get voted to come back? We'll have to wait and see what happens at that point. One other thing I want to tell you, Alex, is that on Monday, there will be a protest held here on the very ground I'm standing on. It's expected that hundreds of people will come out with the two legislators who have been expelled and are no longer officially legislative. Alex?",

And I think it underscores the White House officials' view right now, as both a very organic moment. There's no planning behind what's happened here, and it was driven almost entirely by the actions of the Republican supermajority, but also a moment where both the lawmakers that were expelled on the issue of gun reform, which the administration has long pushed for, but also for the young protesters that have been out there by the thousands day after day after day and just saw two lawmakers expelled with very little precedent. All of those are issues that the vice president is expected to touch on, try and elevate and try and maintain system to some degree a level of momentum. They recognize that this moment has really kind of come out of nowhere. And I think, as you heard from the two lawmakers who were expelled last night, they plan to leverage this moment, both on their push when it comes to gun restrictions but also from a political perspective as they try and continue outreach to younger voters, keep them engaged at a moment that I don't think anybody expected a week ago, certainly not the people here in the White House, but one that they recognized the importance of and recognize, as Gary put it, just how much this became something everyone in the nation was paying attention to over the course of the last several days.",

They don't come out to the ballot box. Well, we are starting to see that changing the 2020, two election, in those midterms, they played a key role.

In fact, you can see right now, as we're filming, that that car is actually being removed right now. It was here for a very long time. The investigators obviously have been doing their work. But you can see the car is absolutely total. Now, one person was killed in this attack. That person is an Italian tourists who is 30 years old, the authorities have said here. Now, in fact, they have said that all the people who were killed in this attack were tourists. And you can see right here that the investigators are still doing their work. They're still collecting evidence. They've been out here the entire evening really doing a lot of very difficult work here, trying to piece together what exactly happened. But as you can imagine, this is something that definitely since chills down the spines of many people, not just here and Tel Aviv but here in Israel, in general. And the prime minister of this country, Benjamin Netanyahu, he has tonight called up more reserves even then before, from the border guards and also from the Israel Defense Forces, as well, because of what he calls a spate of terror attacks that have been going on. In fact, earlier today, what happened was that two people were killed. Two women were killed when their car came under fire. The Israeli authorities say that car then crashed, the woman who was driving that car was actually the mother of the two who were killed inside. She was also severely wounded.

Prayer has been banned up there for Jews since 1967. But recently, there's been a relaxation of that.So, they started, they moved into the mosque and stayed overnight with rockets and other -- sorry, with rocks and other things, and the Israeli police, therefore, moved in to try to stop, break them up so they wouldn't attack the Jews, as they came up to pray the next morning.

And so they're playing this by the book.What it does, though, though, is show that if there was any hope that the Russians would reconsider what they're doing and perhaps pull back on this process, then that's not going to happen. They seem to be proceeding with it apace, or whatever that means, because I think this is going to be a very long, drawn out bureaucratic process. He has been remanded in the Lefortovo Prison until May the 29th while the authorities build their case. The details of that case have not been made public because it's been designated top secret, but it could extend beyond that. If the authorities need more time, they'll ask for it and that they're likely to get it. And so, you know, it looks like it's going to be, as I say, the start of a very long, drawn out process.

We could have gotten more folks out. All that is true, and they admitted as much in some of these reports.But what is also true is it was absolutely the right move the pull out and end our war. It was an unwinnable war. It was untenable. The Biden administration inherited an agreement that was negotiated in the dark by the Trump administration. They started to pull down under the Trump administration. There weren't enough troops in country to withstand the Taliban offensive that was going to come after the lapse of that deal.

There are states where it would not right now be subject to any sorts of laws restricting abortion, and yet the dispensing of this particular medication would be impacted. Now, there are some practical alternatives. There's a second drug, which doesn't seem to be the focus of the preliminary injunction, but this is one of the dangers of these sorts of nationwide rulings that a single judge can do. On the substantive part of it, you know, I have to say that it seems like there's a lot of grounds for appeal. It's a very weak type of argument. The plaintiffs are really cleaning standing on behalf of doctors. This isn't like patients being harmed if the doctor is saying that resources would be diverted. So, I think the Justice Department will have some very good grounds for appeal, and I'm sure they will. But one thing we have to be mindful of, of course, is at its heart, this is a question of deference to agency expertise. I mean, this unprecedented. The judge would overrule the FDA's expertise on this. But one of the dangers as it goes up the chain potentially to the Supreme Court is that the Supreme Court has not shown recently much deference towards agency expertise. So, that's on the horizon here.",

So, what do you think the thrust of their appeal is going to be?WU (voice over):  I think it'll be -- well, it will be a repeat of the arguments we've seen. I think they're going to talk about the standing issue. I think they're going to talk about the fact that the FDA properly went through the procedures to test the safety of this drug, which was extensively tested. But, crucially, for this posture, legally, it's a preliminary injunction. It's different than going through a whole trial. And the showing has to be pretty hard. It's a high bar to have won the preliminary injunction. And part of that bar is you have to show two things, basically, one irreparable harm, and, two, likelihood of success on the merits. I think DOJ has strong arguments on both points. I mean, the irreparable harm, again, would be to these doctors, not to patients being harmed. And, secondly, on the likelihood of success after a trial, I think that's pretty open to argument here given that you would have to overcome the work that the expert agency has already done on this.",

The judge said that the FDA had entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem by omitting any evaluation of the psychological effects of the drug or an evaluation of long term medical consequences of the drug. This is -- this is from Judge Kacsmaryk, Alex. Considering the intense psychological trauma and post traumatic stress women often experience from chemical abortion, this failure should not be overlooked or understated. He also was critical that the drug was not tested for underage girls under 18, critical the entire time of just how the FDA had conducted its process, and you can see the kinds of things that he's homing in on. And I have to say, Alex, we are on a fast track to the Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs back in June, it suggested the majority said, you know, leave it to the states and elected legislators. But this is exhibit A for the fact that it's still very much into the hands of judges, and this single judge has made this ruling tonight that is going to have reverberations nationwide -- Alex.",

And what we just saw, for example, earlier this week is that a liberal candidate and a pivotal race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, it was a race that centered on abortion rights and this liberal candidate won because people in the state of Wisconsin were upset about what the Supreme Court had done.",

There has been some expectation that if this came, they believed they would win in the end, but I think when you talk to officials, if Dobbs -- and the leak of Dobbs and the eventual Dobbs decision was an earthquake, there has been a very clear recognition from very early on, certainly on the advocacy side, but also inside the White House, where they have been having regular meetings on these issues with their team for weeks and weeks and weeks. The vice president has been deeply involved. Jen Klein, who is a senior advisor over here at the White House, has been deeply involved. That if it was an earthquake, the aftershocks we're going to continue, there would be significant and they would come very quickly, and I think that's what you've seen here. There's no question about that. And what White House officials have been grappling with is advocates who want them to do more or pushing for them to do more. Some Democratic attorneys general on this issue of specifically have been pushing to do more, while the White House tries to stay within the legal bounds of things and also try and maintain how they are going to actually address these issues when they come from on the legal side of things. That moment has come on this issue. They have made very clear. They don't believe this case has merit. They don't believe this pill is any danger at all because of the last two decades that it's been on the market, but they are very aware that this could come and now has come and we expect the swift appeal.",

But I actually think, Alex, that this ruling will not stand when all is said and done because -- for a couple of reasons. First of all, there were some hints in some of the opinions that came out last June about kind of the limits of the ruling by Justice Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts.And I think they anticipated challenges down the road and wanted to say, you know, we are willing -- the majority was willing to go so far, but maybe they wouldn't have five votes to say even states that would allow abortion will have it shut off because of the complete erasure of medication abortion possibilities. I actually don't think the Supreme Court will go that far. So what's going to happen is probably we're going to see a pretty swift appeal. I can't predict what the Fifth Circuit will do. Some will depend on you know just exactly what happens there. The panel that's drawn even though as I said, Alex, earlier it is conservative. But I think what you see in this ruling tonight is the outer boundary of consideration of the FDA process here. I don't think you could have gotten any more conservative than what Judge Kacsmaryk ruled tonight. You know, just from our first blush rural reading of all this and what he has said previously I think this will be the outer pool, and then we'll probably see a greater chance as we go along for the Department of Justice to prevail.",

And so, this would if it goes through, would get rid of that because of the opinion of one judge.So women really rely on this. They rely on this when they have miscarriages. They rely on this when they have abortions because they have a fetus who is not -- is non viable. They rely on this for all sorts of reasons, and they wouldn't be able to do that. And so we can think about is sort of that's the -- that could be the short term impact if this goes through. And I want to talk about the safety of this drug. Mifepristone has five deaths per million users. You know, all drugs have side effects, five deaths per million users. Penicillin has 20. Viagra has 49. So if this judge is so concerned about side effects, why isn't he saying let's take penicillin off the market? Why isn't he saying let's take Viagra off the market? And this is why my decisions are not made by judges, medical and drug decisions are made by doctors and scientists, like teams of them at the FDA. So when we look long term, there's something else I want to point out, which is that if this goes through, I imagine this decision has made pharmaceutical companies very nervous because they really going to develop the drugs that we need if one judge can justify that it needs to come off the market. There needs to be confidence in the FDA process, so the drug companies can make the drugs that we need and develop the drugs that we need. If they -- if they think they're just one judge can take that drug off the market, they may not be willing to invest that kind of money.",
