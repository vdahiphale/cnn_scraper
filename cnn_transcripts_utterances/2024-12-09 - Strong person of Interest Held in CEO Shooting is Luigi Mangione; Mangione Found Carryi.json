      "sentences": "It set off the chain of events where the person luckily called 911 and the local Altoona police responded. But from everything that we've been told and from this press conference, the police have a lot of evidence at this point. They have the fake id, the New Jersey fake ID that he used to check into the hostel, the same -- the very same hostel he's caught on camera without the mask.The other thing is there were other of fake identifications on there on him. They also say that they recovered the mask, the mask presumably that he was seen in video with. And so, they'll be able to obviously use that. So they have a lot of evidence. They still have to go through a lot of other information to link him directly to the crime. But it sounds like that process is underway. The other thing the chief said was that he was carrying his U.S. passport, but there's no indication that he was planning on leaving the country. So, that is one way that they were able to officially, officially identify him, despite the fact that he was carrying all of those fake IDs. And the other thing I want to talk about is obviously this manifesto and what it says there and the things that he's writing about. And one of the questions, because this was a targeted murder, an alleged murder of a CEO, and also because there could be some anti-corporate writings, it's reasonable to see if the FBI or the U.S. attorney's office here would in any way get involved in this. And perhaps not only would he face murder charges, there would be other charges as well. But that's still all to be determined. And then lastly, as you pointed out, this manifesto, the police chief here, the chief of detectives said that he described it as a manifesto and it describes perhaps allegedly and gives them some indication as to motive and other information. And they are also investigating other writings that were found online and so forth. So there's a deep, deep investigation underway that's now going to probably stress from -- go from New York City. He has connections to Pennsylvania, he has connections to Maryland, but interestingly enough, his last known address is in Honolulu, in Hawaii. So officials probably are going to have to make their way out there to conduct this investigation as well. So a lot of information, certainly we wait for word on the charges and the direct link of this -- direct link of this person of interest to the crime. But I suspect that will come soon here, guys.",

He starts off basically saying, I don't want to cause any trauma, but it had to be done.So a second page really kind of goes into problems with the health industry. He raises the question, you know, why do we have the most expensive healthcare in the world, but we're 42 -- rated 42 in life expectancy around the world? I can't vet his facts or findings there, but it was talking about the healthcare industry and the need for violence. I mean, especially when you talk about, you know, the opening, which is that it had to be done, these parasites, you know, had it coming. That does kind of fit in what they're talking about. What do we know about this individual? Mr. Mangione is an engineer. He grew up in Tosin, Maryland. He's 26 years old. He graduated U Penn in 2020 and then went on to a master's program where he got that master's degree in engineering. And he has addresses, as Shimon said, in Tosin, where he grew up in Philadelphia, where he went to school, and Honolulu, which we're still looking into.

What we saw is someone eating at a McDonald's who then had the police called on him and apparently taken into custody without incident.And, you know, it's so interesting. You know, John and I have been covering this. You know, there was this consensus in looking at that initial surveillance video from outside that hotel that police weren't dealing with Carlos the Jackal here. I mean, you look at everything from his stance in holding that gun to the type of gun itself, to the mistakes that he had made, apparently leaving behind a water bottle and a burner phone. And so this, you know, this was a sophisticated job in the sense that it appeared to be planned and then executed. And then he was able to successfully flee and, you know, escape arrest for several days. But when you look at all of that material with him on his person, whenever he is actually taken into custody, someone who had the wherewithal to plan all of this and then to escape, several law enforcement agencies would have had to have known that having all of that on his person would implicate him in this crime. As you mentioned, you have the fake ID, an ID that was matching the fake ID he used to check into that hostel. You have the mask that he had that was on these images that have been seen now around the world, and specifically the firearm itself. All of those items could have been ditched along the way as he was trying to escape, but he had them on his person. Of course, you know, we can get into the firearms forensics if you'd like to see how, you know, how that would actually play a key role here. But when you look finally at the manifesto that you have to raise the question, is this someone who expected to be caught and didn't mind being caught eventually, particularly if he is someone who was railing against the industry in which this murder victim had worked. To have all that material on you and then to have essentially the motive, you know, laying out the motive in these documents for police to find Everyone, you know, any good attorney will tell you that the best way to escape any type of serious charge such as murder is to create reasonable doubt. To have no evidence on your person, to try to fight every accusation that comes your way that much, much harder when you have all of that with you as you're taken into custody.",

And on Friday, you talked about how critical DNA evidence would not -- would be, not necessarily in identifying a suspect, but tying them to the crime. And in hearing about some of these details, specifically about the water bottle that was left behind and a partial fingerprint that was on that water bottle. I'm curious, how significant a piece of evidence would that be in a future prosecution?",

The weapon, like the other person mentioned before, we can link it to the bullets because usually the barrel will have rifling. I know this is a ghost gun, hopefully it still produces the same marks on the ammunition.

Obviously, in a lot of cases, forensic experts will look at a firearm and doing an analysis of the sort of grooves that are on the bullet, the impression that is left on a bullet.

And we know that the bullet shell casings obviously recovered from the scene of the crime that could be tested. The fact that we didn't hear of any matches to past crimes tells us that, you know, this is something that he may have, you know, procured maybe recently, maybe he put it together himself and maybe he's never used it before in the commission of a crime that was known to law enforcement. But it is still a critical piece of evidence.Because as you mentioned, when you look at firearm testing, it's very much like a fingerprint. Whenever a projectile leaves the end of that gun, there are unique markings. You could see here. These are images of when I went inside the ATF lab to show this kind of testing. So they would take this gun into one of these facilities. They actually do a test to capture the bullet that is fired, but also the shell casing that gets ejected. And then they essentially take it under a microscope and actually look for those unique patterns. Whenever the shell casing makes contact with that gun, there are unique markings that law enforcement can look at. And what they're trying to do is see, is there a match? When you look at the shell casing at the scene, you look at those bullets and you compare that with what was tested. All they're trying to do here is to match was the gun found on this individual actually similar in nature to the characteristics of the rounds of ammunition left behind at the scene? And because of the unique nature of that testing, as I mentioned, somewhat like a fingerprint. That could be very strong evidence.",

You know, the monopoly money. This guy, I think your guess are right. He wanted to be captured eventually. Maybe he was just tired of hiding and running. He wants his statement out there. He wants his story out there. He wants some kind of justification. And, you know, given the events that happened the past few days, he might get some sympathy from the public. We've seen some people defending this suspect. So it's going to be very telling what he does once inside the detective squad.",

So that would have to be, you know, logged in and vouchered into the records of the Altoona PD and at some point turned over to the NYPD. Including the copy of that manifesto, which, of course, you want to protect by, you know, bagging it and making sure that no one else is handling it, because you're going to want to -- you're going to want to go over that for handwriting, his DNA, fingerprints, who else may have handled it, and so on.But all of that evidence will be logged in there, where they seized it and then transferred to New York for those charges. Once they deal with what they're going to do with the local charges, which really have the effect of being a holding charge for him, you could have that Manhattan District Attorney's case charging him with, beyond being a person of interest to being charged with murder in the second degree in New York. But you also could have a federal case where he is charged with crossing multiple state lines with the intent to commit a felony, to wit, the murder in New York City, which would involve the FBI and the U.S. Attorney. So there's a lot that could come into play here, but the main thing at play right now is state charges of homicide in New York, which can only be drawn up after they learn what they need to learn today.

And we will wait to see if that changes.But to Josh's point, about all these different places that police are going to go, are you surprised as you know, someone who recently, you know, last known location, Hawaii, obviously went through, by your reporting these academic programs at Penn, you would think he would have been around a bunch of people.

And think about it, Brianna, who recognized him, was it his best friend, was it his ex-girlfriend, was it his college professor? No, it was a complete and total stranger in McDonald's.So that tells us something that we've seen before in the Boston Marathon bombing case, in some of these other cases where in the case where the individual, Frank James, shot 10 people on the New York subway. When I was with the police department, we put his picture all over the place. And people who knew him didn't call in and say that's who he is. But people on the street recognized him. So that's why this crowd sourcing thing is so important. You've got to blast it out in every direction because you may get the people who know him. You may get people who know him who don't want to report him. You may get a total stranger who recognizes him on a hunch because they saw those photos and they say that looks like the same guy, maybe the same jacket. Why is he wearing a mask still if that was the case? But that's what you're trying to do, reach as many people as possible. And when they reframed it last week saying, we want people beyond New York City to be looking for this person because we don't think he's here right now, we think he's somewhere else.

Josh, I think especially in light of all of the speculation about what drew this individual who killed Brian Thompson to go forward with this, there's been a broader conversation about whether CEOs, higher ups in companies, corporations that may at times have negative interactions with people in the public, what they need to be taking away from this when it comes to security.",
