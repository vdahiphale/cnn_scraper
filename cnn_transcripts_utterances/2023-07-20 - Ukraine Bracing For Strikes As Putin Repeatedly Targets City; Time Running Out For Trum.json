Trump's legal team saying the former has just hours to respond to the special counsel as a Trump aide testifies before the grand jury today for a third time, three times. And just in, investigators think the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer may have committed the murders in his own home. This comes as the suspect's wife breaks her silence.

It is now just after 2:00 a.m. on Friday morning. The past three nights, like clockwork, air sirens started blasting right at this time followed by a barrage of Russian missile strikes and it's just a bit of what we've seen and shared with you. Monday evening, 6:55 p.m. Eastern Time, nearly 2:00 a.m. in Ukraine, you see the fireball streaking across the sky in Odesa. The following day, Tuesday, 7:09 p.m. Eastern Time, again at the start of this program, Alex Marquardt and his team again were there. You hear it capturing this incredible moment on camera. That there what they were looking at was a missile defense system for Ukraine at work against the Russian missiles. Then it happened again last night, 7:13 p.m. Eastern Time, the sound of explosions could be heard. Again, Ukraine using air defenses to stop cruise missiles. In fact, as of now and it's 2:01 a.m. in Ukraine. Ukraine's president says Russia used 70 missiles and 90 drones over the past four days. And in Odesa, which has come under the heaviest assault, Ukraine's military was able to intercept the fraction of the missiles last night. In fact, the numbers that have that they had destroyed only five of the 19 missiles fired at that crucial port city according to the Ukrainian air force. It's a city of a million people. Now, we spoke to retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling about this and he said that's the strategy. He says Russia is firing off as many weapons as it can to test, to see how much air defense Ukraine's cities have, right? And, obviously, it helps them ascertain where the Patriot batteries, for example, placed. On Russian state television, Putin's propagandists looking at that ratio and celebrating. (BEGIN VDIEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The same thing that happened at night in Odesa, this is their direct merit, very serious. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  This is called the escalation spiral. You hit us, we hit you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  This is war. This is how it should be.

They traveled up to New York, sat down with him over the course of two mornings, but we know the former president received a target letter on Sunday. That typically means an indictment is imminent. He was given, as you noted, until today to go before the grand jury. We don't expect he's going to do that. We also, though, don't expect he's going to give them a formal notice that he won't do it, which leads itself some ambiguity in terms of timing for an indictment, but they can absolutely go ahead and indict the former president or anyone else before they wrap up their work. We know they did this in the Mar-a-Lago investigations. They indicted the former president and his associate Walt Nauta, and then they continued their work. They even sent out another target letter.

I would say it's sort of a halfway interview, Erin, because he came in, he provided some information, but he also made a fair number of privilege assertions, attorney client privilege. The advantage of the special counsel has that a congressional committee does not have is that they can immediately take a privilege claim that they don't credit to the chief judge of the district, who will quickly adjudicate whether or not the privilege claim is or isn't valid. The appeals court will immediately look at that. They have the apparatus, because it's a criminal grand jury, to resolve privilege assertions, and adjudicate them quickly. We did not.

Were you surprised when you saw it? Do you think it applies? HEAPHYmight apply to the core conduct. We looked at the entire federal criminal code, and identified the statutes that we thought were most applicable to the facts that we had developed. The lead counted being obstruction of an initial proceeding, 1512c. I actually think that's a 20-year statutory maximum, although I don't think a statutory maximums really gotten this. I think the special counsel is going to choose the charge, or charges that seems most applicable to the facts and as Ryan said, the 241, the deprivation of civil rights. That punishes people that deprive people of a fundamental civil rights. And the right to vote is one of those rights, the theory here would be that the president, by disrupting the joint session, by attempting to prevent the transfer of power, essentially tried to discount or undercut the will of the people, exercised at the ballot box. And that deprived them of their civil rights. I do think it arguably implies. I do think all of the statutes named in our report, and now in the target letter, and even some others, arguably apply.
