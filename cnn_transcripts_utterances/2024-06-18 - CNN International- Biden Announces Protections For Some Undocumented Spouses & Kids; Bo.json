      "sentences": "Welcome, everyone. It is 8I'm Omar Jimenez. Thank you so much for joining me today in the CNN NEWSROOM. Let's get right to the news. There's a lot of it. First of all, we're going to start at the White House where in just a moment, President Joe Biden is set to unveil a sweeping set of executive actions to shield build some undocumented immigrants from deportation and ease legal pathways to work and live in the U.S. Now, the announcement targets undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have been in the U.S. for over a decade, allowing them to seek permanent residency or citizenship without leaving the country. Now, it also looks to ease the visa process for young immigrants graduating college, including for so-called Dreamers. Those are children brought to the U.S. by their parents. And that's a live look at the White House, where we're going to bring you his remarks, the president's, when they begin. But, first, let's go to CNN's Kevin Liptak, who's also at the White House. Kevin, can you tell us more about what the administration and President Joe Biden is expected to announce today and what the impact is going to be?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's a sweeping set of actions and officials say that it will affect around half a million people. It applies to undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens. You have to have lived in the United States per ten years to apply and you have to have been married by yesterday.And this is a set group of people. You know, it's a contained universe of people who will be affected by this. And I think this can act as sort of a counterbalance for President Biden to some of those tough asylum rules that he signed into effect a couple of weeks ago, essentially shutting the southern border down to asylum seekers. And you do to see in those two things, this balance that President Biden is trying to strike on the most fraught political issue for him, this issue of immigration. After he signed those asylum rules, you did hear from a lot of progressives, a lot of immigration advocates who are worried that he was taking steps that President Trump had taken when he was an office in these -- the steps today I think is his effort to swing the balance in the other direction, to show that he's looking for humane ways to keep families together, to address the large numbers of undocumented immigrants in the United States. And I think you can draw parallels to the executive action that President Obama took in the June of his own reelection year in 2012, the so-called DACA program for the Dreamers, those young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. And in fact, President Biden, this event today is meant to mark the 12th anniversary of that. So there are some parallels there. And the action that President Biden is taken is, in fact, the largest relief program taken by any president since the Dreamer program. So you do see sort of in the universe of all of this, the president really trying to shore up an issue that he is so vulnerable on, and certainly that bears out in polls, you have seen former President Trump really rail against President Biden for the situation on the border, the southern border, and you have seen Republicans say that the actions today amount to amnesty. I think from President Biden's perspective, he certainly does want to show that he's tough on the border. That has been an issue for him. But he also wants to shore up support among progressives and what the White House and what his campaign says this action will do is allow families to stay together and allow for a more humane approach to this issue, Omar.",

You know, Congress has not been able to pass any sort of comprehensive immigration plan for decades, really. President Biden has advocated for some of these things to be written into law, whether it's more security on the southern border or pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are already in the United States.There was a plan about a month or two ago that came together on a bipartisan basis. [15:05:03] But what you saw is President Trump torpedo the bill because he thought that this would be an effective election year cudgel against President Biden. What you're seeing President Biden do is essentially trying to flip the script, regained some of the initiative, pointing to that effort by President Trump and saying, look, I'm doing what I can, but Congress hasn't been able to do anything because they're stymied by Trump and that's exactly what I think you'll hear him say today.",

He's an immigration attorney and partner at Novo Legal group and a DACA recipient himself. We're going to talk about all of that. But I just want to start with what is your reaction to today's expected executive action, both as an immigration attorney and as a Dreamer yourself? LUIS CORTES ROMERO, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY &amp; PARTNER, NOVO LEGAL GROUP: Well, it's certainly a step in the right direction. This is a practical approach that will streamline the process for hundreds of thousands of non-citizens and U.S. citizen spouses in order for them to just finish this process. Like President Biden or the White House has alluded to, these are individuals who are already eligible for legal permanent residency. And this streamlines the process so they can just do a quicker without having to leave the United States and get bogged down with still the backlog of cases and the time it takes for that the process. So it's definitely a step in the right direction. And it also protects certain Dreamers and DACA recipients who have gone to college and have high-skilled jobs for their employers to be able to petition for them, and at least get that process going. But although it's a step in the right direction, it's still leaves a lot of people out, a lot of daca recipients, and a lot of dreamers who didnt get to photo collagen instead joined the workforce or individuals who are not married to us citizens. So while it is a step in the right direction, there's still a lot left to do.",

So, currently, for these individuals and I think we're talking about half a million individuals are going to be impacted by this and we're talking about them in their communities, we're talking about millions of people. Those individuals will have to leave the United States and sometimes just when indeterminate period of time in order to finish their process abroad.Now, the problem with that is, is that now you're dealing with multiple administrative agencies, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, which are already overburdened, still trying to catch up from the COVID delays. And so, the backlog of cases is significant. Taking that step out of it, and individuals without having to leave the United States and just being able to do here significantly cuts on the time that they have to spend abroad and also just the bureaucratic process. And so, it definitely streams lines. The second thing that it does is that it also allows for individuals to obtain a work permit while their cases are pending. But according to the announcement from the White House, they will get work permits for up to three years while there cases are processing. And that's going to significantly help the economy. Those are no more individuals that are able to join the workforce and so, it allows for a temporary reprieve while the cases are pending.",

He's testifying before a Senate subcommittee on investigations about safety lapses that continue to swirl around the world's largest airplane manufacturer. The hearing has been ongoing at this point. And following new claims by a whistleblower alleging the company likely put questionable parts in planes and hit them from regulators. Now, our aviation expert Richard Quest joins me now. All right.

He said MCAS and Boeing were responsible for their deaths, or at least for their -- for those accidents.So he's doing sort of a mea culpa as best he can and saying that Boeing is at fault, Boeing isn't perfect. Boeing needs to change the way it's going about its business. And that's really where we are because it's pretty hard to beat up somebody who's doing the beating up on themselves. And to a large extent, that's where Calhoun has been. He does seem shaken. He does seem to be not on top of the facts in some cases, he didn't know how many whistleblowers. He said he hadn't met any of the whistleblowers. He said he didn't know or didn't -- hadn't seen various documents that were presented to the committee that he then had to admit what gibberish and rubbish.

Toledo was 99 degrees yesterday and I spent five years in Detroit and it doesn't get 99 degrees up there. I mean, you have Lake Erie right there, right? I mean, so here you go. Mansfield was 94. It's the heatwave, 150 more record high temperature is going to be broken all the way through Vermont, New Hampshire, all the way even into Maine. Temperatures in Maine could exceed 100 degrees. And if you've ever watched the Maine property masters, they never installed air conditioners because they don't need them up there. But this week they do. Temperatures are going to be above 100 with those heat indexes there. Right now, the center -- the core of this is in the Ohio Valley. Tomorrow, a little farther to the east.

He is the author of \"The New York Times\" bestseller, \"The Heat Will Kill You First: Life and Death on a Scorched Planet\". Now, that's -- that's where I want to start right now. It might not be scorch plan. I haven't looked at the whole global forecasts, but at least for a good portion of the U.S., that's around 270 million people are going to experience temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week. And a few weeks ago \"The New York Times\" wrote, the hotter it gets, the more difficult it is for our bodies to cope, raising the risk of heat stroke and other illnesses. And it is getting hotter across the planet according to data by the National Weather Service. By far the most deadly kind of weather killing on average more than twice as many people as hurricanes or tornadoes combined. So my question is, what is heat so especially deadly as compared to what we may see in tornadoes or hurricanes? JEFF GOODELL, AUTHOR, \"THE HEAT WILL KILL YOU FIRST: LIFE AND DEATH ON A SCORCED PLANET\":  Well, thanks for having me on the show, Omar. Heat is, you know, very important for our bodily functions or you can think of our bodies as the sort of very sophisticated heat-balancing systems. And I think everyone knows that you go to the doctor you're not feeling good. The first thing they ask you is, are they take your temperature and they want to know what your temperature is. So, a steady temperature is really important to all the metabolic functions of our bodies. And, you know, we can cope with small amounts of changes, but what we really can't once our temperatures go above 101 hundred and two degrees, we start getting in big trouble. Our heart starts pounding, you know, trying to push more blood to the surface of our skin where heat is dissipated through sweat. And that works for a little while, but if the temperatures keep rising and you don't cool off, you start you start getting in big trouble. In the book, I call heat a predatory force and by that, I mean, it goes after the most vulnerable people first, someone who's in their 80s with a heart condition is far more vulnerable than a 22-year-old marathoner, young children, pregnant women, things like that.",

I look out my window in my office in Austin, Texas where I live and I can't tell of it's 75 degrees or 125 degrees out that window. If there's a hurricane, I can see at trees are bending, rules are flying around. So there's no visual communication connection for our brains to register. And also, think about how we use and think about the word heat, you know? I worked at \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. For a long time, every summer we would do a hot issue and that was not about climate, that was about, you know, artists and movies and things like that. Heat can be -- we use that phrase when we meet someone at a party who's attractive, we call them hot. So there's a lot of confusion in our language about it and it doesn't impact infrastructure the same way that flooding does with hurricanes do.

North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un greeted Putin at the airport. As you can see there as the two allies seek to strengthen that alliance, both sides plan to sign a new strategic partnership agreement, and this will be their second meeting in nine months. Pyongyang is rolling out the red carpet for Putin. Portraits of the president and Russian flags have lined the streets. So, a lot to talk about here. To break down this historic trip, I want to bring in former deputy director of national intelligence, Beth Sanner, and Jean Lee, adjunct fellow at East-West Center and former Pyongyang bureau achieve for \"The Associated Press\". Jean, let me start with you because this is Putin's second visit to the country. Last time he was there, was quite some time ago back -- back in 2000 for one, in his first year as president, Kim Jong-un was just a teenager at the time. You spent a significant amount of time in North Korea, how was a moment like this actually received by the people there. How did they view Russia? JEAN LEE, ADJUNCT FELLOW, EAST-WEST CENTER:  I think it's important to mention that this is his second trip, but the first one was when Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il, was in power. So what we will see in North Korea is just showing off this continuity, the friendship between Russia and North Korea, that started during the Soviet era with the grandfather continued through the father and now continues with grandson. So, it'll be played up in the propaganda. When we see paintings, stamps, special magazines, it will be blown up in North Korea for years to come. So, it's a huge part is cementing Kim Jong-un's legacy.

And so, we have symbolism, but the real question is how far will this relationship go? And what, you know, many watchers are worried about is that Putin will not only gain in terms of ammunition and missiles, but that he will give to North Korea. And what we are watching right now is how much in this strategic relationship the partnership that they sign will there be there? And we can't forget that North Korea is a serious nuclear power, probably with 50 nuclear weapons and those ICBMs they have are able to range the United States. But they don't necessarily have all the technology to guarantee their nuclear power against us. So this could be very key if Russia starts giving a lot more in terms of proliferation technology.",
