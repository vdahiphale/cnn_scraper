      "sentences": "First of all, we are seeing the clearest contrast yet between the President and a growing portion of his party on a ceasefire in Gaza. Most Democrats now support cessation according to a new poll. More Democrats in Congress increasingly are backing a ceasefire, including the first Jewish member. She'll be with us in minutes.Today, their moral case for a ceasefire and the splintering of the Democratic Party on the war. Plus, Dexter Wade was killed by an off- duty police officer then buried and his family had no idea. Now the white family says they've been victimized again. Wade's mother will join us live. And Thanksgiving is a time for celebration, but it's also tied to our painful reminders of our colonial past. And indigenous leader has an idea about reframing the holiday with truth-giving. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. It's a hard look at the headlines coming out of Gaza and not hard to look at them and not be overwhelmed by the violence and suffering. Yet it may still only get worse. Israel is signaling their offensive could expand into the South and the IDF says it will chase down Hamas fighters wherever they are. The Palestinian health ministry says the majority of Gaza's hospitals and clinics have shut down. They're out of fuel, and doctors say the patients who were on ventilators that they have now died at Al Shifa Hospital. This week, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar introduced the resolution. Her office says that she would block weapons that would block weapons rather, the quote fund war crimes in Gaza, and two dozen Democrats wrote a new letter to President Biden calling for a ceasefire and citing the impact on children. More than 4600 Dead close to 9,000 injured according to the UN. The political pressure on Capitol Hill follows the activist pressure on the street. We saw a new Pro Palestinian demonstration in major cities last night, more expected today. One member of Congress defending a ceasefire is Becca Balint. She's the first Jewish member of Congress to do so. In an oped, she explains this. \"Like me, there are thousands of Jews that share a deep emotional connection to Israel, because of what it meant for the survival of the Jewish people in the face of extermination. The same history also drives many of us to fight for protection of Palestinian lives. And Congresswoman Becca Balint joins us now from Vermont, Congresswoman Balint, thank you so much for being with us. Let's start here. I want to play for you what you said in late October when you asked during a podcast, what you thought about a ceasefire. And you said this? (BEGIN VIDEO CLILP) REP BECCA BALINT, (D) VERMONT (voice-over): And \"there is no easy answer here. And I will reiterate, if I thought that calling for that right now would help this situation would help the hostages would help the intricacies on the ground, I would do it. (END VIDEO CLILP)",

Hamas can no longer be in control of Gaza. We need to be releasing all of the hostages. And we need to be moving towards a long-term peace in this region to give a homeland to the Palestinian people and to secure Israelis. And that hasn't changed.What -- what it became clear to me in talking with my constituents, and the Op-Ed was really geared specifically at Vermonters, who are struggling with this as well is that we need to be able to hold all the complexity. And I heard an interview with President, former President Obama. And that really changed my thinking about this in terms of urging all of us to hold the complexity.

And Israel must do everything it can to minimize civilian deaths.And so I think that is what is holding so many people up is that there is a denial that Hamas is doing these things, which is essentially putting its own people in harm's way. But even with that Israel must take all steps not to bomb areas where they're -- they're heavy concentrations of civilians. And so I am not a military strategist. What I know is we all want the same things, for the violence to end for the hostages to be released, for Hamas to no longer be in power, and for both these peoples who have suffered for so long, to have safe and secure homelands.",

This week, the National African American clergy network took out a full-page ad in the New York Times they wrote this. \"We see the deaths and hear the cries of both our Palestinian and Israeli siblings who all deserve to live safe from harm. We must do what we can to stop the killing of Palestinians and Israelis and respond to the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\" Joining me now is Reverend Michael McBride, lead pastor of the Way Christian Center in Oakland.

But there's a humanitarian crisis happening in Gaza, that a number of noncombatants Palestinian civilians are being targeted at the number of over 10,000 and over 4,000 of these loved ones are children. We do not believe the way forward is to continue to kill indiscriminately. Palestinian civilians, particularly children. There must be another way forward a ceasefire, we believe, is the most moral way forward to figure out a peaceful long-term solution that includes the returning of hostages held by Hamas, as well as some of those Palestinians being held by Israeli Government and other parts of the West Bank and et cetera. A ceasefire is the only moral way forward and we believe the President ought to listen to the growing number of his own party members, State Department officials, and the country who are calling for a new way forward to help end this conflict between Israel and Hamas.",

It's, you know, every year we go through these rituals, these are rituals, these holidays, these concepts, these -- they're part of our collective cultural mythology.

From my eyes as an indigenous person, we've been here for a lot longer than the settler institutions are telling us or teaching our children in our schools.So when we hijack the truth and we put in its place something that is more palatable, something that eases our guilty settler conscience, it sets us up for conflict later on, because truth precedes justice. And justice precedes peace. So when we look at these holidays, you know, we have Native American heritage that's going on right now. And we're just now in a state where we're consciously deconstructing Euro hetero Christian programming. You could call it settler programming. But that's the truth. When you look into it, I'm a lawyer and I've studied the sources of these cultural mythologies, the mythologies where one demographic is this not only the settler, but the brave explorer, the pioneer, the Cowboys that tamed the wild west and brought under their control and in their subject subjugation, all the beasts of the wild, not only the animals, but they're talking about us. They're talking about the merciless Indian savages. That is in the United States Constitution. So when we talk about the myths of a people, they provide a purpose, a meaning and a place to people.
