Haley also suggested Trump can't win in November, here she is.

Wade and Trump's role in overturning Roe v. Wade.Now Donald Trump, while he might have been definitive about IVF, has been much more squishy on the campaign trail when it comes to abortion. He has tried to walk a fine line between being the architect of the overturning of Roe v. Wade by his appointment of three Supreme Court justices to the Supreme Court bench. However, he has also decided he doesn't want to talk about abortion because he believes that it is a political loser. And as we get closer to a general election, as it does appear that it's going to be a rematch between former president Trump and President Biden, you can expect Democrats to really double down on this issue of abortion.

And she has emerged as the number two in this contest. I do see her staying in it, although I'm not sure what that's going to do. I think what we have to look for is how big this lead is going to be. It could be just a monstrous defeat by Donald Trump. He's ahead in the polls over 30 points. But she might do better than expected. There would be have to be some sort of massive polling error if that was true. But if she does better than expected, she's going to use that to justify the reason why she's she should stay in the race. And she's going to keep hammering this idea that if she were to go head-to-head with Joe Biden, she would probably have a better chance of defeating Joe Biden than Trump would. And that's something that she'll have to connect with with voters. But the problem is in the primaries, of course. The voters are more extreme and more rabid and more committed to Donald Trump.

A number of world leaders are in Kyiv to mark the occasion, including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and European Commission chief Ursula van der Leyen.

That's why I'm announcing more than 500 new sanctions, in response to Putin's brutal war of conquest and response to Alexei Navalny's death.

And to see the shock and fear that were on people's faces as they made a run on the banks and queues, miles long, looking for petrol.And the rush there was to get out of the city. But through that underlying time, the message was from the West, we are behind you and we are supporting you all the way. And as you were just seeing those pictures, live from Kyiv there, that message is still the same from allies, from the -- from Europe and also from the United States. As Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, arrived today in the Ukrainian capital, she tweeted, \"More than ever, we stand firmly by Ukraine, financially, economically, militarily, morally, until the country is finally free.\" But Ukraine's freedom will not come without continued support, which it desperately needs at the moment on the front lines. The U.K. has pledged today a new $300 million munitions package. But the crucial one is still with the United States, almost $60 billion worth of aid, which is needed because, at the moment, we are seeing a small advance by the Russians on the front lines, particularly in Donetsk region. We saw this week that Avdiivka, a small but important town, was taken by the Russians that had lived long in the crosshairs from the previously occupied separatist territory. And we've seen the Russians making a big deal about this, handing out medals and President Putin saying that it's a great victory. But going into this year, we are going to be looking at what Ukraine will be able to do on the battlefield. And it has a new general now, taking over from Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Oleksandr Syrskyi is his name. We will wait to see what his doctrine and how that plays out on the Ukrainian battlefields -- Kim.",

Since January 2021, 44 states have introduced bills and at least 18 have passed laws restricting or banning the teaching of critical race theory. According to Education Week, only a dozen states require Black history in K through 12 public schools. In the last two years, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine and Rhode Island have legislated that Black history courses or electives be required. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And it's so funny because many of these same lawmakers belong to the Republican Party, the party that claims to be all about patriotism, right?

To be an educator, to be a teacher, right now in this environment, inwhich teachers, the ability and freedom of teachers to teach their students, whether it's on race, whether it's on gender identity. In fact, a teacher in my home county in Cobb County, Georgia, recently was fired and had her firing upheld simply for teaching, for reading a book to their students that didn't pass some -- that failed some litmus test because of what it said about gender identity. So teachers are resisting in this moment. Teachers are not going to -- teachers have shown that they will not sit by and let politicians, let politics inform how they can educate their students. And I think we're seeing so much bravery from our teachers, which we've seen throughout history in terms of resisting these modern efforts. And I do believe, like you said, Kim, that all of this, all of these repressive efforts by these extremist lawmakers, are actually having the consequence of shining a light on this issue, of leading teachers to stand up and resist, leading those like me who comment on these issues to do that. And so I take a lot of hope from the fact that, even though we're seeing these attacks, that the resistance will be even stronger.",

But that didn't dampen the mood for the more than 80,000 fearless fans, who braved the inclement weather. Taylor Swift will perform at four solo shows in the Australian city. While we're, on the subject of Taylor Swift, if you're a super fan, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has a job for you. Its posted a job for a Taylor Swift superfan to advise its expert curators and explain her importance to the history of art and design. Now the museum won't pay the Taylor Swift superfan in cash but will give access to its collection of almost 3 million objects. That fan will potentially help influence the museum's future programming. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
