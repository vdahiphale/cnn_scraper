People are going to be asking about, you know, the stability about their own banks and questioning the systems of regulations. And rightfully so, because if you think about it here in the U.S., we have the second longest run between no bank failures, guess what, since 1933, was the Silicon Valley Bank, we hadn't had a bank failure in over 167 days. So, over the last three, four years, been pretty stable for bank failures. However, that was two years ago, we are in a different world now, we're in a different aspect. And if you think of what happened in the Silicon Valley Bank, right, the deposits were a lot larger in 2021 when put in that situation. But again, why I tell you that story, because each bank has its own story, Kim, and there you mentioned -- you know, the story that we were just talking about Switzerland, they were already in trouble, they were looking to be in trouble over the last few years, this has amplified what happened. And you know, they did the right move by ensuring to get those -- you know, that loans back so that can create some stability.",

We are fighting inflation. And we're also, you know, there's a second component, which you can't really ignore, right? This fear of running deposits and getting it from the bank and social media. I'm not blaming all those things. But that's a part of this as well. And in the trust aspect and credibility.

But you have risk management, you have to continue to put money in systems inflammation, so you don't put your bank or put those things in those places that you don't put yourself in that bad spot. So yes, we can have more regulation. That's a part of it. People are blaming the fed, the Feds a piece of it of the interest rates as well.

He's set to meet with Japan's Prime Minister in what Seoul calls an important milestone. Now, the two countries have an acrimonious history, but they're both close allies with the U.S. and their frayed relationships have hampered efforts to put on a united front against North Korea. Now, ahead of the summit, Pyongyang launched a long range ballistic missile into the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It's the latest in a flurry of tests so far this week. Joining me now from Tokyo is the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel. Thanks so much for being here with us, Ambassador. Before we get to the meat of the summit, I want to get your reaction to the North Korea's latest missile launch.

This is as you know, all year they've been launching missiles, but they're always in reaction to the advancement of something like this, which is both cooperation, collaboration and coordination in shared interests. So, you know, I'm not being (INAUDIBLE) about it, but it's not the first one.

Over the last year, the United States, from the president and on down, and you saw the president with the two leaders in Cambodia, two leaders earlier than that in Spain and on the side of NATO, we have had over 40 trilateral meetings. Secretary of state level, secretary at defense level and many different levels.That familiarity, that institutionalized dialogue and conversation, the building of trust, was probably the greatest contribution. And again, those 40 plus meetings, more in 12 months than the preceding 5 years combined. Second is actually a role of restraint. This was directly handled by Japan and the Republic of Korea, as it is appropriately so. And they actually did the most important part of that was talking to each other, hearing each other and then addressing each other's concerns. And the United States' role was a convenor of the trilateral meetings that allowed bilateral meetings to occur and trust between the parties to be built. And nothing advances America's interests, the presidents primary goal, whether it's on the transatlantic or the Indo-Pacific, is to re- energize our alliances, re-energize our allies for shared interests, shared values and shared goals. This is example one of exactly that strategy by the president, but it's also -- step back. This week, we announced Aukus, the collaboration between the United States, U.K. and Australia on the new -- on the submarine nuclear technology. We also -- the Japanese announced a new jet fighter with Italy, the U.K. and Japan. Two weeks ago, the Philippine president visited Japan and were having multiple discussions about what I call the trilateral relationship to point out (ph). Those are all part of our alliances and our allies working together. Now what does that cooperation stand in contrast to China? When you see China in the last two months, they've had two border conflicts with India. They've had two coast guard conflicts with the Philippines. They've strathed the United States' planes and the Canadian planes. They flew a spy balloon over the United States. And the constantly found issues (ph) with the Pacific island nations. That is China's modus operandi: conflict, confrontation. The United States, collaboration and cooperation with our allies. And it stands in contrast. And that's why more and more countries in this region, both allies, friends and partners, want to see America's presence, both economically, strategically and at a deterrence level, because they worry that China unhinged (ph) is a China at confrontation with all their neighbors.",

Cars were also set on fire. Italian authorities banned German fans from attending the match against Napoli over concerns about possible violence. But some Eintracht supporters made the trip anyway. The Italian team ultimately won the match, three-nil. Protesters against Israel's proposed judicial reform found a new way to send a message to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Wednesday, they slowed traffic to a crawl near Tel Aviv's airport ahead of his fight to Germany. Israel has been rattled by weeks of protests against the reforms, which opponents say would undermine the system of checks and balances in the country's government. As Hadas Gold reports, Israel's president is now proposing a compromise and issuing a blunt warning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (CROWD CHANTING) HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been taking to the streets for weeks now to protest the Israeli government's judicial overhaul plan, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, made another impassioned plea as he unveiled his own compromise proposal on the reforms that the Netanyahu government is seeking. [00:40:0] In a televised speech, Isaac Herzog warned that the country is in a worrying crisis and is facing a possible civil war. ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT (through translator): I'm going to use a phrase I haven't used before, an expression that there is no Israeli who is not horrified when he hears it. Whoever thinks that the real civil war of human lives is a limit that it will not reach has no idea. Precisely now, in the 75th year of the state of Israel, that abyss is within touching distance.",

The current judicial overhaul, which has already passed some of its first votes, gives the Israeli Parliament, and therefore, the politicians in power, the ability to overturn Supreme Court decisions and more power over appointing judges. Herzog's proposal limits what the Supreme Court can overturn, but still gives them the power of overturning some laws while requiring a larger majority of justices in order for laws to be overturned. The proposal also creates a new framework for appointing judges. But almost as soon as the Israeli president was done speaking, the ruling coalition rejected the proposal. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Unfortunately, the things presented by the president were not agreed upon by the coalition representatives. Key sections of the outline he presented only perpetuate the existing situation and do not bring the required balance to the Israeli branches of government. This is the unfortunate truth. GOLD (voice-over): Meanwhile, another massive day of protests is planned for Thursday, when tens of thousands, if not more, of Israelis are expected to once again take to streets in --",
