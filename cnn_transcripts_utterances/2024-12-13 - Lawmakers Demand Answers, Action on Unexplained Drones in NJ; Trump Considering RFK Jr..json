But nobody. So law enforcement, in my opinion, and the whole government, state police, Department of Homeland Security, the governor, they need to take this way more seriously and find out what's going on.

There are no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace. Still, people are very clearly on edge.\" Still, people are very clearly on edge. Let's talk about this. Joining us right now is Rick Smith. He's a Founder and CEO of Axon, a private airspace security company that helps safeguard clients from drones. Thanks for coming in, Rick. I appreciate your time. What -- first and foremost, give me your theory. What do you think is going on here? RICK SMITH, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AXON: It's a little hard to tell exactly what's going on in New Jersey, but I can tell you it's good that this is drawing attention to a bigger problem. Just in the past year, we've detected over a million flight violations with drones near airports, critical infrastructure, NFL stadiums, and those sorts of things. So this is a really -- it's a much bigger issue than even what's going on in New Jersey. And this attention hopefully is going to drive lawmakers to take some -- some rapid actions here to empower law enforcement with the tools they need.",

In fact, our laws are built to manage airplanes because drones didn't exist several decades ago. And you need different types of equipment, and that's what we've been building at D-Drone is the ability to track smaller aircraft because we saw things like drones were going to be an issue, and now they certainly are an issue.And so the same radar and tracking system you use for a 747 just doesn't work. And so that's why law enforcement is beginning to deploy these. But there's also some regulatory hurdles because the laws that regulate aircraft are not built to empower police to deal with the drone. So if your local state fair has a drone coming towards it that police believe might be dangerous, right now there's nothing they can do about it. But I think that's going to change pretty quickly.",

There have been bills the last couple of years from both Republicans and Democrats that seek to give state and local law enforcement, state police, and critical infrastructure operators, so people that might be running a nuclear power plant or something like that, these new laws that have been in Congress seek to give them the ability to both track and mitigate drones.Right now, only certain federal agencies can do it, and there's just not enough of those people. Like, clearly, those capabilities were not in the area of interest right now. And so I think that is likely to come through next year. Again, it's empowering your state and local, the same people that are having trouble answering what's going on here, giving them the right and authority to use the tools they need to protect their local airspace.",

Just with what we have alone, we've detected over a million drones flights in the past year that have been too close to airports, too close to critical power infrastructure, you know, major sports stadiums. And that's where -- look, we've been really lucky. If you look at what's happening in the world, the deadliest weapons in the Ukraine war right now are small drones that are easily converted from consumer drones or hobbyists. The same thing is true in the Middle East. We just saw drones play a big role in this revolution in Syria. Luckily, it hasn't happened here in the U.S., and we certainly hope it doesn't. But those are the types of threats we need to prepare for. And again, I am so grateful that this is bringing attention to this in a way that so far seems like, you know, it's -- nobody's been hurt.",

Overnight, two new court dates were set in Pennsylvania as accused killer Luigi Mangione fights extradition in New York.Hearings will now take place on December 23rd and 30th. This, as \"ABC News\" reports, New York prosecutors have begun presenting evidence to a grand jury, which would be the next step in obtaining an indictment. Sources tell CNN as many as three search warrants have been executed in New York, including one on the backpack found in Central Park, the burner phone found along the suspect's escape route as well. Overnight, UnitedHealthcare confirmed Mangione was not covered by their insurance group. Police say, Thompson may have been targeted because of the company's size. There are new details on Mangione's life for much of the last year and his increasing isolation. The \"New York Times\" reports about a trip alone to Japan last April, which included some of the last known correspondents with friends, quote, \"I want some time to Zen out, Mr. Mangione said in the recorded message on April 27th.\" This is \"Times\" reporting. \"His voice quiet and contemplative.\" 'I would be one of his last -- it would be one of his last communications before he abruptly cut ties with a wide range of friends and family.\" Then with late April, according to the \"Associated Press,\" the suspect advised a Reddit user with back problems to, quote, \"keep trying different surgeons.\" He added, \"We live in a capitalist society. I found that the medical industry responds to these keywords far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.\" So a lot of new developments here, Sara.",

If you are there, I'm wondering, sir, what letter grade would you give the transition so far? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): I'd give it a C, maybe a C minus. Here's the most positive thing I can say. President-elect Trump has moved very quickly to suggest a very wide range of folks who he intends to nominate once he's sworn in as president. But the degree to which there's been background checks done on them, the degree to which they've been vetted, I think has fallen far short of what our nation's security and economy, what our public needs. He's just thrown people out more like it was a reality TV casting call than these are serious nominees. And he's already had to withdraw several folks before the nomination process even formally begins. So look, the last time Trump was president, he put forward a number of very serious qualified folks. For example, General Mattis, who was his secretary of defense, a four-star Marine Corps general, decorated combat veteran, who got 98 votes. This time, Pete Hegseth is someone, a Fox News host, who's had all sorts of controversies swirling around him in the weeks after he was first suggested. He may well get confirmed, but it will be after a lot of controversy. He has had to walk back a number of his statements. He has said publicly previously that having gays serve in the military is a Marxist conspiracy, that women should not be allowed to serve in combat. He has just walked those back yesterday. So I'd say for a transition, there's more drama than substance, and it's a bit of a distraction given everything that's going on around the world and here at home.",

I will do that with every one of the nominees who's in the jurisdiction of the committees on which I serve, and as many as I can.And I think that's just part of our job in the Senate, to meet with nominees, to ask them probing questions. And as was the case last time, where they are qualified, they have the right character, and I can support them in terms of what they intend to do with the agencies they're nominated to lead, I will vote for them.

She wrote an op- ed today in which she noted that Kash Patel in one of his books had listed her among people that should some -- have some kind of action taken against them. She writes today, \"I'm on Mr. Patel's list. I don't want a pardon. I can't speak for anyone else on the list, but I would hope that none of them would want a pardon either.

If we didn't break the law, we should be willing to show that we need the trust and fairness of the justice system that so many of us -- so that we trust the fairness and justice system that so many of us have defended.\" She also said that if she were to be prosecuted by the Trump administration, it would embarrass them somehow.

And I admire their determination to trust our legal system and to stand up to the bluster and the threats of Kash Patel and President- elect Trump.
