But, still, a lifetime of waiting to make it to the Super Bowl is going to last a little bit longer.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WIRE (voice over): Super Bowl dreams seemed like they could become a reality for these fans in Detroit. Looking for their first trip to the big game in franchise history, the Lions, powered by a punishing ground game, went to the Bay area and stormed out to a 24-7 lead at halftime over the 49ers. But then, led by the last pick in last year's NFL draft, the 49ers fought back. The former Mr. Irrelevant, Brock Purdy and San Francisco overcoming the largest halftime deficit in conference championship history, winning 34-31 in the NFC title game. BROCK PURDY, SAN FRANSCICO 49ERS QUARTERBACK: I think it's just a testament to God and where he's taken me in life. I've never been the biggest, the fastest, the strongest or any of that.

But there's no question that this is the most momentum that we have seen since that last truce that saw the release of dozens of hostages collapse in early December. When you look at the key players in this meeting, these are the same people who were able to get to that last deal back in late November that led to that weeklong pause in the fighting. And so now the question is how much longer will it take to close those remaining gaps and also we know that often the implementation side of these deals is often sometimes the trickiest part of this. So, we'll see. But certainly ongoing meetings expected to happen this week, including today with the prime minister of Qatar sitting down with Secretary of State Tony Blinken.",

The fact that the United States, France, Japan, see these as credible enough to pull funding from this program, at least for now, what does that tell you? DIAMONDTimes\" was initially provided to the United States. And that's what seems to have led to this pause in the funding. And the accusations are quite startling. One of these UNRWA employees is accused of having helped to kidnap an Israeli woman. Another is said to have helped hand out ammunition on October 7th. Six of those UNRWA employees, based on their phones, according to the Israeli government in this dossier, were actually geolocated as within Israel on October 7th. And several others are accused of being involved in that day's events, whether it was the massacre at several of the kubutz's on the order, or the kidnapping of Israeli citizens and soldiers as well. So, these are certainly very detailed accusations. And it's prompting more than a dozen countries at this point to suspend, at least temporarily, additional funding to UNRWA at a time when, of course, aid in Gaza, humanitarian aid, is critically needed. When you look at the numbers of hundreds of thousands of people currently facing famine, the United Nations secretary-general says that he was horrified by these accusations and there is a hope within the U.N. that this won't ultimately stop the funding all together because, again, of that critical need in Gaza at this moment.

Other research has found that there have been fewer than ten legal abortions each month in states with those bans. Sixty-five thousand rape related pregnancies, fewer than 10 legal abortions a month in each state.Joining us now is CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell. Meg, the numbers are jarring when you look at them.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so that juxtaposition of facts you just laid out there, the fact that we know that fewer than 10 legal abortions are taking place each month in these states that have total abortion bans is really important. The researchers, led by somebody from Planned Parenthood in Montana set out to try to understand how many people that are in this situation where they've been survivors of a rape and a pregnancy resulted from that, but knowing so few legal abortions are happening, what options do they have.And so there aren't good data on this. This was really a data problem. They used data from the CDC, the Bureau of Justice and the FBI to look in those 14 states that have enacted total abortion bans since the Dobbs decision, including five states, you can see there, that have rape exceptions, to estimate how many of these rape related pregnancies have happened. And they got 65,000. And so if you think there are fewer than 10 legal abortions happening in those states per month, what they conclude is that people who have been raped and become pregnant cannot access legal abortions in their home state, even in states with rape exceptions. And so it just puts numbers on this problem.",

It's possible they sought abortions using medication abortion and that wasn't recorded. It's possible they carried the abortions to term.One of the issues here, though, is, even in those five states with exceptions, the authors point out, those exceptions clearly are not working and that could be because they have requirements that the rapes are reported to law enforcement.",
