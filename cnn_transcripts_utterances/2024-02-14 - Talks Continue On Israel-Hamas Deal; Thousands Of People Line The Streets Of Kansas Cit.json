That really seemed to trigger the IDF last night and the Israeli Air Force to have a couple of strikes deeper inside southern Lebanon. Then today, you have Hezbollah, although they haven't claimed it yet, firing multiple rockets at swat (ph) this very important hilltop army base for the Northern Command. That's the IDF's command with its forces right up at the top of the border with Lebanon. So, an important strategic target that Hezbollah hit, resulting in the death of a soldier and a reservist actually very seriously injured as well, and seven other people injured, one of them moderately injured, six of them less badly injured. But that really strikes at the heart of the IDF in northern Lebanon -- so, northern Israel, rather. So again, the IDF and the Israeli Air Force taking it up a notch and hitting, as far as we know, five different Hezbollah targets, command and control, they say, in southern Lebanon. And the way the cycle has been going, and just outlined here the past 24 hours or so, we can expect probably Hezbollah to do something back. And it's -- does this get out of proportion? Does it escalate significantly? So far, both sides have managed to avoid that. But it's moments like this where that sort of thing can happen.",

So, and this brings to the conclusion that, yes, we need to do more in order to deter Russia and also to understand that the only threat to NATO as an alliance can come from Russia. Now, the second topic of the second line is that what Ukraine's -- or what Russia's victory could mean to all the other dictators. And the message is very clear that when Putin will win this war in Ukraine, then every dictator in the world will get the message that it is okay to go to your neighbor's territory and to take it by force.

And the latest example of this is Russia putting your own Prime Minister on a wanted list. That's the first time the Kremlin has sought criminal charges against a foreign leader since their larger scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Apparently, this may or may not be involving Estonia's efforts to remove Soviet-era monuments.

So, Adam, we'll talk about Alejandro Mayorkas that Annie just touched on in just a moment, but first let's talk about this special election. There were so many things that I found particularly interesting about this race, not just the fact that the two main candidates sort of distance themselves from the President and the former President, but also this idea that you had a Democrat making the migrant crisis really the centerpiece of his campaign. I thought that was really interesting. Just give us your thoughts on that.",

The border is a real issue. Now, the Republicans kind of gave the Democrats a gift in that they negotiated this package to fix the border and also to fund Ukraine and they walked away from it. So, now, that's not going to mean that overnight, all of a sudden the Democrats are going to be the border party and the Republicans aren't, but it can begin to chip away at that natural advantage that Republicans have on the border. So, that's a lesson for Democrats going forward. I think the fact that frankly, it's showing that the current President and the former President are both unpopular is reflected in the fact that both of these folks kind of ran away from their own party, but this is a really bad sign for Republicans. I heard your clip where Speaker Johnson was blaming the weather to an extent. Look, you've got to blame the weather for a loss. You are desperately grasping at straws. So, yeah, I think it's a bad sign if you're a Republican right now.",

That is something that former President Trump has knocked for years now. And this loss for Republicans is being blamed by some, including Nikki Haley and obviously President Biden, on Donald Trump, saying once again it shows that there is no real life for Trumpism. It's another failure on a national scale. How do you view it?",

All you have to do is look out with Trump's, I don't know, believe he put out on Truth Social wherehe's all caps angry about these laws, blaming this candidate because she ran away from him -- shows that that really hits him deep. I mean he doesn't react angrily unless there's something that's very, very close to him. So, you think about it, 2020, Trump loses. The first time in combat has not won re-elections since George H.W. Bush in a very different circumstance. He lost the Georgia special election right about that same time, lost 2022 midterms underperformed. All these, you know, special elections that are coming up, Republicans are losing. The problem is Trump is so popular in the base and as you all know there are two different election systems in this country. There's the general election were Trump is, I think, generally pretty unpopular. Now, the question is he or Biden more popular? That's what we'll find out in November. But then there's the primary election system where Trump is the most popular guy since sliced bread. And so, among all the Republicans, every candidate is now fighting between if I distance myself from Donald Trump, my base is going to be mad and I could lose a primary, but I could also lose a general election. I mean, I've been in that kind of a situation in my 12 years in politics. It's not a fun situation to be in, but it's very real.",

Because what happens is when those trees pull water up through their roots and out through the leaves, transpiration, it creates rivers in the sky that then irrigate the Pantanal and other parts of South America. They place into the entire global weather pattern.
