Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" U.S. President Joe Biden is in Europe for a high stakes week of foreign policy challenges and Ukraine will be front and center as Kyiv pushes to join NATO.More wild weather in the United States, a one in one-thousand-year rainfall event in New York and triple digit heat in the southwest. Plus, music superstar Harry Styles gets pelted in the eye on stage, the latest victim in a disturbing concert trend. It is 7:00 in the morning in London where U.S. President Joe Biden is kicking off a high-stakes, week-long overseas trip. He will be meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the hours ahead before heading to Lithuania for a critical NATO summit. That meeting will be taking place as the war in Ukraine grinds on and amid calls for Kyiv to be granted membership in the military alliance. CNN correspondents are tracking developments for us. Clare Sebastian is in London and Nic Robertson, also in London, is standing by outside 10 Downing Street. Welcome to you both. So Nic, the war in Ukraine will of course dominate President Biden's upcoming meeting today with Britain's Prime Minister and also at the two-day NATO summit that gets underway on Tuesday. What is expected to be achieved overall this week do you think?",

      "sentences": "Ukraine will be hoping that it's given a strong and clear path to joining NATO membership. Ideally, they would like to be able to join now, but there are two huge stumbling blocks. One is Article 5, that if one nation is attacked, the others will come to support them, which means if Ukraine was to become an immediate member of NATO, then it would put all the other NATO nations at war with Russia. That's not going to happen. But there's the issue of democratization. And the question becomes,how do you give Ukraine the assurances and the guarantees that it wants that it's going to be stable and can stand up to Russia's continued military onslaught? So, there's more likely to be a sort of a coalescing around language that will allow for bilateral guarantees of continued military support, of continued financial aid that President Biden in an interview this weekend with CNN indicated could be like United States would consider doing another Israelite basis where there is this commitment for sophisticated weaponry, for sophisticate -- for training on sophisticated weaponry for there to be no doubt in Israel's mind and therefore Ukraine's mind that they have the full military support of the United States. So, this is the pathway but not all NATO nations are on the same footing on this and of course the other, you know, question going into this will be, can NATO remain united over the issue of bringing Sweden that it has to join NATO into the alliance. And of course, Finland has -- Finland has joined and it was expected to be on a parallel twin track with Sweden, but it's Hungary and in particular Turkey President Erdogan there who's been holding out the process. But we know when he flew over here, President Biden spoke on the plane on Air Force One with President Erdogan by phone and is expected to have a bilateral meeting with President Erdogan in Vilnius. Now, will that -- what will the outcome of that be even if he was to get a nod for Sweden from the Turkish president. These things don't happen immediately. It needs to be ratified by the Turkish government and Hungary has said if President Erdogan waives his objections, then they would follow suit as well. But what kind of language may emerge from Vilnius around that? That would be the other big question.",

Clearly the U.S. decision to supply cluster munitions, controversial, but also a really clear sign of how the defense industrial base in NATO countries is struggling to keep up with the demands of this war. President Biden actually admitting that one of the reasons they're doing this is because they're running low on other types of ammunition. So that, and of course, the question of the F-16 fighter jets training has begun for Ukrainian pilots, but they have yet to get the go ahead to actually get those planes into the battle here.",

And of course, this comes after Mr. Biden's decision to send to Ukraine cluster munitions that are banned in 100 countries, including Britain. What impact will that decision likely have on this meeting and what other critical issues might be discussed do you think?O'HANLON:  Well, I think the decision on cluster munitions will be controversial, but is a pretty tactical decision. You know, the Russians have been laying landmines here and there, left and right. And this decision will not demonstrably change the basic situation. So, you can agree with it or not agree with it is not a strategic level change in the basic military situation. The military situation, unfortunately, is relatively stalemated with or without the cluster munitions. And I think that's going to be one big piece of NATO's, you know, basic conceptual framework going forward. How do we think about the future of this war? Can Ukraine really liberate all of its territory? I don't yet know the answer to that question. We're going to find out more in the course of the summer. The cluster munitions debate should be seen within that context and probably not viewed as a litmus test about the morality of the overall cause, which I think we all agree is basically on Ukraine's side, regardless.",

Could such a deal like that work do you think?O'HANLON:  It might, but you know what? I also see this as a much less central question. Russia is not going to attack Sweden. Sweden is not even a frontline state. There's no particular reason to worry about whether Sweden is in or out of the Alliance. I would like to see them in. But even if this issue gets punted or protracted, it's not really going to change the basic security situation in Europe. The real issue, of course, is about the war in Ukraine and how do we help Ukraine do better on the battlefield. How do we think about Ukraine's long-term security?

A lot of tension will also be on the House investigations, as well as potential impeachment efforts against top Biden officials like Attorney General Merrick Garland, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and even President Biden himself.Before Congress broke ahead of the July 4th recess, a series of Republicans began threatening to impeach Garland over allegations from IRS whistleblowers that the Justice Department improperly interfered in the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden. And even McCarthy, who has so far taken a pretty measured approach to impeachment efforts, has signaled that he is open to impeaching Garland if these allegations prove to be true. But the big picture here on these investigations is that we're closing in on a period when all of the oxygen in Washington will soon be focused on the 2024 presidential elections. And Republicans want to use this period to thrust what they argue is widespread politicization of the government into the spotlight and damage Democrats as much as possible as we head into election season.

So that just kind of puts things into perspective. So, there's all that land and the northern hemisphere and land heats up a lot faster than water does. Plus, we're also dealing with what's called an El Nino. An El Nino focuses more on our sea surface temperatures, and they're typically warmer. And in the Pacific, we noticed the trade winds start to weaken. As that happens, all that warmer water gets pushed over toward our Pacific coasts of the Americas. And we're noticing it all over the world. El Nino is a teleconnection pattern. So, it doesn't just happen in one area. It happens all across the globe. So, in the North Atlantic, we have five degrees Celsius above where we should be, and that directly correlates to our land. So, sea surface temperatures work with our land some temperatures as well.
