Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.Another case of violence on the streets of San Francisco, this time, a former fire commissioner was allegedly attacked by a homeless man with a metal pipe. But the suspect's attorney claims it was the fire commissioner who was the aggressor after he sprayed the homeless man with bear spray. We're going to go deeper into this story to see what it says about the homeless situation in San Francisco. Plus, Teachers Union President Randi Weingarten is here after a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill about whether teachers unions kept schools closed for way too long during the pandemic. What are the lessons for next time? And Steven Spielberg said he made a mistake in the rerelease of his classic film, E.T., and he'll never do it again. Okay. We'll talk about that. But we begin tonight with that attack on the streets of San Francisco. We warn you, this video is disturbing to watch. Prosecutors say former San Francisco Fire Department Commissioner Don Carmignani was seriously injured after being attacked on April 5th by a suspect with a metal pipe outside of his mother's home in San Francisco. This video comes from Carmignani's attorney. But this video that you're about to see here provided by the suspect, Garret Doty's public defender, shows what she alleges is Carmignani attacking Doty with bear spray minutes before that attack with a metal pipe. She says her client ran away pulling his jacket over his head. Speaking to our affiliate KPIAX T.V., Carmignani says he did not go out to fight anyone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So far, there have not been any arrests in any of these incidents. Okay, lots for my panel to talk about.

I think that's the epidemic we need to focus on.And this is a community that's really vulnerable to violence. Those eight attacks are just what's been reported. We know this is a community that is unlikely to report. So, I think when we talk about this as an epidemic, we really need to think about it for the people who are living on the streets who don't have adequate housing.",

I went to visit some friends in San Francisco. I went to college out there close by to San Francisco. I took my two teenage daughters and said, we're going to take a walk to visit my old professor from college. Walking through that area, in the mission area of San Francisco, I thought, well, I'll give my daughters like a reality check. This was way too much for a -- I mean, I was literally like -- people were like zombies walking.

I mean, you meant in the statistics, this is not more dangerous than any other similarly- sized city.So, sometimes when we talk about it, I do feel like part of it is that it's more visible in San Francisco. I think people see that there are people who are unhoused, there are people who make them uncomfortable on the street. And then they kind of extrapolate from there and say it must be more dangerous than the other American cities, when the statistics don't back that up. I mean, you read that and we can look at that.

And what they ultimately have concluded, that the safety kits, like testing, which is what Dr. Shah from Rockefeller Foundation and I got to by January 2021, which is what most industries have done, if we ended up doing testing and spending the money there instead of social distancing, we would have had -- that would have been a better route. If we knew in 2020 what we knew in 2021, schools would have been reopened more fulsomely.But at the end of the day, of course, I care about the effects of COVID. And what we've been trying to do in the last two years is how do we actually overcome those effects. And so what I just did a couple of weeks ago was there are two interventions I think right now will really help. One is community schools, wrapping services around schools, because we do that, we really wrap not just food services but mental health services, health services, afterschool programs, all these programs that will help kids really reconnect with each other and with their well-being, that's number one. And number two is experiential learning. If we -- kids need to have a joy of going to school. And what we've seen in terms of career tech ed programs in particular, is that when kids do hands-on learning and really work together then, and so --",

Because as we found out fairly quickly, we knew that children weren't going to be that affected by this particular disease. And so from my perspective, it seemed like this was coming from the teachers and the leadership on their side saying, hey, this isn't safe for us, it's not safe for our family members, for the community.

Some schools shut when there were too many teachers absent, but we were able to keep schools open because we understood and used testing as a way to do that.So, I think what happened was that people were fearful. You're absolutely right. But even though -- thank God, kids didn't get as sick as adults. Adults were getting sick and adults were dying. And so, we were trying to figure out -- and I'm not saying that -- look, there were people all across America who were taking different positions than -- you know, I was at the AFT, including some of my members, and you saw some of those things. But we were trying to figure out what were the mitigating strategies that were needed to keep schools open. And that's what, you know -- and that's what we tried to do from April 2020. And what I produced -- I went and I testified in Congress yesterday voluntarily, and I produced much documentation proving all the things that we tried to say. Now, that's why I keep on using the Cuomo administration because, frankly, Governor Hogan, Governor Cuomo, Rockefeller Foundation, lots of governors, they were working in a really different way than the Trump administration was. And the Trump administration did a great job in terms of vaccines. But in terms of giving people the kind of guidance to say, to do what Europe did, we didn't get it. And that's why in this investigative book that just came out yesterday, what they said was, if we had gotten that guidance, that stockpile of guidance, we would have been able to open up earlier, and we just didn't get it.",

I mean, I just think personally for myself. If I'm thinking about a film that I know is offensive and I'm just going to sit there for two hours and be uncomfortable, I'd rather just not watch it.

There are so many different angles. Sometimes, it can actually make it maybe a little more interesting.In this case, I think Spielberg realized what he did was not what he probably should have done. But when you have that artistic license, you can sort of -- it's like taking an old song. When a great band takes an old song that they performed for years and they change it up.
