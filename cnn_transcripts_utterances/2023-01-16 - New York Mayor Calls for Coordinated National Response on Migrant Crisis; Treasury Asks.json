If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.U.S. President Joe Biden is under more scrutiny over his handling of classified documents. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee is now asking the White House for visitor logs from Mr. Biden's Delaware residence where several classified items have been found. He's also seeking records and communications related to searches of the president's homes and other locations. And California is bracing for more potential flooding. Storms have been slamming the state for weeks now, flooding roads, homes and businesses, causing mud slides and leaving at least 19 people dead. Right now, more than 8 million people are under flood watches until Monday evening, including in the Bay Area. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is calling for Washington to deliver a more coordinated response to the migrant crisis. He visited the border in El Paso, Texas, on Sunday and urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency to step up. He said the government's overall lack of coordination has compelled him to take his efforts to a national level. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIC ADAMS, (D) NEW YORK MAYOR: I'm extremely disappointed of what we have done to the cities of this country and the impression that we're not seeing the level of urgency of getting this issue resolved. I believe that we must appoint a FEMA leader that is going to come in and look at this and coordinate our response. It is wrong for El Paso to have a response, for New York to have a response. We cannot have these disjointed responses. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Mayor Eric Adams has estimated that the city will have to spend anywhere from $1.5 to $2 billion to cover the cost of housing and providing services for migrants which have been arriving for several months since last year.The mayor traveled to the southern border yesterday. He visited with El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser. They visited the border in addition to a shelter as well as a processing center for the customs and border patrol. The mayor has said that this is very much a crisis, a humanitarian crisis for the city of New York. Thousands of people have been arriving. Many of them bussed to New York by the state of Texas. I want to just put up the numbers. More than 39,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York and have been processed by the city. 26,000 of them remain in the city's care. And for several months now the city has worked to open 74 emergency shelters as well as four emergency relief centers in an effort to connect asylum seekers with resources. But, of course, all of this costs money. And that is where the mayor's request comes in. For months now he has been asking the federal government to help pay for the cost of supporting these migrants. And the mayor's visit to the border comes a week after President Biden visited the border himself. It is interesting that the mayor chose to go to the border only after Biden made the stop himself. Now, this issue of migrants is not just happening here in New York City. It's also affecting other major cities around the country, places like Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Chicago. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also taking to social media earlier today to express support for Mayor Eric Adams, his trip to the border, and saying that she agreed with his request for federal funding.
