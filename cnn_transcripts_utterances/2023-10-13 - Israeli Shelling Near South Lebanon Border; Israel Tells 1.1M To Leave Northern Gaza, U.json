Hamas, though, has told civilians to stay put do not go anywhere, they say.We're also standing by right now to hear from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in Qatar meeting with Qatari leaders. He's trying to get Qatar to pressure Hamas to release the hostages to some 100 to 150 hostages being held in Gaza. We are going to begin though on the Israeli Lebanese border right now where we have just seen some shelling some real back and forth movement right now. This is the border. Our Ben Wedeman is there.

So it's OK just in the past few moments, and we are by a staging order right near that southern corner of Gaza, a few miles from the Gaza border and about 10 miles from the Egyptian border. We just saw another bus of troops going in. Each one of them has about 50. We've seen that steadily throughout the past couple hours as we've been at this particular location.We're next to a staging area that we can hear. We can hear all the action of the staging going on for a tank battalion. And just behind me over this hill, we just saw six rockets in about the past 20 minutes. Those rockets were coming from Hamas here. And they were intercepted by the Iron Dome. They were essentially coming over the small town or mid-sized town of Ofakim where there's been a lot of activity. And that town is essentially, obviously not far from here. But it's in that buffer zone that I've described between Gaza and where the Israeli military has essentially set up these checkpoints of which we were -- we are along one of them, where they have a complete military zone. And if you can hear some of the loudspeakers where they're speaking up there. So that's what we've seen, we continue to hear outgoing artillery. But the most recent thing that we just saw was about six rockets that came in here over Ofakim from Hamas.",

Thank you so much.We want to go now to Tel Aviv up the coast here. That is where we find our Matthew Chance.

And I think it's really important, John, to bear that in mind as we all sort of brace for the possibility of an Israeli land incursion into the Gaza Strip with the hundreds of thousands of troops they've mobilized on the border, that that military operation is going to be severely, you know, complicated, if not hampered by the fact there are those 100 to 150 Israeli hostages that Israeli officials believe have been scattered in secret locations across the Gaza Strip.Well, the Israelis say that they're doing everything in their words humanly possible to secure their release, but they're stopping short of confirming to us that actual negotiations are underway through third parties to try and secure the release of those Israeli hostages or at least a proportion of them. But obviously Secretary State Blinken in Qatar earlier, undoubtedly speaking to the Qatar authorities to try and put pressure on Hamas. The overall Hamas leader of course, lives in Qatar, to try and get some sort of accommodation from them and some compromise to get some of those hostages out. In the meantime, the Israeli government has appointed a hostage Affairs Coordinator. After complaints that enough was not being done to keep the families informed about the status of those hostages, the status of negotiations to get them free. That coordinator within the past hour or so has been meeting with 500 members of the families of some of those hostages in Israel to update them on what the latest status is on their situation, although no details, of course, are being given to us in public. What the Israelis are saying is that anyone who took these hostages, anyone who mistreats them in the -- in, you know, either now or in the future will face Israeli wrath, whether that's in five years, 15 years, or 25 years. And so the Israelis are absolutely furious that this has happened and say they're doing everything they can to get those people out.",
