This as new video is emerging now showing smoke billowing over Rafah this morning after airstrikes and shelling by Israel there. The U.S. and Israel have been in regular communication about Israel's military plan to conduct a major potentially ground operation in the area of Rafah. But the Pentagon says there is nothing detailed at this point.Joining me now, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. He joins us from Copenhagen, where he will be a speaker at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit. Thank you so much, sir, for joining us this morning. This revelation that the U.S. has withheld, I think it's a total of 3,500 bombs, they're worried about their use on Rafah, where there are more than a million people that have to seek refuge. There has also been a campaign in the U.K. to halt weapons deliveries to Israel over their potential misuse. What does this say about where Israel is? And do you think this will trigger more international response that will further isolate Israel?",

According to court documents, what we're talking about here is Halima Salman. She was a teenager when she left the United States and entered an ISIS-control area of Syria around late 2016. Prosecutor say she then received training by ISIS before she was captured by or surrendered to forces opposed by ISIS about two years later. In 2023, she allegedly told FBI agents that she married an ISIS fighter but denied being involved with any ISIS activities. She is now back in the United States and facing charges.Now to TikTok. TikTok is now suing the United States, it's suing the U.S. government, trying to block the new law that will force the platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States. The lawsuit sets up for what is sure to be a huge legal battle. TikTok is arguing that the law is unconstitutional, violating the First Amendment rights of its users, while makers in the Biden administration have said the ban is rooted in national security concerns over the app's ties to China. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says doctors founding a worm in his head. Here's the quote. \"A worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.\" This is coming from new reporting by \"The New York Times\" about a 2012 deposition during a divorce proceeding. That deposition of Kennedy was reviewed by \"The New York Times.\" The presidential candidate described in this deposition what doctors told him in 2010 because he was seeking treatment for memory loss and mental fatigue, saying this in the deposition, quote, \"I have cognitive problems, clearly. I have short-term memory loss, and I have longer-term memory loss that affects me.\" Kennedy said the parasite was removed and has had no after effects on him. When asked by \"The Times\" if this will compromise his fitness for office, a spokeswoman for his campaign told \"The Time,\" quote, \"that is a hilarious suggestion given the competition.\" John.",
