The question is, how do you get from the attempted murder and aggravated assault charge to the hate crime charge, which has become a major concern to the victims, the victims families, the Arab American community, the Palestinians across the country. And that is a tougher legal issue. To do that, the state's attorney has to be able to prove that hate was the chief motivator, or a -- a factor in the assault.
