With regard to the seriousness of these documents, it's -- you know, these documents appear to be what we call analyzed tactical Intelligence.

This is not Israel's plan for an attack, now Kasie, that doesn't make the leak any less egregious.

So, we're talking eastern New Mexico, and not only do they get their daily rainfall record broken, but this is the all-time wettest day that they have ever recorded.And unfortunately, the result has been catastrophic. Look at some of the damage that has been left behind by the fast-moving water, you can see how it impacted these buildings, overturning vehicles and pushing up all of this debris right along the side of this bridge here, there was some damage to a local car dealership as well. Just incredible amounts of rain, nearly six inches in one day, and remember, this is a particularly dry area of the western U.S., so, when we see this rainfall this time of year, it's tough, that will overtake a lot of the drainage systems, and of course, allow for the flooding to take place. The good news is that the rain is quickly moving away, so, we're going to get a period to dry out and hopefully clean up from the damage, but it's already been done certainly. Some snowfall across the higher elevations of Colorado, but this is a system moving eastward, and it's actually going to be partly responsible for pushing away a tropical system that has no threat to the U.S., but certainly, will help to axe that away from the eastern seaboard and out to sea. Damaging winds, large hail, a tornado or two possible across the nation's mid-section, particularly across Nebraska, stretching into the panhandle of Oklahoma, otherwise, mild and dry over the eastern U.S., temperatures have been very Fall-like and very beautiful, if I can say so myself, Atlanta here at 58 degrees right now, I think will top 80 for the afternoon.
