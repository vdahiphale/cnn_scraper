He is standing out in front of the House, not on the Capitol steps like he planned because it turns members aren't allowed to have press conferences on the Capitol steps.I want to bring in the panel in a moment, but just to kind of give a summary of what we've heard up to this point, he accused multiple members of having rap sheets, something he read in the publication \"Political,\" which we aren't totally sure exists at this point. Protesters in New York City last night supporting the Palestinian cause, he referred to them all as illegal immigrants. He compared Jamaal Bowman, the Congressman who pled guilty to pulling a fire alarm, paying $1,000 fine, writing an apology letter, to the January 6th attack on the capitol, and those individuals as well who are in jail. He said he cooperated for the most part with the ethics inquiry. He did not, he did not sit down for an interview. He also said that the ethics report, which is very damning and contained a lot of receipts, was so thin that it wouldn't have brought charges against him if he were a cop. Of course, he has been indicted. So that's where things stands right now. Oh, also, two action items. He is going to file a slew of ethics complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics, and the aforementioned Jamaal Bowman, he will try to file a privilege of resolution to expel him as well.",

      "sentences": "It seems like and Lauren's been reporting this, it seems like it's against Santos right now, that the momentum is toward its a wave that is going now, pull him out of Congress. I think that's part of why you mean this was a performance that he gave this morning, right?I mean, it was a pugnacious performance in the era of Trumpian politics. He's trying to turn himself into a martyr and likely earn himself a paycheck after he is forced out of Congress. I think it's pretty transparent kind of what's going on there now. That said, he is not wrong, that it is a remarkable precedent to set to expel someone who has not already been convicted or most of the expulsions from Congress took place in the context of the Civil War. They were people who fought for the enemy of the United States of America in its time of most difficulty. So that's true, and that's what you heard from the House Speaker as well. But I do think that one of the key dynamics here is that it does show you the diminished power of leaders in Congress to do stuff about this. A big part of the reason there haven't been more expulsions for situations like this is that when we have had this, the person has been informed in no uncertain terms by their leaders that the right thing to do is to exit stage left immediately. And typically, they have said, okay, fine, we'll do that. The leaders have had the power to get members of Congress to do that and it has not resorted to what you are seeing on your screen right now, which are the people that had to be forcibly ejected because they could not be convinced. I mean, I think it's just more evidence, Erica, that we're living in kind of a shame-free era in our politics.",

More and more members have podcasts rather than doing constituent gates.You know, what is it that he does there is unclear. But here's what I'll say, I'm hearing the same thing as Kasie. I do think that this expulsion resolution ends up passing. It needs a two-thirds majority vote; we know all Democrats are going to be for it. The full New York delegation is calling for this. But it sets up an interesting dynamic in Congress where, of course, Speaker Johnson's going to lose one more vote that he has in a very slim majority. But I would argue it's better for the Republican Party that George Santos be out for obvious reasons. But also, one of the most vulnerable Republican lawmakers is Mike Lawler, who is a New York member, and a top target of the DCCC.

Hamas has said, again, that this was part of their military wing that carried this out and that it was a direct response, as they put it, to the unprecedented crimes committed by, as they put it, the occupying forces, including the brutal massacres in the Gaza Strip. And it goes on, meanwhile, as you also mentioned, the Israeli military has been conducting operations throughout the course of the past month and prior to that initial Hamas attack of October 7 in the West Bank. So just this morning, there was a 21-year-old Palestinian man who was killed in some kind of confrontation around one of the Israeli releases of Palestinian prisoners. That it's part of the prisoner exchanges between the hostages that have been released by Hamas in Gaza. And the Palestinian Ministry of Health, they say that this year alone in the West Bank, there have been at least 455 Palestinians killed and 247 killed since the initial Hamas Massacre of October 7. So, it just gives you a sense of the loss of life and how deadly and volatile the situation is right now, even though the bombs have stopped falling for about six days now in Gaza. And I will add one other factor, Qatar and Egypt mediators in this truce, they're pushing for two more days of truce. If that falls through, we could have more violence here between Israel and Lebanon. And the UN peacekeepers here have recorded for two straight days now, shooting across the border, they say, from Israeli forces here into Lebanon, back to you.",
