We are considering our next steps and there will be a response, and I think that is the expectation here that Israel will respond with force in some way, potentially to avoid civilian casualties. There may be a diplomatic component. But, as for the situation right now, the fact that Israeli schools are all open and operating and there are no controls over large gatherings of people tells you, at the moment, Israel is not expecting anything to come (inaudible) from Iran.

On the one hand, it has a very large population, a large percentage of its population that traces its roots back to historic Palestine. And we've seen particularly at the beginning of the war in Gaza, but also recently, massive protests either outside the Israeli embassy or the American embassy, really strong condemnation of the war in Gaza.And of course, over the weekend, Jordan did shoot down some of the Iranian drones that entered Jordanian aerospace. And of course, the Jordanian government is saying that they were doing it simply to defend Jordan. But the criticism being leveled by many Jordanians against the government is that they're doing far more to defend Israel than they are to defend the people of Gaza. Now, of course, Jordan has led the way in having airdrops of humanitarian goods into Gaza. But in terms of actually doing something more concrete to put pressure on the Israelis to stop their war in Gaza beyond talk, they haven't been able to do much. So I think when Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke with King Abdullah, it was really a means to reassure Jordan that the West, the G7, the United States, Europe has Jordan's back. But the monarchy has to keep an eye on the street where opinion isn't necessarily so positive when it comes to Jordan's role in stopping those Iranian drones over the weekend. Max?

This new video shown on Iran's state media. Part of the country's massive aerial attack for the first time targeting Israeli territory. Hundreds of drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles, and yet Iran calls this measured action and vows things could get much worse for the Israelis. NASSER KANAANI, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): We have carried out this action in the framework of deterrence.

Any moment, we could expect to see him leave his residence at Trump Tower, travel to the courthouse in lower Manhattan. It's a journey that he is expected to take almost daily during what could be a two-month-long trial. Day one of the trial saw a series of motions by both sides, followed by the start of jury selection. The process of finding a jury is already off to a slow start as more than half of the first group of prospective jurors were eliminated right off the bat. We'll get more now from CNN's Kara Scannell.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: (Inaudible). Nothing like this has ever happened before, has never been anything like it. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump speaking out on a day that saw 96 potential jurors passed through magnetometers to enter the courtroom with Trump. They were sworn in and questioning began. A few minutes later, at least 50 perspective jurors were excused because they told the judge they could not be fair and impartial. Of those who remained, three questions by the judge listed the New York Times and CNN as their sources of news. None said they had read any books by Michael Cohen or Trump, and none of them said they worked or volunteered for any pro-Trump or anti-Trump groups. Just nine members of today's jury pool were questioned and not dismissed by the time court adjourned. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg says the former president attempted to cover up payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election, trying to stop her from speaking out about the alleged affair with Trump. Judge Juan Merchan started the day by denying a motion from Trump's lawyers to recuse himself. As attorneys debated, Judge Juan Merchan said he would not allow the infamous Access Hollywood tape to be shown, or video of Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit that found him liable for defamation. Karen McDougal, a model who says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet about it, will be allowed to testify. Attorneys also argued about how much the jury can be told about Michael Cohen's crimes. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I did it at the direction of, in concert with, and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. SCANNELL (voice-over): The credibility of Trump's former fixer who admitted he orchestrated the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels will be one of the most fought-over elements of the case. Trump for his part, entered very few words into the court record. He could sometimes be seen leaning back in his chair with his arms folded and his eyes appeared to be closed for several minutes. When he was introduced as the defendant, Trump turned around and gave the potential jurors a tight-lipped smirk. Once jury selection began, Trump was active, at times conferring with his lawyer and holding the questionnaire up to read as a judge question jurors. Prosecutors also asked the judge to fine Trump for social media posts attacking witnesses involved in the case, saying he violated a gag order. The judge scheduled a hearing for next week to settle that matter. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. It may be the only case against Trump to face a jury before the 2024 election.

And so, the judge has not decided if that is in fact a violation of the gag order. He is going to hold a hearing next week on that. The prosecution though was asking that at Trump be fined $1,000 for each of those three tweets. So $3,000. And remember, Max, Trump is not a stranger to violating gag orders.

Now, I'm not sure whether it's much comfort, but Israel has told U.S. officials, according to one person I've been speaking with, that what they are planning, what Israel is planning would be limited in scope. What that looks like, we still don't know, but a second source is telling our colleague Natasha Bertrand that there are indications that Israel wants to carry out some kind of kinetic military action which would be a response, of course, to that Iranian retaliation on Saturday night with more than some 300 projectiles.Another thing we are told, Max, is that there has been no warning yet by Israel to the United States about an imminent attack. The Biden Administration certainly hopes that there would be some kind of warning because should there be an Iranian response to that, that could certainly threaten U.S. assets, U.S. personnel, military and diplomatic in the region. For now, the Pentagon says they are maintaining some of those assets that they had moved out to the Middle East in anticipation of the Iranian attack on Saturday night, perhaps the surest sign that things are not yet over. So while the U.S. does believe that Israel will take some kind of action, there is certainly a hope that Israel will, as officials have been telling us, take the win, that they will realize that some kind of balance has been re-established. There was the Israeli attack against the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Iran then responded to that. And in the U.S.' view, because Israel did so well at repelling the Iranian attack, that equilibrium has been re-established, but it does not appear that Israel sees it that way.

It was earlier this year, in fact, just one month ago that government leaders gathered here in Beijing and Xi Jinping outlined an economic growth target of around 5 percent for 2024, seen as ambitious by some. But from what we are hearing from the data dump that we saw today, expectations were met in this first quarter.The real question is, is this sustainable? Is it something that can be maintained in the future? In fact, if we look at the growth, a lot of it has to do with China's robust ability to manufacture goods at a very fast and competitive rate. And here in China, I can tell you as someone who reports on the economy, there are really three big industries, electric vehicles, solar powers, and batteries. So much success in those areas that it can be argued that China is perhaps flooding the market, putting so much merchandise that it's creating an unlevel playing field, especially when it comes to pricing and it's a concern that we heard from Secretary -- the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen when she was in China last week. It's also some themes that we have heard from the German Chancellor, who has also been spending time here in China. The real question is, will manufacturing be the future of China? Because there are some other issues that need to resolve, including the housing sector which has created problems, and so many other areas including unemployment and just consumer confidence. In fact, today, we heard from one economist for Moody's Analytics, Harry Murphy Cruise. He said, \"There is a growing mismatch in China's economy. Manufacturers are doing the heavy lifting while households are on the sidelines.\" So the real question is, how do you get people confident to spend money once again? China is certainly making appeals to the west. In fact, as part of this visit by the German Chancellor, a number of executives, heavy hitters from some of Germany's most recognizable brands are here in China, trying to alleviate concerns about government crackdowns and trying to get these nations enthused about the fact that there is a very large spending population here. Max, I should point out that while there is so much skepticism about the Chinese economy, it's not stagnant. It's just slow growing compared to what we've seen in the past.",

This is where the dance and the high priestess lit the flame before taking it into the stadium in front of the spectators who were gathered there and waiting. It's a remarkable moment when this happens because you have to remember that this is the birthplace of the Olympics. This is where the first games to play -- at the 776 BC. So were looking at a history dating back almost three millennia.So, the crowds cheer. The first torch bearer took the torch out of the stadium, and from then, it will be passed on to hundreds of people in Greece and eventually the thousands of people before it reaches its final destination in Paris, France. A number of people were also here from the boat that will transport the flame. It's a beautiful boat. The Belem, it's a historic French boat. A three-masted wonderful old cargo ship that will take the flame from Greece's Panathenaic Stadium, the first place where the modern Olympics were held, to Marseille, to the Port of Marseille, and from there, thousands of people will carry it all the way to Paris in what the French are promising to be is going -- is going to be a spectacular ceremony. We've understood now that the French President Emmanuel Macron has said that possibly, there may be some changes to this initial plan to have the flame come in all across the Seine due to security reasons. And much like any people here today, he has made an announcement to support the Olympic Truce. The Olympic Truce used to be what the ancient Greeks practiced. It used to be a cessation of all kinds of hostilities during the time of the games, so the athletes and spectators could have free passage. This has been a call from the U.N. It has been ongoing since 1993 with, of course, until now, very limited results, Max, but still afloat (ph).",

He is the host of the podcast, \"That Said with Michael Zeldin.\" Thank you so much for joining us.

So if you get one person who has snuck onto the jury and hangs the jury, meaning they can't get the unanimous verdict, then they have to do it all over again.

Or if there is a mistrial, a hung jury, there won't be enough time to re-try the case.

He graduated from Harvard Law. A 1995 article in \"The Harvard Crimson\" credited him for moderating a discussion between black and Jewish students, calling him the \"anointed one\" for his ability to reconcile diverse people and clashing views. Bragg's resume lists a series of prestigious offices. He served as assistant attorney in the southern district of New York, a top lawyer in the New York attorney general's office, a professor of the New York Law School racial justice project. That's where he represented the family of Eric Garner. The family sued the city after a plain-clothed officer put them in an unauthorized chokehold after he was caught selling loose cigarettes. Garner's death in 2014 sparked outrage and protests nationwide. Bragg credits his interest in police reform to his years growing up here in Harlem, where he says once again, he was unfairly stopped by police as a child. His mother was a teacher, his father a social worker according to \"The New York Times.\" And Bragg now taking on his highest profile case to date, his case against the former president underway.",
