But the new spin is too late as Prigozhin no longer the target of Russian prosecutors Tuesday appear to have fled to Belarus. According to its president, Alexander Lukashenko who relished in colorfully describing a starkly contrasting weekend to Putin, in which he persuaded Prigozhin in a phone call to stop his tanks moving on Putin. There was cursing. [02:05:01] ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, PRESIDENT OF BELARUS (through translator): Yevgeny was in complete euphoria. There were 10 times more expletives than normal words. I said Putin will not talk to us due to the situation. He was silent and then said, but we want justice and we'll go to Moscow. I said halfway you will be just crushed like a bug.

It's clear, I think that if and when it reemerges, it will look somewhat different. But we're getting some sort of mixed signals around this. On the one hand, a report on Tuesday that Wagner was getting ready to transfer its heavy weaponry back to the Russian Ministry of Defense.That seems a pretty strong signal, if not a dissolution of the group of a significant downgrade in its status, but on the other hand, Russia has dropped the charges against Wagner over the mutiny. Prigozhin according to Lukashenko is now in Belarus that we have not seen actual evidence of that. We did though get some satellite images showing several planes linked to Wagner on the tarmac of an airbase near Minsk. You can see them there. But of course, that does not tell us whether or not Prigozhin was on board those planes but according to Lukashenko he is now in Belarus. I think, as you say, the next big question is how many Wagner fighters could follow him there and what the situation for them could be when they arrived. There have been reports that Belarus is already setting up camps for these fighters. Have a listen to what the Belarusian President Lukashenko had to say in response to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUKASHENKO (through translator): We are not building any camps yet.

And meanwhile, this is being seen, certainly by countries on NATO's eastern flank the potential presence of Wagner fighters in Belarus as a new security threat that the Iranian President warning that this would create new instability for Belarus' neighbors on Tuesday.

And I think that's part of the reason why he's there and not somewhere further afield.If he does get too far out of line they can get to him. But the -- are -- there are a series of issues with the Kremlin as well, which is essentially what to do with all of this machinery that Prigozhin has built.
