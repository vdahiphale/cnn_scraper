At 7:37 a.m., excuse me, on January 4th, 2024, the Perry Police Department responded to an active shooter event at Perry High School. Meanwhile, Dallas County communications was also received multiple 911 calls of an active shooter at the high school. Perry police officers responded within minutes. They immediately made entry and witnessed students and faculty either sheltering in place or running from the school. Once inside, they located multiple individuals with gunshot wounds. Officers immediately attempted to locate the source of the threat and quickly found what appeared to be the shooter with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. As additional officers responded, a systematic approach, search of the school took place. Officers located, there in the research of the school, and improvised explosive device. The state fire marshal and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms rendered the device safe. Numerous officers from multiple agencies were able to secure at the school and verify no additional threats. At the same time, first responders were rendering aid to the victims who were they transported to area hospitals. The shooter has been identified as 17-year-old Dylan Butler, a student at Perry High School. Butler was armed with a pump action shotgun and a small caliber handgun. Butler also made a number of social media posts in and around the time of the shooting. Law enforcement is working to secure those pieces of evidence. All evidence thus far suggests that butler acted alone. There are six victims. One of them is deceased. That individual was a sixth grade student at Perry Middle School. The other five are being treated at area hospitals. Four of the surviving students -- four of the surviving victims are students and the fifth is a school administrator. The law enforcement response was swift and immediate. Roughly 150 officers from local, state and federal agencies responded within the hour. The investigation into this tragedy is ongoing. The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is serving as that lead investigative agency with assistance from the Perry Police Department, the Dallas County sheriff's office, the FBI, the ATF, and the Dallas County attorney's office.

They located multiple victims with gunshot wounds. One person was killed by the shooter. The shooter has been identified as a 17-year-old named Dylan Butler who came with a pump action shotgun and a small handgun. A sixth grader was killed. He's not been named. Five others were injured, four of them students and what a school administrator, perhaps thought to be the principal of the school. The shooter is believed to have died but a self inflicted gunshot wound. Today was scheduled to be the first day of school for the new semester, according to the district's calendar. There was also a rudimentary explosive device was found, but that was suggested to have not posed a threat. We also were told by law enforcement that the shooter posted a number of things on social media and I'm not sure if there is still up or not. They said something like trying to get them removed from social media. TikTok, being one of those social media sites. Let's bring in former police chief Charles Ramsey. He led police departments in both Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Also with us, Juliette Kayyem. She served as the assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. Chief Ramsey, I hate the fact we have so many of these school shootings and of course it's the first week that from winter break. And here we go, another school shooting.

What did the family know? And like Chief Ramsey, sort of possession of the guns and how he possessed them. There was a question, it was hard to decipher what it was, and the chief sort of shut it down about a father. So we don't know what is out there, what people in the community know.

This wouldn't even count as a mass shooting event in some of that lists because there are just so many.And one thing I just wonder about is, I've talked to law enforcement officials about what can be done about this. Because obviously, if this is in effect a pump action shotgun and a small handgun, these would not be affected by so-called assault weapons bans. And one thing I keep hearing is stronger red flag laws, so that law enforcement is where people might pose a threat to themselves and others, and not just stronger laws but more funding and social workers and such that can't deal with that. And also, laws that require parents to store guns safely so that kids can't get access to them.

If you are not being used but responsible adult, they need to be secured.I'm sure they're going to be digging into this young man's history. It probably hit a lot of the heavier issues at school before. People need to pay attention to social media posts. Don't take it for granted. If somebody's making threats or putting something out of the ordinary, they need to let someone about. And we don't know yet exactly what this postings were.

In just a few hours, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former United Nations ambassador and Governor Nikki Haley are going to take questions from Iowa Republican caucusgoers in two CNN town halls, just 11 days, only 11 days before those Iowans become the very first voters in the nation to pick their candidate for that Republican presidential nomination. Donald Trump will not be in attendance tonight, but his dominance over the Republican field could be a main topic of questioners, given that DeSantis has faced not one but two Iowa voters just yesterday who questioned why he has not yet gone directly after Donald Trump. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Des Moines for us, at the site of tonight's CNN town halls.

And there aren't many of those.I spoke with one woman yesterday who said she's looking for a candidate with integrity, but at the end, it's a gut feeling. She'll be watching the town hall tonight. She's been in several events. So she sort of underscores at the end of this race, you sort of just know it when you see it. But separately of that, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is trying to make the argument that he can be sort of the Trump administration's continuation without the drama. He can get the job done. He talks a lot about the eight years he could serve in office. Of course, if Donald Trump is reelected, he can only serve one more term. That's one distinction. Also electability, that's becoming a central argument of both of these candidates in the final days of this race. The Florida governor yesterday was making the argument to voters that he said Donald Trump simply can't win. He pointed out the midterm election result from President Trump's time in office. Nikki Haley has been also talking about electability, looking ahead, past this primary, saying she has the strongest showing against President Biden. But, of course, before any of that can happen, they must convince these Iowa Republicans that they can actually compete going forward. So Nikki Haley maybe looking for perhaps a few more moderate Republicans. Ron DeSantis may be looking for a few more MAGA conservatives, if you will, who are simply looking to turn the page. But at the end of the day, they are trying to not only peel away some Trump support but also motivate some Republicans who may be sitting on the sidelines wondering what the outcome to all this may be, Jake.",

And he hopes if he can get all his paperwork in, if those appeals are resolved in his favor, then they can move to trial faster. But that is not how the Trump team is describing it. They insist that this is political. Many of these motions, as you would expect, are critical of the defendant, former President Trump, but the Trump argues that Smith is operating as an arm of the Biden campaign and they have a list of things that they want the judge to do in response. They want Smith held in contempt. They want him to withdraw his motions, be forbidden from submitting other motions, and then assess monetary sanctions in the amount of Trump's legal fees for dealing with these additional filings. Now, look, the judge overseeing this case, she too has expressed the desire to move things along quickly. It's unclear how she'll rule here.

Do you think Judge Chutkan will actually comply with this request, to sanction special counsel Smith? JIM TRUSTY, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY:  Yeah, too early to know. I mean, we haven't seen a response from the special counsel's office yet. You know, normally, Jake, when you're talking about stayed proceedings, where there's been a court order either by the trial court or an appellate court to stop everything, that's usually reference to simply ongoing hearings, litigation, court appearances. So it struck me that this is very different, at least from the reading of the Trump motion. When you read the motion, it says, no, we actually talk very specifically to the judge and she agreed that this was something where we are staying all the activity. In other words, don't give us motions during this period, don't give us discovery, and they complain about getting 4,000 pages of discovery and some motions that had been filed by Jack Smith. They complain about the substance of the motions, too. But they're basically calling fouls, saying a stay means a freeze. And I think that's interesting. I mean, it's kind of new territory for me. I don't usually associate that with a stay. But if the truly created a record that established this is supposed to be a freeze from the burdens of litigation, that the phrase that use, then nothing has some life. It has some potential.",

But first, we do want to warn our viewers, some of the content of this report is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  The familiar innocent school of a child, but this child has been through the unimaginable, one of nearly 100 patients evacuated from Gaza to the Dixmude, a French helicopter carrier turned hospital ship, kitted out with specialist medical facilities. Doctors here say they've already carried out 130 operations and just over a month, with patients as young as three and injuries spanning severe burns to amputations. We were going to bed at night. I remember, I covered my face with a blanket, this 10-year-old Mahab (ph) says. Then, suddenly, I found myself in a hospital. I don't know what happened. Like many his age, Mahab's dream was to become a footballer. The aftermath of the airstrikes still painful in Mahab's memory. Twenty-two-year-old Mohammed was also evacuated in December, after his leg was severely injured. His aunt says that Mohammed's learning difficulties mean he's unable to fully across the horror they've left behind. When we call our relatives in Gaza, there are always airstrikes around them, Nisreen says. They've been displaced over and over again. They keep being told to move to the safe areas, but there isn't a safe place left in Gaza anymore. The photos of family members killed seemed endless. Nieces and nephews, children seen in this video all killed, she says, when Nashilta (ph), a U.N.-run school, was struck. I hope I can return to Gaza, to pay with whatever family I have left. I just hope they will be okay. That's all we can hope for in this life. Holding on to that hope, grows more difficult with each passing day. And while that medical team here does its best to heal the physical wounds of its patients, it's clear that the emotional scars of this war run deep. When the patients arrive here, they all have this look in their eyes, one which makes you feel they have come out of something very, very difficult, Dr. Huber says. It's a bit shocking for us. We are not used to seeing this, especially from children. Inside Gaza, death seems near impossible to escape. And for the thousands wounded, there is not re-spite. The vast majority of hospitals in the strip are no longer operational. Doctors, forced to work under Israel's unrelenting airstrikes, with limited medical supplies. Only a small handful of more wounded have so far been evacuated. Facilities like this are few. The evacuation process, precarious. And while the shuttered poppies of these survivors are now slowly on the mend, some have turned their minds to remolding the fragments of their lives back home. Gaza is my home, even if I die, I want to die in Gaza, Abdel Raheem says. We'll rebuild everything, even if we have to start from zero. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
