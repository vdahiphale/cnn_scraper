It's America's deadliest fire in more than 100 years. At least 96 people have been killed in Maui, Hawaii after wildfires fueled by powerful winds tore across the island at speeds of a mile a minute. You can see here at the terrible impact on the historic town of Lahaina, which became ruins overnight. A search and rescue efforts continue. It is believed that the death toll will grow. Island residents who survived have lost family and friends to the fires, as well as livelihoods. Take a listen to this firefighter describe what the situation is like. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, just picture us perched on a cliff, about 300 meters above the sands of these Pacific Ocean beaches, and when people come through these checkpoints, they are really assessing what if anything can be saved inside of the disaster zone and thinking about how first responders, in the next few weeks and months, will be finding the missing. But in terms of the sense of -- I should say, shared sense of trauma, Bianna, it's not spectral, it's not private, it is out in the open.

And the suffering here is something that people want everybody around the world to know about that this isn't a housing and community, this is a community of hardworking people who are trying to save the tradition of the, you know, old royal Hawaiian kingdom which existed up into the late 19th century, and vestiges of that which were so present in Lahaina may be lost forever.

But generally, we have entered a path of maybe not militarization as Mr. Shoigu has just said, but trying to build one of the strongest armies in Europe, again, because we -- Poland has been perceived until recently as a net recipient of security. We are now transitioning to the role of net provider of security, also for our partners in the European Union and NATO. You know, Russian officials, Mr. Shoigu being one of them, love to wallow in kooky conspiracy theories. We have also heard his remarks about our willingness to invade Western Ukraine. Of course, those remarks are as outlandish as it gets, and we have already rebutted many of those allegations on multiple occasions. There is, of course, a kind of rivalry in that part of the world, but I think nobody has any doubt whatsoever who is the aggressor and who has committed profoundly to defend their borders and their security in central and eastern Europe.",

I saw exactly what you said, right, a precocious sort of bubbly ingenue brimming with personality. Speaking in complete sentences. My aunt, you know, staccato sentences, I would say, at best. She had access to her inner life, had been encouraged to think, how does this make you feel? Mad, sad, happy? You know, she has -- she can add, she can subtract. She is -- can do a tiny bit of reading. This is what happens when you have state subsidized interventions, starting from the time you are zero years old, you can get occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy. The public school took Emma and she had this explosion of speech. She went from having essentially nothing to talking, because she was surrounded by peers who did. They provided supplementary reading and all -- speech and all these kinds of resources for her. And as you point out, she has this heroic mother and terrific dad. They're both highly involved and they've dedicated their lives to trying to figure out how to make learning an enjoyable, tactile, kind of multi-sensory experience for her. It's just night and day.",

I was probably doingit as I was reading your description of this family and of Emma's thriving surroundings. As we close here, I -- you know, the part of the story that stood out to me the most, I would say, that I still think about, is the caretaking that your aunt received the last two decades of her life, a polar opposite from what she experienced in the first several decades of her life, and that is thanks to people who you call the hidden saints, and that is Carmen and Juan Ayala. And these people took 23 years of their lives to care for your aunt as if she were their own, until she died of a heart attack in May. And I'd like to read a passage from the piece, about the love and the bond that your aunt developed with this family. And I'm going to read to your description of Adele's funeral. We buried Adele three days later. It is a gorgeous afternoon, perfect really, but the incongruities and dissonances of the hour are hard to. Here we are, having a Jewish funeral for a woman who has never been exposed to the Jewish tradition her whole life, while those whose lives have been most brutally upended, those who have spent the past 24 years loving and caring for Adele are Catholics. My aunt will be buried next to her mother, forever reunited, while the woman whom she called mommy who just four nights ago rubbed Vicks VapoRub on her back and brought her tea because she had a cough will go back to a house with an empty twin bed. That was so beautifully written and a wonderful tribute to this family. But can you talk about that, and I'm sure the comfort knowing that your aunt had this lovely family taking care of them that this brought you and your mother?",

It's a healthy democracy, probably healthier than our own, and it's facing a violent fascist imperial regime that is attacking it, setting up concentration camps and the territories it occupies. And so, I felt, especially, as a child of holocaust survivors, an anti-fascist, that I had to be here and support and to talk to people about what they're going through. And then, secondly, I'm a philosopher.

It's inarguable that they face a cultural genocide because, in the occupied territories, Russia forbids the Ukrainian language, they replaced textbooks to erase Ukrainian identity. But there's a slightly different structure, let's say, with British colonialism. The British, when they occupy the country, they didn't think that the Kikuyus in Kenya were actually British. They wanted to make them British. They wanted to civilize them in the language and -- of colonialism. They were seizing their territory and pushing them off into reserves, but they wanted to erase their identity. This phrase, Africans have no history, was part of the colonialist mindset. Here, it's somewhat different. The Russian ideology, the Russian national ideology is that Ukrainians really are Russians and that they've invented this identity, a fake identity, and the fake identity is all about being anti-Russian. And so, the reason I'm worried about genocide is because you have this conception that in Russian ideology, that as long as there's Ukrainian identity, it's an existential threat to Russia because it's this is anti-Russian identity. And so, that's very much like what Hitler thought, what the Nazis thought about Jews, that they were just there on the planet to destroying (INAUDIBLE). And so, it isn't like British colonialism and that there's no even pretense of a civilizing mission. I mean, I think the pretense was, you know, a pretense and not correct.",

I think Ukrainians by constantly identifying themselves with Europe, and western values are losing allies, they're losing allies who are victims of American imperialism, they are losing allies who suffered under European great powers and the scramble for Africa that was decided on in the 1984 Berlin conference. And so, those are valuable allies. The acts -- the former colonized countries in Africa, victims of U.S. imperialism in Latin America should be on the side of Ukraine.

And the second is to avoid being thecountry -- becoming the country that Vladimir Putin falsely says Ukraine is. Ukraine, unlike most democracies in the world, has no far-right -- has almost no far-right representation in its legislature. It has held off the kind of extremism that you find in antidemocratic far-right, quasi-fascist extremism. You even find in its European neighbors to its west, like Hungary. But the worry is that, you know, Putin is saying Ukrainians are really like the Ukrainian nationalist who allied with the Nazis. They're like Stepan Bandera who was a profound anti-Semite, who participated in the massacre of Jews, and that's in Ukrainian history. And the concern is that coming out of this war, Putin will win. If he doesn't, he's not going to win on the battlefield. The world, I hope, will prevent that. And Ukraine, the Ukrainian armed forces will. But if, emerging from that, they lose the second war, the war for their identity, the war for their soul, as it were, you know, that would be deeply tragic. We've been talking throughout about how to avoid really bad nationalism. And so, you could nationalism, you learn a lot about your country, but you learn the bad and the good. And if you only learned the good parts of your country or exaggerated versions of the good parts of your country, you risk falling into a kind of nationalism that undergirds fascism. So, I've been saying, look, Ukrainians did have complicity in the evil empire that is the Soviet -- the imperial empire, that is the Soviet Union, the problematic, you know, evil empire, that is the Soviet Union. And Ukrainians -- Ukraine did have a history of antisemitism. You -- there was a version of Ukrainian nationalism that was associated with a narrow conception of the people, the nation, that excluded Jews and resulted in great violence.",

So, it's hard for them to look at figures in the past who were nationalists but also, you know, committed acts of great violence against the Pols, against Jews, and completely denounced them. But I have emphasized that -- I've tried to emphasize that you're going to have to avoid fascism, to avoid the kind of nationalism that underlies fascism, you're going to have to embrace the bad and the bad aspects of your history as well as the good ones. And then, we've been talking about how to treat national minorities, especially the problem of how to treat, you know, monolingual Russian speakers when this is over, you know, we've been talking about the importance -- you know, how, when you're so angry at them. And in general, like the importance of representing people, different minorities. One of the things that has really impressed me about Ukraine, it's one of the most loved families is the Nayyem family. They're Afghan refugees, and they're incredibly patriotic Ukrainians. Mustafa Nayyem is now the head of the agency for reconstruction and infrastructure, which is obviously important. So, that will help against the bad version of nationalism.
