Authorities say there is a, quote, armed and dangerous, unquote, person on or near the campus. The Governor Roy Cooper now pledging all resources to capture the person he is characterizing at the shooter. Moments ago, a law enforcement source told CNN that federal law enforcement has responded to the scene but at this point, there was no information, at least not yet, about anyone being shot. Right now, we're getting information in about a situation where somebody is armed and dangerous. But we do not yet know if anybody on the campus in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, has been wounded or shot in any way. We're going to go now to former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis. Ed, right now this is an unusual situation. Moments ago, local schools around the UNC campus at Chapel Hill were told they were clear to dismiss students. What does that tell you about what might be going on right now?

And so this real uncertainty, especially in the immediate vicinity of where the incident happened, right? You've got to keep that place locked down until you could clear every room, every area where the suspect might be hiding.

So people are all working together on this. There is going to be a command post set up. That information is being fed to the command post, but, you know, as you're managing an incident like this. There is the incident, which is critical, making sure everybody is safe and your office is safe and doing everything that is humanly possible to maintain safety.

That date could have a major impact on the president's race. It's scheduled right before Super Tuesday. One day before Super Tuesday.We're joined by Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Thanks for joining us. So, Governor Christie, your reaction to the federal judge setting Trump's trial on the special counsel election interference case, setting it for early March of next year, while you're also a former federal prosecutor, a former U.S. attorney. Is that too soon? Too far away? What do you think? CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it's a realistic date, Jake, given that it is a one-defendant case. I remember talking to you at the time of the indictment and there is question about why did Jack Smith just indicted Donald Trump and have six unindicted co- conspirators? I think today is the reason why he did that. He decided to get this case moved to trial. He had to restrict it to one defendant. He indicted the person he felt was most culpable. And today, I think what the judge did was two fold. One, she gave them another six months to get ready for trial. In a single defendant case. And, two, she made it quite clear to the Trump legal team that the public relations games that they and their client play are not going to impact the decisions that she makes in the courtroom. And, so, I think for Republican voters, the biggest thing they have to look at now is we're going to have a guy running for president who from March 4th, probably for the next four to six weeks will be every day in a courtroom in Washington, D.C. and not campaigning against Joe Biden. This is disastrous for the Republican Party.

Those are just some of the hateful attacks against racial minorities within past few years and today, it's Jacksonville, Florida. Jacksonville, Florida, reeling from an all too familiar form of hate and violence in the United States. Let's bring in CNN's Brian Todd. He's outside the Dollar General store in Jacksonville. And, Brian, we are learning more about what happened when that shooter initially shopped at Edwards Waters University, a historically Black college, before killing three people at the store where you are right now.",

[16:45:09] That security officer's named was Lieutenant Antonio Bailey. Lieutenant Bailey said that he was tipped off by a student that the shooter looked out of place on the campus of the university. And then he approached him. Here's what he said happened next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. ANTONIO BAILEY, EDWARD WATERS UNIVERSITY POLICE OFFICER: There was a individual that was putting on tactical vests, putting on gloves and putting on a mark and hats. And at that time, you know, I just wanted to approach the vehicle and figure out what he was doing on the university property. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the sheriff of Jacksonville, TK Waters, had said earlier that the shooter did have an opportunity to attack people on the campus and didn't take it. Jake.",

And that was one of the things they said, that they immediately called JSO, the sheriff's office in progress while they were pursuing the suspect.So, I'm looking to get more information. We were briefed by the FBI, by the sheriff's office and so many others. But then the question then exists why wasn't that person stopped since they were trespassing on the campus of Edward Waters? What was it that allowed them to get away? And I certainly appreciate that there were the things that that security department did, but I want to look at what can be done differently. And I want you to take into this account, Jake, we were supposed to be there, we meaning my colleagues on the council and so many others, Secretary Marcia Fudge, we partnered with her for the House party. And so, the House party event was scheduled to be at Edward Waters on Saturday. However, we ended up moving the victim to the state college, Florida State College, about two miles away because there was an issue with the pipe that caused the air conditioning to go out. So -- but by happenstance and, of course, due to the blessings of God, we ended up not being in that space. This could have been so much worse.",

One of them, ones that I have, those who are put under the Baker Act, which the gunman was under as a teenager, they're not allowed to legally purchase guns. The Baker Act is a law that allows people to be involuntarily detained and examined up to 72 hours when they're undergoing a mental health crisis.Jacksonville sheriff says there was nothing indicating that the gunman couldn't own any guns. Do you think Florida's laws when it comes to this intersection of people with severe mental health problems who are dangers to themselves and others, and gun laws, do you think it's strong enough?",

When you start having those conversations and you want to get rid of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, you are planting the seeds of discord.
