A horrific chain of events and a fast rising death toll in Seoul. Right now at least 146 people are confirmed dead.This happened at a Halloween festival. And I want to show you some of the scene. We have to warn you, though, the video you're about to watch is graphic. It is a horrifically chaotic scene on the streets of Seoul, South Korea tonight as people perform CPR on others on the ground where they fell. The fire department chief there saying the cause is presumed to be a huge uncontrollable crush of people. We still do not know what led to that crush of people. But the White House, at this hour, is now weighing in. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan wrote, \"The reports out of Seoul are heartbreaking. We are thinking about all those who lost loved one and hoping for a quick recovery for those injured. The United States stands ready to provide the Republic of Korea with any support it needs.\" Let's get right to CNN's Will Ripley who has been up all night covering this. He is right there on the scene for us as he has been all afternoon here in the United States. Will, you've been speaking to witnesses. What more are you learning about what happened?",

When you're talking about 146 people at least killed, that's a death toll that has almost tripled since we arrived here on the scene a number of hours ago. And these are not necessarily just locals. These are foreign students. These are young people, mostly, late teens, early 20s.And I spoke with a witness who says that he was here with his friends who were American service members. So there are more than 30,000 U.S. troops stationed here in South Korea and Halloween is a popular day to take off, take leave and come here to Itaewon, the nightclub district in Seoul, that is always packed on Halloween. And yet this year, the first year post-COVID restrictions where there's no limit on crowd size, it was especially packed. And I want to show you just this massive, massive police, firefighters, law enforcement presence out here. You're now up to more than 1700 people who are on the scene investigating because they have two really, really urgent tasks. One is happening at hospitals throughout the area and morgues where they're trying to identify these people, and let the families know because there are so many families that have not been able to get ahold of these young people who were out celebrating on Halloween night. I mean, the hotels are fully booked. People have been coming in, even flying in from around the region to come here to Itaewon to celebrate. But a lot of people don't know if their loved ones are OK, if their friends, if their children, if their family members are OK. And so identifying the victims, notifying families, but also starting to look very closely at the cause because one thing that people keep telling me repeatedly out here is that yes, it was crowded, but I talked to one person who's lived here for 10 years who said it's crowded every Halloween. Why this Halloween? Is it possible for me just to show our viewers here? Thank you. Can we just show them the streets, sir? Is that possible? Thank you. Thank you. We just want to show people how narrow this street is. Charlie, just get up here, right up here to the green tape here. So this is the street where it happened. OK. And you can see, Jim, just how narrow it was. And if we pull up the pictures that was given to me by one of the young men, a 22-year-old who was actually, you know, partying here, it was full of thousands and thousands of people. And OK, we'll step right back here. Thank you so much. And he actually described for me what it felt like when all of these people were so packed together. And this was about an hour or two before the incident. So listen to how he described it. He said it was very scary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That's right. And it shows that it's not theoretical when officials warned that all of this political rhetoric, this heated rhetoric we've been talking about for so long could lead to actual violence. It appears in this case that this suspect believed in a bunch of conspiracy theories at least according to a social media online presence that we found where he's posting memes and postings about election fraud, denying the results of the 2020 election, talking about COVID vaccines and conspiracy theories about the January 6th insurrection.This appears to be someone again who's not just on the receiving end of that vitriol but was predisposed to act with violence. And what we're told is yesterday morning in the early hours here in San Francisco, this suspect, 42-year-old David DePape entered the rear of the Pelosi residence and encountered Mr. Pelosi. The speaker was not here at the time. There was an altercation. The husband, Paul Pelosi, of the speaker, he was brutally assaulted during this accident and was eventually taken to the hospital. We learned last night new details about why the police were brought here to begin with. That's according to our colleagues John Miller and Jamie Gangel, reporting that during this altercation, Paul Pelosi was able to dial 911 and left his phone open. He was speaking in code and it was an adept dispatcher who actually heard the altercation, realized something was wrong. She sent the police here. They ultimately were able to tackle that suspect and take him into custody. Jim, he now faces multiple charges including attempted homicide and assault.",

He's currently being held on a litany of crimes including burglary, assault, trespass and battery. And most important, as Josh said, he's being held on charges of attempted homicide which tells you that police and prosecutors believe the intent here was not just to attack, not just to injure, but an attempt to actually kill. And we'll see what degree this is.The suspect is going to be arraigned in California court on Tuesday. If the police can establish, if prosecutors can establish that this was deliberate and premeditated then it should be a first-degree attempted homicide which means he'll face potential of life in prison. I thought it was notable that the police chief went out of his way to say at the press conference that in their view this was intentional. To me, that suggests that we will see those most serious charges here.",

You can have both state and federal charges for the same conduct. We saw that for example in the killing of George Floyd. Those police officers were charged both in the state of Minnesota and federally.It is a federal crime to assault or certainly to kill or attempt to kill either a public federal official or a family member of a public federal official so long as prosecutors can show that the reason, the motive had something to do with that public official's performance of their public duties. And so that's why the evidence here that we've heard of this individual calling where is Nancy, and that kind of thing is going to be so important because if the authorities can tie this attack to Nancy Pelosi's role as speaker, to her work as a member of the House of Representatives, then you will have federal charges of attempted member of a family member of a federal official.",

So that's just in the last three or four days, those things have happened, those cases have come to fruition, Jim.

And in fact there's been a major development in the case of a man who threatened him and his staff, Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California, he joins us now.Congressman, thanks very much for joining us. And my apologies that this is what we're going to have to talk about here rather than all of the other various issues that the voters are looking at heading into the election. But as you know, and our viewers may not, a Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty to one count Friday after the Justice Department says he threatened to kill at least three staffers and a, quote, \"beat the S-H-I-T out of the congressman,\" referring to you, of course. And that he had several AR-15s. He could spend five years in prison. What's your reaction to this plea and this overall threat environment that is -- just seems out of control right now? REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Thanks, Jim. And as you alluded to, this is, you know, one of many threats. In fact, you know, if you had reached out to me, you know, to ask, you know, which threat this was, and frankly, I told you I was going to have to look it up because we get dozens of voice mail threats, threatening to kill me, my family or my staff each week. And so when we heard about a plea, like that's great. But this is just kind of a drop in the bucket for what's out there. So I'm grateful to the FBI, the DOJ and the Yonkers Police Department. My staff is grateful as well. But we're seeing political rhetoric, violent political rhetoric, is on the rise and we're a country of unrestricted weaponry. And that's makes this just so volatile and combustible. But, Jim, what really frustrates me is that leadership has -- lack of leadership has consequences and inaction has consequences. And when I see my Republican colleagues fail to condemn the political violence that's out there or in many ways like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert glorify it, it inspires others and it gives them a permissive lane or a green light, if you will, to believe that it's OK to do this.",

You know, things you do in your life that you love and enjoy. But for these people that making threats, their Facebook pages look exactly like Marjorie Taylor Greene's Facebook page or Donald Trump's Facebook page. And that's the problem is that they adopt what they hear from leaders in the Republican Party and because it's not condemned by other leaders like Kevin McCarthy, they go out and they carry out the rhetoric in a violent way that they are hearing. And that's really the problem. The only antidote to this is unity among the Democrats and Republicans at the highest levels to say that this is not acceptable.

The staff members, you know, work at the Capitol so they're most likely, you know, to be the victims of one of these threats.But we don't have the funding and the resources right now. And Republicans have blocked our efforts, you know, to protect family members. And so I share the frustration that Adam has because we've been told the same thing that we acknowledge that you have a high level of threats. We just don't have the resources to protect you. And frankly, the number of people in the last two days who have texted me, you know, different, you know, firearms that I should buy to protect my family is just disturbing because that is a deterrent to people wanting to go into public service is if you think that you have to arm yourself to the teeth or have public security. One other part of this, Jim, my staff, my chief of staff told me today that she spends up to 10 hours every week, in her work week, just dealing with the FBI and the Capitol Police about the threats coming into our office. So it's actually affecting our ability to serve our constituents. And so it's just -- it's dizzying.

Unfortunately, it was a pattern in this debate where John Fetterman was addressing issues directly. They were asked a simple question, yes or no to raising minimum wage to $15. John Fetterman was a yes and he gave his reasons why. The other side went around and around the mulberry bush and you never heard the response to that. John Fetterman was very clear about Roe v. Wade. He supports it. You heard a lot of talk from the other side. The third issue I thought that stood out as well was the issue of crime and gun violence. Both candidates were asked, where do you stand on the bill passed this summer? The first time the NRA was defeated in the United States Senate in 25 years. John Fetterman said he would have supported the bill. The other guy talked about around it and basically said he wouldn't support the most commonsense set of gun measures that even conservative Republicans supported. But if you are in the pocket of the gun lobby, I guess you don't support it. So John was very direct and I think people noticed that.",

John Fetterman is going to be supporting in the United States Senate the kind of legislation that I've supported. Like supporting the COPS Program.We have a vote in March of this year. It went by everybody but here are the facts. We have voted in the House and the Senate this year on the COPS Program, on the Burn Justice Assistance Grant, on Homeland Security, border security, all in the spending bill. More than three-quarters of Republicans voted against it. They voted against the COPS Program. John Fetterman will vote for it. And his record as a mayor -- the reason he ran for public office was to help the crime problems in his home city of Braddock and to work with the police. They reduced the loss of life through gun violence over the course of five years. So he's got a record on fighting against crime. He's a Democrat who will support these bills. Based upon the votes this year of the Republican Party, they are the party of crime in Washington. Based upon their votes. Let them explain why they voted against the COPS Program, $512 million. Why did Republicans vote against $675 million that goes to courts and prosecutors to fight crime? They have no answer for them. I think we should emphasize that as people go to vote.",

On the phone was this woman who said not only should James Brown's death be investigating, he was murdered, but she had evidence that could possibly prove it.It came from an unlikely source. This woman was, at the time, the singer, the main featured singer for the Carson and Barnes Traveling Circus. My first question is, how could she possibly know this? I was a little bit skeptical at first. I thought, this is so unusual, so out there. Could it possibly be true? So I kind of put her off for a while. She kept calling, texting. Finally, my editor said maybe go see what she has. So months later, I did. It turned out she did have quite a lot of evidence. As wild as her claims sounded to begin with, I was able to find corroboration for many of them.",
