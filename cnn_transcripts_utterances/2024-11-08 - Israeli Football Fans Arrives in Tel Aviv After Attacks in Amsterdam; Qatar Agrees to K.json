Israeli football fans are arriving in Tel Aviv after attacks in Amsterdam that have been condemned as anti-Semitic. The U.S. has charged a man living in Iran over a plot to kill President-Elect Donald Trump. And sources telling us Elon Musk joined Donald Trump in a phone call with the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Also, it's \"Zero Day,\" the Taiwanese drama imagining a Chinese invasion. We have all of that and a great deal more. We start with planes that are now arriving in Israel after the government chartered flights to bring home its citizens from the Netherlands. It follows attacks on Israeli football fans in Amsterdam. Attacks have been condemned by officials as anti-Semitic. The police are saying as many as 35 people have been injured. More than 60 people have been arrested. The heads of the Netherlands Central Jewish Council are calling the attacks unacceptable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHANAN HERTZBERGER, CHAIRMAN, CENTRAL JEWISH COUNCIL (through translator):  Yes, people feel it. But people are not safe either. That's clear. What happened last night is really terrible. People went to a football match and came back to Amsterdam to have a smoke, a drink, and go to a hotel. And they were just put in a corner by five or 50 men and beaten up. That is unacceptable in Amsterdam. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
