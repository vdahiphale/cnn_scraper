Donald Trump asking the United States Supreme Court, the highest court in all the land, to overturn the Colorado State Supreme Court ruling that took him off of the ballot under the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist clause. Now, Team Trump says, one, he's not an insurrectionist. They say what happened at the Capitol on January 6th, the crowds breaking into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to literally run for their lives, threatening to hang the vice president of the United States, wasn't even an insurrection.

But wait, there's more, because the Oregon Supreme Court could soon rule on a bid to remove Trump from their primary and general election ballots because of his role on January 6th. Now, the Supreme Court is in the hot seat now, all nine justices, assuming they all don't recuse themselves. But why did Donald Trump wait until now?

They chose not to give him that. And what he did after that is refuse to recognize it, ultimately resulting in a violent insurrection. The idea that we're going to do the same thing again four years later and trust the democratic process and somehow have a different result, he's not going to do that same thing, just doesn't seem to hold up.

She joins our conversation now, too. Krista, look, since the last time you were on the show, Maine also found Trump ineligible. Oregon might well do the same. I wonder how you are feeling today now that this is really likely to go before the Supreme Court. KRISTA KAFER, PLAINTIFF IN COLORADO 14TH AMENDMENT CASE: This is where it was always headed, I believe. This is something that the court really needs to weigh in on. They need to weigh in on a couple of different questions, including, is the president an officer? Is he even somebody that this applies to this particular clause of the 14th Amendment? We believe it does. When you look at original language at the time, those that were discussing it, newspaper articles, dictionaries, when you look at all of that, you can see that, yes, at the time, they meant the president and the vice president to be included under that clause. We also need to ask the court, does Congress need to do anything? And there's a Section 5 in which Summers said, well, Congress needs to act. We're saying no. In fact, the plain language of Section 3 says that Congress only needs to act to grant amnesty. In fact, state courts, which can and in many cases must enforce federal law, that these courts, that the state is the right place for -- I mean, it would be great if Congress would act, but we've got states that have laws of the book, including our own, that say that unqualified people cannot be on the ballot. And as somebody who is going to be voting in this state, I don't want to see the ballot cluttered up with people who just aren't eligible to run, whether it be former presidents that have already served two terms --",

But is it all or nothing but some kind of political chess piece, especially during a presidential election year? What is the solution? And is anyone even trying to come up with one?Well, joining me now, Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas. I'm so glad that you are here with us today, congressman. Surely, you have been following not just today, but over the days, the weeks, the months, the year, as the successive presidential administrations. You represent a border district, congressman. And the big question for so many people tonight is, how much longer can this sort of posturing go on when there are real consequences in cities like yours? REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): Absolutely, there are real consequences every single day. You know, what New York and Chicago and Washington, D.C. are experiencing, we've been experiencing this for almost 10 years or longer than that. We see this every day. And what we don't want is we don't want political narratives when people come down and take a few photos and then fit those images in their political narratives. What we want is real solutions. And there's ways that we can solve this. But it's going to be bipartisan. We can't have the speaker say HR2 or nothing. The legislative process doesn't work that way. We got to be able to compromise, give it a little bit, get out of our comfort zones, and get the job done.",

But keep in mind that in the last 25 years, 87% of those asylum claims are going to be rejected. So, there's got to be a better way that we can do this work at the very beginning instead of giving a false hope, a false promise to people that will be here four, five, six years, go in front of an immigration judge and then be told your asylum claim is rejected.",

I mean, Eagle Pass, El Paso, according to Axios reporting account for $33.95 billion annually in trade. That's a very significant amount of money we're talking about here. and yet that is one of the prospects being floated in the negotiations.You also say, congressman, that your constituents want Congress to take an action. Of course, everyone is looking to Congress. You, I'm sure, are aware of that as a member of Congress. Everyone is looking towards what's happening there. But now, some of the 60 House Republicans, led by Speaker Johnson, they are threatening to shut the government down over the border crisis.

It could mean something certainly of an innocent variety. He's a person who potentially likes younger women, not necessarily underage women. And so, I'm not sure that Bill Clinton is particularly liking the fact that this came out. Certainly, Gouffre (ph), who was the initiator of this lawsuit, indicates that she had no dealings or interactions with him. And, as you mentioned, Laura, there's nothing of a criminal or civil variety to embroil and implicate him, but just a mere fact of an association with a person like this, obviously, is troubling and problematic, to say the very least.",
