And the gist of theattorney general's allegations is that Donald Trump, over more than a decade, vastly overinflated the value of his assets. Just to give you one quick example, when it comes to Mar-a-Lago, that had been assessed as a $20 million property. Donald Trump tried to claim that it was worth about $500 million. And the allegation is Donald Trump then took those inflated numbers and used them to get bank loans and lines of credit that he wouldn't otherwise have been able to get. And so, if Donald Trump is found liable, and it's really important to note, he already has been found liable on one of the seven claims made in this case. The judge here found last week that Donald Trump is liable for repetitive, persistent fraud. So, to that extent, Donald Trump has already lost that one count. There are still six other counts that are in play here. If he is found liable, then he will be hit with ultimately penalties, will be financial penalties, and this could cause him to lose his certificate to do business in the state of New York, which would have implications elsewhere, as well.",

And now Michael Cohen appears on the witness list for the attorney general. He could well testify in this trial. Presumably he would testify about just that. Let's remember he was part of Donald Trump's inner circle, his business and legal inner circle. On the other hand, Michael Cohen, of course, will be cross-examined aggressively. He despises Donald Trump. I think that's fair to say. And in the meantime, since he made his first statements, he's pled guilty to various federal felonies, he's completed serving his time.

When those cases get tried, he does have to physically be there. Now, as to the likelihood of him testifying, again, an important difference. In a criminal case, a prosecutor cannot force a defendant to take the stand. But this is a civil case, and so the parties can compel each other, can subpoena each other, and force each other to take the stand. If that happens to Donald Trump, then he has two choices. One, he can testify and perhaps suffer the consequences. Two, is he can take the fifth. He can evoke his right against self-incrimination. But if he does that, in the court we're in here, New York Civil Court, the judge can consider that Fifth Amendment invocation against Donald Trump. Again, because we're in a civil lawsuit context.",

And what did they learn, the Trump team? They learned how to make lemonade out of lemons. Nobody wants to be criminally indicted. Nobody wants to face four of them across 91 felony charges here. But that's the position Donald Trump had found himself in. And so, what they tried to do was lean into that, play the role of victim, fundraise off of it, energize his base of supporters around it and they saw they had tremendous success doing so. His poll numbers went up and he blotted out the sun in terms of attention. The entire story of the 2024 presidential race over the many months of his four indictments were, was just Donald Trump. You didn't -- none of his opponents had oxygen. And so, what the Trump team has learned is let's continue that. Even though he's not being indicted anymore and there will be a lull in terms of awaiting for trials to start, where can we maximize this kind of attention to sort of cut off the oxygen of any political opponent? And showing up in New York when you're not required to do so at a civil trial like this to take on a political opponent in Tish James is precisely the kind of thing they want to be doing to execute on that strategy to dominate the information flow.",

No more lashing these disparate issues together so that the American people's interests are subjugated here on the floor of the House. You know how we should stand up for our border, demand that the United States Senate take up our single subject appropriation bill that funded the border. It created Republican unity. We voted for it. It has the policy demands that the continuing resolution that Speaker McCarthy advocated for on this floor, did not. Our DHS funding bill requires E-Verify. And then hours later after we passed that, the Speaker wanted us to vote for a continuing resolution that didn't include E-Verify. Retreat is never a strategy to win anything. So, Mr. Speaker, just tell us. Just tell us. What was in the secret Ukraine side deal? What commitments were made to President Biden to continue the spending of President Biden in exchange for doing things for President Biden. It is becoming increasingly clear who the Speaker of the House already works for, and it's not the Republican Conference. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that these questions be answered soon, because there may be other votes coming today or later this week that could be implicated by the answers to these questions.

And now we've got this trial, which could be the end to his business empire, as he knows it in New York, at least.

You know, I think what David Chalian was speaking of his lemons into lemonade with regard to four indictments on over 80 counts regarding to his actions as president. This civil trial and the initial statement made by the judge finding sweeping and persistent fraud goes to the heart of his business empire and to the perceptions related to the presidency ultimately, which is that he is a massively successful businessman. What this judge seems to have found in the documentation is persistent inflation of values in the billions of dollars. And the punitive nature of this in the civil trial, not going to a jury, by the way, could cripple his ability to do business in New York, which is where the Trump empire began, in addition to potentially $250 million judgment or more.

But that base that would follow him, no matter what he does apparently in some polling, is around a third of the Republican Party, around 10 percent of the American people. Around a quarter of the Republican Party is opposed to Donald Trump, would not support him. And the rest are persuadable. So, we need to keep in mind when we start prognosticating about that the future that people don't vote until January. I'm not saying it's like -- that any one contender has risen to a likely person who could topple Donald Trump at this point. And polls show, at least in terms of electability, Nikki Haley is the person who does best against Joe Biden compared to, say, Donald Trump. But we don't see any voting in the Republican primaries till January of next year. So, treating this as a done deal, foregone conclusion, Donald Trump's going to be the nominee, I think, is putting the cart ahead of the horse, frankly.",
