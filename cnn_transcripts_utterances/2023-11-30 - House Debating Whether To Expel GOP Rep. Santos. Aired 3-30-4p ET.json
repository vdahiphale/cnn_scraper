Questions about that House Ethics Committee report. Surprisingly, some congressman on the Republican side -- again, Republicans are in control of the committee that put this report together -- saying that it's bogus, that it stinks of politics, really surprising to see some of this.",

      "sentences": "All right. Congressman Matt Gaetz speaking in opposition to the expulsion resolution against George Santos. Let's listen.REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): ... pled guilty to a number of those crimes and continued to serve in Congress. He was in Congress for like an additional pay period after having pled guilty to the very same things that were that -- that Mister Santos has been indicted for. And so, I think it's -- it's persuasive to me that Mr. Higgins and Mr. Nells, two law enforcement officials, with Sterling reputation, are here not necessarily to defend Mr. Santos, but to defend this precedent in this due process that is being shattered. And I was struck when the author of this resolution said the quiet part out loud. He didn't try to shoehorn the expulsion of George Santos into some existing construct or precedent, he said yep, we're making a whole new precedent. We're making whole new rules right now. But he defends that by saying that the new rules are better, that it's a higher standard. So, we should just throw away everything that's happened from the first Congress to the 118th, because the new precedent is more robust. The problem is, it's a lower standard for due process. Without merit. Mr. Speaker, whatever Mr. Santos did with Botox or Only Fans is far less concerning to me than the indictment against Senator Menendez, who's holding gold bars inscribed with Arabic on them from Egypt while he is still getting classified briefings today. But he's not getting thrown out of the Senate. He's getting classified briefings under indictment for bribery. But what, what cause -- cause Santos was buying Botox and Only Fans, we got to throw him out. If George Santos is convicted, he ought to be expelled. But until then, it is an incredibly dangerous thing for people in Washington, DC, to substitute their judgment for the judgment of voters. Winston Churchill said that, you know, in -- in a -- in a democracy, people get the government that they deserve. Well, the people of Mr. Santos's district elected him. And like this is not some district in rural Mississippi with like one newspaper. This is New York City. And George Santos rolls in there, wins. And you know what? It's between him and his voters, him, and the justice system. And the fact that the Ethics Committee has done this incredible violation of precedent will do grave damage to this institution for many years to come. Because now there's no requirement of any conviction. There is a departure from the precedent from the Duncan Hunter matter and many others. And I fear what that may indicate lies ahead for the future of due process in the House of Representatives. I yield back.",

What I ask of my colleagues, again very respectfully on both sides of the aisle, is to just step back from this moment and reflect upon the sacred right of the American people to determine their representation in our representative Republic. This is not a right that has been enumerated for this Congress. The American people run this thing. I believe the people of the third district of New York are quite capable of removing Representative Santos if they choose to do so. In the history of our nation, we have never done what we're poised to do. Since the Civil War two members of Congress have been removed by expulsion, both having been convicted of federal crimes. The people of these United States own the sacred right to remove their representative. This is reflective of our oath, ladies and gentlemen. My -- and I say this sincerely, my beloved colleagues, step back from this egregious act that you've threatened. Reflect upon the American people that we serve. The oath that we've sworn. And allow the people of New York to cast their vote as they see fit. Mr. Speaker, I am prayerful.",

And look, this is so stark, and the difference is what we're hearing. We have people that support Santos who are frustrated with the process and the precedent this has set. Not addressing the issues here.And D'Esposito, the congressman from New York who brought forth this expulsion request, he hit the nail on the head. He said look, you have 23 indictments in a court. You can see your day in court on those charges. But what we found as members of the Ethics Committee is indisputable. You no longer should serve in this body. And that's what they're making their decision on. Look, what is the purpose of having an Ethics Committee if you're not going to expose this kind of behavior and show that there are consequences for these actions.",

And now he's taken to the House floor with just a couple of people behind him there.You know, there are 435 members of the House. He'll get a lot of votes tomorrow, but clearly that's different than actually speaking out loud for him. But he could have responded on the Ethics Committee. He did not. He declined to. So, look, I'm not sure there's much precedent for this. History would show that the only members who have been expelled have been convicted. But all he has done, the mother in the 9/11 burning building the on and on and on history does not provide much of a guide for this at this moment in modern history of social media.
