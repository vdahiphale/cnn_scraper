We're going to break this down for you. And it's not if but when Israel will retaliate against Iran. The region is on edge tonight as Iran warns, don't cross any red lines. A special report on what's happening inside Iran tonight coming up. Plus, Truth Social shares plunging today. Hundreds of millions of dollars erased from the company's market value as Trump followers keep buying up shares. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the hunt for Trump's jury, his criminal jury. And we are down to 32 to potential jurors from this morning's 96. And tonight, the first-ever criminal trial of a former president is officially underway. Now, Trump is required to be there every single day. In fact, he can actually be jailed for contempt if he doesn't show up. And today when the judge read him those rules, he was emotionless as he agreed. According to \"The New York Times\", he actually chuckled when the judge told jurors that he will ensure a fair trial, then when he left the courtroom, he went to the cameras to speak out about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt. It continues and it continues forever. And we're not going to be given a fair trial. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump, according to \"The Times\" appeared irritated throughout the day, paying a lot of attention during jury selection, but did appear to doze off a few times this morning before jury selection began.But then we know Trump. Turn to watch as that first group entered the courtroom and that was around 2:30 Eastern Time today. Many prospective jurors in the back row stretch their necks, lifted their head. They were trying to get a look at the former president. One woman giggled. Our pool reporter was saying, putting her hand over our mouth, looking at the person next to her with raised eyebrows. The reality of it is this, there were 96 possible jurors initially brought into that room, and at least 50 raise their hands when asked specifically about whether they would be biased are not able to be impartial. They said that they couldn't be. And that's honesty. And, of course, Trump only needs one juror to vote against conviction to win. And even based on how Manhattan voted in the last election, as our Harry Enten has pointed out, a random group of 12 Manhattanites would include a Trump supporter that you'd like to think this is not what a jury is going to come down to, but its still important to point out in the context of the words from the former president. And here are some of what we do know about the jurors who were excused today. One potential juror was heard in the hallway saying I just couldn't do it while leaving the courtroom. A few others were excused due to personal conflicts. So now you say, what do we know about the 32 remaining, some of whom might actually be on the final jury? Well, here's a little bit of what we know. We know there's a woman among them who told the court she lives in midtown Manhattan, married without children, works in business development for a venture capital firm, says she likes going to restaurants in the city. Another woman living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan married without children. She works in city government so she likes cooking, artwork, and going to shows. And then there was a man in Midtown Manhattan. He says he's married with a child and works as a creative director telling the court he enjoys hiking and cooking. All three to get their news, they say from \"The New York Times\" and CNN, and two also listed \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Google. Now that is -- that is a Manhattan standard operating procedure on people, but that's what we know so far. Paula Reid is OUTFRONT outside the courthouse. And, Paula, I know I was there with you today and now, you've gotten even more information here as those jurors left the room. Trump making some false statements outside of court where you are about what the judge will and won't allow him to do. So what's the reality of the situation?",

I'm sure there's some people that just wanted to get off because serving on any jury is burdensome for people.But presumably a lot of them are honest and that's how were going to get to a fair and impartial jury. And I say that not just based on this case or what happened today, but really based on 20 years of watching juries, Joey Jackson may have a different view, but I think that when the judge instructs people that whatever your personal beliefs, you have to put that aside and decide this case based on the evidence in the courtroom and that only.

I think today the system worked and why do I say that? Yes, I'm a defense attorney one everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty. We can agree to that. But the reality is, is that this judge has been really gone out of his way to be fair. Why? Generally speaking, when you have prosecutors and defense attorneys in a courtroom and people say I can't be fair. The judge says, come here, let me talk to you then in speaking with that person in essence rehabilitates them to get them on the jury. This judge said, look, to any person who does that because I want to have abundant caution for the fairness of this trial, what I'm going to do is to just excuse them. And so I think that's a system that works. And how else does it work, Erin? It works because in addition to those that are excused because they noted they can't be fair and have bias, you have these challenges for cause. What does that mean in English? It means that of jurors can be fair in an unlimited fashion. If you could demonstrate that they have some kind of bias based on further questioning they will be excused as well. And so I do believe that in essence, you're going to have a fair jury and impartial jury who will be able to adjudicate this case on the merits in the courtroom as they see it.",

There's no number. That peremptory strikes. Those are the ones that are ten. But if a juror has a bias expresses any type of bias, that's called a challenge for cause. It's unlimited. So you've got the question that's going to go through each of the jurors. Then as I understand it, the jurors will be allowed to the lawyers be allowed to follow up with some of the jurors outside the presence in hearing of the other jurors. There's another opportunity to get a juror offered cause. I'm telling you, Erin, it's going to take awhile to pick this jury.

They've shown that in the past. So it doesn't take a kinetic stretch. It takes the kinds of strikes where you can be covert and claim plausible deniability on what exactly happened. Although most people will understand what happens. Yeah, I agree that this is not something that both nations should go to war about because if that happens, the entire Middle East will go up in flames. Iran is not looking good right now, based on the attack the other night, both from their capability, but also the very fact that they get it and most of the region is running contrary to Iran right now and it's changed from most of the region being against Israel just a week ago.
