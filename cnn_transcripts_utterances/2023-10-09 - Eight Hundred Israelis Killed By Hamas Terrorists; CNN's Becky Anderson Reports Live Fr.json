After one of the darkest days in itshistory, with reports of as many as 800 Israelis now killed by Hamas terrorists, Israel's retribution has begun. Tanks and other heavy armor are heading toward Gaza, targeting the Hamas fighters who invaded Israel over the weekend. And already, take a look at this video, Israeli rockets are pounding Gaza. You can actually see the porosity of the assault here. Israel says it has hit over 130 Hamas targets in just the past few hours. And Israel says that it is fighting off militants who are trying to infiltrate the country from the north in Lebanon. It is using artillery and helicopters to stop those terrorists.",

And those hostages, and we're talking about possibly over a hundred, the IDF, the Israel Defense Forceshere, haven't actually put a number on the Israeli citizens who are in Gaza but we know that they are there. And they are there as we witness these fast-developing hours. This is the scene over Gaza right now. Look at this video. Rockets and airstrikes pounding Gaza as Israel prepares for what could be a ground invasion. Israel's Defense Minister says he has given the order for a complete siege of Gaza. That means no food, no electricity, no fuel. But Hamas is not done attacking Israel. Hundreds of Hamas rockets have been fired today with air raid sirens heard here in Tel Aviv and in the holy city of Jerusalem. The Israeli siege of Gaza is complicated by what we've just been discussing, the terrifying pictures of hostages captured during Saturday's invasion. Hamas, as I said, has claimed more than 100 hostages, many of them women and children, who are now being held in various locations in Gaza. And there are fears that this conflict could, could spread north. Israel says terrorists based in Lebanon are trying to get into Israel and Israel is using both helicopters and ground troops to beat them back. Let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman who is following all of these developments and joining us now from Jerusalem. Let's start with these images coming out of Gaza today. I mean the ratcheting up of the Israeli effort to target these military headquarters as they describe them in Gaza. We've seen the smoke from here. We feel the booms here. As the activity goes on, what do you make of what we are seeing at present?",

But as I've been reporting,we've also seen IDF, Israel Defense Force activity to the north. And as I look to my right, I'm looking up the coastline here to northern Israel. And we've seen activity by the IDF targeting suspects, they say, who have infiltrated Israel from southern Lebanon. Nobody has claimed responsibility for those suspects. No one group. There of course are concerns that Hezbollah could get involved in a conflict with Israel. Not an awful lot of evidence to suggest that, as yet. But just let's talk about the significance of the opening up, if that is what we are seeing, of this front in northern Lebanon -- in northern Israel.",

But what we understand is that Israeli helicopters and artillery have been in action, firing on areas inside southern Lebanon. The Lebanese army has said that just an empty house was hit, but it's warned residents of area to stay at home and not to go anywhere near the border, while the Israeli military has told people living in communities along the northern border of Israel with Lebanon to stay inside, as well. Now, Hezbollah has not claimed any responsibility of direct involvement in these activities today, but this really is the wild card in this currently wild situation. The question is, will Hezbollah become involved. If Hezbollah becomes involved, of course, Israel is going to be dealing with a two-front war. And as much as Hamas has shown that its abilities are much greater than anyone thought, Hezbollah is really considered the most powerful, well- equipped, well-trained non-state actor in the Middle East. So, that could change the situation even more radically than it has changed since Saturday morning. Becky.",

In a way this is worse than Yom Kippur because in the Yom Kippur in the '73 war, we faced two very large serious countries like Egypt and Syria with a million and a half soldiers. And although we were unprepared, we managed to fight back. They did not take hold of even a single settlement or kibbutz or moshav, whereas these terrorists coming out of nowhere are still in a certain way holding people hostage and went, you know. And the way they did it was, you know, they've also exposed how evil they are which to us is unprecedented. I mean, I'll say something which may sound maybe far-fetched and crazy but it's the way I feel. I mean, Hamas this time made ISIS seem like Mother Teresa.

And I assume that begins with providing both tactical and strategic intelligence. That includes promises of munitions and weapons and equipment. And we've heard some of that already. And then I think the movement of the carrier, the Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group, to the Eastern Mediterranean, first and foremost, is about signaling support for Israel. It's a carrier with a cruiser and four destroyers. And can provide a lot of fire. But I think that's more about assurance and support. Secondly, it's about deterring nation states. Syria, Iran, for sure. And then I think thirdly, that task force can provide a number of functions. It could be a non-combatant evacuation operation, since we know the airport of Ben Gurion is shut down. Or it could conduct hostage rescues if the Israelis seek our assistance.

At some point, there will be an accounting of what happened and why. And as you note, it was not just an intelligence failure that nobody knew this was happening or being planned. There was a military failure as well. It just astounds me that nobody was guarding the barrier fences along the Gaza Strip. You know, where were Israeli soldiers and troops? That they were, they, the terrorists were allowed to cross in multiple points without being stopped. So, look, there's going to be time for all that.

Where is the condemnation of Hamas? The war crimes committed by Hamas? The fact that they are shelling, continue to send rockets into Israel and bombing towns and cities, the slaughtering of the young people at that festival. I mean, this is another example of the U.N. doing this, you know, each-side-ism and not standing firmly behind Israel, which was attacked and people massacred by these terrorists coming across the border. And it's just ridiculous. And look, I know Hamas doesn't represent many innocent Palestinians who are subject to Hamas rule in Gaza. But if that's the extent of the Secretary General's statement, he needs to do far, far better in terms of explaining what's going on here and taking sides. There's no discussion about Hamas releasing the hostages. Over 100 have been taken, some who were killed, men, women, children, the elderly. It's just -- I expect far more. And hopefully there was more out of that statement, but we'll find out later. So, with regard to the Americans, look, we know nine Americans were killed, maybe some were hostaged. I think the United States role will first of all be diplomatic, trying to work with Qatar, who has a relationship with Hamas, and maybe get them released. But I suspect that Hamas, a reason why they took so many Israelis hostage was to trade them off Palestinians who are held by the Israelis. Palestinian terrorists and criminals, by the way, who are held by the Israeli government, and also has human shields in the conflict that has just begun and will likely continue for days, if not weeks.",

As ordinary Israeli citizens look to Benjamin Netanyahu for leadership in this moment. A lot of people have described this as being a Churchillian moment for Netanyahu. What are they expecting of him in the coming days? ESTHER SOLOMON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"HAARETZ\" ENGLISH: Well, what they expect and what they fear are perhaps two different things. What any country or civilians of a country that has been attacked in such a horrific way would expect a leader to take clear control with the authority of the position that he holds. Unfortunately, that is a bit more difficult in Israel, which has already been through nine months of a government led by Netanyahu that has tried to undermine its democracy.
