And that if he wants to get elected, he needs to go figure out how to appeal votes from other groups, that not may not be with him traditionally.Now, it's a heck of a way to try to campaign and get somebody's vote by talking down to them and saying, yes, go ahead. Get your normal 3 percent, you bunch of losers. I mean, it was -- and he looked pained. He was grimacing during the entire time.

So, in a way -- and because there's no cameras in the courtroom. If there were cameras in the courtroom, and we had seen the Stormy testimony, if we had seen the Michael Cohen testimony, if we had seen all of the things that we would see in a courtroom when there's cameras in it, I think we would all be transfixed. We would all have been watching this 24/7.
