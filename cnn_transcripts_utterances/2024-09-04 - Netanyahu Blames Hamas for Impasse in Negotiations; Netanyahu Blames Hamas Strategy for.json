But we are firm on our red lines, including the Philadelphi Corridor, for the reasons I have described here. I'm flexible where I can be. I'm firm where I have to be. I think there is the possibility of getting this deal if we stick to this strategy. I said before, we got 150 hostages out because we combined a firm stance with military pressure. And I said that Hamas, after that, relied on international pressure, but it had weakened. And then we went into Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor, so it got strengthened. And they were beginning to balk. A condition that they said they'd never accept, a red line, is that we must commit to getting out of Gaza and enabling Hamas, basically, to take over Gaza again. End the war. Get out, let them retake Gaza. That's obviously something we couldn't do. They said there'll never be a deal. Well, they started caving in there after we took the Philadelphi Corridor. And then, they started backing off. You know why they waited? Why they started backing off? Because they waited for Iran to start a general war with Israel. That didn't happen. So, then they waited for Hezbollah to start a general war with Israel. That didn't happen either. So, now, they resort to the final tactic, they're going to sow discord and create international pressure, again, using the hostages, even after the murder. And this is something that's not new because they started this a year ago. You should see this. I mean, this is their tactic. This is Hamas orders for psychological warfare found in Hamas underground command post on January 29th. That's right after the beginning of the war, 2024. And this is the original document in Arabic. Our soldiers found it. And here's what it says. Push photos and videos of hostages. Put it out in the media. Because, that creates enormous psychological pressure. Who's not affected by it? Any human being seeing these souls, these girls these people, young people, from those dungeons, you're affected by it. Second, increase psychological pressure on defense minister. Third, continue blaming Netanyahu. And fourth, claim ground operation will not release hostages. That's Hamas' not only -- that's not only their talking points, it's their strategy. And their idea is, this will sow internal discord and increase international pressure on Israel. That's what they hope to achieve. And they hope -- they think this will happen. Well, it won't happen. I can tell you why it won't happen. I'll tell you why they'll fail. Because overwhelmingly, the people of Israel are united. They understand everything that I said here. Overwhelmingly. You should know that. It's important. And the second thing is, we're committed to achieving our goals. All three goals. Destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities, releasing all our hostages, and ensuring that Gaza does not become a threat to Israel anymore. And all these require standing firm on the things that will ensure the achievement of these goals. And with God's help, and with our people's will, and with the courage of our soldiers, we'll achieve all goals.",

So, it took -- this was the military plan that the military and the political echelon agreed upon. We were never going to leave -- I was never going to leave Rafah alone, and you know that. And I'm also not going to leave Philadelphi alone. I said that 20 years ago. I said it's critical that we not leave Philadelphi when Sharon did the disengagement, I said we have to get there. So, we got there it took a while to do, but it was a progression. A progression of military advancement that produced the result. So, we're there now. Now, once we're in, now we'll leave? You know, we'll leave, we won't come back. You know it, everybody here knows it. Everybody in here knows what pressure will be brought on us so that we don't come back.

I'm telling you that if we relieve the pressure, if weget out of the Philadelphi Corridor, we're not going to get the hostages back. Certainly, we're going to condemn a lot of them to stay there. We could get a few out. They'll give us that. But they'll leave a lot with them. We won't have the pressure point. And something else will happen, we will not be able to come back. So, we won't release all the hostages and we won't achieve the defenses that we must have to prevent more October 7th again and again and again. That is my responsibility. I can understand the torment of families. They don't -- you know, none of them believe that we'll get the hostages in the first batch either. None of them, few of them, quite a few of them didn't believe it. And they came and they said, you have to get them out, you have to get them out, you're not going to give them out, you have to make this concession or that concession, I didn't make those concessions, and we got them out. So, it's very hard, you know. I don't stand in judgment of these tormented souls, because they're undergoing an agony that is hard to fathom, and I understand that. But the responsibility of leaders is not merely to share the sentiment, the emotion, but also to exercise judgment. The correct judgment to make sure that these horrors do not happen again. I believe that our strategy is the best way to achieve both goals, both releasing, freeing the hostages, and ensuring that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again.",

And this is interesting because as we know, the original deal that was agreed to on May 27th, that was agreed to by the prime minister and by President Biden specifically, would allow Israel to return to fighting in Gaza, if need be, after the first phase of the deal. So, after about six weeks. So, in a sense, it's almost as if he's testing that agreement that was made without calling out President Biden specifically, but suggesting that there would be too much pressure on Israel not to go back, even though that was one of the terms of the agreement that the prime minister also signed off on initially.",

Hamas waslooking for other guarantees, the guarantees that all the troops would leave Gaza entirely. So, again, there were things that may have happened behind the scenes that we're not aware of in the negotiations, but those -- what the prime minister is saying now and the agreement that he was given before don't seem to marry up. And if you listen to John Kirby, as we all did, as you did, of course, a couple of weeks ago, John Kirby was saying, look, the best we can hope for is to get a deal for the first six weeks. It was everyone's understanding that this was a very time limited deal. And the understanding of that was that the IDF, if Hamas provoke them, would be able to go back in. And I think there's one other point here that was brought forward by Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, over the past couple of days. He was on television yesterday and he said, look, just to be really super clear, the prime minister was offered a military technical alternative to having troops along the border there, one that would have solved the problem that could be done without having troops in place that would stop Hamas using those tunnels to resupply and re-equip, which is what the prime minister says is major concern is or had framed it that way. So, there were even, according to his own defense minister, opportunities for a solution there that the prime minister didn't take, which reinforces that impression that he has now created, that he is in effect trying to sort of stymie the deal for whatever reason. But the idea that, A, he could go back in, put troops back in along the border and, B, there was an alternative solution to having troops on the border, that there are to -- I think the public and the listening public here in Israel as well, of course, apparent holes and gaps and really more questions.",

I have a lot of sympathy workinghere in Ukraine as the U.N.'s. highest ranking official for the pleas of government, including the president to be properly supported also in military terms so that they can defend themselves. What I think, in parallel to that, needs to happen is two things. One is humanitarian aid. I mentioned the frontline communities. There's some very vulnerable people there. I met also some people that are in so-called collective shelters and transit centers. So, who've been evacuated, particularly families with children, they need to be supported both in transit and then when they end up, for example, in the west, for example, in Lviv. So, there remain significant humanitarian needs. My predecessor, Denise Brown, who's been on this show, said, the worst thing we can do is to normalize the war in Ukraine. So, there's -- again, there is, of course, as you asked, the military aspect of that, but there is the humanitarian aspect of it. This war is not over, and we need to support and address the humanitarian needs. And then, if I may say something a bit more uplifting, I mentioned I visited a school yesterday in one of the metro stations, underground stations in Kharkiv. They have a total of five of those operational now, and the sixth one just opened with international support. So, where I'm going with this is where there are opportunities to also support recovery efforts, we must do that. I've been really struck in my more than a month here now at the resilience, as we call it, of Ukraine's civilian population and of government. Whenever they have an opportunity, they start rebuilding and trying to -- including trying to provide their children with schooling. And that, I think, deserves every support that we can give.",

In Kharkiv, Ukraine talking about their resilience and ingenuity, just built their first permanent subterranean school. How effective is this in terms of at least bringing some sense of normalcy during wartime in your view? Is it for children? How important is it that they still get to go to school?

So, clearly, the energy sector seems to have been targeted and there's been massive destruction there. I am told by my UNDP colleagues, United Nations Development Program colleagues, that over 12 million households are without regular electricity supply as well as 400,000 businesses. So, we need to do two things. On the one hand, colleagues of mine in the U.N. are trying to help get us -- help the population in particular get through the winter. You know, generators are being supplied. Fuel is being supplied and nonfood items, warm clothing and shelter kits. And in parallel, again, discussions have started with the International Community, including the U. N., on how to rebuild the energy sector and rebuild it in an environment friendly way. So, again, you see the drama, the worry about how will we get through the winter, but you'll also see this enormous energy, excuse the pun, to rebuild the energy sector before the war is even over.",

The paper reporting that it obtained a document showing Prime Minister Netanyahu effectively derailed a deal back in July by introducing a raft of new 11th hour demands. Nic Robertson joins me with the latest from Tel Aviv. And as we heard there, the prime minister defiant saying that he is not moving in terms of his insistence that Israel remain on the Philadelphi Corridor, even if that means that this peace talk, these ceasefire and hostage talks don't move forward.

And so, they really feel like they need to get it right. They've also had a lot of wrongful convictions. And they've gotten a lot of publicity about that. And so, what they've tried to do is putting guardrails. It's a lot harder to use a jailhouse informant now. The police interviews are recorded. And so, there's -- it's harder to get a wrongful -- excuse me, a false confession. They make it easier for you to apply for a new trial. Like if you're in prison and innocent and new evidence comes forward, they make it much easier for you to actually get access to a judge and present that evidence. And the most important thing that they've done that a number of states have followed is that they have created what's called a Conviction Integrity Unit. That's a unit that got Ben out. And in that unit -- it's a unit within the prosecutor's office. And what they do is they take on dubious convictions and they reinvestigate them top to bottom. And it is probably the most powerful tool that Texas or other states have right now for undoing wrongful convictions. And that's what got Ben out.",

What began as a student-led protest against government quotas in early July morphed into a mass uprising. After Hasina, who'd been in power for more than 15 years, ordered police to open fire on the crowds. Over the following weeks, hundreds of people were killed while thousands were arrested.",
