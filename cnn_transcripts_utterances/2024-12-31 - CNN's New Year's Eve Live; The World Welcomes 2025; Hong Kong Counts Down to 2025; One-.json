He's known for his contributions to the musical subgenre Shibuya-kei, which is a Japanese indie pop that really set off in the 90's. It was an amazing performance. And really, in the past hour or so, we've seen a gorgeous projection map on the skyscraper right here behind me. We're in the heart of Tokyo, in Shinjuku.

I will try my best to do something special for my fans. Stay tuned. (END VIDEOTAPE) MONTGOMERY (on camera): I mean, talk about an icon here, Kristie. He is just so humble. Of course, even though he is so well known across the world. Shout out Taeyang for making the time earlier in December to sit down with us.

A little different surroundings this year. Last year, I was about a mile down the Chao Phraya River, on the rooftop across from the Temple of Dawn. And tonight, I am here at ICONSIAM, a truly iconic place to ring in the New Year with crowds that organizers were estimating to be upwards of 70,000 people tonight. And a lot of them are coming here to see one person, a Thai icon, Thai-conic as her -- as her people tell us we need to refer to her because she is truly iconic. She is Lisa. She started her career right here in Bangkok as a 13-year-old, auditioning to join the South Korean K-pop group Blackpink. And we know how that turned out. Blackpink headlining Coachella, topping charts around the world. And now Lisa is on her own, and she's going to be performing here tonight. And we are going to be interviewing her. I have to -- I'm standing here with two Lisa superfans, Vivi and Tata -- Vivian and Sasa. Vivian, Sasa, I don't know where the heck I got the Tata from, but Vivian and Sasa, as you can tell, they're -- they're twins and they are really excited about coming here to see Lisa.

And Julia, here in Asia, look, we got Teayang, we got Lisa from Blackpink. But it all culminates with the climax, which is the ball drop there in Times Square. CHATTERLEY: It absolutely does. And I'll tell you what, I am so excited. It almost feels like midnight already. And I've been here since the small hours of this morning. I'll tell you a secret. This is my first time in Times Square for New Year's Eve. I've watched it on the television. Normally I'm back home in England. So it feels hugely momentous to be one of the 1 million people that are expected to gather here in the coming hours here in Times Square. It's super exciting. The obvious things, and I've got the ball, the sphere, the crystal sphere just in my eyesight here. So I'm keeping an eye on it. That, of course, drops at midnight. But my favorite part of this, which I literally cannot wait for, is the confetti drop that happens at midnight too. And on a lot of those pieces of paper, people have written their wishes for 2025. I'm not going to tell you what I wished but one of my wishes, I hope will be lighting up and falling from the sky later on. It's a hugely exciting evening. And you can already see actually crowds and people starting to gather. Clearly, they're hours early. The great news for me is that, as you can see, the sun is up and it's shining. It's freezing cold, but it's beautiful. Less good news if you're going to be here later, because apparently, it's going to be raining, so you're not allowed to bring umbrellas. You've got to bring your ponchos. But don't worry, we are prepared. And what we tried earlier, I'm going to try it again because my colleague Brynn Gingras is actually down there in Times Square. And if we can get the cameras coordinated, I'm going to try and wave to her so that you see where she is and where I am, too. So, Brynn, can you hear me? I'm up here looking down at you.",

Now, Julia, you were just talking about all these revelers who are about to pack Times Square, waiting, getting excited. Well, look, we even have some here who are standing behind the pens waiting for their moment to get in and start the process of just waiting and waiting and waiting until midnight.
