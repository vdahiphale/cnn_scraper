A car has driven into a large group of people who were gathered at a Christmas market, a quite large Christmas market there in Magdeburg. German media says that at least one person has died. Emergency services are saying that up to 80 people are injured at this count, at this point.Based on CCTV footage from the market that we have seen and verified but are not showing, it is incredibly graphic, those numbers will almost certainly go up. This video that, again, we are not airing at the moment shows a black car speeding through a large crowd of people. And in its wake, you can see debris. You can see bodies on the ground.",

      "sentences": "The driver of that black car is said to be under arrest. And this new video appears to show someone being taken into custody not far from the scene, though at this point it is not clear if that is the suspect. You can see multiple police yelling and surrounding this person as they lay down flat on the ground.Different video then shows that person being led away. That is the footage from overhead, again, not far from the scene in Magdeburg. We have CNN's Fred Pleitgen on the phone with us. Fred, what are you hearing about what happened? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Hi there, Boris. Well, the latest information that we have, and this is coming both from German media and also from the authorities as well, is that apparently this incident, as they put it, started at around 7:00 p.m. local time, 7:04, I think is the exact time. That's about 1:00 p.m. eastern U.S. time. And that this BMW is a black BMW, apparently just plowed very fast, as we saw in some of that surveillance camera video, through a large crowd of people in that Christmas market. You can see people trying to jump out of the way, but very difficult to do because, of course, those market stalls are very close to one another. The aisles are quite narrow, so just extremely difficult for people to get out of the way. And indeed, the latest numbers are that the police is saying that at least one person has been killed and up to 80 people have been injured. So just to show how devastating all of that is, we know that the local hospitals in Magdeburg and in the surrounding area of Magdeburg, it's a pretty big urban area, actually, they are all gearing up for what they know is a mass casualty event. There are dozens of ambulances that we've seen there in the surrounding area trying to get to the scene, trying to help people, obviously, with so many people injured. That is a huge task for the authorities that are on the scene there. We have heard some of the authorities speaking about an attack. Not everybody has. The chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, he's come out and offered his thoughts and prayers for all of those who were affected by all of this. And he also says that it looks like a terrible scene that is unfolding on the ground there. Of course, one of the things that we've been speaking to as this incident unfolded and as we've been covering it is the fact that the security of Christmas markets in Germany has been a major political issue in this country. And obviously, also a major security issue in the country, as well as the whole Christmas market industry is gigantic. And it's really a national pastime here in this country that is known to have become more dangerous since 2016, when there was a large-scale attack on one of the main Christmas markets of the city of Berlin, with about a dozen people that were killed then. So this is known to have been an issue in Germany. This is something that the authorities have been gearing up for. And we know that a couple of months ago, one person was arrested near Augsburg for allegedly planning an attack on the Christmas market there. So the German authorities certainly were on alert for something. Nevertheless, this does appear to be a large-scale incident that took place there in Magdeburg -- guys.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. And in some ways, a soft target, but one that shouldn't have been that soft. I was just looking back.It is what, since 2016, it was December the 19th. So we're only one day off that anniversary when the Berlin attack took place. And that attack, along with Nice, that really opened our eyes to the potential of these sorts of attacks on, if you will, soft targets. But since then, the security apparatus, as Andy McCain was saying, has been put in place that these should not be that soft in a sense, particularly on the Friday night before Christmas, when there would have been throngs of never mind just shoppers, but just people going to have a good time. And to put this into a wider context, still, Germany at the moment is in the middle of a political crisis. It has got, of course, the government of Olaf Schultz has just collapsed. There will be elections taking place in February. And it is once again the far right that looks to stand to make gains.",

My thanks go to the dedicated rescue workers in these anxious hours.Richard, thank you so much for your perspective. Please stand by. We have to take a quick break as we follow this breaking news out of Germany. At least one person dead, up to 80 injured after a driver plows into a crowd at a Christmas market.

German media says at least one person has died. As many as 80 have been injured. We will, of course, stay on top of this story and bring you any more updates as we get them.We do want to pivot to another breaking story we've been following this afternoon. Lawmakers in Washington could vote as soon as tonight on a plan that would keep the federal government from shutting down. Let's get straight to CNN's Lauren Fox live on Capitol Hill. Lauren, we watched the initial deal implode. We watched plan B implode last night. What's the status of plan C as we're hearing that Speaker Mike Johnson is meeting with minority leader Hakeem Jeffries?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, I've kind of lost track of which letter of the alphabet plan we are on at this point. It seems like House Republicans had gone back and forth several times this morning and into the afternoon about how they wanted to approach this.But where things stand right now is they are eyeing putting a bill on the floor that would include a spending bill till March 14th, farm aid, disaster aid, and that they would vote on it under the suspension of the rules. It requires two thirds majority of the House. That means two things. They have to make sure that Democrats are supportive of it in order to get their votes on this package. And it's going to be a huge question whether or not they can maintain a majority of their conference on a vote like that. We know that one of the steps in this process was going to be Mike Johnson needed to have a conversation with Donald Trump and his team about what was in this package, whether they were supportive of it, because what it does not include is an increase in the debt ceiling. That had been an 11th hour request from Donald Trump. And while House Republicans tried to do that on the floor last night, they failed Democrats voting largely against it. And then you had the fact that there were more than 30 Republicans who voted against that plan. Perhaps a nod to the incoming president that they tried their best, but they were unable to get that plan across the finish line. We are still waiting to know when that vote will actually happen. And it's worth pointing out that even if the House is able to move their bill tonight, it still has to go through the United States Senate, where any one member could really slow this process down. I just talked to Senator John Cornyn, the Republican whip, who made clear that what they are learning about this process over the last 48 hours is how to not do things next year.",
