The former president will be placed under arrest. He will likely be fingerprinted electronically then he is expected to plead not guilty to the unprecedented 37 count indictment. Trump is accused of course of willfully mishandling highly-sensitive classified documents brought to his Mar-a-Lago resort after he left office.He's also accused of allegedly conspiring to try to hide these documents these materials material from investigators stashing boxes in unsecured locations, including a ballroom and even a bathroom. Trump aide Walt Nauta is also charged in the indictment. He is expected to appear in court today, alongside his boss, the former president. This historic hearing comes after months of work by Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. It represents frankly a grave turn and the multiple investigations into Donald Trump, as Mr. Trump seeks to return to the White House as the Republican front runner in an already divisive presidential campaign. Our anchors and our correspondents are covering Trump's arrest and arraignment from every angle, including outside and inside the courthouse in Florida where the former president will appear soon. Joining us throughout the coverage, CNN anchor and chief correspondent Kaitlan Collins. She's outside the courthouse in Miami. Kaitlan, what are you learning about what's been happening in Trump world at this critical moment for the former president and for the nation? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: It is a critical moment, Jake. And a lot of his allies you're seeing publicly come in rally to his defense. I'm told that's happening after the former president was up late into the night last night before his scheduled arraignment here at the courthouse right behind me just in a matter of hours from now. He was urging them to come out and publicly defend him as you've seen several of them coming out and doing. But he has also been attacking the Special Counsel Jack Smith repeatedly not only in private, I'm told, Jake, but also as we can see publicly on his Truth Social account continuing almost on an hourly basis to complain about this investigation. About the fact that he is now the first former president to face federal charges. Those charges, of course, that he'll be pleading not guilty to inside the courthouse behind me today. Jake, that is despite the advice of his own legal team who have told him not to attack the Special Counsel, saying it is not in his best interest to have these repeated -- these repeated attacks on them. Of course, he has seemingly ignored that. He has continued to attack Jack Smith publicly going after him. Jake, I will say one thing that I did learn as we were reporting out on his legal team, which is very much still in flux as of this moment. No new attorney was added in time for that arraignment today as he was working on that. But of course, when it comes to the venue here, he is pleased that this is happening here in Florida, Anderson, that it is not being -- these federal charges being filed in Washington. He believes that this venue happening here in Florida, of course, a lot remains to be seen. He does believe it will benefit him. Of course, whether or not it does, that remains to be seen.",

They'll take his fingerprints but we do not expect at this time that there will be a mug shot. Then he's going to go inside the hearing room. Right now, there are many reporters and some members of the public in sight waiting to be able to watch this hearing. The charges that have been filed against him will be read and he'll have a chance to plea. We expect that he will plead not guilty. Now at the defense table with him well, the two attorneys. Todd Blanche and Chris Kise. And as Kaitlan noted, he is getting a little rowdy here. Anderson, I'm going to toss it back to you.",

More have been coming out just in the last few hours.As the hours go by waiting for the former president to arrive. I want to show you the security situation here, Anderson. So, what the police have done is they're using these bikes. This is the entrance into the courthouse. And they have positioned themselves here along the entrance, the perimeter of the courthouse, and then you can see they're using vehicles to block some of the entrances. A little different than what we're used to seeing in these situations. You know, when we were in Manhattan, we saw metal barriers being used, we saw fencing being used to try and secure the perimeter. We're not seeing that. And some people have raised some issues with that. I want to show you more around here, as more supporters have gathered here. And they are really stretched out all along. This street here really just commingled with many of the media. There are some counter protesters, not many. But really the police have not done anything here to separate them from any of the groups, from the media. And then we go out here to the street, Anderson, where traffic is generally open. And what we've been seeing out here is actually supporters driving in their pickup trucks and jeeps driving down this street with flags, waving flags and showing their support. So that's been the scene out here. We had one brief little scare here earlier, the police -- there was a suspicious package, a suspicious item that they cleared. But all else really, it's been peaceful here, as the supporters here wait for the former president's arrival.",

The other part of it is that if you stretch around the block, some of them are gathering just up the block from here. So, it's really hard to tell but it's not a massive presence because they are commingled, you know, we're kind of all together with the media.So it's kind of hard to tell, but I would say, Anderson, probably like a couple of 100 at this point.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So I think it's helpful to break these charges into two categories. First, there are the documents charges. These are counts one through 31. Each of those 31 charges attaches to a specific document that was recovered from Mar- a-Lago. 21 of them were actually recovered by the FBI during the search warrant in August. The other 10 were turned over by Donald Trump's team in response to a subpoena.Now, to explain what this count means. Willful. Willful means intentionally and in violation of law. Retention is the second word. Retention just means to hold on to something, to possess something when you're not supposed to. And then this is important. National defense information. Not classified information. So, a lot of the discussion about where these documents classified, declassified, is not going to matter. What matters is do they relate to the national defense? We see the indictment gives us some detail about that. Then, the second category, we have six counts, that all relate in some way or another to the attempt to obstruct justice. They're sort of called different things, withholding a document, false statements but they're really centered on the subpoena. So in May of last year, DOJ served a subpoena on Donald Trump's team saying, you have to hand us all of your classified, all of your sensitive all of your defense information. Trump then brought in his lawyers, sent them to the storage room where there were certain documents. But others had been removed. But certain documents, the lawyers go through those documents, and they submit a certification, which says we did a diligent search. Here's the documents, we found, there were 38 documents. And that's it. Now, that ended up being very wrong, because a couple months later, there's a search warrant and the FBI finds over 100 more documents. So that certification is the real fulcrum of the obstruction charges. And the theory is Donald Trump and Walt Nauta intentionally misled their lawyers, knowing that the lawyers would in turn intentionally mislead the FBI, and in turn the grand jury. And I should just add, Walt Nauta, the second guy here, he's not charged with the 31 document charges. He's only charged in the obstruction case, plus one other charge for false statements because he lied directly to the FBI.",

Some of these charges have 20-year maxes, some have tens, some have five, if you add them all up at some wild number in the multiple hundreds. Nobody's getting hundreds of years in prison here. Nobody, without any prior criminal history is getting anything near the maximum sentences.If you look at the federal sentencing guidelines, which are advisory, judges have to take them into account, but they're not binding. I ran a sort of rough calculation how this might come out if Trump gets convicted. It comes out to something in the eight to 12-year range. That's a lot. But again, judges can go below that. And what I -- what I do feel confident in saying is if Trump is convicted on the core of this indictment, this is a prison case. The Manhattan case, I don't believe is likely knowing that New York law. That could well be a probation case, this one if there's a conviction, it's a prison case.",

It's anything that if it were disclosed could cause grave damage to the national security. In addition to simply top secret documents, we know certainly from the Mar-a-Lago documents that were seized over from the search warrant, there were top secret documents that were also code- word protected.Documents that were based on signals intelligence, human intelligence, those and some compartmented intelligence. So these are all not additional classifications, but handling restrictions. So once you've gotten to top secret, and it's even more concerning, more sensitive than your general run-of-the-mill top secret documents, documents are limited by who can see them how they're distributed, where they're held, and those are typically referred to as compartmented information. That is quite simply the very heart of the nation's most important secrets on the national security side. It doesn't get any more serious than that.",

And I think that there's a lot of fruitful opportunities there to make motions to dismiss portions of this or all of it for prosecutorial misconduct, for improper disclosure of attorney-client communications, to challenge the sufficiency of the search warrant.And also, to make technical arguments about the applicability of Presidential Records Act and things like that. And so, I think that they're going to have a pretty robust motion to dismiss. You're at the early stages, which, you know, truth be told has nothing to do with the guilt or innocence.
