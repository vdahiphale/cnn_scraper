The charges are really important here. And what they -- what they do as the DA was just laying out, he was noting how the defendant pleaded guilty to the highest charges that were in that indictment. He had put some lower charges in because he wanted to cover all his bases, he said.What this does is this ensures life in prison without parole. The defendant's attorney has said he will not appeal. These are the state charges. They can't say much beyond that because there are still federal charges pending. But this will ensure life in charge -- life in prison rather, without parole. The sentencing will be February 15. Victims' families -- survivors will have the opportunity to speak then. And as you mentioned, 10 people were killed in this horrific shooting, a number of others injured. The DA laying out the evidence with -- that was there including the 180-page document where the shooter talked about his hatred for black people, for Jews, for immigrants, for other minority groups, his plan to carry out these killings, and also talked about how he had looked up how to modify his weapon, modified it himself so that he could kill as many people as possible.",

It got caught up in that tower transmission pulled back there, and they had to wait there for hours, seven hours to be exact, as fire crews and ground crews from power provider, Pepco, used a bucket truck, a cherry picker, to try and get up to them and do this very successful but very delicate rescue.This was not an easy job. They actually had to communicate with the two people onboard the plane via cell phone. I want you to listen now to one of the 100 firefighters who was on the scene here, who describes this very tricky situation to get these two people out of that plane one by one and back onto the ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT GOLDSTEIN, CHIEF, MONTGOMERY COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: One of our concerns is the safety of the occupants in the airplane, the safety of the fire rescue personnel, and the re -- the rescue thereof. We are taking measured and risk-balanced steps to approach this activity and we'll be doing this in a manner which we will aim to extricate these two folks out of the plane. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Why are you not saying anything about this?Because if you see these images of the children with these teddy bears that are dressed in these bondage outfits, I mean, it's really unbelievable that they even made it so far as to actually get published and get posted and actually go viral like it did. So, Kim said, like you said, Kate, that she's reevaluating her relationship with the company and that she actually got on the phone with the executives to tell them, you know, this is incredibly serious, and how are you going to make sure that this doesn't happen again? Now, she didn't reveal the details of that call but you know, she said, that based off of their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with, and the actions I'm expecting to see them take to protect children. Now, Balenciaga is saying we sincerely -- we sincerely apologize for any offense our holiday campaign may have caused. Adding our plush bear bag should not have been featured with children in this campaign. Now, they say that, Kate, they're going to take action. You know, file a lawsuit and go after those that they said put this campaign together and that they didn't have anything to do with those images. So, they say.",

Iran, for their part, as you mentioned, had calls for the U.S. to be thrown out of this World Cup to be suspended for 10 games, but we were still waiting for World football's governing body, FIFA, and are still waiting for any comment from them.But what I can tell you is the U.S. coach, Gregg Berhalter, has just apologized for this. In his pre-match press conference, he says sometimes things are out of our control. All we can do is apologize on behalf of the players and staff. But it's not something we are part of. The U.S. haven't shied away from addressing social and political issues here at the World Cup, but it's obviously not been ideal preparation for what is, without doubt, their biggest match of the tournament so far.

I'm actually a little sorry to hear from Amanda's report that the U.S. coach has apologized.You don't need to apologize for this. This is exactly what this team and what U.S. Soccer is all about. Keep in mind. Of course, this is the U.S. Men's National Team. Earlier this year, Kate, they're the ones who agreed to give up some of their money to the U.S. women so the U.S. women would get equal pay. That's what this team is. It is young American men. Obviously, the Soccer Federation is run by a woman. Cindy Parlow Cone is the president of U.S. Soccer, a 1999 hero from that great World Cup. And so this is what is in keeping with U.S. Soccer and the U.S. Men's National Team. They're very much Title Nine males.
