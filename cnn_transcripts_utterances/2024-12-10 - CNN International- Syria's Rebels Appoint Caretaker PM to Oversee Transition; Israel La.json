Well, the stock markets in New York are going to open in around 30 minutes. Let's check in to see how those futures are doing. As you can see, a mixed bag that's after the S&amp;P and NASDAQ pull back from record highs. We're seeing a slightly softer reality right now, as you can see, basically on the flat line with the DOW Jones 0.2 percent in the red. Well, the rebel coalition in Syria is moving forward to consolidate power. It is named a caretaker prime minister to oversee the transition for the next three months. This after the rebels met with the former prime minister, who agreed to hand over power and cooperate with the coalitions of groups that toppled Bashar Al Assad. Now under the brutal Assad regime, Syrians were tortured, imprisoned and impoverished. Now the new government is bringing new hope for change. CNN's Clarissa Ward has been out on the streets of Damascus, where people are still celebrating. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There were reports today of a naval base being hit, as well as images of helicopters that were destroyed, purportedly in an Israeli military strike. And there's the Israeli government is making clear that they are taking these strikes at a moment of opportunity. And what they are also doing is that they have sent Israeli troops into Syrian territory, into that buffer zone that has seen neither Israeli nor Syrian troops occupy positions there for more than 50 years now, and they are actually going beyond that buffer zone as well. The Israeli Defense Minister said that they had captured several strategic points outside of that buffer zone in Syrian territory. They say it's designed to protect Israel at this moment of vulnerability from a security perspective of uncertainty in terms of who will actually emerge in governance in Syria and what kind of neighbors they will be to Israel. But there are reports of Israeli military personnel as close as 25 kilometers away from Damascus. The Israeli military has insisted that they are not that close, that they are not marching on Damascus by any means, but merely trying to secure their border. The Israeli Foreign Minister also said that these were temporary steps designed to shore up the security situation again at this moment of instability, but certainly a lot of questions about how much longer Israel is going to be able to carry out these strikes before the kind of international condemnation reaches a higher point. And also, the extent to which the new rebels who have taken down Bashar Al Assad and who are preparing to govern Syria. How long will they tolerate this? Obviously, they have their hands full with trying to assemble a government and shore up their position inside of Syria, but there is likely to come a point where they will no longer tolerate these kinds of Israeli strikes on military capabilities that they are very much inheriting.",
