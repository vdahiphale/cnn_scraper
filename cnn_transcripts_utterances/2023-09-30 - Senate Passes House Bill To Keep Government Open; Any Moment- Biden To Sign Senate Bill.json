      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. This is CNN special live coverage on a chaotic night, even by Washington standards. I'm Dana Bash live in the nation's capital. Here's the headline.The United States government will not shut down, at least not for another 45 days. Right now, as you see on your screen, that is the United States Senate. It is voting as we speak to keep the government open. This is happening just hours before the deadline. Senators are voting on a bill that passed the House earlier today. That bill not only continues the government spending levels, it includes disaster relief, but no money for Ukraine, no additional money for Ukraine or border security. Now on the Senate side, which is where we are right now, there was some last minute drama. One senator held up a vote over concerns about the lack of Ukraine funding in this bill. But leaders Schumer and McConnell struck a deal. They vowed not to give up on support for the Ukrainians in the war against Russia. But there's also more drama. The fate of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is uncertain at this time, as hardliners in his party are pushing for his ouster. And also in the House, Democrat Jamaal Bowman may be in some trouble after he appeared to pull a fire alarm at the Capitol. We're going to get into that in a moment. But first, remember, tonight's deal, it only avoids a shutdown in the immediate future. In mid-November, it's quite possible we could be here talking about the same things all over again. Let's get right to somebody who has not left the Capitol for -- I don't even know how long -- many, many hours, many days, our own Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju. So, Manu, at this point, we saw that the vote is open. It's been open on the Senate floor for quite some time. Are senators at dinner? Are they flying back in? Are they training back in? What's going on?",

Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader keeps these votes open for a very long time, allowing senators to do just that, have dinner, go to fundraisers, come back and vote.This vote is probably going to be called sometime soon, probably maybe in the next 20 minutes or so, maybe less, maybe a little bit longer, we'll see. But there's no question about this. They will have the votes to pass this bill to keep the government open for 45 days after a chaotic scramble to avoid a government shutdown, something that seemed almost certain was going to happen. Just this morning when Kevin McCarthy, the speaker, went behind closed doors, they had talked about a in definite shutdown, trying to figure out ways to limit the impacts of a shutdown. But they changed their approach. Kevin, for the first time, McCarthy decided to rely on Democratic votes to get this issue over the finish line, to extend government funding for 45 days, would not include any aid to Ukraine --",

I know you're not happy with the notion of Congress not doing its job, constitutional job, which is to fund the government by October 1st, but I'm guessing you're happy enough that the government didn't shut down.Take me behind the scenes, if you will, the last several hours and to what happened in the United States Senate with the discussions about passing this bill to keep the government funding -- funded for 45 more days without additional aid to Ukraine. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE: Well, Dana, I'm relieved that we are not heading home tonight having to explain a shutdown of the U.S. government to our constituents, to our neighbors, to the men and women of our armed forces and of federal law enforcement, our own employees in the Senate who would have been forced to work without pay. I've lived through several previous shutdowns, as have you, and they are not as glamorous or exciting as some might imagine. They are, in fact, embarrassing and tedious. They weaken us on the world stage. They make our allies question whether we're reliable. They harm our economy, and they show dysfunction in our political system. It was unexpected that Speaker McCarthy would make such a quick about face today. Embrace support from across the aisle and move a CR that keeps our government open for the next 45 days. In the last few hours, there were a lot of urgent conversations among senators, Republicans and Democrats, leadership, appropriators, and rank and file to reassure each other that there is sustained and strong support for funding Ukraine. There are other things that are also we're not taking care of in this bill, humanitarian relief funding. I'm someone who chairs the relevant subcommittee and is very concerned about the dramatic growth and hunger around the world. There's other unmet needs. We are going to have to turn to those in the coming 45 days and work out before the end of this calendar year. How do we sustain funding for Ukraine through the rest of the coming year? How do we sustain our leadership in the world and invest in the State Department in encountering humanitarian challenges? And how do we finish our appropriations process? Today, we didn't shut down the government. But tomorrow, we have to keep our commitment to sustain funding of Ukraine, something President Biden has spoken strongly about, something that both Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell, Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, Senator Graham and I have all spoken to this evening in different settings to reassure our partners and allies that we will sustain our support for Ukraine.",

I was literally just talking to a leader in the House Republican caucus about whether they might also move and send us an increased Ukraine supplemental. The core issue here was, if the government shut down tonight, there wasn't going to be additional funding going to Ukraine in the next couple of weeks. And we have instead found a path forward where the government stays open, and there is a path forward for working together to support Ukraine aid and to send a strong message to the 50 other countries supporting Ukraine that we will be with them going forward.",

President Biden has a uniquely forceful and capable voice here, given his five decades of experience in foreign policy. I'll remind you, he went to Kyiv earlier this year, the first U.S. president in modern history to go to a war zone that the United States did not have control over and to go to the risk of being in Kyiv, standing alongside President Zelenskyy and committing to the -- all the support that Ukraine needs.And just last week, as you know, President Zelenskyy came and addressed the entire Senate here in the old Senate chamber and heard very forceful statements of support from all the senior senators. What you're raising, Dana, is the larger challenge. We have to convey to the average American that 50 other countries are supporting Ukraine and have matched and exceeded our support for Ukraine, that whether or not Ukraine succeeds in its war against the Russian invaders and occupiers is critical to the future of NATO, of the Free West, of democracy, and if Ukraine falls, other countries will take strong signals from that, that they can change borders by force, that they can realign the world. We heard a chilling prediction from one of the most senior military leaders when we had a conversation about Ukraine last week, who said, if we do not stand by Ukraine, it will, within a matter of a year or two, the open season on the world stage for aggression that will draw the United States into future wars. We are far better off robustly and sustainably supporting Ukraine in their fight, which in so many ways is our fight as well.",

Was it a firm I'm going to bring it up? And then there's also the question of, OK, if he made a firm commitment, what happens to McCarthy if his right flank decides to introduce a motion to vacate? Would he be Speaker? And what would the Democrats ask from him? What concessions from him would they ask if they were to say, oh yes, give the votes to keep him as speaker? Would they ask for power sharing? Would Ukraine be a part of it?

He is the most unreliable Speaker of the House we have seen in recent memory. He cuts a deal with the President and the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, and can't stick by it. He says he's going to -- he's not going to do a clean CR, and he ended up doing a clean CR. He can't hold his caucus together. How can you govern with this person? And now, if he is successful, if Kevin -- if Speaker McCarthy is successful, he will make the country look as unreliable as he is.
