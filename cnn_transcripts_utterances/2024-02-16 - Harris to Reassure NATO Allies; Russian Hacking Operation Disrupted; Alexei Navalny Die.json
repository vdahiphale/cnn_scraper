      "sentences": "Is a reflection of how significant Trump's comments have indeed been. Not a real new position for him, but the fact he felt he needed to reiterate it, sending shockwaves here to a gathering really that has enough on its plate, put aside the continuing Israeli assault on Rafah and European calls for protection of civilians. You'll hear a lot of that here as well.Ukraine is now heading into its third year of a war against Russia. A war in which, its fair to say, Ukraine is on the losing side now. We are seeing significant potentially advances by Russia around the key town called Avdiivka. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, well, he'll be here tomorrow onstage. He is on his way currently in Berlin, I believe, then on to Paris, then back to here, signing agreements with the Germans and the French, separate security agreements essentially that -- possibly a substitute from Ukraine's broader desire to become part of NATO. A bid, though, I think for Europe to make it clear how important Ukraine's security is here. Because ultimately if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, then there are fears its militarized economy won't necessarily feel it can or wants to stop there. And so the real background larger issue is U.S. money for Ukraine, $60 billion held up by, it's fair to say, Republican dysfunction in Congress. So far it hasn't arrived. Its impacting Ukraine's front lines already. But ultimately hear, Vice President Harris is going to have to stand up in front of a crowd and try and offer assurances despite the fact that there is a very loud clock ticking behind her for those November elections. And, frankly, this maybe the last time this White House gets to speak outside of a thorough and aggressive election campaign to its allies at a forum like this. Back to you.",

Russian military intelligence agency was using a network of more than 1,000 hacked internet routers for cyber operations against the U.S. and its European allies. Now, the FBI chief says the hackers are now locked out.Let's go to CNN cybersecurity reporter Sean Lyngaas, who joins us from Washington. So, Sean, just explain what this means and how serious of a threat this is, or was.",

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, this is classic cyberespionage. It's kind of a years-long cat and mouse game. In this case between the FBI and the Russian GRU, military intelligence agency.What the FBI says that the GRU did is they set up this vast network of infected computers that they used to spy on people, and particularly the U.S. and European governments, collect intelligence off computers, trying to presumably track information related to the Ukraine war and that sort of thing. So, it's not entirely uncommon, but it was -- it takes a lot of resources to set that up. And what the FBI announced yesterday was this disruption where they - they cleaned out some of those computers, kicked out the hackers and now forcing them to sort of rebuild and reset. They'll come back, but this -- in the - in the U.S. law enforcement eyes makes it a bit harder for them, the Russian spies, to do their job. So, it's very much a cat and mouse game that they claimed victory yesterday, but it's - it's a long, ongoing espionage game.",

It caught the White House off guard. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan was set to brief some of the House Intelligence leaders yesterday. And so, the administration is trying to deal with the fallout of that revelation.But what we know so far from CNN's reporting is that it's sort of a medium to long-term threat. It's not eminent, but it's something that officials are very concerned about in terms of how the Russians might use space as a means of setting back U.S. interests. We're going to get more information, I suspect, as the days and weeks come - come forward, but right now it's still a bit -- a bit up in the air, Omar. Cyberspace and outer space. Sean Lyngaas, thanks for covering at all. Now, a former FBI informant charged with lying about President Biden and his son's business dealings. What this means for the Republican's impeachment inquiry. Thats next.",

I also want to bring in CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger. David, as we're just hearing there from Nick, as he's reminding us, right, of the work, the life's work, in many ways, of Alexei Navalny, the fact that he could still communicate with the outside world and continued to influence conversations and perhaps even some politics, resistance politics, within Russia. Can you put that into context for us, what it will mean if, in fact, these reports are confirmed?",

And, of course, this come out as an official statement by the Russian prison sentence.You know, Erica, there has never really been a dissident in modern times like Navalny. One who had such a charismatic affect about him, such followers and such an ability to communicate, as you suggested, even from prison. And, you know, his decision to go back to Russia, from Germany, where he had been recovering from the last effort to kill him with a poisoning, was remarkable. It seemed suicidal to people who had known him or covered him, but it also reflected his own belief that in prison he could still lead a movement. It also tells you something about Vladimir Putin today. Putin is -- has systematically been getting rid of those remnants of opposition to him ahead of some elections that are coming. There was Prigozhin, who, of course, mounted an attempt that look like military overthrow, although he said he was not trying to overthrow Putin himself but just his military commanders. He was stopped or stopped himself 150 miles from Moscow. And, a few months later, died in a plane crash. Now Navalny, the most prominent dissident. So, Putin enters these elections basically having crushed all of those who have - and they're very few in number -- who have made a public case for the incompetence and for the evil nature of the rule that they've been under.",

That only played into it. And I think surprised perhaps a lot of people that he would still have such access to information and communicating with the outside world.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think what you have to realize, like the great strengths of Navalny and the great threat that he posed to Putin was not that he was so outspoken even, per se, but that he hit the Kremlin where it really hurt, which was to humiliate them, to make a mockery of, frankly, their incompetence.And so in revealing the nature of his poisoning, he wasn't just showing how deeply cynical and depraved the Kremlin had become and the security services have become and the levels that they would stoop to, he was also showing that they were unable, even with 30 men working for many years following him all over the country, using a very lethal, toxic nerve agent, they were unable to kill him successfully. They were unable -- and if you recall this extraordinary moment where he makes a phone call to one of the security operators, or security servicemen who was part of this so-called toxins team, he pretends that he's an aide to Nikolai Patrushev, the national security apparatus, and he fooled this FSB officer into talking on an open line very openly about how he was poisoned, and why it didn't work and where they sprinkled the Novichok in his underwear, famously. This was so deeply humiliating and embarrassing for President Putin and for the Kremlin because they often enjoy the myth of the darkness, of the evil. That's why they use a nerve agent like Novichok. That is something that they lean into in their messaging. What they don't like is being called incompetent, stupid, unprofessional, and corrupt. And this was the other thing that was the big, big part of Navalny's platform, exposing corruption. Russian people may be willing to tolerate a strong man or a dictator, but still many people felt sickened and appalled by the levels of corruption, by the state of the kleptocracy, particularly as their lives continued to become more difficult, more expensive. And so that was really his talent, if you will, was honing in on areas that were particularly sensitive to the Kremlin, and also particularly appealing to the broader Russian population, even among those who had traditionally been supporters, (INAUDIBLE) even of Putin's presidency.",

      "sentences": "Well, a few things.First of all, while people have been concerned, and the U.S. government has been concerned about Navalny and spoken out about it and so forth over many years, I don't think that there was a sense this was coming. I spent the morning with U.S. officials here in Munich, who are at the Munich security conference. And in my conversations with them, this did not come up. What did come up repeatedly, though, and has throughout the opening of this, which is the major national security conference, is a new and much broader concern about Russia. You know, for the past two years it's all been focused on Ukraine. There was a brief moment when people thought that Putin had been weakened last summer during the Prigozhin uprising and now there is a sense that Putin is reasserting his control, will be there for a long time, and that Europe and the United States have to get ready for a prolonged confrontation with Putin. And I think Putin senses that as well. And he wanted to go into this with zero opposition, no way for him to have any cracks domestically. I think even in death, Navalny will have that reputation for courage that you heard Clarissa describing. I think he could continue from the grave, assuming that these reports are true, to be sort of the organizing fall behind the Russian opposition. And there's no way that Putin can do away with that.",
