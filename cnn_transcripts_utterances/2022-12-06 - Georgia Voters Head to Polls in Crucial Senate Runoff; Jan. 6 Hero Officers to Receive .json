And, look, wait time under around a minute-and-a-half right now. So, it is a swift process if you're in the right place.Of course, a lot of Georgians, more than 1.85 million, voted early through those five mandatory days of early voting, long lines during that period. But you were going to different areas then. We've seen a lot of confusion at this particular precinct in Southwest Atlanta, where people are coming here thinking this is where they're supposed to vote and they're told you can't vote here. This is not your home precinct. In fact, to be honest, within the past hour, we've seen more people be turned away than have actually been able to complete their ballots at this particular location. For those who can, though, they tell us, it has been a very, very painless process. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining us now, Bill Nigut, executive producer and host of Georgia Public Television Political Rewind and CNN Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny.Bill, if I can begin with you, ultimately, we tend to talk about this race in national terms, Democratic control of the Senate, or greater control, right, in this, case 51-49. Trump's endorsement of the Republican candidate, Herschel Walker, the impact of that, but, ultimately, were those national issues the one that have been driving this race? Is that what is going to make the difference here or is it more local issues? BILL NIGUT, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND HOST, GPB'S POLITICAL REWIND: Well, it depends on which side of the campaign you're on. In the Herschel Walker campaign, they have spent most of their time trying to tie Raphael Warnock to President Biden, making it a national issue. If you see all of the commercials been run either by the Walker campaigns or the PACs, many of them are all about he's a rubber stamp for President Biden. So, they try to nationalize the race. A Raphael Warnock on the other hand has talked about issues that are of important to people in Georgia. A primary one being the fight that he made to lower the cost of insulin that he was able to get at least part of what he wanted through. So, yes, Republicans wanted to be a nationalized race.

I mean, we should remember, he's the one who recruited Herschel Walker to run for the Senate here in Georgia. Most Senate Republican leaders, including Mitch McConnell, were not enthusiastic at all about Herschel Walker winning and he was exhibit A comment that McConnell made earlier this year about a lack of quality candidates. Now, eventually they got on board, but the reality is that Donald Trump remains a double-edged sword. He inspires his own base of voters but he turns off independent voters. That was the story in state after state in November. We'll see what happens today here in Georgia. But it certainly is going to sort of end the year and begin the New Year with a referendum on Trump if he is a negative in every respect or if it's different here today in Georgia. But those independent voters have made the case that they simply have not signed on with any Trump- endorsed candidate. We'll see if that holds today in Georgia as well.",

That is going to be followed by the Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, as well as Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, the minority leader, and also the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer. They give brief remarks. There will be singing of God Bless America. There will be a prayer by the chaplain and the congressional gold medal will be honored here. Now, Republicans and Democrats came together for this vote but there were still some who voted against this. There were 21 Republicans on the House side who voted against awarding the congressional gold medal to the U.S. Capitol Police, the D.C. Metro Police. They contended there were different versions of the bill that they supported. One of them I just spoke to this morning, Chip Roy, said that he supported a different version of this bill. But, nevertheless, there was some dissent on the Republican side of the aisle to giving this gold medal. But the Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy was asked at the time about this.
