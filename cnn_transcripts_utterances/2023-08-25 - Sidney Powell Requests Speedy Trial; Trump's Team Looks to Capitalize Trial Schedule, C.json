And later, a story you'll only see here on the level of support in Russia for the Wagner mercenary army and Yevgeny Prigozhin. Good evening, everyone. John Berman here, in for Anderson. First up tonight, a string of new developments in Georgia's election subversion RICO case against the former president and 18 others, all of which we will talk about tonight. There is election lawyer, Sidney Powell in a court filing late today joining co-defendant Kenneth Chesebro in requesting a speedy trial, which she is entitled to under Georgia law. Also today, a court filing from co-defendant and fake elector, Cathy Latham joining two others in claiming she was following the advice of the former president's legal counsel and acting \"at the direction of the president of the United States.\" It is a striking admission, but also part of the defense in an effort to transfer her case to federal court, but it also raises by extension a defense first offered by another former president.

He was the chief-of-staff at the White House when he helped set up that call for Donald Trump and spoke on it somewhat whenever Trump was calling Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of State. And so at this hearing on Monday, it'll be like a mini trial, theoretically. The DA's office is subpoenaing witnesses, including Raffensperger himself, others who were witness to that call. They're going to bring them to the witness stand, put them on display, have them testify, and then the judge is going to look at this and determine should Mark Meadows be able to move his case to federal court and get some constitutional protections around him? Because he was the White House chief of staff, or should this stay in state court? Was he doing politicking when he was setting up that call working for Trump after the election? The other thing that the judge very well could weigh in on is if everybody should have their case in federal court, and maybe signify exactly what should happen with Trump's case as well if Trump could try and do the same thing -- John.",

It is clear that this judge has rejected that argument, because if that argument were accepted, Meadows would be in federal court now, since he clearly was chief-of-staff when he was doing these activities. The likely standard is whether or not what he was doing was related to his official status, and as the previous speaker indicated, campaign stuff is not related to your official status, likewise, messing around with the Electoral College standards is not part of your official acts.

I mean, at this point, they are just trying to get in to federal court, but if they either plead out and cooperate with authorities and prosecutors are certainly going to try to thin this herd right away and get some of these people out of the case, if they cooperate and testify against Donald Trump, presumably, this is what they're going to say, which will be very strong evidence against the former president and others.The other way it could come up is if they remain in the case and go to trial alongside the former president and testify in their own defense and say that they were acting at the direction of Donald Trump and therefore should be found not guilty. So there are a couple of ways, if this is their evidentiary position, then it could be a problem for Donald Trump down the road.",

But by asking for a speedy trial to which is my understanding, they are entitled under Georgia law, their case goes on a track, which is different from the others. And so whatever their defenses are, this is a way of saying, hey, you know, my case is going to be separate from their cases. There's also a very -- you know, sort of interesting pattern here about the ways in which each of the defendants in the Georgia case are basically acting inconsistent with one another. Our previous discussion about Shafer suggests that. They are beginning to you know, point the finger at one another, but this speedy trial, Trump wants delay, and they want a speedy trial and the only way one can reconcile those two is if they go forward, while the rest of the defendants are delayed. BERMAN: So Jennifer, another theory, here is the nine-dimensional chess theory here, which is that all the defendants think it would be good to put some stalking horses out there. First, put a couple of cases out there first, so they can all see one case, all the evidence presented, and then they have the evidence of that trial, Trump would, specifically when he then stages his defense, any merit in that?",

So there's a lot that you get to know.I think other defendants other than Trump would be happy with this result, because they would get to see a preview of all of these witnesses, see them cross examined, et cetera. The big guy, though, at the top of the ticket certainly doesn't want that, because he's made pretty clear he doesn't want this to go and doesn't want voters to see particularly in Georgia, where there are likely to be cameras in the courtroom, the full weight of the government's case before the primaries even start.",

Of course, normally the day, after a debate, you have the media dissecting what candidates had said on stage, of course, Donald Trump was not there.

But I do think behind the scenes and what his team will be doing is talking about what the next year will look like. We know that Donald Trump's lawyers and the former president himself want to try and push these trials beyond the 2024 election. But I do think increasingly, they're recognizing that they may not be able to do that, like especially with the mounting legal battles that he is facing, and, you know, the four indictments.

Certainly not in any of the state media. And I've tried to look at some of the newspapers that have been coming out over the past several hours as well. They haven't even looked at it as well. So it feels like certainly when it comes to the state media, they've been, you know, reluctant to report on the public sympathy for this man, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner. I mean, it is so sensitive right now. The country feels like it's on a sort of knife edge. And I think people are very shocked, as I said, shocked, but necessarily surprised that this air crash took place.

Thank you very much.I'm joined now by CNN Military Analyst, Retired General Wesley Clark, former NATO Supreme ally commander and a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center. General, you know, obviously, the Wagner group filmed sledgehammer executions, Prigozhin led this revolt, this march on Moscow. Yet now there are these memorials popping up in several Russian cities. What's the takeaway here? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a different culture, John. That's the basic thing. When we look at Russia and we look at Putin, we see him through our own eyes and through our own background, and we want to believe that everybody's the same and sees things the same. But Russia has a different culture. They have a culture of sacrifice. They have a historical legacy of brutality. They were overrun by the Mongols. Ivan the Terrible of the 15th century took charge. He was brutal, and it's been a brutal history of oppression, murder. The Serfs were only freed in Russia in 1862. Before that, the nobles owned the people, that the land -- and the land was given by the tsar. And all of this is part of the Russian character. So after being invaded by Napoleon, invaded by Hitler, death, sacrifice, brutality, and service of the state, yes. And in Russian culture, the state is all powerful. It's what protects Russia in a way that Americans don't have any real appreciation for. And so, for Putin, Prigozhin was used. He was useful in holding the war together in the east. Maybe he reacted with a spasm of anger going on his march to Moscow. Maybe it was a setup designed to smoke out people who were of dubious loyalty. Maybe Putin afterwards decided he could use him for a while in Belarus. Maybe Putin then decided he was a liability. But all of that simply shows the Byzantine character of the way the Russian intelligence operates, the ruthlessness, relentless drive for success of Vladimir Putin.",
