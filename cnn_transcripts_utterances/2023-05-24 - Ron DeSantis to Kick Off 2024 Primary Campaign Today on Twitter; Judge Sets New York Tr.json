What is unique about his announcement, we are told by his political team, is that you will be sitting down to do so with the owner of Twitter, Elon Musk. You will be doing that on Wednesday night, and it certainly not typical and not typically how someone would announce their candidacy.But it goes with what we have been told about what this likely campaign will look like, which is that it will not be typical. It won't be traditionally. They want to really push the envelope and do things in a unique and different way, and this certainly fits the bill in that situation. We also know that DeSantis will be gathering his biggest donors and bundlers here in Miami on Thursday, to really amp up that fundraising game, and make sure that they turn in big numbers right out of the gate. He's going to set all of them lose to raise as much money as they possibly can to give him big numbers right out of the gate. And also, on Tuesday night, we saw this video from the Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis is re-tweeted by her husband, and it essentially a height video that then has a code to text the word \"launch\". Again, all these pieces coming together which is what we know we've been in the works for months now that has been talked about so much. But now, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis officially getting in the 2024 race, and we will start to see how that shapes up with both his Republican light rivals, chiefly among them former President Donald Trump and the sitting president, Joe Biden.

It was his first visit to this courtroom after pleading not guilty last month to 34 counts of falsifying business records. The judge explained to Trump the protective order, barring him and his defense team from sharing evidence turned over by prosecutors on social media. Prosecutors requested to the hearing to ensure that Trump is aware of the new rules against him, in the consequences that he could face if you violate the court order.

Meaning unable to pay the bills of the United States that have occurred over the last many years. In order to avoid that potentially drastic economic consequence, Congress and the White House need to agree on how to raise the national debt limit.Right now, that debt limit is at $31.4 trillion, and there is significant disagreement between the two sides on how to do just that. Now, what the Republicans have been demanding for sometime are spending cuts, bringing down spending below this year's level of federal spending. Democrats say that is a no go. They want to free spending that is what the White House has offered as a potential compromise. But the difference is in hundreds of billions of dollars and how much the government can spend on a number of key domestic programs. That's on result as well. There's also policy issues as well. Republicans have been pushing for work requirements on social safety net programs. The White House has been not in favor of that as well. There've also been a number of Democratic efforts to try to get some Republican concessions, including to give Medicare more power to negotiate drug prices, Republicans have said no. In fact, Kevin McCarthy said they are not going to go offer a single concession. The only concession, he said that Republicans will make would be to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for all of their demands. Now, this all comes as treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned Congress that they may have only until June 1st to raise the national debt ceiling. But, a number of conservatives that I spoke to, earlier in the day, indicated that they did not believe that the June 1st deadline was real. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  I don't believe that the first of the month is a real deadline. I don't understand why we're not making Janet Yellen show her work.",

They don't want to negotiate off that position, so they're saying, don't even negotiate with the White House.And, on the Democratic side, there's a number of progressives who are asking Biden not to negotiate with Kevin McCarthy. Concern that doing so would only give into the Republican demands, trying to pressure him to either raise the national debt limit, or pressured the president to try to use a constitutional authority. It has never been tested in the courts to raise the debt ceiling on his own, to avoid a default on his own. The president has been unwilling to go in that direction. But, pressure is growing on both sides for their leaders not to give in, which is racing all sorts of questions about whether a deal can be reached between Biden, McCarthy and whether it can pass Congress.

Russian authorities say that they've beaten back the Ukrainian saboteurs who launched recent attacks in the border region around the Russian city of Belgorod. But Ukraine, and those fighters themselves, insist that they are what they claim. They are Russian citizens fed up with Vladimir Putin, the war in Ukraine, and the totalitarian drift of their country.CNN's Matthew Chance has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a bold cross border raid, exposing the weakness of Russian defenses, and highlighting the increasingly brazen armed groups who say they're Russians fighting against the Kremlin. Moscow dismisses them as Ukrainian saboteurs, who've now been defeated, a barrage of ferocious Russian strikes carried out on its own soil. Defense officials say, at least 70 of fighters, some in U.S.-made Humvee armored vehicles, have now been killed. But for the Kremlin, attacks inside Russia, like a series of damaging train derailments over the past year, or attacks on crucial fuel storage facilities, have become an embarrassing feature of its war. Even the Kremlin itself was targeted with drone strikes, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. But Russian groups, who say that they're fighting against the Kremlin, are increasingly emerging from the shadows. CNN made contact with a fighter said to be from the National Republican Army, and anti-Putin group operating inside Russia. His voice and features have been disguised. ANTI-RUSSIAN FIGHTER (through translator):  A fire at the military facility, the death of the agent at the regime, or a day of activity on the railway that supplies the Russian army -- for us, these are all successful missions.",
