But now, having the weight of the House Ethics Committee and also the damming report behind it signals this is actually going to grow momentum, which we have already seen. Meanwhile, the new speaker, Mike Johnson, is essentially giving members the green light to vote their conscience on this vote. I want to read you part of the statement from Johnson's spokesman. He said, \"The speaker has reviewed the report and its very troubling findings. \"As members from both parties, members of the Ethics Committee and Representative Santos return to Congress after this Thanksgiving break, Speaker Johnson encourages all involved to consider the best interest of the institution as this matter is addressed further.\" We are expecting action sometime after the Thanksgiving break. And like I said, we have already seen signs of support growing inside the GOP for this effort. Since the report was released yesterday, we have already seen over a dozen new Republicans come out and say they would back expulsion after previously voting against it.

There are also other factors that Hamas has been asking for, not just the release of Palestinians. And this is primarily, Pam, on both sides, women and children that we're talking about, not men and not fighters. But Hamas has also been asking for things like more trucks of aid, more fuel to go into Gaza. So there are all kinds of elements that are playing into these incredibly intense negotiations.",

And that's important because that would potentially give us clues into any criminal investigation here.These accusations that are coming from his former girlfriend are on the civil side and at the federal level. And they are very serious allegations. Among them, she says that Diddy was physically violent toward her, controlled all aspects of her life. Also forced her into sex trafficking acts. And that when she tried to leave him in 2018, he forced his way into her home and raped her. Those are part of her allegations. Now you're showing just a little bit of some of the statement that she's put out to this point. But she said that, \"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships.\" Now, as you can imagine, folks from Diddy's camp, lawyers in particular, saying that these claims are just completely outrageous. And as part of their statement, they said that: \"For the past six months, Mr. Combs, Diddy, has been subjected to Miss Ventura's persistent demand of $30 million under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail. \"Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Miss Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs' reputation and seeking a payday.\" Now she is seeking unspecified monetary damages as part of this. But they first met back in 2005 when she was 19, and he was 37. She says it wasn't long after that, that she was introduced, as she says, through Diddy, to a lifestyle that included substance abuse, excessive drinking, effects of which she still feels today. So we're talking about more than a decade from that period over to 2018 that she feels like, based on what she says happened, Diddy should be held accountable for.",
