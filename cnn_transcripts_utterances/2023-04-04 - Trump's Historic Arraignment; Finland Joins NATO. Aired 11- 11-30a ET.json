You're looking at live pictures outside Trump Tower. Donald Trump is inside. And we have new details on exactly how today's events will unfold.A lawyer for Trump claims that the former president may speak to cameras before and/or after his arraignment. We'll see. The judge overseeing this case is not allowing cameras to broadcast the official proceedings. But still photographers will be allowed into the courtroom before the hearing begins. We also expect to learn for the first time why prosecutors believe Donald Trump is a criminal. When the indictment is unsealed, the criminal charges facing Donald Trump, they will finally be known. We also just learned this morning that Donald Trump has hired a new lead counsel. Criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche will take the lead for Trump in today's proceeding. CNN's Kara Scannell is outside the court in Manhattan, where she's been for days and days. Now the moment really, Kara, is about to take place. What have Trump and his team been doing?

We're also learning that Trump is expected to speak to the cameras. And remember, this is going to be a very unique situation, where the former president will enter the hallway and enter the courtroom. There will be a camera there to capture this moment. And we're told that he is expected to say something either before or after the arraignment. And then once he is inside the courtroom and the judge asks for him to enter a plea -- I'm told by one of Trump's attorneys that Trump himself will enter that plea of not guilty. In some instances, the lawyers do it but I'm told that Trump is going to do it  today. We'll see how that plays out real time. Meanwhile, he has brought on an experienced criminal defense attorney, Todd Blanche. He's a former federal prosecutor. He's someone that the Trump circle knows. He once represented Paul Manafort in state charges brought by this very same district attorney's office. So Blanche is someone who is familiar with the New York state law. He is working with Susan Necheles, another veteran criminal defense lawyer, who represented the Trump Organization in their tax fraud trial last fall. That ended in a conviction.",

We have new details about the course of events on this historic day. He will depart Trump Tower in just a couple of hours. The drive to the courthouse is four miles, which, in normal New York City traffic, could take anywhere from 20 to forever. But with his Secret Service detail, he should not have to deal with any of that. All trials and most court activity will be halted even before Donald Trump gets there. This is because of security concerns. Now when Donald Trump arrives to the DA's office, he will technically be under arrest. He will be booked, he will be fingerprinted. But at this moment, it's not clear if a mug shot will be taken, because authorities are concerned it will be improperly leaked. The arraignment is scheduled for about three hours from now, at 2:15 Eastern. Now as we said, Trump's lawyers claim that Trump will speak before and after the arraignment. We are not clear exactly when or if that is actually going to happen. Then the arraignment: during the arraignment, the indictment will be unsealed finally. This is the moment when the public might get its first glance of the details of the charges. His lawyers have said he plans to enter a not guilty plea. After the hearing, maybe he speaks right after; maybe not. But he is expected to head straight to the airport, go back to Mar-a- Lago in Florida, where he is planning to speak at 8:15 pm Eastern. You will definitely hear from him sometime today. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is outside of the court right now. Can you give us some more details about what is going on at this hour? We haven't seen huge protests, have we, yet?",

Some of the supporters there behind us. Those are where the Trump supporters have been gathering. It's a park that's directly across the street from the courthouse, literally across the street from the courthouse. And so, you know, potentially Trump can hear them when he's inside the courthouse, when he's inside the district attorney's office. He's likely able to hear them. Marjorie Taylor Greene was here. She spoke for about 10 minutes and then she left. Right now, really, we're seeing a lot of activity outside the courthouse, here outside the Manhattan DA's office. Just up the street for me here is where we expect the motorcade to arrive. Donald Trump will be arriving here, then going into the Manhattan DA's office and he will be placed under arrest at that moment, taking the stairs to the seventh floor, where he's going to be processed, the fingerprinting that you were talking about. And then the processes begin and we wait for him to go to court. But I can tell you, just in the last hour, we've seen more Secret Service agents. We've seen uniformed members of the Secret Service outside here. So certainly they're gearing up and preparing for his arrival. And just -- the influx of people just continues more and more as the hours get by and as we get closer to that 2:15-2:30 arraignment time. But it's been peaceful out here. Certainly the police have been allowing the traffic to flow. They've been letting people walk through the streets. So really right now, I think everyone is just waiting for Donald Trump to get here. And I will tell you this much, once he gets here, things are going to be very, very different -- Sara.",

General Assembly in September, when they have numbers of heads of state coming into town. So they are used to this.Certainly it's different, a little bit, with the Secret Service involved and other agencies. But certainly they are prepared. I actually want to kind of let you know where I am right now. We're on the backside of where you just saw Shimon, on the other side of 100 Centre. That is that building there behind me, where the arraignment is going to take place. And on a nice day, like we're seeing today, the area just below me is a park. It's usually bustling with people, ready to have their lunch. The streets are all shut down and this is actually likely the route the former president will be taking to get into the arraignment on the side of 100 Centre. Of course, we don't know his direct right -- route. That is by design for security purposes. But it will be interesting to see as the morning into the afternoon goes on, as we start seeing the security posturing that there were dry run-throughs by law enforcement of several different agencies. Last week, for example, I'm hearing it's possible a tent maybe put up just outside the door of where the former president will enter 100 Centre for security purposes or just so no one can actually see him going in. So it'll be interesting again to see what other measures will be taken to protect the former president. We also are hearing very soon, Kate, they're going to be shutting down this courthouse, if you can imagine that. This is a very popular court, where a lot is happening on an everyday basis. And to have it completely shut down, to make sure there's no foot  traffic into, again, increase the security, it's quite unprecedented -- Kate.",

And now and forever, as long as he is a Republican presidential candidate -- or perhaps the party's nominee going forward -- these two paths are completely linked, the legal path and the political path.We know that the former president has essentially frozen this Republican presidential race into place. I've been talking with advisers from some of his rival candidates. Yes, they're lamenting the fact that there's no oxygen left for them to make their own cases. But they've also had to sort of rally behind him and against this criminal indictment. We will see how long that lasts, of course. But the politics of this are very immense. It's part of the unprecedented nature of all this. But we should point out, this is one of the very reasons that the former president wanted to announce his candidacy so early. Last fall, he knew these potential charges were looming. And this is just one venue. There's still a Georgia case looming and the potential of a couple of cases in Washington. This is why he wanted to be an active presidential candidate. So John, one thing is so clear standing outside Trump Tower here, where he is still inside, I'm told, talking with his advisers and family throughout the morning, that there is no campaign trail that does not include the courtroom. So that is a central part now of not only his campaign but also the entire Republican presidential race. BERMAN:  You know, Jeff Zeleny, it's so interesting. None of us have seen the indictment so none of us knows exactly what Donald Trump -- Donald Trump will be charged with. I do wonder if these other campaigns or potential campaigns like Ron DeSantis have plans to go through, line by line, count by count, to familiarize themselves with this, to make their own decisions going forward.",

Additionally NATO will now have access to Finland's military assets. The country has upwards of 257,000 troops, both active and in reserve, as well as hundreds of -- hundreds of tanks and combat aircraft. It's also important to remember the original goal of NATO, formally known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The group was formed in 1949 to challenge Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II. The treaty was signed 74 years ago today. And at the heart of the treaty is Article 5, the Principle of Collective Defense, which is, an attack on one member of NATO, quote, \"shall be considered an attack against them all.\" This article has only been used once in NATO's history after September 11th. So NATO leaders from across Europe and North America welcomed Finland's membership into the group. CNN's Scott McLean is following this for us in London this morning.

For NATO, it means that their border with Russia just got more than800 miles longer. The secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that look part of Russia's justification for going to war in the first place was to get less NATO. But now as a result of its invasion, it's actually gotten more NATO right on its doorstep. The U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken called this day historic. It comes 74 years to the day of NATO's formation. He also said this.
