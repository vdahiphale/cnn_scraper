Also, inside that phone call today, between President Trump and Ukrainian president Zelenskyy, the same leader, who was on the other end of the line, during the call that got Trump impeached. And we're also learning about a big change that is coming to Trump's rallies, as the Secret Service is preparing to protect the nominee, in his first rally, since his attempted assassination, tomorrow, in Michigan. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, President Biden is in isolation, as he's fighting off symptoms from COVID-19. But he's also on isolation in the figurative sense, as he is now fighting off new calls, from his own party, to get out of the 2024 race. The party that Biden has devoted his life to is unleashing a new and really public effort, to push him out of challenging Donald Trump for the White House. A slew of House Democrats have joined two more prominent Democratic senators tonight, in calling for Biden to step aside. All of it, we are told, has President Biden seething, tonight, with much of his anger directed at Nancy Pelosi. That's because some of the names that are calling for him to drop out of the race are her close allies. And in the view from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, tonight, where President Biden finds himself, that is no coincidence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Biden has not said he is going to do so. He's not moved an inch on that. He says he looks forward to returning to the campaign trail, next week, once COVID is behind him. But we are closely monitoring what has developed into an intense and fluid situation, tonight, seemingly changing by the hour, at this point, as Democratic donors are also certainly feeling it. That's why Vice President Harris had to get on the phone with them, today, from the West Wing, as many of them say that their wallets are closed, until this matter is resolved. Joining me tonight. Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic State Rep from South Carolina. Former New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio. And Republican strategist, Shermichael Singleton. And Bakari, I mean, to see this reporting, from Carl Bernstein, tonight, on CNN, in the last hour, saying that how Biden is feeling, as he is lashing out and seething at Pelosi, and Obama, is pretty stunning to see such a break between three figureheads in the Democratic Party.",

It's pretty remarkable to see this break between them.BILL DE BLASIO, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: It is. I mean, first, you know, I've talked with you about the fact that I feel for Joe Biden. It's an incredibly difficult moment, incredibly difficult decision. I had to make a much more humble version of this decision myself, when you -- when you have to think about stepping away from the stage. And I understand why that brings out anger, frustration, et cetera. But I want to say, ironically, in a group of 8-year-olds, I think Nancy Pelosi is being the adult in the room. I think Nancy Pelosi is actually talking to people about what they're feeling, and encouraging people to express their feelings, so that we can figure this out together. I have never -- you know, I don't believe this is inside-the-family behind-closed-doors kind of thing. I think this has to be out in the open, and we have to deal with it once and for all, because the stakes are so high. And in the end, this is an organic problem. This is not a creative problem. I respect Bakari a lot. I don't think this comes from the left. I don't think this is artificial. It predates the debate. It's an organic problem. And so, for a lot of people, this sort of, it's the time to say the emperor has no clothes, and we have to decide what we're doing here. And I got to tell you. I would follow Nancy Pelosi anywhere, because she can count votes. And I think her singular concern, right now, is how do we win? And that's what every-day Democrats, everyone I'm talking to, is obsessed with one thing. How do we win? And they don't feel like we're winning, right now.",

I think Democrats are running the risk of forcing a lot of their voters to become discouraged. I think political disenchantment will eventually set in. And many people that they need, particularly considering that this is an Electoral College race, four states, right? They're going to stay home. So, Republicans are looking at turning out Trump's voters. They're looking at low-propensity voters. And they're saying if we can maximize and maintain 2020 levels, and maybe increase 2 to 3 percent, in a state like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, there is a mathematical path to beyond 270.

You know what -- what I've been thinking a lot about is the signs along the way that could have prompted the campaign, and the party, to think through what might have happened, if this eventuality did. And I think back to that David Ignatius' column that was written in September of last year, almost a year ago. And that was a seismic thing on this network, broadly speaking here, one of the President's favorite columnist, coming out and saying, with this format that we've now seen over and over again: Thank you, for all you've done, look at all of the achievements that you've had. Now, it's time to step aside. You floated this yourself during the campaign. Do it.

But the Trump speech, I thought plowed no new ground and is really just vintage Trump. COLLINS: Well, and given that call that he had the day after he left Milwaukee, with President Zelenskyy, Trump is describing it as a very good call. But you just heard from Zelenskyy there, on what a second Trump term could mean, especially given he picked Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio.

Now, I'm not a shrink. But I know the technical term, for somebody who says, I will bring peace to the world. This is nuts. He has no idea how he's going to negotiate an end to this war, except I think that his affinity for Vladimir Putin will lead to concessions to the Russian side, that are going to be devastating for Ukraine. So, I think this is a very dark moment. And it's not just a dark moment for Ukraine. Because we haven't come to their assistance, out of the goodness of our hearts, out of an act of charity. We have been assisting Ukraine, because it's in the core of American national security interest, to defend against unprovoked aggression, on the continent of Europe, and to try and get peace and stability there, that benefits us in innumerable ways.

But that fix did not come before airports descended into absolute chaos today. Payment systems went down. Hospitals had to cancel critical appointments and surgeries, because of what happened. A California nurse even told CNN that baby heart monitors stopped working, along with automated medicine cabinets that dispense drugs for them that they rely on so much. People have been impacted in ways that you may not have expected. In Arizona, hotel key cards could not be made. Guests had trouble getting into their rooms, while others were using chairs as door- stoppers to prevent lockouts. The DMVs shut down in Texas and South and North Carolina, because of this. In San Diego, courts were really brought to a standstill, and jail bookings had to be limited. And if you were waiting for a package from UPS, or FedEx? Good luck, because you're going to have to wait a bit longer, because of what happened today. They notified that there would be delays in their system, because of this CrowdStrike outage. I want to talk about this with the former FBI Deputy Director, and cyber expert, Andy McCabe. And it's great to have you here. Because this wasn't a hack. It wasn't a breach, which I think it was what a lot of people expected, and kind of feared. But what do you make of how a single flaw, in a software update, took down so many systems and services that we rely on?",

And there are a number of really big players in that environment, who most of us rely on. And when one of those big players makes a mistake, it has repercussions, all around the globe.We've got to remember that software producers, whether they're cybersecurity producers, like CrowdStrike, or others, are in a constant race, to stay one step ahead of the next cybersecurity threat, be that from criminal actors or nation-state actors. So, they are constantly in these cycles of updating their products, and sending those updates out to us, automatically. If you listen to the FBI, or CISO, or any other government agency, they will constantly tell you, you've got to keep updating your systems, to stay ahead. So, when one of those players, in this case, CrowdStrike, mistakenly built an error into their update, it has unbelievably broad impact on the entire economy and people's lives.",

I know there is some reporting that CrowdStrike has had this problem once in the past.

I'm sure. we'll probably see some of that here in the aftermath of this outcome.
