BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTENATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As dawn broke, Israel launched the first of a series of punishing air strikes, starting in South Lebanon, pummeling what it claimed were Hezbollah targets, hitting, hitting and hitting again. While Hezbollah battered over the past week, it struck back, as it did early Sunday. Its missiles reaching deep into Israel, to Haifa and beyond. Many others intercepted through text messages and by breaking into local radio broadcasts. Israel warned people to leave and stay away from buildings where Hezbollah might be operating. But the bombing was enough to send thousands fleeing north, the roads packed. Strikes, war planes, destruction says Ahmed, no one is left there. Everyone has fled. We took our belongings and left. Yet even those fleeing vowed they will return. We will be back, God willing, shouts this man, we will be back. Tell Netanyahu we will return, when and how and to what? Unknown. The death toll for one day reached into the hundreds. The wounded, well over a thousand.

On social media, Zelenskyy posted that \"this fall will determine the future of this war.\" And he says that much of the onus is on the United States. In a new interview with The New Yorker, he talks about the plan saying, \"This plan is designed first and foremost, with Biden support in mind. If he doesn't want to support it, I cannot force him. If he refuses, that's unfortunate. It would mean that Biden doesn't want to end the war in any way that denies Russia a victory and we would end up with a very long war.\" Now, a key part of this plan for victory, according to Zelenskyy, are those long-range missiles made by the United States and the United Kingdom which he wants to fire inside of Russia. It's no mistake that Zelenskyy started his U.S. tour this week at an ammunitions plant in Pennsylvania, highlighting that us support for Ukraine over the past 2-1/2 years.

I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job.And then he went on to offer $150,000 to whomever could complete the job. We also learned from the agents in court that the defendant, Ryan Routh, they believe, was in a position that provided a clear line of fire to the sixth hole putting green. Now, remember, Donald Trump was on the fifth hole putting green. At the time this all occurred, that would have put him about 12 to 15 minutes away from the sixth hole putting green.

And investigators in court said that they -- there was a fingerprint that they believe belongs to Ryan Routh on that electrical tape. That is a preliminary finding. They are still looking into that. We also know there was a letter now addressed to the New York Times that was found at the scene. They did test that letter for fingerprints and DNA. They have not found Ryan Routh's fingerprints or DNA on it just yet, but they did find a fingerprint belonging to someone else. The FBI agent who was testifying did not say who that person is, who that fingerprint belongs to, or what was in the letter. Also, they did search Routh's car. They found a Hawaii driver's license and a passport in his name, along with 12 pairs of gloves and six cell phones. One of the cell phones prosecutors say included a search, a Google search from how to get from Palm Beach County where this all happened to Mexico. Also, they found cell phone data that would have placed Ryan Routh in this area for about a month before this incident occurred. They said that he arrived here as of August 14th. That's according to cell phone data pinging off the cell phone towers in the area. And finally, there was a handwritten list of dates and venues prosecutors say that was found in his car.

And there has been a year year-long border conflict there as both sides have carried out rocket attacks and airstrikes back and forth across the border. Over the last week, Israel announced that it was entering a new era of this war and it dramatic increased its attacks. And Monday is evidence of, basically, an air war, an aerial campaign against Lebanon. Take a look at this heat map created by NASA over a 24-hour period and it will show you places that are burning red over the course of an -- or aerial bombardment that Israel says hit more than 1,600, as it puts it, Hezbollah targets.

So that's nearly 100 women and children in a total death toll of nearly 500 people killed in a single day. To add context to this, Lebanon is not a stranger to conflict. In 2006, Hezbollah militants fought a month-long war against the Israeli military. And in that conflict, which I covered, Anna, around 1,100 people were killed on the Lebanese side of the border. In a single day yesterday, Israeli war planes killed nearly half the number of people who were killed in a month of all-out fighting and the Israeli government is pledging to further ramp up its operations, its military attacks into Lebanon in the days ahead.",

In the '70s, most of the civil servants were women, over half the teachers, doctors -- a bird may sing in Kabul but a girl may not, and a woman may not in public. This is extraordinary. This is a suppression of the natural law. This is odd. I feel that the Taliban, since they've issued over 100 edicts in Afghanistan, stripping women and girls of their education and employment, their freedom of expression and movement, they have effectively incarcerated half their population.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER DANIEL, UTC, EMOJI STANDARD &amp; RESEARCH WORKING GROUP:  Well, there's -- obviously, there is criteria that we were looking for. So anyone could submit an emoji proposal, all it has to do is include a number of factors.
