And the president's performance that's led to mass panic in the Democratic Party. You're going to see what voters think moments from now as the Biden campaign calculates its next move.Plus, it wasn't just a horrible night. That's the message from Congressman Mike Quigley who is now the first Democratic lawmaker to openly discuss if President Biden should be replaced as the party's nominee. He's concerned is not just about the presidential race, but all the House and Senate candidates also on the ballot this November. And supreme consequences. The Manhattan district attorney is now open to delaying the former president's hush money sentencing. As CNN learns that President Trump's federal election subversion case may not resume for another month. We're tracking all the fallout from the high court's bombshell ruling on presidential immunity. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Joe Biden is attempting to use the monumental Supreme Court ruling on presidential power to warn about the dangers of a second Trump presidency. But in this crucial first week after the debate, the president's delivery was just as focused as his words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is a six-point lead, Dana. And this is unchanged -- unchanged since our last poll in April. In fact, it's been a remarkably consistent race with Joe Biden trailing Donald Trump just outside the margin of error for quite some time. If you look back in our trend here, you see it was identical in April 49, 43. You see, nothing has really changed since last August. By last fall, this race is kind of locked into place.",

So, 65 percent of the electorate say their mind is made up.If your mind is made up in this poll, you're splitting 53 percent for Trump, 45 percent for Biden. However, 31 percent of voters in the poll say they are movable, either they don't have a first choice, or they're not locked in. They're willing to move off of who they're saying their choices right now. 31 percent of the electorate is movable. They split more evenly. 39 percent for Trump, 37 percent for Biden.

But overall, the thrust for Biden supporters is they want to vote against Trump, not for Biden. It's the complete reversal for Trump supporters. [12:05:00] Two thirds of Trump supporters are casting their ballot for Donald Trump. 34 percent say they're casting against Joe Biden.

Only 25 percent of voters say Joe Biden gives Democrats their best chance of winning in November. And take a look at these numbers. Joe Biden's approval rating is down to 36 percent in this poll. That is his lowest approval rating of his entire presidency in CNN polling. His lowest number nearly four months out from the election. That's not welcomed news for any incumbent. And we tested, what would it look like if Vice President Kamala Harris was in a matchup against Donald Trump and not Joe Biden. And the vice president actually does a little bit better against Trump than Joe Biden does. She pulls the race within margin of error, no clear leader Donald Trump at 47, Kamala Harris at 45 percent. We also tested Gavin Newsom, Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer. You see here, those Democrats, they kind of perform like Joe Biden. Donald Trump is beating them right now outside the margin of error.

OLIVIER KNOX, SENIOR NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, U.S. NEWS &amp; WORLD REPORT: Well, I have two thoughts. So, the first is I have not seen the Democrat -- Democratic Party, this agitated in this much of a panic since 1998, really 1988 when the Lewinsky scandal erupted. And we saw a prominent Democrat saying that Bill Clinton should resign, right? That didn't happen. And Democrats did just fine in those -- in those midterms that year. The second thought I have is that we really should be polling the four or so states that are actually going to decide this election now. If '24 -- but if 24 goes the way 20 and 16, we're talking about tens of thousands of voters in a handful of states. And so my theory of the case is that literally any issue can swing with this election.",

I was in conversation with some of them this weekend. There was a rally here in D.C. in support of low wage workers.And I thought that there would be more pushback after the debate performance. I thought that they would raise issues with a whole number of things concerning President Biden because this is really the left flank of the coalition. And instead, it was the exact opposite. They really rallied around him. They said that all of the response was not fair. They seem to take a really pragmatic response to all of this.

And he needed a debate performance that was going to upend the trajectory of the race. That did not happen here. I mean, inside these numbers of him being six points down from Donald Trump is that he's down 10 points among independent voters.Obviously, that was not the case four years ago, when he won the race nationally by four percentage points. So, if this is what the result is, that would be, you know, a 10-point swing in the other direction.

But if polls show that Senate candidates, House candidates are now at risk of losing their races, more than they were before because they're being dragged down by Biden. And this was a concern, while before the debate that a lot of people didn't want to in tough districts and tough states, didn't want to campaign with Biden, didn't want to appear at events with him. If now it looks like Democrats are a bigger risk of not being able to flip the House. You losing the Senate, then I think that could really start to change the public conversation.",

And a few senators did (inaudible) for example, was one of them. The same kind of thing is happening. Very, very different subject.Peter Welch, the Democratic Senator from Vermont, said the following. He said, I really do criticize the campaign for a dismissive attitude towards people who are raising questions for discussion. That's just facing the reality that we're in. The campaign has raised the concerns themselves. So then to be dismissive of others who raise those concerns, I think that's inappropriate. I'm just going to paraphrase backoff campaign is what he said. KNOX: A lot of people are taking the back off campaign approach, most of them quietly, Peter Welch, evidently in public. People are pointing back. You know, the Biden campaign in the White House have been using the term breadwinners to describe the people who worry about the impact of this debate performance on the election in November. That was, of course, coinage from 2016, when the Hillary campaign pushed back against skeptics of her presidential bid. We all know how that ended up. I can tell you from having talked to a couple of people who are in the camp, I support Joe Biden, but boy, they need to have an honest conversation. They're very upset with the tone from this White House. They're upset with the tone for the White House.

It's not like all of the Biden campaign money can just be handed over to a new candidate. So, they've tried to say, look, getting a new nominee is not going to be a super simple process. There's all these -- it's going to be messy. It's going to divide the party right before the election. And one other thing I just note on the interview is I've spoken to a number of Democrats who have said, if Biden would have just gone out and done an unscripted TV interview right after the debate, that would have quelled a lot of concerns, but he didn't do that.

In that case, there was evidence that was presented to the jury about things Donald Trump was doing while he was president, things like tweets, some testimony from Hope Hicks. His team wants to argue all of that should be thrown out -- the whole case should be thrown out. The district attorney's office say we don't think the whole case should be thrown out.

And this speaks to the question of a president's conduct. The president's conduct in particular in and around January 6. He said the district court must carefully analyze the indictments remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a president must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the district court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictments charges without such conduct. Testimony or private records of the president or his advisers, probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial. So that speaks to some of the confusion that you were just talking about.
