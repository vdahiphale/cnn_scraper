But once those supplies are in, the breakdown in law and order, the criminality, the looting, the danger of the situation means that we're not able to get the aid out.So right now, nothing is coming in through southern Gaza.

That is a submerged truck, and there were several instances where there were swift water rescues and water entering buildings and homes. A significant situation unfolding as a flash flood emergency was in place for this area. Look at how much rain fell. This is again, incredible, 5.78 inches, roughly 150 millimeters from this storm that moved through their average October rainfall only a little over an inch and a quarter. So again, this is the wettest day that Roswell, New Mexico, has ever recorded. And the wet weather continues, even though the storm system that is responsible for the flooding that occurred Saturday into early Sunday morning hours still could produce a bit more rainfall over eastern New Mexico. It will quickly move on by Monday afternoon and bring rainfall to the central parts of the country. Now we are focusing our attention on Southern Italy, where they are also contending with flooding. The Salto River in Sicily actually overflowed its banks, and this is the result. And look at the flooding across this agricultural area, significant impacts to the region. It's all thanks to a low pressure system that's churning across the central Mediterranean. There is the potential here for more rain. Some of the totals here have exceeded 125 millimeters, especially across the central portions of the country, but Sicily impressive rainfall totals as well, with more rain to come and the potential for more flooding as well. In fact, chances of flooding through about Tuesday with orange and red alerts in place for the area as we get this onshore flow from the Mediterranean, allowing for precipitation to build up across the region, so covering flooding from North America to Europe on this latest weather report.

Well, breaking news coming to us from Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital. Well, this follows a meeting in brussels last week with his counterparts in NATO. High on the agenda: questions from allies about the upcoming election and how it might impact Ukraine aid, Specifically concerns that a potential Trump victory could jeopardize a future U.S. aid to Ukraine. Well sources familiar with the meeting tell us, Austin said that while he cannot predict the future, there is still bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress. NATO officials say they are preparing for the U.S. to take on a lesser role. Well, it elsewhere in Ukraine, a CNN producer on the ground in Kyiv reports hearing loud explosions and air raid sirens early Monday. The city's mayor warned residents on social media to take shelter as air defenses had been activated. It comes amid reports that more than a dozen people injured in central Ukraine in the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Officials say a missile attack damaged several buildings and the local gas pipeline. Well, meantime, President Zelenskyy is warning of a new threat amid reports North Korean soldiers may soon join the war to support Russian troops. The U.S. Defense Secretary couldn't confirm those reports, but said it may signal something even more important about the conflict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: I can't confirm those reports at this point in time. It's something that we will certainly continue to investigate. If that is the case, it's serious obviously but it also indicates that Putin is having trouble, you know. We know that that he's continues to lose a lot of people. And you heard me say before that he's lost somewhere north of 350,000 people killed and wounded. I believe that that number is probably much higher than that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
