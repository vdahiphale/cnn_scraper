Now it's Guatemala over there and that if you look here, are folks crossing, waving at us. Migrants who have made the journey from various countries, we've met folks from Haiti, from Cuba, from Honduras. Ultimately, though, many of them tell us if not all, they want to go north. By the way, that's the official crossing that bridge, not many people using that instead, they come to this side, the Mexico side. And this is in to a city that's called Ciudad Hidalgo, and they've set up little encampments, you can see here, you've got folks with tents set up, they've got clothes hanging, they're cooking food, you see a lot of families, a lot of young children in particular. And the plan for many of them is to be here and Ciudad Hidalgo until they can find a way usually by bus or by car to get to Tapachula, which is the largest city in this area in the state of Chiapas, in Southern Mexico. And many of them plan then to go meet with officials. And they hope to then claim asylum here in Mexico, or at the very least try to get transit documents. And that buys them time to stay in Mexico as they plan their way into the U.S. Most of them will tell you and they've told me this directly, they want to enter the U.S. legally. But what you've noticed here, and we've seen this in the past several months here in Mexico in particular, is the influx and the surge is a real strain on the resources for Mexican cities. And you notice it, as you see a lot of these folks are really trying to, on their own, figure out how to find food, how to find clothes, and they're filling up cities like Tapachula. 15,000 to 17,000 right now, that's the number of migrants alone in Tapachula. Huge numbers that plan to wait and stay. So essentially, if you look at the U.S. border as a river, and you've cut it off in one part, please. That's the intention from U.S. border officials, well, upstream, it's still flowing, and it's flowing rapidly. And this is the impact. It's coming on over the banks. You've got migrants here who ultimately yes, want to go to the U.S. But frankly, most of them don't know how or where they end up. It really has become a humanitarian crisis.

We have to keep in mind that they had said that after a strike that they conducted on the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol in the night from Thursday to Friday of last week that they had killed 34 senior officers in that strike, including the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Viktor Sokolov. Now, of course, the Russian seem to be trying to show that he is still very much alive at least you had that video of the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, holding a meeting with some of his top commanders, some of his top generals, and there seems to be Viktor Sokolov on the screen there. Now the interesting thing that we've gotten from the Russians in the past couple of days is actually that they really haven't said very much. The Ukrainians have put that claim out there that Sokolov had been killed, and the Russians were really silent for about 24 hours saying nothing about that, and they still haven't officially said anything about it. In fact, earlier today, there was a conference call between the spokesman of the Kremlin Dmitry Peskov and journalists where he was asked if he knew anything about the faith of the fate of Viktor Sokolov. And he said that this is something for the Defense Ministry to answer and certainly something that was not in his remit. So officially, the Russians have not denied that he has been killed. However, it seems as though they're trying to portray that things are business to usual maybe that they won't even comment on all of this, but certainly they seem to show that he is very much alive against impossible to independently verify when that video was taken. The Ukrainians are saying that they're reevaluating it, but certainly right now it seems as though the indications are that he could very well be alive and all this of course, as you mentioned, Becky, as those attacks in the Odessa region continue with grain facilities having been hit there in the overnight hour in the massive drone attack that happened there, Becky.",

And it comes as President Biden has certainly tried to tout his pro-union bonafides. He has described himself as the most pro-union President in American history, and this is certainly an opportunity for him to put that on display today. What it is also an opportunity for him to do is also to draw a contrast with Former President Trump, who is the most likely candidate to become the 2024 Republican nominee at this stage in the race. Former President Trump is heading to the state of Michigan as well tomorrow and the White House despite the comparison here, the White House insists that they are not going because Former President Trump is going to the state of Michigan. Former President Trump had announced his visit before Biden did. But nonetheless the White House is taking the opportunity to contrast the policies of the two Presidents talking about the fact that Trump has \"talked big and delivered little contrasting\". Trump's policies like tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited wealthy Americans with President Biden's policies which they say have brought a resurgence of American manufacturing here in the United States and deliver pro-union policies as well. Now the UAW for its part is certainly welcoming President Biden's visit to the state Shawn Fain. The union's President is expected to join Biden on the picket line in Michigan. He has by contrast, criticize a Former President Trump, but there's no question there are major electoral implications here. Michigan is a state that Trump won in 2016. Biden narrowly won that state back in 2020. And there's no question that appealing to working class voters is something both of these candidates have tried to do, and that both of them will need to do if they want to win the White House next year.",

And of course, the potential for interest rate rises, all three major indices are on pace to end September lower. Well, interesting moves on the oil markets right now prices for both West Texas Intermediate WTI and Brent lower by less than 1 percent not significantly lower, but they're off their highs. That's despite production cuts by key producers, including of course, Saudi Arabia, and Russia to try and boost prices. The outlook uncertain after the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank restated their commitment to fight inflation holding interest rates higher for longer slows economic growth, of course, and with it, the demand for oil put that price dip into context. And you can see it comes off a trend of rising prices this year and as crude heads north towards $100 on the barrel. Russia has reasons to benefit from this despite being hit by Western sanctions. There is an awful lot to unpack here, Isaac Levi, heads Europe- Russia policy and energy analysis team at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air joining us now.

However, high interest rates insinuating lower growth could enable prices to fall kind of slightly, also increased supply from other oil producers such as Brazil, U.S. and Guyana outside of those that have announced cuts, as you mentioned, Saudi Arabia and Russia could mean that actually oil prices stabilize and don't suppose --",

And Iassume that the Central Banks would have to react accordingly to hike interest rates against their willingness to do so. I think this is an unlikely for the rest of the month. As we've seen, Russia had announced their ban on gasoline and diesel exports, and perhaps loosening on that in recent announcements that they may be selling marine fuels as well. So I guess it depends on Russia's ability to sustain the supply cuts as they're very much dependent on oil exports to a few federal finances but also the war on Ukraine.

If you look at export revenues they've achieved this year compared to last year, they're much higher as a result of the EU's bands and other oil price cap measures, too. However, there's so much more that could be done to make the sanctions more effective in reducing Russian export revenues and Putin's ability to fund the war on Ukraine. Expanding on that, I think the article you're referring to is on their ability to develop what is often referred to as the shadow fleet. So these are vessels or tankers that are owned or insured outside those countries in imposing the sanctions. So for example, their tank is owned or insured in Russia. Russia was previously very reliant on the west to transport its oil on these boats. And therefore they to use these boats or insurance, they were forced to sell at a low price.",

Firstly, it's entirely possible that we get there. And secondly, there has been record growth in clean energy capacity, particularly solar and electric vehicles. But then you look at what needs to happen next and the goals are pretty steep by 2030, the IEA is saying there needs to be a tripling of renewable energy capacity. And by 2030, there needs to be a 25 percent drop in fossil fuel demand. Now, it's going to cost a lot. So currently, investment in clean energy is around $1.8 trillion this year. The IEA is saying that in the early 2030s, it needs to increase to 4.5 trillion dollars a year. Now, Fatih Birol, who's the Executive Director of the IEA, has already said that he believes oil will peak before 2030, which didn't go down particularly well with OPEC, I have to say, and today's got a warning actually for governments. He says we have a very clear message strong international cooperation is crucial to success. Governments need to separate climate from geopolitics, given the scale of the challenge at hand. And I wonder actually, whether this warning is quite pointed towards us and governments in particular. For instance, China, their climate envoy recently said they don't believe that phasing out fossil fuels entirely is realistic. Or of course here in the U.K. where they've actually watered down some of their climate policies believing that they're already on target so why is more ambitious.
