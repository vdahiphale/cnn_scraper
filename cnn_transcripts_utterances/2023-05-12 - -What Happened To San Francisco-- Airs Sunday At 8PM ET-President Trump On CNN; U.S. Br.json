According to the city's own controller's office, San Francisco residents feel less safe now than at any point since 1996.This week on \"THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER,\" our very own Sara Sidner heads to the Bay Area, a place she once called home, to find out what happened to San Francisco -- watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWS CENTRAL, SENIOR AND INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  So when I first laid eyes on San Francisco I was enchanted. From where I am right now, driving over the Bay Bridge, and it looked like someone had taken an enormous vat of fog and just continuously poured it over the hills -- like dry ice being poured over a perfectly sculpted city on a stage. And then you get down into the city and you meet these glorious human characters and you get to experience the microclimates and the terrifyingly steep hills that make the city an adventure. Then there's the glorious bridges that sit in the bay and welcome you into the shining city on a hill. The endlessly diverse neighborhoods from Chinatown to the Mission, to the Italian enclave of North Beach, to the pristine Presidio, which gives the city its lungs. And down to the Pacific that rests below, inviting you in and then biting your skin with its ice-cold touch. This city was endlessly magic and I loved this city. I mean, truly loved this city, and I still do -- it's just that it hurts to see what's happened to it.",

These are live pictures from Yuma, Arizona where we've been watching the line at the border grow. Now, we should mention it's not even 5:00 a.m. there yet. Joining us now is Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas. Mr. Secretary, the president met with you yesterday with Sec. Antony Blinken and Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin about the end of Title 42. As you've watched this play out over the course of the last several hours where do things stand? Can you update us on what you've seen, so far, seven hours into this kind of new reality? ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Good morning. We are seeing people arrive at our southern border as we expected and as we have been planning for. We are taking them into our custody. We are processing them. We are screening and vetting them and if they do not have a basis to remain we will remove them very swiftly under now what we can use -- our traditional immigration enforcement authorities. We have been very, very clear that there are lawful, safe, and orderly pathways to seek relief in the United States and if one arrives at our southern border one is going to face tougher consequences, and that is what we are going to deliver.",

And I say that with confidence because our plan has worked in the past. The president extended lawful safe and orderly pathways for individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela on January 5. And for those individuals from those countries who didn't use those pathways we delivered a tougher consequence. We saw a more than 90 percent drop in the number of encounters of those individuals in a matter of days. And so we've seen success. We will achieve success. It will take time.

And you put out a statement last night. You've been very clear that the border is not open. You know, one of our colleagues on the ground said it appears the Department of Homeland Security is making a very clear effort to kind of showcase the law enforcement efforts. Federal agents in black jackets and handcuffs were walking around Sacred Heart Church in El Paso asking migrants to turn themselves in. ICE was giving access to reporters for removal flights -- something I think the Obama administration did as well. Is it intentional?

And Justice Brennan said that sounds like a fear of too much justice.And I think we see that over and over again where the courts are just unwilling to do. We ought to be concerned with racial disparities in all kind of sentencing, not just in capital sentencing. But it's been invoked over and over again. In another case, Justice Powell we shouldn't ask jurors whether they have opinions -- racial prejudice opinions because then we'd have to ask about a lot of other things as well.
