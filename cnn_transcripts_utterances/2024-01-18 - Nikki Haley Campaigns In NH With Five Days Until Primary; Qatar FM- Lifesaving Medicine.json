Plus, CNN political analyst and White House reporter for the Associated Press Seung Min Kim. Good to see you both, ladies.Tia, let me start with you. We just heard one of the critiques there that Nikki Haley has made about Trump. But her critiques tend to be about the chaos that surrounds him or the turning of the page as a party or his age, and Biden's. But some say she's still holding back, that these are not strong enough. So, what do you think we see tonight at this town hall? Does she take the gloves off as some have said she needed to long ago? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: So, I think Nikki Haley is walking a really fine line because she does want to show her appeal, how much she could possibly perform better than Donald Trump in the general election and be a more palatable Republican candidate than a lot of people think Donald Trump is in a general election. However, she also realizes the dynamics of a Republican primary. In most primary states are not like New Hampshire where she can depend on independence to help her surge in the polls. So, she's speaking quite frankly to two different audiences at the same time, which is why we see her kind of going only so far in her critique of President Trump. I think she has to possibly make a choice eventually if she's going to go harder or pull back completely. One will benefit one group. One will benefit the other.",

We have some data that shows that he's run no ads there since mid-November. And now, he's turning his sights to South Carolina.Of course, Nikki's helped -- her home state.

Now, I think, as a result, this may help accelerate the perceived inevitability of President Trump. If he continues to win outright, quite frankly, while Haley and DeSantis keep trading second place, then he can say hey, why are we still focusing on who's second place? I'm the clear winner.So, I think it would not be great for Nikki Haley for -- if Ron DeSantis is able to do well in South Carolina.

You know, having been on the ground, what are you seeing in hospitals? DR. SEEMA JILANI, PEDIATRICIAN: I bore witness to a staggering failure of humanity as what I would call it. I -- in the first three hours of my work at the emergency room, I treated a 1-year-old boy with a bloody diaper and no right arm and no right leg. He was bleeding into his chest cavity. He needed a chest tube. He needed to go to the operating room, something in a United States hospital. He would have gone straight to the OR. The orthopedic surgeon bandaged him up and said we have so many other emergency pressing cases, which sets the stage and made me wonder what could be more pressing than a 1-year-old without an arm, a leg, and who is as fixating on his own blood?

That snow band just keeps moving up and down back and forth, up and down Lake Erie. It was south of us this morning. It's back over Buffalo this morning.And the snow had really picked up earlier. We could be looking at snowfall rates of two to three inches per hour as we go through the afternoon which the weather service says is lighter than it was yesterday. And we'll tack on another foot. We already have storm totals of 30 inches or more for some of those suburbs around Buffalo like West Seneca. And if you look behind me, we're going to run out of places to put it. I mean there are mountains of this stuff everywhere all over the city as they're trying to plow it out of the way because we had another leak event last weekend. The Buffalo fans are going to have to shovel out that stadium again before Sunday. As the Bills have another game, the hockey team postponed their game. And they have to try to play it tonight and another foot of snow. So, I want to show you what the radar looks like. You can see the bands that are just continuing to pump out there over Lake Erie and Ontario with the hefty snowfall rates. And it's picking up that moisture over the lake and just dumping with all that cold air. Looking at some of the snow depts, you can see where we've got the feet of snow up towards Watertown and Buffalo and it just, like I said, it just continues to come down. So, we're going to add to that map. And then I want to show you the lakes because this is what is so important -- in what I find so fascinating about this event because we're in January these lakes should have much more ice on them. But we had a record-warm December for a lot of these cities and states around the Great Lakes. So, the ice didn't get enough coverage and 00 yes, now you have all this moisture and it's dumping all that snow. Ice coverage should be about 20 percent, and we're only at eight, John.",
