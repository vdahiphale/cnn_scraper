As Republicans now prepare for a new opponent at the top of the Democratic ticket, President Biden says it should be Harris and is giving her his full support. In a letter posted on X, he also said, quote, \"it has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president.\" He went on to say he believed it is in the best interest of his party and the country for him to stand down in the race. In her own statement, Harris said she was honored to have Biden's endorsement and it was her intention to, quote, \"earn and win this nomination.\" CNN's MJ Lee is following developments from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Joe Biden had been so resistant to the calls on him to drop out of the 2024 race until he suddenly was not. We are told that that moment came within the last 24 hours or so and that it was really Saturday night that the president approached this decision. And Greenland, two of his closest advisers, Mike Donilon and Steve Ruschetti, to begin drafting that letter addressed to the American people. This was so closely held, though, that even some of the most senior advisers in the campaign and the White House didn't know, barely got a moment of heads up before that letter went public. Even Vice President Kamala Harris, we are told, only found out of the decision today on Sunday. Now, something that I am learning was not a factor in the president's decision. And all of this were medical issues. The president has not had any medical exams, any serious ones, at least we are told, other than basically the daily check ins that the president has had with his physician to check on the status of his COVID recovery. Now, the reason that we are clarifying that is because as recently as over the last week, the president suggested in an interview that only a new medical condition could sway him to drop out of the 2024 race. Of course, the reason we are here in the first place is because of the serious concerns about the president's health that really came to light and became amplified after his disastrous debate performance at the end of June. Now we are learning, of course, that the president at the end of the day could not overcome those concerns. And that is why he is now announcing that he will not be seeking a second term after all. And now he is throwing his full support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris. MJ Lee, CNN at the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president and is certainly not fit to serve and never was. He went on to say, quote, \"all those around him, including his doctor and the media, knew that he wasn't capable of being president and he wasn't.\"CNN's Kristen Holmes has more reaction from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump, his campaign, his orbit started preparing for the idea they might be running against someone other than President Joe Biden shortly after that debate took place. They started to see what was happening in the Democratic Party and really noting that it seemed to be more intense than they had originally thought. And that included putting together these sort of research books on each of the people they believed could be potential presidential candidates or nominees for the Democratic Party. That included some Democratic governors, high profile governors. But it also had a big focus on Vice President Kamala Harris. And that was because there is a fundamental belief that exists to this day among the campaign that she will end up being the nominee or that she was going to be the nominee if Biden were to drop out. Now, obviously, we are in a different situation. They have already started launching their attack ads on Kamala Harris. We expect to see some from the campaign in coming days. But we also know that Trump's super PAC, MAGA, Inc., one of the big super PACs aligned with him, is already running ads hitting Kamala Harris in battleground states. They're going to continue doing that. But the big thing here to note is that while you might hear from Donald Trump or some of his allies that they are confident they can beat Kamala Harris if she's at the top of the ticket or whoever's at the top of the ticket, there is a lot of concern that we are now in uncharted territory. They know that this could change enthusiasm. Changing enthusiasm going into November could change turnout. They had created an entire campaign that was going to run against President Joe Biden, and that included millions of dollars in data gathering, in modeling, all of that to beat President Joe Biden and no one else. So when you're talking to the campaign, to outside groups right now, yes, they are running polling against Kamala Harris, but they're also running polling against other potential nominees. But they're also doing is somewhat in a holding pattern because they are not going to spend that same level of output, that same level of money on Kamala Harris or anybody until they know for sure who is going to be the Democratic presidential nominee.

As you noted, the polls, the snap polls that have been taken show them neck and neck. I think that we are just -- and the Trump camp knows this. We are in a completely different battleground now with Harris at the top of the ticket or likely at the top of the ticket.

So he's obviously leaving in a way that he doesn't want to leave.But I think his biggest legacy will be enacting the Violence Against Women Act. Also, his response to COVID, not only the American Rescue Plan and keeping us out of a global recession, but also passing the largest environmental legislation that we've ever had in the United States and those sweeping and the infrastructure -- infrastructure bill. I think Biden will also go down in the history books as somebody who really did put country or party above his own personal interests.

But I will say that they have to be careful. Right. So this is a situation where I think you've seen over the last few weeks, party elites struggle with trying to figure out whether or not the president should stay in the race, whether or not they will anger certain constituencies within the party if they force him out or if he chooses to leave. And there are also conversations around whether or not Vice President Harris should be the nominee.

We've seen the Republicans really trying to advance their leverage in that base, but it's traditionally been a stronghold for the Democrats. I think Kamala Harris should do well in that area. But it's really, again, a very urgent, time sensitive moment moving away from a president and President Biden, who's been a very strong foreign policy president, who's been a centrist, a moderate with decades of experience, but had really come to be seen, especially in recent weeks, as just not the right person to take the party forward, partly because of his concerns over his mental state, his physical state, how he would endure for four more years.

Just one was after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. So how worried would the Republicans, particularly Trump, be looking at those numbers?",

Now, under Biden, the United States has shored up and bolstered ties with allies around the world, especially here in Asia, to counter a rising China. And as such, American allies here in the region, they've been offeringmessages of support, including the Australian prime minister who calls Biden, quote, \"an honorable man of integrity.\" Now, Prime Minister Albanese had war words to say. I want you to watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's bring it up for you. \"The South Korean government will continue to work closely with the U.S. to further develop the South Korea U.S. global comprehensive strategic alliance,\" unquote.We also heard from Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, who says the following quote, \"I recognize that President Biden's decision is based on his desire to make the best possible political decision. The Japan- U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of our nation's diplomatic security. We will continue to monitor it closely,\" unquote. Now, in contrast, the president of the Philippines directly responded to Biden's decision to drop out of the race, saying that it was a demonstration of genuine statesmanship. And on X, the social media platform, this is what we heard from Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos, Jr. He said this, quote, \"we thank for his constant, unwavering support for the Philippines in a delicate and difficult time.\" He's making reference there to the tensions that have been simmering between Manila and Beijing over China's claims, its assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea. And the United States has said that it stands with the Philippines. So as for China, at today's Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing in Beijing that just wrapped in the last hour or so, a spokesperson said that the U.S. election is America's own internal affair. So China has no comment. Back to you.",
