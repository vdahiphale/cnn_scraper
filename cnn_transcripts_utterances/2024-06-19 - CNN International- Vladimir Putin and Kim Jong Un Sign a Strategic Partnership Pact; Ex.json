The optics obviously, a lot of pomp and circumstance, massive crowds, children waving Russian flags, Putin's picture emblazoned across one side of Kim Il Sung Square. All of this smacks of the Russian attempt to show that it is not only not isolated by the war in Ukraine, but that Putin's patronage is actually prized in some parts of the world, and certainly here in this relationship, unlike the relationship that he has with China.No one can accuse Putin of being the junior partner, so those optics that they know the West is watching, the rhetoric as well also not very subtle. At one point, President Putin thanks Kim Jong Un for supporting all Russian policies and then goes on to clarify and lest we were in any doubt that he means confronting, what he calls, the imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites. I think, look, Mike is right, the pact, this comprehensive strategic agreement that they have reached, it does raise a lot of questions, but it also looks very much like a counter to NATO's Article 5, that defensive pact in NATO that calls for an attack on one ally to be seen as an attack on all. And this, of course, coming as Russia watches, as Western weapons are starting to make their way to the frontlines in Ukraine, those long-awaited U.S. supplies, as restrictions are being lifted on using some of those supplies to hit Russia. And this is way to send a message, I think, by cozying up to North Korea that Russia is not to be trifled with in this was. So, very clear messaging, very clear that the audience here is in large part at least the collective West, as Russia call it.",

Happening right now, millions of Americans are grappling with a triple weather threat, deadly wildfires, extreme heat and the first possible named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. A heat wave is sending temperatures soaring across the Midwest and Northeast. In New England, the National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine has issued its first-ever excessive heat warning, plus the Texas Coast is under a tropical storm warning. The system is expected to bring heavy rain, high winds, and flash flooding over the next several days. And then you move out farther west, crews there in California are making some headway battling wildfires. LA counties, post fire is now 31 percent contained, but a state of emergency remains in place in New Mexico as fast growing wildfires burn thousands of hectares. You can see the plumes of smoke there. One person has now died as thousands flee the flames. I want to check in with Rosa Flores, standing by for us in Corpus Christi, Texas where they are already experiencing tropical storm conditions. Rosa, what are you seeing?

What is the situation there?ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. This is an area in Ruidoso, New Mexico, mountain city where about 8,000 people or so have evacuated in the last 48 hours and the remnants of the existence of this fire, wildfires continue. It is actually two different wildfires surrounding this area which have burned up to about 20,000 acres in all. So very dangerous situations and the terrain, obviously, mountainous and very difficult for firefighters to work in, but we are surrounded by these wildfires and that is why you are seeing all of the smoke. And obviously, a great deal of roads that are impassable at this point because it is just too dangerous. This road takes you out kind of to the northern edge of Ruidoso, New Mexico and we believe those are neighborhoods that have been some of the hardest hit. In all about 1,400 structures in this area have been destroyed or damaged by the wildfires since they first erupted Monday morning. And we've spoken with a number of residents, many people who have fled, obviously, a great deal of uncertainty and trying to figure out exactly the status of people's homes. Many people having to leave very quickly Monday night, into Tuesday as well. Some other areas that -- where the wildfire flared up yesterday afternoon, we saw evacuations ongoing throughout there. So, all of this continues to remain a very volatile situation. But, Amara, there is a sliver of good news possibly coming later today. Weather forecasts show so that it could start raining after three o'clock mountain time here in the United States, in this particular area, which could help speed up the relief and help the firefighters to extinguish these fires much quickly because, right now, the fires are barely contained in any kind of way. So, firefighters still trying to get the situation under control, but rain showers later today could help them do that much more quickly. Amara?",

That is according to a CNN analyst, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the U.S. was withholding military aid in this new video.Now, in it, Mr. Netanyahu says \"It is inconceivable that the U.S. has been withholding weapons and ammunition from Israel.\" And the White House took issue with those claims. Separately, Israel is warning Hezbollah that there could potentially be an all-out war after the Iran-backed militant group published a video appearing to show military and civilian sites in Israel. This comes as the Israeli military approves operational plans for a potential offensive against Hezbollah and Lebanon. Meantime, a mobile pier constructed by the U.S. to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza is out of service once again due to bad weather and heavy seas. Officials say sea conditions will only worsen as fall and winter approach, raising questions about the pier's lifespan. CNN's Oren Liebermann has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the waters off southern Israel, these U.S. army vessels wait for work. They are part of the operation for the U.S. built temporary pier to Gaza. But the pier is here some 30 miles from the war-torn strip in the Israeli port city of Ashdod, tucked behind this power plant. From these satellite images, you can see it is sheltering at the port, unable once again to operate in heavy seas. The pier began with a major promise from President Joe Biden. JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean. A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day. (APPLAUSE) LIEBERMANN (voice-over): Two months after the State of the Union, the pier known as JLOTS did begin delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. U.S. aid said this nautical option would one day be able to feed 0.5 million people a month as critical supplies on the grounds stalled at checkpoints and airdrops could only do so much. But a week after it began operations in May, the pier broke in heavy seas. Repairs took more than a week, and the small army vessels that are part of the system also needed work after four of them ran aground in high waves and winds. The Pentagon said a rare weather pattern knocked the $230 million pier out of commission.",

The pop star was charged with driving while intoxicated after being pulled over by the police in the Hamptons, which has an upscale community on Long Island, New York. Now, an officer said Timberlake's eyes were bloodshot and glassy and that there was a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. Timberlake told police he had one drink with friends and was following them home.CNN's Brynn Gingras is tracking the story for us. Hi there, Brynn. So tell us, what are we learning about what happened here? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Amara, well, so far we haven't heard from Justin Timberlake or his locally based attorney here in Sag Harbor. We are not really sure if we will get a comment after that charge of one count of DWI, but there you have it. You just said that. At 12:30 in the morning about, Monday morning, Justin Timberlake left allegedly police say a hotel in this downtown area of town and drove away. And there's actually a video camera footage capturing him driving down the street and police say he blew through a stop sign and then kept driving about six more blocks, swerving over the lanes and then he got pulled over. And according to the police officer, who was actually wearing body camera footage, he says that like you said, Timberlake had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath. He had slurred speech and when he was grabbing his vehicle registration, he had bloodshot eyes and then they performed a field sobriety test. And according to the court paperwork, Justin Timberlake failed that field sobriety test, not able to really be steady on his footing. When they took them back to the local jail, he apparently refused a breathalyzer three times, and so he was booked. He spent the night in jail, ahead of his arraignment where he pled not guilty to that single charge and he was released on his own recognizance. Now, this is all happening in the midst of Justin Timberlake on a world tour. He was in town, expected though to still perform this weekend in Chicago, but he then coming back to New York to perform at Madison Square Garden. He does have another court date for this charge. It is not until July 26th. He actually doesn't need to come back here. It's going to be a virtual court hearing and that on that date, Amara, he is actually going to be in Poland with another concert date. So we'll see how he responds to all of this, again, no comment just yet, but we'll also see how this could affect possibly his tour.",

Born in Alabama, he earned the nickname, the \"Say Hey Kid\" for his enthusiasm towards baseball.

Seven years later, Mays had one of his best seasons, clubbing 52 home runs, winning a second MVP award. During the 1972 season, the 41-year-old was dealt back to New York to play for the Mets and what became the last at bat of his career, Mays hit a game-winning single in the 12th inning of game two of the 1973 World Series, putting an exclamation point on a one of a kind career. But perhaps even greater than his performance on the field was the legacy he left off it, playing his first major league game just four years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier, Mays helped to carry the torch for future black baseball players and athletes, and he inspired his community for generations to come. [08:55:00] BARACK OBAMA, (D) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A few years ago, Willie rode with me on Air Force One. I told him then what I'll tell all of you now.
