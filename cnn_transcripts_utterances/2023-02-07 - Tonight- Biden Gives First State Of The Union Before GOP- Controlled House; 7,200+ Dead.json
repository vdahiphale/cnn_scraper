But I think it's important to note one of the key pieces of this, which is just how many people are going to be watching this president in primetime in this moment, given kind of the backdrop here of a divided Congress, kind of a critical inflection point of his first term in office, and what we expect to be a couple of weeks before he announces that reelection bid.And the importance of this moment for this president. One, to connect with White House officials' view is very real, intangible accomplishments of his first two years in office. Particularly on the legislative side, the economic recovery, the public health crisis, they believe is now waning largely under control. But trying to connect those not just to the American public, that still seems to some degree to be skeptical when you look at the polling right now, but also connect them to what they believe they can accomplish going forward. When you talk to White House officials, they make clear progress will be a key element here but not a mission accomplished type moment, that there is more work to do and the president is going to lay out why he believes he can finish the job not just over the next year or two years, but perhaps the next six years. And I think that is kind of the undercurrent here, that's very important. Now the president will, as you noted, detail economic agenda, will details foreign policy plans. You can look at the guests in the First Lady's box to get a good sense of the president's decisions to talk about police reform, to talk about mental health, to talk about the war in Ukraine that is still ongoing, that is such a focal point of the president's foreign policy at this point in time. And -- but he will also talk about Republicans. And don't expect this to be when he talks about as officials any kind of political attack line speech or partisan warfare type speech He will lay out very clearly that when it comes to the debt limit battle that we're already kind of in the middle of right now, the president has a diametrically opposed view than the individual that will be sitting behind him, speaker Kevin McCarthy But he will also detail where he believes there are areas of overlap where the two parties can work together and try and kind of lay out a lowering the temperature steadfast leadership type moment when he knows tens of millions of Americans are going to be watching. It'll be a long speech, but it will be an important speech for the president not just for what he's done or what he's doing right now but what he expects to do in the months ahead, guys.",

And what I'm looking for is exactly what policy she's going to shape. She's going to talk about social conservatism. She's going to talk about how good the overturning of Roe v.

So, this is -- these are extreme positions even in -- within the context of the Republican Party. But then she's going to -- she's going to put out some other economic pushbacks, I think to the Biden message to your point, Bianna, I think it'll have to do with pouring a bunch of money into the economy, and what role did that have in stimulating the jobs market? And what we're all -- well does that happen simulating payrolls? I am looking for this rift in this wedge that you're going to see.

And if you're thinking about presidential legacy, there's a case to be made that he should go out on his own terms, create a clear contrast with his predecessor, show the virtue of democracy is not about holding on to power at all stakes, and really focusing on a long-term policy agenda.But being real, there's a power of incumbency. Democrats giving that up would be seen as a self-inflicted wound. And so, these are the kinds of calculations that are being made. All the gravitational pull seems to be about him running again. And if he does, he's got to show he can work with Republicans and that we can pass things that we're not as divided as we seem. That's core to, I think, the appeal of this presidency. But there's these other factors, age and the right arc of history, which you should keep in mind.",

A search and rescue team from Kazakhstan, for example, on a site just about 50 yards down from where I'm standing at the moment on what was a live search and rescue operation until about an hour ago, they've had to call a halt to that because the building which was partially collapse is in danger of fully collapsing. There were 24 people in that building when the quake struck at 4On the site behind me here, we understand there are some 15 people unaccounted for. We have been hearing signs of life or reports of signs of life from the team here who have been using, and it's incredible to see -- I mean, they're using heavy equipment, you may be able to see the drills or hear the drills behind me, they're using space. But, Bianna, they're using -- and Victor, they're using their bare hands at times to just shovel away the debris because they understand -- that they believe through the equipment they're using that there are or there may be a void underneath here in which there may be people still alive. In fact, a couple of hours ago, there were reports that somebody had actually contacted them with a mobile phone to say that they were still alive. So, we've been hearing these calls for silence. When all the heavy equipment is turned off, everybody goes silent. Those on the site, those who are gathered here, and many of those gathered here beside me are family members. Everybody goes silent, hoping against hope that the rescuers will actually be able to recover somebody. Sadly, while we've been here, that hasn't happened. Certainly, that hasn't -- they haven't rescued anybody alive. And in fact, they held a white sheet up about an hour and a half ago. They were clearly bringing out a body. But the rescue goes on -- the search and rescue goes on. This is not a recovery scene as of yet. And I can tell you, every single person working on that site will continue until they have to close this out. It is not quite as cold as it was. It was bitterly cold when this earthquake struck. But it's about minus one -- minus two now. So, these conditions are not easy for us. I say while there is hope, these guys and these women will continue. We're like 41 hours into this operation as things stand at the moment. Back to you two.",

This is separate from the TBI's investigation. They are pursuing a criminal investigation, so these officers are expected to be disciplined bringing the total to at least 13 officers who have been or will be disciplined for their role in the Tyre Nichols stop. These officers were not identified nor were any details given as to their involvement.But the city council meeting has been tense at times and was certainly emotional. And there was a very tense exchange between one councilman and the police chief here, CJ Davis, during which this councilman said that she was like Where's Waldo in the days after that this incident was made public. She was also asked whether or not what happened to Tyre Nichols was a cultural problem within the police department or a training problem. Listen to her response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CERELYN \"CJ\" DAVIS, MEMPHIS POLICE CHIEF: Culture is not something that changes overnight. You know, there is a saying in law enforcement that culture eats policy for lunch. We don't want to just have good policies because policies can be navigated around. We want to ensure that we have the right people in place to ensure our culture is evolving and it's changing to the philosophy that we're talking about the reforming and the reimagining of what policing looks like in our community. So, having the right people in the right place at the right time is critically important. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
