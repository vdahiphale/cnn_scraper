But I just want to say, the process of certification is for any design, right? Even if it hadn't been with a carbon fiber hull, you still go through same process to certify it. The fact that the carbon fiber hull was present demanded special extra attention just because that had never been done before. And it meant an additional effort and probably quite a bit of extra testing to get past to that certification process.",

And, you know, the issuing of the letter and the discussion is like, look, you are going really fast over here and you are ignoring some of the knowledge base that we have for these things. And the response, which is not completely unique in an industry, is, well, the existing regulations are stifling innovation and it's too slow and we have a better method. And it's like, well, now, it's maybe not the only answer, but it is a reliable answer and a process that we know works. You put a design at the front and what comes out is a safe submarine.Finding and developing an alternative method of self-certification, it's not forgiving. I mean - and it's a lot of people that put their minds to this, to get humanity, I like to say, to a level of knowledge where we can go reliably to the deep ocean because there is absolutely nothing easy about this.",

And some of these references were, at minimum, tangential relevant to this industry.And it did cause some concern. And, yes, I think it was meant to - to show we have some expertise here. But as the experts in this industry, we knew where the expertise lied. And it's - it's a -- you know, it's one of the things that did come out of the letter and one of the issues we asked that OceanGate remediate, and that was to clear up some of their website. They were using some language to reassure people that sounded like they were certified. And we asked, look, you can't use language like that. It will be misconstrued. Please fix it. And that they did. I mean, in the end, it was very clear that it was experimental, not certified. And, you know, that's part of public safety. It's a - it's a question, what do we do about these things. And one aspect is, full disclosure. Just tell the public, this is not certified, this is experimental, and then it leaves some of the decisions to people to make if -- are you willing to go into this.",

PETER BOYNTON (RET.), U.S. COAST GUARD: Yes, just listening to it, it's been years since I've read the Coast Guard guidance documents, but if my memory serves here, I could swear that there was a reference to whether or not the operator is misleading about the safety of the vessel, that then becomes a factor as to whether or not it's unsafe operations.

We're going to be getting back to Anderson and Newfoundland shortly. But first we want to go down to Washington, D.C. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, receiving VIP treatment at the White House at Thursday's lavish White House dinner. Top CEOs attended, like Google, Microsoft, Apple, they were all there. Top officials as well. The toast at that dinner followed a news conference, which, for Modi, is quite rare. He actually took questions from one U.S. reporter, one Indian reporter, including questions about his human rights record. Now, in between that news conference and that dinner, he also addressed Congress. Today, Vice President Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will host a luncheon for Modi. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us now from the White House. And, Arlette, this is an all-out blitz to some degree by the White House, by the administration, but also by Capitol Hill. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. There are very real concerns about human rights, perhaps backsliding on the Democratic front with India. Some Democrats didn't attend the speech yesterday in Congress and yet the White House is unequivocal about the need and necessity to go all in here. Why?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Phil, the White House has really pulled out all the stops with this state dinner in order to show that they are trying to boost this relationship with India. A key part of that is they are seeking to build up these ties to have India serving as a counterbalance to China's growing influence in the region.Now, last night it capped off with that state dinner, which was rather glitzy and included a vegetarian menu to accommodate Modi's vegetarian diet. And those two men actually toasted with ginger ale because they don't drink. And the president gave that toast to two great nations and two great powers. Of course, China is in the backdrop of all of these discussions that played out yesterday. And yesterday the president did not back down from his recent labeling of Chinese President Xi Jinping as a dictator. He said he doesn't think that those comments have thwarted efforts to stabilize relations with China and ultimately said he does hope that he and Xi can meet soon. But that news conference between President Biden and the Indian prime minister was also remarkable for the fact that Modi simply doesn't take questions from reporters very often. But he stood there and faced a very pointed question about his own record when it comes to cracking down on political dissent and also targeting religious minorities. Modi stood there and claimed that he - that there is no space for discrimination in his country. A lot of people had also been watching how Biden would approach that. Now, in just a short while, in a few hours, Biden and Modi will be gathering once again here at the White House to meet with tech leaders involved in the AI space and also semiconductor world. Just another effort highlighting how Biden views India as a possible counterbalance to China.",

But these are serious people with serious curiosity willing to put serious money down to go to these interesting places. And I don't want to discourage that. But I think that it's almost now the lesson, the takeaway is, make sure if you're going to go into a vehicle, whether it's an aircraft or a surface craft or a submersible, that it's been through certifying agencies, you know, that it's been signed off.Every day we trust our lives to engineering. We step into an elevator. We make an assumption that somebody somewhere has done the math properly and it's all been certified properly. We should take the same precautions when we get into a submersible. Even if it's at a resort and we're only going down 300 feet or 1,000 feet.",

It led to much safer and better, greater use of the oceans as well. So, we need to learn from that, from this incident. But I would take a little exception with what he said that I am worried about innovation. And I think we can do better with inspection and regulation at the speed of innovation, not because it's sloppy, but because we're in a new century. We need to move fast to support the innovators.",
