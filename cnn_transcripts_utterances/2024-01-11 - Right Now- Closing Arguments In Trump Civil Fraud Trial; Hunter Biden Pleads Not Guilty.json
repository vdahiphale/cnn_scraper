The final moments of Donald Trump's civil fraud trial are playing out right now in New York courtroom, a trial that cuts to the heart of everything that Donald Trump has built his name on. The New York Attorney General Letitia James's office is finishing up their closing arguments right now. They are trying to make the case that Donald Trump and his adult sons, Donny and Eric, and their company defrauded banks and insurance companies by lying about the value of their asset. The New York attorney general wants Trump to pay $370 million in fine and for him to be banned from ever doing business in New York state again. The judge, we should note, has already found Donald Trump liable on one of the seven counts. Trump's team has rejected all of the claims of fraud from the very beginning, and they're alleging without proof that Donald Trump is being prosecuted because he is running for office. Donald Trump once again, tried to turn the courtroom into a campaign appearance today. He delivered a five-minute monologue full of complaints in the courtroom that led the judge to tell Trump's lawyers to get his client under control. Mr. Trump then took his grievances down the street to the microphones at one of his New York properties. There he speculated without evidence that his legal troubles are the fault of Joe Biden and they are helping him in the Republican primaries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If we cut through all the bluster, this is one of Donald Trump's defense, stronger points here. This is not your typical fraud case where somebody was ripped off, where somebody made a representation to investors and then the money was taken or even in a bank case where someone made a false statement, got a bank loan and then defaulted on it.And what Trump's team has argued is these are sophisticated multibillion dollar banks. They did their own diligence, they willingly made these loans. They got repaid and they got repaid with interest. Now legally speaking, if there was still fraud, if the numbers were vastly inflated, that can still hold up on some of the counts, including the count that judges already ruled in Trump's -- excuse me, in the A.G.'s favor on.

This was at a time when Israel is fighting a genocide, a moment when Israel was being accused of genocide, that's something you're likely to hear more of tomorrow as well, the idea that this is self-defense. Still, we've been speaking to the South African delegations tonight. They believe that whatever the international jurisprudence that is established here by the court, whatever its final decision on those provisional measures around the broader question of genocidal acts, South Africa believes that they have done something important here today by forcing Israel to explain itself on the specifics of what and how it is going about that campaign inside the Gaza Strip -- Jake.",

The agency said it recently cancelled six planned missions to northern Gaza because requests for a safe passage were simply rejected.Just yesterday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, part of the International Red Cross, said four of its medics were killed when Israeli airstrike hit their ambulance in central Gaza. Israel's military has not commented. All this as hunger and disease grip the Gaza, nearing the 100th day of war. The executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, joins us now. Cindy, good to see you as always. So a new analysis from the integrated food security phase classification shows a quarter of Gaza's population of roughly 2 million, a quarter face the highest possible level of food insecurity that's called catastrophic hunger. How unusual is this rapid acceleration to that status, and the sheer scale of hunger and food insecurity in Gaza? CINDY MCCAIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME:  Well, what we're looking at right now and you reflect the numbers very accurately is famine -- the lack of food, the inability to obtain quality food, all the things that produce the kind of situation that the people of Gaza are in right now, are exactly what's happening. We are looking at famine. The only way that we can prevent this is by a ceasefire, number one. And number two, safe and unfettered access in for our trucks and for our people to be able to feed, not just those people that are in the shelters, but people there within the small our communities as well. We've got to get in there. We have to. People are starving to death and a lot of them are children unfortunately.",
