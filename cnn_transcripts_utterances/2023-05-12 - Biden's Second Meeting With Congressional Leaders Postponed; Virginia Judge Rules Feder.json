What are we willing to actually negotiate on? And a couple areas are potential. This is far from being finalized. They are not close to a framework. But what they are looking at is some kind of budget caps agreement. That is how much money they are going to spend over the next several years. That's potentially on the table. They are also talking about whether or not to do permitting reform as part of this negotiation. That is something that Republicans and Democrats have both looked at as a potential. They are looking at clawing back some of the unused Covid funds, given the fact that that declaration has ended in this country. I think there's a question of what to do with some of that unspent money. That could be a way to have some government savings. So that gives a sense of what they are talking about. But like I said, time is running short. There are about four days when Republicans in the Senate and Democrats -- or excuse me, Democrats in the Senate are all going to be in Washington. That's not to say that people can't stay behind. That's not to say staff isn't going to continue negotiating until this is done. But that gives a sense of just the timeline that we're operating under.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Bri, this is just the latest flash point in the debate over gun rights and public safety following that sweeping Supreme Court decision last year involving the state of New York.Now what the high court had ruled then was that any law restricting gun rights must face a so-called historical test, the question being is the law consistent with tradition and law at the nation's founding over 200 years ago. This federal judge in Virginia ruled that federal laws banning 18 to 20-year-olds from buying handguns from federally licensed dealers is unconstitutional because there was no similar law on the books when the United States was founded. I'll read you part of what that judge said in his ruling. He wrote, \"The government has not presented any evidence of age-based restrictions on the purchase or sale of firearms from the Colonial Area, founding or early republic.\" Again, getting to that historical text. Many gun rights groups have celebrated this ruling. They point to the fact that 18 to 20-year-olds can buy guns legally from private sellers in many states. And they say this ruling will ensure that young buyers go through federal background checks when they buy from a licensed dealer. But of course, gun safety advocates clearly are disturbed by this ruling. I'll read you one statement from the group Every Town for Gun Safety. They say, quote, \"Not only are guns the leading cause of death for U.S. kids and teens, but research shows that 18 to 20-year-olds commit homicides at triple the rate of adults 21 years and older.\" They go on to say, \"The court's ruling will undoubtedly put lives at risk. It must be reversed.\" Finally, as far as what happens next, the U.S. Justice Department is expected to appeal this ruling. Brianna, we'll wait and see how this hot-button issue plays out in the coming weeks. KEILAR: Yes, we certainly will. Josh, thank you for that. Boris?",

The judge has ordered him and the mother of his 4- year-old daughter to provide more information about their finances, including detailed responses from Biden about his art sales and his tax returns. The case has morphed into a proxy war, pitting the president's son against Republicans who trying to get their hands on his financial records. Also, a heavy penalty for two men who admitted to cheating during a fishing tournament by stuffing lead weights inside their fish. An Ohio judge sentenced the men to 10 days in jail and their fishing licenses have been suspended for three years. They must forfeit their boat worth $130,000. Each man has to pay a $2,500 fine. If the fishermen had not been caught tipping the scales at last year's competition, their prize would have been nearly $30,000. Kentucky police have captured this man, Kyle Aaron Skaggs. He had been missing since Monday. Described as armed and dangerous after walking out of a home incarceration program in Lexington.",

This brings the United States into line with other places like the U.K. and Canada. And this really had been an evolution since going back to 1985 when the FDA enacted a lifetime ban on gay and bisexual men from donating blood because of concerns about the spread of HIV through the blood supply. That changed in 2015. They lightened that up, requiring a period of abstinence before people could donate. Then during the pandemic, when there was a real crisis in the blood supply, they shortened that even further to three months. Now finally, they are unifying this really across all donors -- Boris?",

KEILAR: As the U.S. continues to face an unprecedented medicine shortage, a new report shows cancer treatments are among the hardest hit. There's an active shortage of about two dozen chemo drugs. Nine out of 10 oncologists say drug shortages left them unable to properly care for their patients. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen is joining us now on this. Elizabeth, you have spoken to cancer patients who have needed drugs and then they were not able to get them. That must be devastating for them. DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Brianna, I spoke to a mother whose child had cancer, a little girl. She was supposed to get a certain chemotherapy regimen and they said, guess what, we can't do it, we can't do it today, we can't do it tomorrow. They couldn't do it for a long time. They didn't have the drug. I spoke to a man with prostate cancer. He got only partial treatment. They said, we know if we could give you the full treatment, it would add years to your life, but we can't do it. So it's obviously very devastating to hear that. It's not just cancer drugs. If you look at data from the University of Utah, more than 300 drugs have been in shortage in just this year, in the past five months. The last time it was this bad was in 2014. Now it's interesting. The University of Utah asked pharmaceutical companies, what's the reason for this shortage or that shortage? And 56 percent of the time they didn't give an answer. The answer is unknown. So here are people who can't get their cancer drugs. Pharmaceutical companies, their response, we don't know why there's a shortage or we won't say -- Brianna?",
