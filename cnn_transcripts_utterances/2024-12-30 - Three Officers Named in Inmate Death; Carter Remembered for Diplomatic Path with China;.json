CNN has learned that at least three of the officers accused in the death of Robert Brooks have been accused of assault in previous incidents at the same prison. Disturbing body cam video shows multiple correctional officers punching and kicking Brooks, who was handcuffed at the time. Let's bring in CNN's Polo Sandoval, who is following this story. Polo, what's the latest here? What more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Rahel.So, a lot of what we've learned has been actually found in some court documents that have been obtained by CNN. They specifically show that three of the officers suspected in the fatal beating of Robert Brooks had been previously accused of assault at the same upstate New York correctional facility. Two of them, Sergeant Glenn Trombly and Officer Anthony Farina, are each named in a 2022 complaint filed in federal court. It's regarding a 2020 incident in which those two officers allegedly looked on as a fellow officer beat a handcuffed inmate at the very same facility that Brooks died in earlier this month. That beating reportedly left the - left the inmate permanently disfigured. But then there's also Officer Nicholas Anzalone. That's the correctional officer who's named in a separate 2022 complaint alleging that he not only joined in on the assault of an inmate, but also that he was allegedly involved in a covering up of - really a fabrication of disciplinary charges against the inmate who was left with what's been described by his attorney as substantial physical and mental injuries. Now, both of these cases, Rahel, they were first reported by \"The New York Times.\" [08:35:01] They are still pending. CNN actually reached out to the New York Corrections Department for more information on these previous allegations. They said they do not comment on pending litigation. But I also want to add that in 2022 there was an independent watchdog group that actually found widespread results of assault and also mistreatment at the hands of the staff. The corrections department responded to that report, saying that it was simply - certainly troubled by this, and said that it was in the process or had at least addressed some of those concerns from the group, including the deployment of body worn cameras earlier this year. And those cameras are what captured the fatal beating of Brooks earlier this month. Weve seen this video. Parts of it, quite disturbing to watch here. Brooks had been serving a 12-year sentence for assault. He's seen in the footage getting kicked and punched by officers while his hands were still handcuffed behind his back. At one point, something is even shoved into Mr. Brooks' mouth. The next day he was pronounced dead at the hospital. It's still unclear, Rahel, exactly what led up to the moment where they brought him into the examination room. The New York Department of Corrections has already named 14 staff members suspected in Brooks' death. None of them, or their representatives, have commented since the video was released earlier this weekend by the New York state attorney general. CNN has reached out for comment from those correctional officers. But something that's certainly telling, Rahel, of the brutal nature of this beating is that the correctional officers union, which, as we know, typically defends these correctional officers, have responded saying that this is, quote, incomprehensible.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  A smile and a handshake between two very different men who saw a common future. U.S. President Jimmy Carter and China's communist leader Deng Xiaoping both knew the fate of the world would one day hinge on relations between the U.S. and China. It was 1979. Washington established diplomatic ties with communist Beijing. And for a president who got a deal done between Egypt and Israel and struck a nuclear accord with the Soviet Union, Carter believed ending hostility with Beijing was among his greatest achievements.",

Recently released former detainees tell CNN that he is being held at a controversial military base that doubles as a detention facility. CNN has not independently verified that.
