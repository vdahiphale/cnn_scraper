White House officials have been looking ahead to the summit and talking about how they would handle the dynamic at play here. There were talks of boycotts, talks about walkout. None of that eventually came into path because the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, decided not to show up.But it is still the overriding topic that the leaders are talking about behind the scene. And we understand that there is now an effort underway to circulate a leader's declaration that would condemn the war in Ukraine and specifically condemn the after effects of the war -- high energy prices, high food prices. And what a senior admission official said is most countries have signed on to that declaration. Of course, left unsaid there is that some countries are still hold out. And that is sort of the dynamic of the G20. It is not like the G7, where all the countries are aligned, sort of focused on the same thing. It's a much more sprawling group, different ideologies, different geographies, different national interest that are at play. And so, as President Biden goes to meet world leaders at the summit, speaks to them on the sidelines as pull-aside talks, he is trying to convince them to sign on to this declaration, to take a firmer stance against Russia. And when you think about the equivocal nation, the nations that have been expressed strong support for Ukraine or strong opposition to Russia you are thinking about India. Even the countries, the G7 host, Indonesia, hasn't necessarily been a strong as some white outs officials would like. Now, remember President Biden has said, repeatedly, that he doesn't believe Russia should be a member of the G20 at all. That is not really a discussion right here at the summit. It would require all of these other countries to agree with him on that. And that's really a nonstarter that we do expect to see more about this declaration, more about this language about Russia over the next several hours, days as the summit continues -- Christine.",

And they believe it's time for the party to put Donald Trump behind them, testing how they're going to message that. How directly they're going to stay that and how they're going to position themselves. And I think we'll really be hearing Trump's announcement tonight in the context of that. Ron DeSantis, probably, is the most formidable opponent. Certainly early polling, whatever that's worth, it's not worth much. But, at this stage, the 2024 race certainly showing Ron DeSantis is sort of the most prominent Republican and opposition. What is Trump counting on? He's counting on trying to bring back the magic of 2016, where there were so many challengers to him in the field that it actually ended up creating a clear path for him.

Obviously, the challenge for any candidate in trying to create the magic of two campaign to go is that he was an unknown at the time. And America now knows what would a Donald Trump presidency be like.So, I think that he wants to recapture the winning spirit of 2016. But, it will be very hard to recreate the conditions of 2016.
