He faces extradition to the United States where he could be sentenced to 115 years in prison. One day after the embattled FTX founder was arrested in the Bahamas, he was denied bail by a judge who said he posed a flight risk.In New York, federal prosecutors unsealed an eight-count criminal indictment, which includes charges of fraud and conspiracy and violating campaign finance laws. Meanwhile, the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued this statement, we allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception, while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto.

He's facing eight counts of criminal liability. And these span the gamut. And what we're seeing in this context is a potential legal liability that could be serious enough to land him in jail for life. So, this is very, very serious legal jeopardy for him.One issue that the U.S. will face is obviously trying to extradite Sam Bankman-Fried to the U.S. And that process could in fact take potentially months, if not actually years in some cases. So, one potential roadblock that the Justice Department here could face. And that could give Sam Bankman-Fried potentially some kind of reprieve going forward are the extradition proceedings that we will -- that he will have to face in order to be moved from the Bahamas to face trial here in the U.S. CHURCH: All right. So, if convicted, as you say on all counts, Bankman-Fried could face more than 100 years in prison life in other words. So, what about the other people linked to his company and also the various stars who supported FTX? Tom Brady, his former wife, Giselle and many others. How liable have they ultimately given some would not have known of the deception or fraud? They wouldn't have known about the inner workings. Some would?",

It's unsurprising that the case has been bought first against Sam Bankman-Fried. This is a situation in which he is the headline grabber, he is obviously the head of the entire organization. We heard testimony today at the financial services hearing from Mr. John Ray III who is the current CEO that pointed to Sam Bankman-Fried as the person who was running this entire enterprise.And so, we certainly have a very strong culpability for Sam Bankman- Fried. But obviously, what Mr. Ray also pointed to was this coterie of other very close confidants that were in concentrated control, in Mr. Reyes' words off FTX. And what the indictment today pointed to was a series of conspiracy charges, conspiracy for wire fraud, for example. And in that context, you do have a conspiracy, you are assuming that there will be other conspirators that will be involved in this context. So certainly, if you are connected to the very close circle of advisers that were running FTX at the time, there is every reason to worry that you are next in line to face legal Jeopardy in this context. Now looking much further afield for folks like the big stars involved in this case, as you mentioned, Rosemary. Tom Brady and the other big stars that were very closely involved in hyping up FTX. That is a harder case to establish. In fact, the other day, or one of the cases against them was thrown out, the high potential is going to be harder to face because there's no real crutch there to say that these folks were deceiving particular customers or they even knew about the problems that were happening in FTX at the time,",

As Russia continues to ramp up its aerial assault, Ukraine could soon get a much-needed boost to its defenses, exclusive reporting by CNN shows the U.S. is finalizing plans to send the highly advanced patriot missile defense system to Ukraine.U.S. officials tell CNN the plan is expected to be approved soon by both the U.S. Defense Secretary and President Joe Biden. And the Patriots could be shipped in just a matter of days. Ukraine has long been asking for the system but the training on how to use it, well that could take many months.

Air Defense has been one of the U.S.'s top priorities to get to Ukraine and a key focus of the international meetings to see what systems are available.U.S. now making the decision to send one of its most advanced systems, the long-range patriot, which will fit on top of the systems that U.S. has already provided. At the beginning of the war. it was the short- range Stinger missiles, then more recently, the NASAMS, the medium- range air defense system, and the Patriot will fit on top of that at a crucial time as Russia carries out missile strikes, drone strikes and rocket attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and energy infrastructure causing widespread blackouts and water shortages across the country. And that seems to be part of what tipped the scales in favor of sending over the Patriot missiles. There was also a question of how long the training on these would take. Normally it takes months but now that the U.S. sees this war is dragging on, and as the U.S. is set to perhaps expand its trading of Ukrainian forces, the opportunity is there to provide the necessary training to operate Patriot missiles so Ukrainian can operate them, sustain them and maintain them effectively. That was one of the key decisions here. How quickly could they get into the country? Well, the U.S. has repeatedly shown he can move systems very quickly when it comes to HIMARS and Howitzers, the bigger challenges the training, Ukraine has shown repeatedly that it can compress the trading timeline in some of these more advanced systems. Still, this trading normally takes months. How much can that be compressed? Well, we're about to find out. Oren Lieberman, CNN at the Pentagon.",

The move is meant to slow inflation. The latest government report shows prices are still high but inflation is cooling. Consumer prices rose 7.1 percent in November. That is the lowest rate in almost a year. And inflation has now slowed for five months in a row.The increase was driven by food and housing costs which offset falling energy prices. The inflation reports sent U.S. financial markets higher on Tuesday with the Dow finishing about a third of a percent higher. You can see there, the Asian markets, Hang Seng up but point- 63 percent. The Nikkei in Japan up point-72 percent. And there are the future, some encouraging numbers there. Certainly, in green territory. We'll keep an eye on those.
