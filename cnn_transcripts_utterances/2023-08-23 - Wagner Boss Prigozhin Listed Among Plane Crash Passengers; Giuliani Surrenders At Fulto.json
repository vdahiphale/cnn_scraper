So, the fact that is on this passenger manifest of this rare private jet link to him, tracked around the world, is a clear indication something is afoot. The way Russian state media has leaped upon this and put the manifest out quite early would possibly suggest, there's a hand here and trying to suggest he may have passed. But until essentially, we see some clear proof that he has died, or recognition from those around him in the Wagner Group that is indeed the case, this is still a deep mystery.And I should point out too, Jim, as well, the investigating here of the gruesome remains of a plane crash, you've seen images from the wreckage sites here it's appalling as you would normally expect from the aftermath of a plane crash. If that were done by transparent Western investigators using DNA technology, that would be tough. But instead we're going to be dealing with Russian investigators, Russian state media. A clear agenda media there, as we've always heard from them. You should hear the things they've said about the Ukrainian war. They say what they're told and it's unclear quite what they'll be told at this point. Instead, there we have this remarkable mystery of exactly how Yevgeny Prigozhin survived this long, the most prominent critic of Putin frankly yet. And also quite what happened to him that led him to be listed as being on this plane -- Jim.",

And I, you know, comments that we have seen then from top Biden administration officials over the course of the last, you know, two months here, really demonstrate that they were publicly willing to say that they believe that Prigozhin still had a target on his back. That he could be killed by the Kremlin because of this coup that he failed to carry out when he, you know, staged that march on Moscow.And we should note that it came from administration officials across the board. President Biden warned that Prigozhin should be careful about the food that he was eating. CIA Director Bill Burns agreed with that assessment. Said that Prigozhin shouldn't fire his food taster and said that Putin is the, quote, apostle of paybacks. Saying that he would be surprised if Prigozhin were to escape further retaliation. And the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Russia has an open window policy. So all of them being very clear in saying that, you know, even though there was a certain period of time where perhaps things had been, you know, smoothed over or there was a perception that thing were smoothed over between Putin and Prigozhin with the two meeting and Prigozhin trying to say that what he was doing was really just to protect Wagner or not to actually go after the Kremlin. U.S. officials were still saying that Prigozhin wasn't safe. And I talked to one U.S. official today who said that he has been a dead man walking for a while now. So comments like that help to inform what we're seeing are these early comments coming out of the White House and from President Biden himself saying they aren't surprised if these reports coming out from Russian state media are indeed true.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's chaos here to be quite honest. It is a circus. A lot of media just anxiously awaiting the exit of the former mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani, the former attorney for the former president. We are looking at his, what appear to be -- appears to be his vehicle exiting the jail right now. He seems to be held up by some sheriff's deputies. But he is all but guaranteed that he wanted to make a statement to the media after being arrested, and after surrendering. So we are standing by with a host of others from networks from around the world waiting for Giuliani to comment.Ahead of his expected press conference, we have been talking to an individual who identified himself as an adviser to the mayor. He briefly talked about the bond agreement that was negotiated with the district attorney's office here in Fulton County. But the really didn't say much else. Saying that he is going to leave it to Rudy Giuliani to speak about the process. We heard Giuliani leave New York City earlier this morning where he parroted the narrative that this is politically motivated. That he would be hard-pressed to find a prosecutor like him with a record like his in the last 100 years. We've been talking about this at nauseam but it's worth underscoring. The irony of a man who literally used the RICO statute in the '80s to take down some of the most violent criminals this country has ever seen, only to be indicted himself with the same statute. It has been an incredible fall from grace for a man who was known as America's mayor. And now for him to be on the other side of the justice system. One of the outstanding questions here that we want to ask him, who exactly paid for the plane, the private plane, we understand, that he used to travel down here from the northeast to Georgia. Last we heard that Giuliani was running out of money and was having difficulty finding local representation to take him through this bond agreement process. Another question is, if he regrets attaching his name to the former president. He has been held accountable it seems by the prosecutors' office here, meeting with Georgia lawmaker at least three time after the former president lost the 2020 election. He met with Georgia lawmakers three time to spread conspiracy theories and election lies. In those conversations with Georgia lawmaker. And we caught up with him when he testified in front of the special purpose grand jury and asked him if he lied to Georgia lawmakers when he spoke. He didn't really answer the questions. He did, we should mention, testify as well in front of the special purpose grand jury. That was the body that gathered the evidence that then presented charging recommendations to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Who then took her case to the grand jury here to ultimately get indictments against 19 co-defendants. So as we stand here outside the Fulton County Jail on a very hot Wednesday in Atlanta, we're waiting for Rudy Giuliani to come to the cameras to make a statement -- Jim, Brianna.",
