What we know about a car crash that killed eight outside a migrant center near the Mexican border. Plus, deadly ethnic clashes in northeastern India. We're live in New Delhi with a look at what's fueling the riots. Thanks for joining us. And we begin in Allen, Texas where residents are mourning the eight people killed in a mass shooting on Saturday. Many have been honoring the victims by placing flowers on this makeshift memorial. It was set up at the outlet mall where the gunman fired on crowds of shoppers. The victims were also remembered at this church vigil on Sunday. Several people there delivered remarks, including the mayor-elect who called for prayers and expressed condolences for everyone affected. One of the victims in the shooting has been identified as Christian LaCour. His sister says he was a sweet, caring young man who was loved greatly by his family. Authorities are still piecing together details about the shooting and are trying to determine if the gunman had ties to right-wing extremism. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Texas with more on the investigation. ED LAVANDERA, CNN U.S. SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  The parking lot of the outlet mall here in Allen, Texas where a gunman killed eight people Saturday afternoon is still cordoned off. Hundreds of cars still in the parking lot as investigators continue to work through the scene. We have learned from various witnesses who were there at the time of the shooting that the gunman, from the moment he started firing, into the moment where he was shot and killed by an Allen police officer, that the gunman had moved Several witnesses described the gunman moving deliberately and shooting at victims as he was continuing to move through the parking lot. We have now identified, according to a senior law enforcement source, the suspect as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia. He lives in Dallas. We were in the neighborhood where his parents live and we are told that up until several months ago, he was living there. We tried to speak with Garcia's family, but they refused to answer the door when we knocked on it. But we did speak with about a half dozen neighbors who described Garcia as someone who kept to himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, for every hundred or so people, they're about 120 guns. That is by far the most in the world, right. So, not everybody should have a gun. That's where our focus is. Our focus is on the fact that most people in this country agree, gun owners and non-gun owners really do agree that before you get a gun you should pass a background check. You should have a red flag law if you're endangering yourselves or others.

So, it could be tax fraud, wire fraud, whatever it might be, you can't get a gun.But the number one way to figure out if someone is going to commit a crime with a gun is if they've already committed a violent crime. So, if you, for example, commit a violent misdemeanor, 80 percent of gun owners feel you shouldn't have a gun, right. And if you do that by itself, you would eliminate homicides with a gun by 19 percent. That's the single biggest thing that people can do, that states can do, that the government can do. They have not done it yet. That is the biggest thing that we can do. There are answers that gun owners and non-gun owners agree upon.

They know, for example, Rosemary, I know you've talked about assault weapons ban, but that's not happening. We're not going to have an assault weapon ban in Congress. And many Democrats understand that and are trying to figure out what else we could do about this issue that will make a difference. So, for example, a congresswoman from South Carolina is putting forth an amber alert when there are shootings so folks know. We get now an amber alert in the United States, meaning when a child is missing in your area, you get a notice, a beeping comes up on your phone. People are trying to do that now.

He then backtracked on that promise on Sunday. And it seems that even before that U-turn, Russian efforts in Bakhmut, according to Ukrainian accounts there, have been intensifying.A Ukrainian commander saying that they are seeing new units being moved in including from Wagner that more ammunition is being used and a variety of ammunition. We know that Ukraine has accused Russia of using incendiary ammunitions in Bakhmut. So, it seems that Russian efforts to try to take the remaining parts of that city that it doesn't yet occupy are intensifying. And of course, on the flip side, Ukraine is doing everything it can to prevent Russia from bringing home a victory ahead of May the 9th, which is of course, tomorrow, Tuesday. And I cannot overstate the importance of this day in Russia. It's a huge part of their national identity. Tens of millions of people were killed. But we know that it has in multiple regions, particularly those closer to Ukraine, been scaling back some of the celebrations. Some regions citing security concerns, others saying there's a lack of available weapons to show off. So, I think that is a notable context given that we are now almost 15 months into this war.
