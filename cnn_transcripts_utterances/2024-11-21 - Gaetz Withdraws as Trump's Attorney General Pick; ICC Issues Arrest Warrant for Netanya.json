It has been pretty much green all day apart from a momentary dip in the morning. Those are the markets and these are the main events: Donald Trump's beleaguered pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, withdraws his name from consideration. And the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And Bitcoin inches closer to $100,000.00. Coming to you live from New York. It is Thursday, November 21st. I am Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, good evening. I want to begin with breaking news on Donald Trump's Cabinet picks. Former lawmaker, Matt Gaetz says he is withdrawing his bid to become the next US Attorney General. Gaetz posting on X: \"It is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump-Vance transition.\" Gaetz was the subject of a House Ethics investigation. They were looking into allegations he had sex with an underage teen, among other misconduct. Some Republican senators expressed relief that he is not going to be seeking the top law enforcement job anymore, and sources say that Trump's advisers had serious doubts that Gaetz would be confirmed. Joining us live now is Katelyn Polantz from Washington, DC, so Katelyn, just take us through. I mean, in the end, it was clear that the math would not have worked for him because there were a number of Republicans who certainly were not going to confirm him, that they would have rejected his nomination. Take us through that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, over the last eight days since Donald Trump announced he wanted Matt Gaetz to be theattorney general, it has been hard for Washington to stomach this idea. The legal community was pushing back. I was even hearing from conservative lawyers, very high ranking former Justice Department officials, saying there is no way he gets confirmed and at the end of the day, the Senate just was not going to be on board. And in addition to that, Matt Gaetz or at least the people around Matt Gaetz, we've learned through sources, were concerned that there would be additional damaging information that wasn't previously known coming out about the congressman's behavior in the past, and that there were additional witnesses that had spoken to a House Ethics Committee that has been investigating him for some time. This is the man that was being nominated to be the head of law enforcement in the country and yet, he had been investigated himself. Criminally, he was not charged, but he was looked at by the FBI, the Justice Department for possible sex trafficking because of sexual -- a relationship he had with a girl who was underage at the time. And then the House Ethics Committee, they were coming very close in recent days to finalizing the report that they have done on Gaetz about this, and then just before this news broke, we did have reporting at CNN exclusive to CNN's reporters that there was a woman who at the time when she was 17, had told the House Ethics Committee she had two sexual encounters with Matt Gaetz, not just one that had been previously known, that we had known. She had spoken about -- that that was something that was going to be part of this report. And it was very likely, more things that the House knew that the Senate also and then very well, the public may know as well about Gaetz eventually.",

I believe the last presidential nominee who was defeated, Cabinet nominee who was defeated in a Senate vote when the president's party controlled the Senate, was 1925. But not infrequently, people have to withdraw, and I think that matters here, Zain, because there is probably a ticker in the head of Republican senators about how many times they are willing to vote publicly against Donald Trump, particularly in the immediate aftermath of his victory and the fact that they didn't have to do that on Matt Gaetz, I would think raises a lot -- the person who has to be, I think, the most concerned about this is Tulsi Gabbard, who would probably be the next on the list as potentially the least acceptable. I mean, Nikki Haley yesterday publicly described her as a Russian-Iranian- Syrian-Chinese sympathizer and said, this is not the sort of person we should have at the head of National Intelligence, it might be easier for other Republicans to vote against -- for Senate Republicans to vote against her, since they didn't actually have to cast a public ballot against Matt Gaetz.",

You know, filing multiple lawsuits on regulatory and other immigration issues. He has faced his own investigations. So, you know the question really is, does Trump want to go in the kind of Nixon mode of find me someone who is going to challenge them even more, which I think would lead him to Paxton or does he try to find someone who is a little bit more, at least has one foot in kind of the conventional conservative legal establishment in which case there are multiple choices. Matt Whitaker, one who you might have thought he might have turned to.

Israel is not a member of the ICC and is not obligated to turn in Mr. Netanyahu or Yoav Gallant, either. Many European countries are members, however. The EU foreign policy chief says the charges are not political and that they should be respected. The court issued a separate warrant for the arrest of Hamas official, Mohammed Deif. It says there is reasonable grounds to believe that Deif was responsible for crimes against humanity. Israel says that Deif was killed in an airstrike in September, although Hamas has still not confirmed his death. Nic Robertson joins us live now from Jerusalem.

The UN says that virtually no aid has reached the besieged areas of Northern Gaza in 40 days. The World Food Programme says that 90 percent of Gaza's population faces acute food insecurity. Ricardo Pires is a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's Fund. He joins us live now from New York. So obviously, the sort of breaking news that we got today is really about the ICC issuing that arrest warrant for Netanyahu, and obviously in part because the ICC is accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. I mean, obviously, you're much more focused on humanitarian aid. So I am not asking you to speak about what the Israelis have been accused of in terms of their tactics specifically. However, just talk to us about the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza, where, you know, hunger is obviously much more acute. RICARDO PIRES, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN'S FUND: Indeed, hunger continues to be an ever growing shadow for hundreds of thousands of children not only in the north of Gaza but across the strip, who have been suffering for now, nearly -- with no food, no water, not enough medicines getting through because most of the humanitarian corridors remain closed since the Rafah incursion in May. They've seen loved ones die. They've been injured. They are displaced and have been displaced multiple times since the war started. They're at rock bottom, and the UN as well, we are so constrained from being able to support these children at the level that they need and their needs are growing. They're outpacing the resources we have, and we are desperate to reach them, but yet we cannot. So they are in a catastrophic situation right now, unprecedented emergency levels and the suffering continues.",

For example, 2,500 children right now are unable to be medivac'ed because of unlogical reasons. We don't even get enough explanation from the authorities as of why they can't leave the Gaza Strip to get the proper medical care they need, and they are waiting, 2,500 children severely injured who have seen everything a child should never have to see, who have been injured, burned, survived buildings collapsing and the families they love so much dying in front of their eyes. And yet, they are strained in Gaza without a logical explanation as to why they can't leave. Four thousand newborn babies are unable to get the neonatal care they need again, because hospitals have been attacked and have been destroyed and the infrastructure is just lacking.

And so this would be really significant if it is approved by a judge especially this ask for Google to spin off, sell its Chrome business. That Chrome browser makes it really easy for Google to track users around the web and target them with ads. It is really core to its ad business. And the Justice Department says that making Google search the default on Chrome also reinforces Google's monopoly power and that is why they think the company should be forced to sell it off. They've also proposed a number of additional remedies here. They think that Google should either be forced to sell off its android operating system or no longer make Google search the default on that browser, on that operating system. They also want Google to make search data available to competitors and they want to force Google to stop performing these exclusive contracts with device makers like Apple and Samsung to become the default web browser on those devices, which has been also been really core to its business. And this would be just a huge change for Google, a huge change for the industry. And Google, of course, is pushing back really forcefully. They, as you said, have called this extreme. They also said that it would be bad for Americans' privacy because it would be forced to share data.

Before that, though, these are the headlines at this hour. Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro has reportedly been indicted in connection to an alleged plot to kill his successor. CNN Brasil says that federal police accuse Bolsonaro of having \"full knowledge of the alleged plan.\" Bolsonaro and 36 others were apparently named in the indictment. He has denied allegations of attempting a coup. Actor, Jussie Smollett's 2019 conviction for reporting a false hate crime has been overturned in the US State of Illinois. He was accused of staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself and then lying about it to police. This happened in Chicago. He appealed, saying a special prosecutor had no right to intervene after the initial charges were dropped. And a piece of conceptual art has sold at Sotheby's for $6.2 million. It consists of a banana duct taped to a wall. The artist, Maurizio Cattelan calls his work comedian. The winning bid was placed by Justin Sun, the founder of a cryptocurrency platform. Russia says it has fired a new type of weapon against Ukraine. This video appears to show the moment the strike hit the city of Dnipro on Thursday morning. Russian President Vladimir Putin says it was carried out by an experimental non-nuclear ballistic missile, which has a medium range. He says it is response to Kyiv's use of longer range weapons supplied by the West. Nick Paton Walsh is in Kyiv for us, so Nick, what do we know for sure about the classification of this missile system because there was initially some debate that it was an ICBM, an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System, and then word that it perhaps was an intermediary range missile system.

Look, we've had a long day where essentially the lack of certainty about what was fired at Dnipro has essentially played into I think what the Kremlin wanted, which is to cause anxiety and concern. What we know from Pentagon officials speaking in a variety of different ways is that they think this was called a MERV, a multi-reentry vehicle, which essentially allows multiple warheads to land from one missile on a particular target. That's what you can see in the video of the strike over Dnipro. Now, they're not quite sure what missile this is or what is based upon. It may indeed be something they haven't seen before, and so that makes classifying its range complex because if it did take off from Astrakhan like some open source media suggests, it's only 1,000 kilometers to Dnipro. Maybe it could have flown further. Maybe that's its whole distance. Vladimir Putin called it the Oreshkin, the hazelnut, and said it was a new hypersonic missile with a non-nuclear warhead, suggesting that Russia has something fresh in its toolkit that it deployed in response to recent American escalation. But here's what we know. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATON WALSH (voice-over): A familiar horror, but a quite different sight on Ukraine's skyline. Multiple projectiles at 5:00 a.m. apparently from one missile hitting an industrial site in the Dnipro City, suggesting, as Ukraine reported, Russia had launched a new type of ballistic missile, perhaps intercontinental.
