There were these Shahed drones, which are Iranian-made drones that the Russians use, flying over the Ukrainian capital, with the Ukrainians trying to shoot them down. In fact, the building that you see behind me is substantially damaged. This is the area where one woman was actually killed inside that building by debris falling from a drone that was actually shot down.And this is not the first time. In the past couple days, there have been several of these kinds of attacks, obviously terrifying the local population here. Here is what happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over):  Terrified children running for their lives as Russia unleashed another massive aerial attack on Ukrainian cities. But Ukraine says its air defense managed to shoot down all the ballistic missiles fired at the capital, Kyiv. And now, Ukraine's forces seem nearly ready for their own much-anticipated counteroffensive. This weekend, Ukraine's top general, Valery Zaluzhny, releasing this video showing troops gearing up for battle and showcasing modern western weapons with a clear message, it's time to take back what's ours. And that's what these guys are training for. This is a unit of the offensive guard of Ukraine's Interior Ministry. We have a clear motivation, the commander says. We defend our lands. This is our nation, our homeland. The offensive guard is mustering tens of thousands troops, they say, training to storm trenches and evacuate casualties, which they know they're bound to have in the tough battles ahead. What these guys are practicing here no doubt will become a reality for the Ukrainian Armed Forces very soon, as Kyiv says it will start a massive counteroffensive to take back all of their territory, including Crimea. The Ukrainians already seem to be stepping up strikes on possible Russian supply lines in occupied areas, Russian-installed officials claiming Ukrainian missile attacks against targets around Berdiansk and Mariupol in Southeastern Ukraine in the past days. It's just the beginning, a top adviser to Ukraine's presidency tells me. Everything that is happening now is a precursor for a counterattack, a necessary precursor where the intensity of fire increases. And he lays out bold aims for the counteroffensive. It will end undoubtedly on the borders of Ukraine as they were in 1991 with the de-occupation of Crimea and with the beginning of a massive process of transformation of Russia's political system. But for now, resilience remains the key for the people in Ukraine cities. These newlyweds had just tied their knot and were on the way to their celebration when the air raid sirens went off. So, they just continued to celebrate in the bomb shelter, vowing not to let Russian rockets ruin the best day of their lives. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  So, as you guys can see, a lot of resilience here on the part of the local population. Of course, nevertheless, these strikes do frighten a lot of people. I was able to speak to the mayor of Kyiv just a couple minutes ago, and he called the strikes that happened here nothing more than terrorism. Erica?",

CHIP ROY (R-TX):  I'm going to be making that loud and clear to my Republican colleagues that this is not a deal we should be taking. The whole point of the rules committee was to say we were going to have a power sharing, where we had a representation of the entire conference, and I'm not thrilled with this bill right now.

And, typically, the way it works is that conservatives are the ones who get these rules out of the committee and put them on the House floor. That's how it's been happening all year.That's the tradition of this committee that the majority party is responsible for the rule to get it to the floor. But in this case, we are watching very closely some of those key conservatives because what you're hearing from Chip Roy is that he's very upset about this legislation. You're hearing the same from Representative Ralph Norman. And we're going to be keeping a close eye on another conservative on that committee, Thomas Massie, and whether or not he becomes the critical tie breaking vote in this committee today when it comes to getting it out of the rules. So, one thing to keep in mind, earlier this year, when Thomas Massie was asked how he was going to use his position on the rules committee, this was back in January, he told my colleague, Melanie Zanona, quote, I would be reluctant to try to use the Rules Committee to achieve a legislative outcome, particularly if it doesn't represent a large majority of our caucus. I don't ever intend to use my position on there to hold somebody hostage, to hold legislation hostage. Now, his office is not saying how he is going to vote today in this committee, but, obviously, that comment back in January, giving some insight into how at least Thomas Massie is viewing his role on this Rules Committee today. If it makes it out of the Rules Committee, we expect it will have the votes it needs to pass on the House floor with multiple sources telling me that Republicans are confident they could get or are at least locking down about 150 or more Republicans.
