Tonight, residents in Kyiv once again forced totake refuge in subways as Russia launches one of the biggest attacks on the country since the war began. I will be speaking to one of President Zelenskyy's advisers for the latest. Then more than a dozen people dead and hundreds injured in Peru as protests sweep the country following the arrest of the former president. We'll have the very latest for you. Plus more backlash for Twitter boss Elon Musk as he suspends the accounts of several high-profile journalists. But first this hour. Ukraine is much colder and darker tonight after Russia launched a barrage of missiles across the country. Seventy six of them by Ukraine's account, 40 aimed at the capital alone. Residents of Kyiv scrambled, as you can see there, into underground shelters as air raid sirens blared. But Ukraine's prime minister says its air defense also shot down the vast majority of the missiles, the ones that struck, well, struck hard. In Kryvyi Rih, at least, two people have died, officials are reporting colossal infrastructural damage in Kharkiv. And attacks on energy targets have left a serious shortage in the country's power supply. At the moment, 50 percent of customers don't have access to electricity and that includes light, water, and of course, heat. Will Ripley brings us this report now from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Kyiv city military administration says the Ukrainian capital has survived one of the most massive missile attacks since the beginning of the full scale invasion. I'm standing in a square where you can see these destroyed vehicles from the beginning of the war. We actually can't take you to the scene of these attacks because the targets were critical infrastructure. And Ukraine has very strict rules about filming and showing these locations. They don't want to tip off the Russians to what areas they might have hit, and what areas they might have missed. But in this case, Kyiv says that most of the missiles never reached their targets because they say at around 40 missiles that Russia fired directly at Kyiv, which is a huge number even for locals who have been living here throughout this full scale war for nearly 10 months now, they say they shot down 37 of them. There were however, three explosions reported here in Kyiv both on the east and west banks of the river. Two of them in the east, one in the west. There are reports across Ukraine of entire cities plunged into darkness as a result of these attacks, which didn't just hit here in Kyiv, they also hit to the south in Odessa and to the north in Sumy and Kharkiv. But here in the capital, there were tens of thousands of people sheltering in place, hiding in underground subway stations, waiting for an all-clear. And there were sounds of explosions. We actually heard them this morning as we were getting ready to pack up on go on a road trip. The air raid sirens went off, and there were some loud explosions that could be heard in our vicinity. CNN staff who lived even closer to the scenes of the explosion said they also heard the sound of the air defense systems being activated, shooting down, presumably those dozens of missiles that were headed towards the Ukrainian capital. A number of dead and injured, of course, those reports are always fluid, but as of now, we know at least two people killed, at least five people injured, including children. And UNICEF just days ago warned that these ongoing Russian attacks, this constant bombardment of the civilian power infrastructure is putting the physical and mental health of nearly every single child here in Ukraine in a desperate risk.

But the policy is set to expire on December 21st. With that, the U.S. is bracing for a surge of migrants who are currently housed in encampments. CNN's Rosa Flores joins me now from Houston in Texas.

We're seeing these dramatic picturesout of El Paso, for example, of thousands of migrants who are either waiting in what is Mexico or are already in line to cross into the United States. Isa, that is just a portion of this issue that the Biden administration is about to see. And I say that because there are thousands of migrants who are waiting for the lifting of Title 42 that are on the northern side of Mexico, all along the southern border. And what they're waiting for is for Title 42 to lift. I mean, just think about it. Title 42 has been in place since March of 2020. And what it does, it simply allows federal agents in the United States to swiftly return migrants to Mexico. Now, that has happened since March 2020 where migrants are returned without any legal consequences. And so, many of them have tried three, four times. I've interviewed them in the past, and then they give up and they wait in Mexico. SO just imagine. So for years now, migrants have been arriving and waiting in Mexico for Title 42 to lift. So what is DHS doing, the Department of Homeland Security here in the United States? Well, they issued a plan today -- I mean this week, excuse me, that explained some of the things that they're doing. For example, they're shoring up resources along the border. They hired more than a 1,000 border patrol processing coordinators and 2,500 contractors. And the reason why that is important is because those are civilian positions. These are civilians that are being sent to the border to process migrants, which is the gripe that a lot of law enforcement agencies and politicians have talked about over the years because, when there is a big surge of migrants, they have to take border patrol agents, which are the law enforcement agents of the southern border. The law enforcement agency of the southern border, to then process migrants rather than to focus on national security. So with these extra resources where border patrol is able to do is they're actually able to do their jobs, which is to keep the southern border safe. According to this DHS plan that was released this week, they also say that DHS has increased the number of soft-sighted facilities by more than ten since last year to increase the holding capacity by a third. And that they also have doubled the transportation resources on the border, with hundreds of flights and also buses. Why is that important? It's -- the key word here is decompression. Now, that's a really fancy word for saying that border patrol, what they do is they take the areas, Isa, where there is a huge surge of migrants, and they move them to other areas along the border where those migrants can be processed. And so, that's how they're prepared. That's how DHS is prepared to deal with the surge of migrants that they're expecting once Title 42 lifts is they have planes, they have buses, they will be moving migrants around to make sure that those migrants are processed.

In the People's Daily, the headline reads \"Start by wearing a mask and be the first person responsible for your own health.\" In Xinhua, the headline reads \"In the fight against the epidemic, everyone is the first person responsible for their own health.\" Other articles are praising the last three years of zero-COVID and hailing this pivot as an achievement, including this commentary from the People's Daily that has gone viral. The key lines are \"The virus has weakened, but we have become stronger. Chairman Xi's insightful judgment, scientific and firm decisions shows his reliability as the people's leader. It pointed out and provided crucial guidance for us to win this people's battle, total battle and precise battle against COVID.\" A lot of people online, they're furious over that article. Some are calling it a lie that completely ignores the devastating impact of zero COVID over the last three years, the trauma and pain that people faced during lockdowns, no apology or no admitting that the government has ever made a mistake. State media has instead focused on how the government is responding. The government said it will train volunteers and retired health workers to boost manpower. The government is increasing the number of fever clinics. This social media video shows people waiting inside a Beijing stadium that's been converted into a makeshift fever clinic. You can see some lines forming and people waiting on the benches. We're already seeing hospitals under strain here in the capital. But the really big concern is what happens when people go back home for the upcoming Chinese New Year and COVID starts to spread more rapidly in the rural parts of China with weaker health infrastructure?

A source close to Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he asked to appear via video link prior to Sunday's kickoff, but talks between Ukraine and FIFA are continuing. It comes as FIFA's president touted the success of the tournament in a press conference earlier today. Gianni Infantino says it's been \"The best World Cup ever.\" But he also faced questions over the death of migrant workers, Infantino calling it a tragedy. Let's get more on all of this. CNN's World Sports Patrick Snell joins us now to discuss. Patrick, great to see you. Look, it shouldn't perhaps come as a surprise to any of our viewers, Infantino's comments, and not wanting to have politics involved. He's very much gone to extreme lengths to keep political messaging out of this World Cup.",

We've seen them on a regular basis at this World Cup as we get ever closer now to Sunday's big final between defending champions France and Argentina. But from the very beginning, you're quite right. Football's governing body has gone to really extreme lengths to keep political messaging out of a showpiece tournament in Qatar, which is, as a reminder to our viewers worldwide, it is the first Middle Eastern nation ever to stage the sport's biggest and most prestigious events. And look, in recent months, we have seen Kyiv repeatedly trying to use major world events to keep the global spotlight on the war in Ukraine, President Zelenskyy appearing via video at the group of 20 nations summit, the G20 summit, for example, as well as the Grammys, as well as the Cannes Film Festival in France. But I think worth-looking a little closer at Infantino's words at that news conference on Friday, the FIFA President saying \"Some political statements had been stopped in Qatar because the association has to take care of everyone,\" as he put it. He added \"We are a global organization and we don't discriminate against anyone. Those fans and the billions watching on TV, they have their own problems. They just want to watch 90-or 120 minutes without having to think about anything, but just enjoying a little moment of pleasure and joy. We have to give them a moment when they can forget about their problems and enjoy football.\" And Isa, I think fair to say in a nutshell, Infantino has been, you said at the top, absolutely steadfast in his unwillingness to allow anything he perceives, he perceives to be political, making its way into this World Cup.",

In fact, last week it was, Isa, Qatar Supreme Committee For Delivery and Legacy confirming to CNN that there have been three work related deaths during the construction of World Cup stage and 37 non-work related deaths. Those are the numbers. But in an interview with UK TV presenter Piers Morgan, which aired on Talk TV in November, the Supreme Committees Hassan Al Thawadi saying that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament. So on Friday, Infantino asked to actually clarify all that. He was actually asked how many workers had lost their lives in making this World Cup happen in Qatar, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think it's really awesome, revealing that he has incredibly thin skin and is not really someone who can handle aggressive reporting on either him or his companies. I do want to read you a statement that CNN put out yesterday after Donie O'Sullivan, our colleague, was banned. And it says in part, \"The impulsive and unjustified suspension of a number of reporters, including CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, is concerning, but not surprising. Twitter's increasing instability should be of incredible concern for any -- everyone who uses Twitter.\" And it goes on to say \"We have asked Twitter for the -- an explanation, and we will reevaluate our relationship based on that response.\" I think that last line is really key. CNN has asked Twitter for response, and it will reevaluate its relationship with Twitter, dependent on whatever they say. And I'm curious, and I think this raises the bigger question is, what are newsrooms going to do broadly speaking? It's not just CNN's Donie O'Sullivan who was banned, you know, he banned reporters at the New York Times, The Washington Post, and other independent journalists. And so are newsrooms going to stand for this? Or are they going to say, hey, enough is enough, we're going to pull our reporters, pull our content, pull our brands from this platform. And finally, I think the other point is, our advertisers are going to be OK with this, you know. Advertisers make up the bulk of revenue for Twitter.
