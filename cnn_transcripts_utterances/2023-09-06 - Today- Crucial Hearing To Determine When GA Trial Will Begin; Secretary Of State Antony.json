And that means voters can see. This will be in Georgia where a judge will hear arguments about whether a trial should start as soon as next month, October 23rd, and whether Trump's case should be severed from some or all of his 18 co- defendants. That's what Trump wants, along with a much later trial, as speculation swirls over whether any of his co-defendants might turn on him.With us now CNN's Paula Reid, who has been following all this. Paula, what are we going to see in just a few hours?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's significant. We're going to be able to see this entire hearing. And while it's about scheduling and logistics, not necessarily the most exciting topics, here in this case, they take on a true significance because we know that the central tension in all of the Trump related criminal cases is timing. He wants to try to push all these cases back until after the 2024 election. But prosecutors are keen to move these things along as quickly as possible.Now, today, they're focused not only on scheduling, but also the possibility of breaking this case up into smaller cases. They've asked the district attorney to come with a good faith estimate of just how long it's going to take for her to put on a trial with 19 defendants. Already several people charged in this case have asked to separate or sever their case, from the rest of the group in the hopes of getting a faster trial. The district attorney insists she wants to try everyone at once. So the judge is going to have some questions about exactly how that's going to work, how long it's going to take. And he's also said that he wants to hear what she thinks would be the consequence if they did maybe break this up into some smaller groups. So shout out to the state of Georgia for the fact that there will be cameras in the court, which will allow anyone who is curious about what's going on here, the process, to tune in and see how this is working. This is not an opportunity that taxpayers are afforded, of course, at the federal level, where the former president faces to criminal cases.",

And his lawyers argue that because of that that should be moved to federal court where there are laws that actually protect federal, certain federal workers from state level prosecutions.They're also confident that if they can get it moved to federal court that they will be able to get the case against Meadows dismissed. Now, it's not clear he's going to be successful. But whatever happens here will have ripple effects. Because I know in speaking with my sources, other defendants and their attorneys in this case, they're watching to see what happens with Meadows because they believe Meadows has the strongest shot of anyone besides maybe the former president successfully removing his case to federal court. They're like, look, if it doesn't work for him, we're not even going to try for our client.",

I cannot imagine a world I should say it's highly unlikely it's hard to conceive of this judge ordering the other defendants who would like to push this off. It's hard to see him forcing them to go to trial next month.So she may have to do this trial, very complicated trial in stages. And of course, that will be very taxing on her office's limited resources. And it's hard to see that happening even though certain of defendants, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, are asking for this early trial date. They could also change their mind, once they have the full breadth of discovery, which is said to be somewhere in the order of magnitude of two terabytes of information or some 150 million pages.

Although, as you said in the introduction, he has a better argument than some of his co-defendants, because in some ways, of course, everything that away, he's chief of staff does could be said to be under color of his office or federal law. But I think here when you're talking about intruding into the counseling and tabulation of ballots, that is not something that is typically within the executive branch. So I think that's a long chain of argument. But if he does win, it could upend very much of what's happening in state court, it could well be that some or all the defendants are then removed as well to federal court.

Overnight, Russia launched a barrage of missiles at the capitol city, a reminder that Blinkin is in the middle of a war zone.

It came overnight, as you mentioned a moment ago here in Kyiv fresh ballistic and cruise missile strikes on the Ukrainian Capitol that were intercepted by Ukrainian anti -- air defense systems, even though some of the debris caused some damage here in the Capitol.But what we've been hearing just in the last few moments is of a deadly attack on civilians. Once again, it's just a village that is not very far from the front line from Bakhmut within striking distance certainly. Sixteen civilians, including one child have just died, John, in an attack on a market in a town that is not very far from there in Russia and shelling. An important reminder, I think, even as Secretary of State is here of exactly what is happening to civilians all along the front line, that line -- that is remember more than 1,000 kilometers long. So a lot of civilians on that front line, many more have just today paid the price. And I think that is the important context in which Secretary Blinken is coming he's going to be meeting with President Zelenskyy. And it is of course, all about selling this again to the American people when he gets back. But it is going to be also about seeking some of the reassurances that his administration is looking for about the fight against corruption, the ability of this country to meet its the obligations as it seeks to join NATO, the European Union and to move on from the past. So an important visit that comes at a critical time, of course as ever, amid more destruction at the hands of the Russians, John.",

And we've seen, you know, since those -- that first series of late night votes that eventually delivered him the speakership. He has been engaged in in a real high wire act, and he's managed to do it successfully.But for his detractors on the right, they have to know that if you come at the king, you best not miss as a wise man once said, right? If they trigger this option and it doesn't work out, it looks like a paper tiger going forward. And so it works better as a threat than an actual practice. And if it were to succeed, obviously, it would throw the entire House into chaos with really unpredictable consequences.
