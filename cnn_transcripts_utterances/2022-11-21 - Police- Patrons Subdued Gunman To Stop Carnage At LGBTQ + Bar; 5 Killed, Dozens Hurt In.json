The numbers mean the man who wants to be speaker may end up a hostage within his own party. And will Republicans finally say never again to Donald Trump, a roster of would be presidential challengers turns up at a big meeting in Vegas, their message to former president should not get a third chance.Up first for us though sadly, six minutes of terror. New details this morning out of Colorado Springs and the scene of the latest American massacre. This is Club Q, an LGBTQ nightclub where a gunman wearing body armor burst inside at 11:56pm Saturday evening and open fire. Witness accounts from inside the club describe a frenzy. A hailstorm of broken glass, muzzle flashes, blending with strobe lights, people diving behind tables, tout race bullets. The club's owners tell the New York Times that surveillance tape shows the gunman had a rifle and what appeared to be six magazines of ammunition. The chaos interrupted only when two people threw themselves into the line of fire and pin the gunman. Police arrested the shooter just minutes later 12:02am Sunday. Inside those six minutes, at least five were murdered, 25 more injured. The why is still a big unknown at this hour. Another big and painful question. Why was the suspected gunman 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich able to get a weapon after an incident just last year in which he made a bomb threat against his own mother. Let's get straight to Colorado Springs, CNN's Rosa Flores is there. Rosa, what's the latest?",

Let's get some important insights and perspective now from the former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, and the former federal prosecutor Elie Honig.Andy McCabe, let me start with you first. The police chief says, the suspect has not yet been interviewed because he is hospitalized, also said his mother is not cooperating, at least at this point with investigators. Obviously, you have the surveillance video. You have the witnesses inside. From an investigative standpoint, what are the next critical steps? ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR, FBI: Well, John, the evidence from the scene will build a strong case against this defendant in any respect. And there's a question as to whether or not he'll be charged with a hate crime. But certainly, he'll be charged with very significant felony crimes of violence. What investigators are doing today is coursing through whatever background and information they can find about this guy, whether that's from social media, or from computing devices, telephones, iPads that he may have had in his residence, to try to understand why he did this. Also, to understand if there are other people that he's in contact with who may be similarly motivated, we want to identify that network as soon as possible. Once you've ruled that out, you're really looking for evidence of motivation, particularly if they're considering charging them with a hate crime. They really need comments, statements, writings, things that indicate these defendants mental state and whether or not he targeted any of these people specifically, because of their gender or sexual orientation, or any of those other factors that are in the statute.",

When you're trying to get to the motive question though, la gets a loud nightclub. Unclear as to whether anybody inside heard, whether the shooter said anything as he went through how do you build the rest of the case?ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASST. U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Yes, John. So, this shooter almost certainly will be charged with first degree murder under Colorado law, which means the intentional killing of another human being. The question is, will the authorities, will prosecutors be able to bring a hate-crimes charge either under state law or it could be federal as well, if they can show that the motive here was an illicit bias and bias based on, as Andy said, on gender or on sexual orientation, certainly counselors. So, what you need to do, you start with, of course, interviewing the people inside the club. The bartender, who just showed actually pointed out that this was one of only two LGBTQ clubs in this entire city. So, you would take that into consideration the nature of the location, you try to ask questions of the suspect of the shooter himself. Sometimes people actually do just come out and confess I did it because I hate this type of person. You of course, want to speak to any patrons in the club to the extent they were able to hear or see anything. And then you comb through the social media posts, you talk to every family member, every friend who knows this person, and you look to see if you can get some the motive. If you can, and we could see additional charges for hate crimes as well here.",

Or do these laws need to be scrubbed again, and if a family member will not, pick up or phone or file the necessary paperwork to say make sure this person never gets a weapon. The police have to be required to do so what can be done?ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASST. U.S. ATTORNEY SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: John, it's about education. And it's about police officers taking action. Red flag laws do not operate on their own. You have to have either a police officer or in some instances, a family member who goes to court, who goes to a judge and says we need to take away this person's firearms, at least temporarily. And the truth of the matter is, even in states like Colorado that have red flag laws on the book, they're one of 19 states plus D.C., it doesn't happen automatically. And those laws are very rarely used. The public data shows that in the entire state of Colorado, the red flag laws were used to seize firearms about 50 times per year in the entire state. So that gives you a sense of scale. Now that's a low among other states, but people need to not just know about these laws, but someone actually has to take action to enforce them.",

That would get you a House of 222 Republicans, 213 Democrats, essentially a flip of what we have now. There are 222 Democrats at the moment. Kevin McCarthy hopes to be the speaker of this new House, hopes to be the leader of Republicans. But there are still several members who say they will not vote for him under any circumstances. One, Andy Biggs of Arizona challenged him for Speaker. Kevin McCarthy has 43 days to convince them think otherwise. And he says, they need to think twice so they can get things done.
