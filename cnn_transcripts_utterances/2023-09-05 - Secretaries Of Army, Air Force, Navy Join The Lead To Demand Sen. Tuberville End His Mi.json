But should Musk turn the mirror toward himself? But leading this hour, secretaries from three branches of the U.S. military are all here on The Lead for an exclusive in studio interview. For the first time in history, three branches of the U.S. military are operating without Senate confirmed leaders or Chiefs of Staff. Three hundred more top nominees are also on hold all because of this one lawmaker, Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville, and his objection to the Pentagon's new policy which reimburses service members or their families for travel if they have to go to another state to get an abortion. After six months of frustrating paralysis, the secretaries of the Army and the Navy and the Air Force wrote this opinion piece in \"The Washington Post,\" quote, \"Officers and the millions of service members they lead are the foundation of America's enduring military advantage. Yet, this foundation is being actively eroded by the actions of the single U.S. senator, Tommy Tuberville. And it is putting our national security at risk.\" So joining us now, the secretaries of the Air Force, Frank Kendall, of the Army, Christine Wormuth, and the Navy Carlos Del Toro for this exclusive joint interview. Let me start with you Secretary Kendall. How is America less safe and less prepared than it was six months ago?",

Independents, half of them believe it's because of his own actions and Democrats, almost 83 percent.

Independents believe that 25 percent of them believe this is weaponization of the DOJ, so even independents are buying the malarkey that this is not valid actions on the part of Trump. So those are important things to keep track of. But look, we're seeing in these reports and many others, his numbers are getting just stronger.

It's the very same argument that he made with respect to executive privilege, essentially saying since the subject matter, as part of my advice and counsel to the president, it's beyond the reach of the legal process. The judge in D.C. rejected that as the judges rejected many similar claims of privilege.He has a very expansive view of what is -- what he was doing in his official capacity. The Georgia prosecutors response was, this is well beyond official business. This is political. And this is dealing with elections, which is a classic state function. Therefore, the judge, I think, is likely to reject Meadows claims, and this case stays in state court. TAPPER: All right, timothy Heaphy, thank you so much. Appreciate your time today.",

He was in tears, sobbing when his mom was essentially begging the judge to have mercy on her son. But I will say, Jake, some of those people who expressed remorse who tearfully spoke to the judge, in one case, Dominic Pezzola, after the judge exited, he raised his fist and said, Trump won. This is something that Tarrio made a reference to today.He said that he believes, you know, after this is all over, he's going to be away from politics. He's going to leave politics behind. And then he made a reference to that Pezzola moment. He said after you leave judge, you're not going to hear anything but that from me, clearly, the judge did not buy his plea for mercy and his plea that he has remorse for everything that happened on January 6th. Tarrio was essentially trying to get the judge to believe that he wasn't really, you know, the leader of the conspiracy simply because he wasn't here. He had been arrested a couple of days before and he'd been banned from being inside Washington that day. So how could he be in charge of the riot when he wasn't here? The judge clearly said, Jake, that the jury did not buy that when your lawyers made that excuse. Jake?",

      "sentences": "Yes, two things Jake, one not surprised at all that Tarrio has gotten the most significant sentence because the Proud Boys really were the tip of the spear for the riot. As we showed in our first summer hearing last summer, the Proud Boys picked a very vulnerable point in the perimeter of the Capitol security at the Peace Circle, pushed through barricades there, concussing Caroline Edwards, who was a very compelling witness for us.And then very specifically, intended to use violence to breach the windows and doors of the Capitol. So they were the instigators and the first to push through a barrier and the first, I mean Pezzola himself is the first to go inside. Interesting to hear Evan's reporting about what Tarrio is now saying about remorse because it's very different than what he said right on and resticks. He actually texted other members of the Proud Boys, we did this, referencing the riot. And he posted this chilling video of himself in a cape with this ominous music, saying, you know justice is coming. So he certainly wasn't remorseful on January 6th. He was gloating about the success. Judge Kelly understandably saw that difference and punish them severely and appropriately.",
