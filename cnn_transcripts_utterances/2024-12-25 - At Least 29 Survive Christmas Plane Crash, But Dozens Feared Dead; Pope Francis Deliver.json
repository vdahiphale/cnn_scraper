At least 29 people survived a Christmas day plane crash near Aktau, Kazakhstan, but dozens more are feared dead. We want to warn you, some of this video may be disturbing. Now, this was taken moments after the plane crash as rescuers scrambled to pull people out of the burned wreckage. Drone footage shows the scope of the devastation on the ground. Now, it's not known for sure yet what caused the crash, but there are preliminary reports. The plane tried to make an emergency landing after a bird strike. And this Christmas morning, Pope Francis is urgently calling for peace and the end of the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. The pope delivered his 12th annual Christmas blessing from the balcony of Saint Peters Basilica. Thousands were in the crowd. You can see right there, as the pope prayed that leaders would negotiate peace in war-torn Ukraine and the Middle East. Now, this Christmas is a special one for the Catholic Church because it marks the start of its jubilee, which happens every 25 years. Meanwhile, the British royal family is also getting in the Christmas spirit today after a year of health challenges for King Charles and Princess Catherine. They, along with Queen Camilla, Prince William and other royal relatives, attended their traditional Christmas service in Sandringham. Charles and Catherine both underwent cancer treatments this year. The king will break tradition later today when he delivers his annual Christmas message from a chapel at a former hospital, instead of from the traditional setting of Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. And this now, happy holidays and merry Christmas from space. Four NASA astronauts on board the international space station recorded a video message to send back to earth. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUNI WILLIAMS, NASA ASTRONAUT:  It's a great time of year up here. We get to spend it with all of our family up on the International Space Station. There are seven of us up here, and so we're going to get to enjoy company together from all of us to all of you, merry Christmas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they've almost always been hopeful, even in the hardest of times.So maybe looking back at the fact that that did not get a good reception, he's got a chance because he's one of those two presidents, Cleveland and he, who are the only ones who came back after a loss to reflect on that and give a different kind of address that that will reach out to the country as a whole.

If it fails, you'll be one of the worst. He said, no, I will be the last American president. That's how perilous democracy was.And he comes in and he starts off saying, only a foolish optimist would deny the brutal realities of the moment. The country was in the worst stage of the Depression, one out of four, out of work, starving people wandering the streets, the political system, the financial system had collapsed. And he comes in and he says, not only the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. But he said, I'm going to put you to action. This is not your fault, people. It was the fault of leadership. And I'm here to provide that leadership. I have a program I'm going to send to Congress. If they don't act on it, I will act as if we were at war. I will get you to work. Incredibly, Kasie, by the end of that speech, the mood of the country had changed. Headlines read, we have a leader. We have a government. The government still lives, and hundreds of thousands of telegrams and letters came into the White House. My favorite one said, a man said, my roof fell off. I've lost my job.

You know, when Jefferson won after a hugely vitriolic campaign against Adams, and he came into the office and he said, we are all federalists, we are all Republicans. We have to find the common good. I'm hoping that this 1940, 1945, now, this 2024 can be turned into a different year in 2025, and that the vitriol and the anger and the grievances and the fact that the country feels so divided and so polarized can begin slowly, slowly, slowly to come back to some common ground. That's what inaugurations are. There are moments of hope. And then they're followed, of course, by the 100 days. And it depends on what happens.
