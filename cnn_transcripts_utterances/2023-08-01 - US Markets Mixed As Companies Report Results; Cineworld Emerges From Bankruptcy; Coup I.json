Profits are actually down year-over-year, sales are barely budging and profit margins, they are under pressure. But Richard, you know, as well as I do that everything is relative, especially in the stock market and investors had been bracing for the worst, right, they were fearing a recession and obviously, that is not what we have gotten. So when you look at how things are stacking up against expectations, you can see that S&amp;P 500 companies so far, 80 percent of them have beaten on earnings. That is ahead of the 10-year average of 73 percent. So this is better than expected. It is exactly what investors want to see. We`ve seen big earnings beat this earning season from the likes of Netflix and General Electric, Intel. And just today, we heard from Caterpillar, which is benefiting from the boom in construction. Their profits nearly doubled, blew away expectations. Sales also beat, so a lot of positives. You see Caterpillar up almost nine percent on this earnings. This is an economic bellwether. So that is the good news, Richard. I think the bad news, though, is the fact that these companies are reporting drops in profits. In fact, if this plays out, as expected, this would actually be the worst earnings season since the middle of 2020, when the economy was dealing with COVID.",

The bank more than doubling its profits in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2022. Pre-tax earnings hitting $21.7 billion in the six months to June. Well, higher interest rates, of course, mean banks can charge more for loans and mortgages than they pay out on deposit and HSBC has been aggressively cutting jobs and assets for the past few years. It also notched up this time an extra one-and-a-half billion dollars in provisional earnings from the acquisition of the UK arm of Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed in March. All of this was good news for shareholders who will be rewarded with a share buyback of up to $2 billion, HSBC`s chief executive announced on Tuesday, and yet, there are questions around whether savers should also be getting more. HSBC and other lenders are under scrutiny from a UK regulator for failing to raise rates on customers savings accounts at a similar pace to interest rates. The Financial Conduct Authority said UK`s top nine financial service providers including HSBC, Barclays, and NatWest had on average pass through of only 28 percent of the base rate rise compared to an average of 80 percent between 2004 and 2009 for the majority of cash savings accounts. A spokesperson for HSBC told CNN that the lender had raised its savings rates more than a dozen times since the beginning of last year.

So I think, important for us as New Zealand, given where we are, given we`re quite niche, is the easier we can make it for people to choose investing in tourism promotion, making it easier for people to choose our destination. It is a very competitive landscape. So how -- you know, anything we can do to make it easier for people to choose, make that booking and make their way here, I think will make a significant impact in what was the number one export earner.
