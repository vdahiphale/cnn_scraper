Remember, he was one of four people killed at a mass shooting at a Sweet 16 party in Alabama two weeks ago.Also today, we're learning that at least nine teenagers are recovering after being shot in an after-prom party Sunday in Texas. Thankfully, their injuries are not life threating. But this is the sad reality that scenes like this are no longer out of the ordinary. We're joined now by gun violence prevention activist, Shannon Watts. She's the founder of Moms Demand Action. Shannon, obviously, after all of the attention that mass shootings have gotten in the last few years, public polling shows that Americans overwhelmingly support certain gun reforms, things like universal background checks, but yet there's no momentum on Capitol Hill for reform. From your perspective, I am wondering if there is any one piece of legislation that you have hope that may pass.",

It is not just mass shootings, although we have had more mass shootings this year than we have had days in the year, which is incredibly tragic.But we are seeing the shootings at pool parties and at prom after- parties. And even last week, we saw many examples where children or teens made simple mistakes and, as a result, armed and paranoid and racist men opened fire, shooting and wounding or even killing them. So this is the reality that the gun lobby has created in this country, a populous that is armed to the teeth with very little regulation. My question is, when will the guns make us safer? There are 400 million guns in this country and very few gun laws. It has not made us safer yet. In fact, we have a 2,500 higher homicide rate than any peer nation. So you ask about the momentum, and I have been doing this as a volunteer for a decade and we've passed over 500 gun safety laws in the states. And last summer, we passed the first federal gun laws in a generation. There is momentum in this country for stronger gun laws. There are some gun extremists who have been elected to office who are standing in the way. But I am confident, especially as I get ready to go into another election cycle, that this issue is top of mind for every parent in this country regardless of the political party. And we have to vote out those lawmakers who are refusing to stand up to the gun lobbyists and making the children stand up to gunmen.",

It does not appear that the guns are making us safer at the clip that the shootings are happening.And I want to point out this graphic on gun violence from 2023, 162 children killed. It's the graphic that was just on the board. This one shows that parents are overwhelmingly concerned about gun violence at school. And 77 percent say they are concerned. But it is not like that when I was in school. Something like Columbine that happened when I was in middle school was an anomaly. Why has the situation deteriorated so much?",

And that is the gun lobby.We have a wealthy and powerful special interest who has allowed a seat at the table to write our gun laws. And then also marketing the guns to particularly white young men based on fear, and considering your man card that we issued and the picture of the assault rifle. This has led to the proliferation of guns in the country. And we will see the gun sales spike, because the gun lobby preys on fear and chaos. It's why tens of millions of guns were sold in the pandemic in this country. Look, there are countries that have high rates of gun ownership and low rates of gun violence. This is not hopeless. We should not be cynical. We have made huge strides in the last decade toward gun safety, legislatively, electorally and culturally, but we have more work to do.

So let's back up and talk about the sort of the timeline. This is a building that was built in 1960, and so they were coming up on the 60- year-old building recertification. That requires an inspection and, quite frankly, it didn't go well for them. That's why engineers say they found the sagging floors and termite damage and even had partial collapse of the ceiling, given all of the water seen come down in south Florida. Then Thursday, the residents learned that they have to evacuate, that it is deemed unsafe. They have to get out. And now we are in the 24- hour window, less than 24 hours where they have to get out. Again, the residents that I spoke to acknowledge what happened in Surfside and they have not forgotten that. But quite a bit of frustration. Listen to a little bit of the conversation that I had.

And what we are starting to see is, you know, the threat is coming from outside the perimeter. For someone who worked with critical infrastructure a lot of my career, your biggest threat is internal and safety features, right?
