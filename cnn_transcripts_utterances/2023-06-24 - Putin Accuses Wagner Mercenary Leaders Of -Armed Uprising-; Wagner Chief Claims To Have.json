I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta for our special \"BREAKING NEWS\" coverage of the crisis in Russia.Also joining us is CNN Christiane Amanpour in London. Christiane, I'll join you in a moment. We begin today with a stunning development in the Russian war on Ukraine. And perhaps, the biggest threat to President Vladimir Putin's iron fisted control over Russia in decades. Putin is accusing the head of the mercenary Wagner Group of an armed rebellion. The group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin has been a longtime ally of the Kremlin, which relied on his soldiers for its war on Ukraine. But yesterday, he accused Russia of attacking his mercenaries and Prigozhin, now says his private army has seized control of Russian military facilities in two critical cities. The first is in the city of Rostov-on-Don. That's about 700 miles south of Moscow. And the second city is Voronezh, at about the halfway point on the road to Moscow. And he is threatening to push on to the Capitol if Russia's top general and defense minister don't meet with him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, CHIEF, WAGNER GROUP (through translator): Again, we came here. We want to receive the Chief of General Staff and Shoigu. And so, they aren't here. And so, they aren't here, we will be located here, blockading the city of Rostov, and we'll go to Moscow. (END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: President Putin calls the actions by Prigozhin, a betrayal and a stab in the back to the Russian people. In an ominous sign, a Russian armored vehicles began appearing on Moscow streets last night. Putin is warning those who follow Prigozhin, that they will pay the price. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): All those who deliberately chose the path of treachery, who prepared an armed mutiny, who chose the path of blackmail and terrorist methods will face inevitable punishment, and will answer both to the law and to our people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have CNN's chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh, national security reporter Natasha Bertrand, chief national security correspondent and anchor Jim Sciutto, and CNN military analyst and former NATO supreme allied commander, General Wesley Clark.So, Nick, let me -- let me begin with you because you've done a lot of reporting on Wagner, and you've been in that sort of area. We know about, you know, Wagner, we know that it's managed to be pretty much the only sort of results-based group in this misconceived invasion against Ukraine. What do you think is at the heart of this current challenge by Prigozhin to Putin, even though he's not actually calling on Putin's ouster?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think this kind of power struggle between Wagner and the Russian military is something that they have been watching very closely over the last several months, including as recently as this year, when they saw that Prigozhin was obviously very directly challenging the Russian defense minister and calling him out and saying that not only is the Russian Ministry of Defense, essentially leaving Russian troops and Wagner troops to die in Ukraine without sufficient ammunition, without sufficient equipment, but also that they are not functioning as a proper kind of military inside Ukraine, doing this military operation in a way that Prigozhin anyway, thought it should be carried out.He thought that they were so inept and incompetent that Wagner really had to fill that void. And as we saw, that is exactly what they were doing inside Ukraine. So, Western officials now are very closely monitoring how this impacts Ukraine, of course, because as Wagner troops have moved into Russia, they are distracted in Russia, how will that impact? Of course, Ukraine -- the resistance that the Ukrainians are facing inside Ukraine, and will they be able to make some kind of breakthrough there? But look, we are hearing that officials across the administration were fairly caught off guard by this development, because while, of course, Prigozhin and the Russian ministry of defense were feuding for months, and very much in the open as well. It was unclear to U.S. officials, when this would actually -- this tipping point would actually happen, and how far Prigozhin would actually be willing to go in terms of challenging the Russian military. Obviously, yesterday, we saw that he said that the Russian military ordered an airstrike on his troops inside Ukraine. And that appeared to be, in his mind, anyway, the final straw here. And that is when he decided to send his troops into Rostov and challenge the Russian military and Russian ministry of defense there directly. So, now officials are waiting to see how far Wagner can actually get because they are watching within the next 24 to 48 hours if they are going to face supply shortages, and how that's going to impact -- how this all unfold. But ultimately, they are concerned about the potential impact of this on Russia's stability. Because, of course, Russia is a nuclear state. So, that is something that they're very concerned about right now. They don't want to see this deteriorate to the point where those assets and that those weapons could actually be put in danger and risk of destabilizing, not just Russia but the entire region.

But first, I want to ask General Clark, because of course, this happens, right as this counter offensive, is making fits and starts. It's not as fabulous as everybody thought it would be. And I want to know what you think the Ukrainians should do, or could do now, to take advantage of what may be, you know, a very serious challenge to the Russian military and to the Russian president. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, the Ukrainians are certainly watching this very closely. They're getting the intelligence feed from their sources. They've got sources, obviously, inside Russia, they're -- they have some idea of what's going on. They're also talking to us in Western sources. They've got to move forward. But they've got to do it at their own deliberate pace, Christiane. I mean, this is -- whatever happens on the highway to Moscow is not going to remove the minefields in front of the Malidipol (PH). And so, they've got to move through that area. With all due diligence, they've got to be careful, they've got to win the counter fire fight against the Russian artillery. They've got to blunt the Russian ground attacks on them, find ways through the minefields, but they are making progress. It is slow, it is painstaking, there will be losses. And obviously, what we'd hope is a wholesale collapse of the Russian military there as a result. And then, the minefields wouldn't be protected and the artillery wouldn't be manned, and there wouldn't be any counter attacks. You still have to go through the minefield. So, it's still going to be tough.",

Let me just ask you, Jim Sciutto, before we go to a break. I mean, the bottom line is that Prigozhin doesn't actually have that many people compared to what Putin has.",

I mean, the best estimates Wagner forces, perhaps 25,000, certainly nothing to compare to the larger Russian military, at appears his hope is that some, as you say, some of those Russian forces peel away or at least don't stand in his way. And then he builds something, he builds momentum to get -- to get larger, to snowball, in effect, and that is a -- that's an uncertain outcome almost impossible to predict at this point.But at least, we haven't seen enormous resistance to his movement. Certainly, as his force has moved into Rostov-on-Don, virtually, no resistance, it seems, perhaps, without firing a shot. And since then, making steady progress up the highway there, of course, that could change as they get closer to Moscow. The only other point I would make, Christiane, is that it's interesting, when U.S. intelligence has looked at Russia for the past several years, and assessed where the greatest threat to Putin's leadership is, they've often told me that it's far less likely to come from progressive dissidents, or even the Russian public than it is to come from his right wing. That, that, that, that was the greater threat to his leadership. And Wagner certainly falls into that category. And I think is as folks are digesting this, and we all are, and just in the span of a quite tumultuous 24 hours, that the potential outcomes here include ones that perhaps might even be worse than Putin, if one could imagine -- if one could imagine, you know, Prigozhin is certainly no, no grand reformer.",

But it also claims to have taken control of key military facilities in two Russian cities. Wagner has been instrumental in Russia's fight in Ukraine. Now, the Russian President Vladimir Putin, calls these acts an armed mutiny. And he's warned that those responsible will be punished, and he's calling them traitors. Security now is extremely tight in the capital city, which is preparing what the Kremlin is calling anti-terrorist measures. And the city's mayor has declared Monday a non-workday. So, for more, I want to bring in Nina Khrushcheva.

It actually seemed very laid back. In fact, when Alexei Navalny demonstrations that you, Christiane, and I talk about in the past, the human rights activist and lawyer in his demonstrations to support him, that were much more militant and protective of the Kremlin. This time, it seemed rather laid back, people were getting married, people were going into exhibits, and so on. I think it's changing now. I haven't been outside in the last two hours. But there are less cars in the street, and people are much worried because in the morning wasn't still clear how far towards Moscow, Prigozhin troops are going to make it. And now, they're in the Lipetsk region, which is rather close to Moscow.

And so, the question for everybody, when he really started pushing it about a month ago, why was Putin silent? And, of course, it is that the remarkable feature of the today Kremlin is that it keeps saying that it's strong, but it's obviously incredibly weak. It's just going, basically at the speed of the turtle towards whatever the goal of denitrification and demilitarization is. And it seems to me that people who were originally behind with Putin, the, you know, sort of the great nationalist project of Russia, seem to be tired of waiting for that to happen. And it is possible, they are the ones that are pushing now this -- a greater nationalism struggle that Prigozhin can represent. I think in your earlier guest, that's was a conversation, because it's basically now, the fight between state nationalism and Wagner, criminal, rapist, whatever they are, former prisoners, nationalist that they offering to Russia.

And then, because it was such a shock to the system that they tried to do it via volunteer fighters, people who are going to be contractors. So, now they are trying to not to really bring Russia into the point of the bloodshed, because I think, Prigozhin is ready. Prigozhin and his -- and the forces of whoever is behind them, who fought behind him, if anybody is behind him, they are ready to actually have a revolution in order to nationalize Russia more. So, it seems to be the Kremlin -- I mean, and I think in your earlier conversation, it was that if we can ever imagine that Putin would be modernizing force on this, it does seem that the state is now, because basically, the choices between stayed bad Putin nationalist, and then even worse -- even worse, worse version of it. So, the coup as we are seeing now is coming from the right, is coming from those -- from those nationalist forces, which by the way, Putin or his people kept saying, well, you don't want me the West. Look what's going to happen after that, and it seems to be playing out ultimately now. AMANPOUR: Yes. I mean, that's all well and good, but they enabled it. They allowed him to do that.

And it's also a very -- there's a lot of civilians in that environment. So it can be a difficult goal for Putin if he wants to go after Prigozhin, which he seems to, and take him down physically. So that's going to be hard. Prigozhin sent a small force, it seems, to go to Moscow. It's -- I think it's hard to imagine that this group of people that are driving to Moscow could really get through and do anything meaningful there, or find anyone meaningful to do something meaningful, too, meaning that this appears to be somewhat of a piece of theater for Prigozhin.And he's been very good at this sort of theater. We've seen it in Ukraine around Bakhmut, you know, the multiple videos that he puts out, complaining that his troops, other troops, aren't getting the support from the Russian Defense Ministry that they need. He's been a master of the message. Has he really come out too soon when the greater system in Russia is not ready for a challenge to Putin because without naming Putin, yes, he's challenging that? But Putin has not answered the question, and that is that Prigozhin has put out there, and that is that the war has been fought badly, shouldn't have been fought, was fought on a bad premise.

Wagner served as a private army, doing controversial jobs that often not even Russia's military could do. Prigozhin, a former prisoner himself and self-styled hard man from St. Petersburg, used Wagner to operate around the world. CNN has tracked Wagner mercenaries to the Central African Republic, Sudan, Libya, Mozambique, Ukraine and to Syria. Along the way, Prigozhin enriched himself. Rights groups have accused Wagner of horrific violence, like this of Wagner fighters allegedly smashing the feet and hands of a Syrian prisoner with a sledgehammer in 2017. The man reportedly died after his ordeal. The images are incredibly disturbing like so many others attributed to his group. For many years, Prigozhin denied the existence of Wagner, its work best done in secret. A master of mythmaking, it was Prigozhin and Wagner who set up the notorious Russian troll farm used to spread disinformation around the 2016 U.S. presidential election. But when his fighters took to the battlefield in eastern Ukraine and began winning battles, Prigozhin seemed to want the spotlight. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER FOUNDER (through translator): The Bakhmut operation began on October 8th, 2022, in order to give the battered Russian army an opportunity to recover. Our guys stormed this city for 224 days. There were only Wagner private forces here. PLEITGEN (voice-over): His tactics included flinging poorly armed and poorly trained troops into the so called meat grinder of war in Ukraine's east. Suffering a shocking number of casualties in an attempt to overwhelm defenses, Prigozhin rub his victories in the face of Russia's flailing Defense Department, venting his fury at the half hazardous and ill planning of Russia illegal invasion, and chastising the Russian top brass mocking Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. [12:55:20] PRIGOZHIN (through translator): You think you are the masters of this life? You think you can dispose of their lives? You think because you have warehouses full of ammunition that you have that right? PLEITGEN (voice-over): Now the Kremlin's secret weapon may be its biggest threat. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
