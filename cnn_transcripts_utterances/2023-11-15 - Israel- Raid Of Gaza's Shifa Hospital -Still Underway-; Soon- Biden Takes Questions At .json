This as CNN obtains exclusive Hamas bodycam video of the October 7th attacks. Plus, President Biden about to hold a rare solo press conference this hour. We're going to bring it to you live. And, quote, I will bite. The senator who almost started a fistfight with a witness in a hearing is doubling down tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And we are OUTFRONT following two breaking stories. President Biden expected to hold his first press conference in months this hour. We're going to bring that to you live. This, of course, coming at a crucial moment in the Israeli war in Gaza. Tonight, we are learning that Israeli forces are still inside the largest hospital in Gaza al Shifa. A spokesman for Israel's military telling reporters, and I quote, it's a complicated area which still has many people. We need to conduct in the right place. Now, keep in mind, we first learned about this operation starting 24 hours ago. Israel's military has released video from inside the hospital they say was filmed in this day. I want to make it clear that these videos were shot and distributed by the IDF. CNN cannot independently verify their findings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COLONEL JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: It is definitely an MRI machine, and if you follow me behind the MRI machine, I will show you what our troops exposed just minutes ago. In military terms, this is a grab bag. Grab and go of a Hamas combatant. And if you zoom in and we get some light over here, what you will be able to see are -- is military equipment. There is an AK-47. There are cartridges and ammo. There are grenades in here. Of course, uniformed and all of this was hidden very conveniently, secretly behind the MRI machine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we've been unable to get a comment from hospital authorities at this time. But one thing not shown in the IDF video from the hospital at this point, now they do say it's ongoing, but I do want to make it clear at this point, they have not released any footage of Hamas alleged tunnels at that hospital. Remember, Israel said that the operation to enter Al Shifa was to clear the tunnels, that they said were being used by Hamas fighters and that they said that there was a command and control node there. An IDF spokesperson telling CNN that they were the, quote, beating heart of Hamas' operations referring to Al Shifa. This was a claim that U.S. intelligence independently came out on the record and said -- they say that's true as well. But while Israeli troops continue to sweep Al Shifa Hospital, they are now also engaged in a fierce fight to the north. CNN cameras capturing large explosions and flares. I do want to emphasize this is the exact same area that Israel said it had secured and was in control of but now, according to the IDF, Israeli forces are being ambushed by Hamas militants there. And it comes, this fighting, as we have an exclusive report tonight with footage from the October 7th terror attack on Israeli civilians. Now, many Hamas militants on that day were wearing GoPro cameras to document the attack. Some of the videos they took were then shared by Hamas, they put them online as propaganda, but not all of them. Israeli sources told me that they found many dead Hamas fighters and they were dead still wearing the go pro cameras. So footage was there. And now, CNN has obtained video from one of these cameras from the Israeli military. This particular GoPro from this Hamas militant, this one GoPro, runs 100 minutes of horror in its entirety. I do want to warn you that this exclusive report from our Oren Liebermann that you will see in just a few moments is very, very graphic. The horror of what that happened that day. Oren joins me now live from Tel Aviv. And, Oren, I am giving everyone a moment to decide what they're going to watch here. But obviously, your exclusive report is coming up here in a moment. I first want to ask you, though about, what's happening at Al Shifa hospital where last night, it was at this time where you broke the news as IDF forces were going in. They've now released new videos, the IDF has, not independent journalists. Is there more to come?",

And that is what propels them forward. It means that they are not really a well-organized fighting force, although they were able to pull off this massive attack and they got lucky in that sense that they were able to move as far inland as they did, that they were able to kill as many people as they did. But what this shows is that there is a real psychological difference in the mindset of these people compared to what the Israeli IDF would be like.",

IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF EURASIA GROUP &amp; GZERO MEDIA: The idea that you could get 2,000 Hamas terrorist fighters, young kids all gunned up across the border to cause the kind of damage that they have, terrorists, inconceivable. That's the big surprise. The big surprise is not that Hamas is a terrorist organization. The big surprise is not that you'd have these young kids prepared to martyr themselves in the cause of their ideology. The big surprise that the Israeli Defense Forces, the gold standard for border defense for operational security, human intelligence, failed, was just asleep at the switch. And that's why the Israeli people overwhelmingly blame Prime Minister Netanyahu. It's why he doesn't want to talk to the Israeli journalists right now.

This is one of the things that really was central to his election in 2022, restore America's place in the world.And China was always going to be at the very center of that. Of course, for any president, events get in the way. Events intervene. So, Ukraine, certainly, and now the Middle East. But China is still so central to everything he is doing. But every move he is making there throughout this -- the time of the summit, them walking side by side, them shaking hands, everything is top of mind as he is running for re- election again. He turns 81 years old on Monday. We are told that he wished the wife of President Xi Jinping a happy birthday. Her birthday is the same day as President Biden. But that points out the fact he does turn 81 on Monday. And every step he makes he is watched very carefully. But, again, this is something that diplomacy is something he wants to be doing. He wants to be focused on this rather than other domestic challenges. But we are being told that fentanyl was a central part of this conversation. Erin, this is a key part of the Republican argument on the Republican primary campaign, controlling fentanyl coming into the U.S. So, if President Biden gets what he can view as a win out of that, this is something where being the commander in chief, being president is a huge part of being an incumbent, a major advantage.",

I think that's a major flash point as well.They view us an adversary. They don't view us as an ally. And so, to say we made an agreement with an adversary, as Karen said, you know, they often don't keep their agreements with us and they don't think it's in their best interest to do that. So, if I were in Biden's shoes that, yes, you have to talk to these people, but you have to be clear-eyed about what their ultimate aims are, and you have to communicate to the American people that you understand they are an adversary.

It was the plan.Secondly, we've had over the last few weeks a Chinese charm offensive towards Australia when the prime minister came. That was a relationship that was completely broken over the last few years, started in the midst of COVID. The Chinese reaching out to Lithuania, also a broken relationship, all the places they've got problems with in the West, they're trying to patch over. Why? Sue Mi already said it. The Chinese economy is not doing very well. But also because the rest of the word looks like it's in flames. This Russia/Ukraine conflict, the Middle East conflict. The Chinese -- very different from Iran, from Russia, from North Korea -- they don't want chaos globally. They need the global economy to be stable. They actually need the geopolitics of the world to be stable. So even though they're an adversary of the United States and a competitor, they're not trusted by the U.S. and it's mutual. But they are adults. And in that regard, you have two leaders that have known each other for a very long time meeting today with the intention to try specifically to lower the temperature. And that has been sort of in train now for months. I'm not surprised. It's not the end of the world. It's not suddenly -- it's not a new glasnost between them. One other thing I would mention, though, for you, is that a few hours ago, the Chinese got very good news on the issue that has been most important to them. And that's Taiwan. And the two opposition parties in Taiwan who have not been able to see eye to eye decided they are going to run on a joint slate. And the one that will run for president will be the one that happens to poll the best in a few internal polls. That means that it is much more likely on January 13th that the next Taiwanese president is not pro-independence but instead someone that is more willing to work with mainland China. And that takes a very significant piece of conflict and reduces the temperature between the Americans and the Chinese. It is not coincidental that that announcement came hours before Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping. Clearly, that improved the temperature in the room.",

But this is just one example of how the decorum on Capitol Hill has really devolved in recent years, where this behavior is not only tolerated but it is also incentivized, given that he is tolerating off of this, tweeting this, doing media interviews. So, certainly not the finest moment for the world's greatest deliberative body. And I'll also point out, Erin, that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, an actual wrestler was on Capitol Hill today. So, maybe they needed to bring in some actual fighters today. But, you know, it's just another example, again, of how the institution has really changed in recent years, Erin.",
