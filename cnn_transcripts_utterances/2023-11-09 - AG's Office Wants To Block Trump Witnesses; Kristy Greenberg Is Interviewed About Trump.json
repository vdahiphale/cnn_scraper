The New York attorney general's office filed the letter asking the judge to block several of Trump's expert witnesses from testifying because these lawyers say the testimony relates to issues already resolved by the judge. The AG's office rested its case after hearing from Ivanka Trump.Our Kara Scannell outside the courthouse this morning. Kara, so what do we expect to see now and what clues do we have about the Trump defense strategy?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, this morning it's going to be arguments over these motions. And Trump's lawyers are going to ask the judge for a directed verdict, that is to say that the AG's office didn't prove their case and to find in Trump's favor. Now that is a hail Mary pass because the judge has already found that Trump's financial statements are fraudulent and he has already said that he thinks that there's been enough evidence presented in this case to fill the courtroom.And then the attorney general's team is going to go after some of these witnesses that Trump's team will begin calling as soon as Monday. That is when they will begin presenting their defense. The attorney general's office wants to block four of these expert witnesses, saying that the valuations and the accounting rules that they are going to talk about is something that has already been resolved by the judge when he found that these statements and the values placed on these properties were fraudulent. So, that will take up the bulk of today. And then Trump's team will begin their defense on Monday. They're expected - they said they're going to call Don Jr., Eric Trump and bankers to the stand. And part of the reason, in their defense, is they're trying to say that the banks had done their own due diligence, that they didn't rely on these financial statements when they were making decisions to make these loans. And that is the key of the allegation here that is left for the AG's office to prove, that the banks had received these loans -- have issued these loans after receiving these fraudulent financial statements and then had relied on them in some way. And so that is where the focus of the defense is going to go. Ivanka Trump wrapping her testimony yesterday. And during the cross- examination of her, they even got into some of this where she testified that the bank was excited to do deals with them. That they even sent a team of bankers down to the golf course in Florida before they agreed to underwrite a loan. So, kind of these were the initial building blocks. You're going to see a lot more of this. Trump says that their defense, assuming the judge let's them bring in these witnesses, could go as long until December 15th, John.",

Let's talk about this next phase, the Trump defense that now will start being presented. You've been in the courtroom for more than one of the Trumps being on the stand, so you have a unique perspective. I saw you describe Trump's day in court as something out of \"My Cousin Vinny.\" And I think everyone will kind of understand that.

So, there are six other causes of actions, falsifying business records, falsifying financial statements and insurance fraud. And to prove that they have to show that somebody, the banks, the insurance companies, actually relied on those statements, that they were material. And so you saw that, as Kara said, in the defense examination of Ivanka Trump. They were asking her, well, you know, did the banks actually care about those financials? Well, and she said, no, they did their due diligence. They came down. They sent people down to do their own independent appraisals. So, you're going to see that defense saying, this didn't matter to the bank. What mattered to the bank was the relationship with the Trump family. This was the personal, you know, wealth management group. They cared about building that relationship. They didn't care so much about these valuations.",

She's the primary point of contact for the lender. So, all of these emails that she's on, even though she didn't remember anything about them, at one point she's shown a document and she said, oh, this brings back so many memories. And then every answer to every question after that was, I do not recall. But they got the documents in because she was able to say, I have no reason to believe these are inaccurate.",

We're talking about huge magnitude of error here where you're talking about like triple the size of an apartment or, you know, appraisals that they have that show value and they're like doubling and tripling what the appraisal value is. So, again, the intent to defraud, I think you can kind of glean from the documents and glean from some of the testimony that's come out from other members of the Trump Organization saying that the Trumps are actually providing these valuations to them. So, the intent to defraud is there, and then there's going to be this question of materiality as to these other counts. And that's where I think the defense may score some points.",

You'll remember this because just over a month ago we watched lawmakers scramble to get a stop gap measure in place through next Friday. And here we go again.

He's been trying to solicit suggestions from his colleagues across the ideological spectrum but so far he has not said precisely how he plans to try and avert a government shutdown. And as you noted, time is running short. There are a couple of options on the table. One of them is this idea of a laddered, short-term spending bill. Essentially two different deadlines with various proposals and money for various government agencies expiring on two different dates. You've heard from a lot of Senate Republicans that that idea might make things more complicated, might make it much harder for Republicans to get any actual legislative victory out of two specific deadlines. And it's something that the Senate is not likely to take up.Meanwhile, you also have this idea of some other kind of short term spending bill into January, perhaps trying to make some additional cuts related to that short-term spending bill. But, again, that would likely go nowhere in the Senate either. So, one of the key questions right now is, are we going to be setting up this showdown between the House and the Senate because you have Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is expected to take a procedural step on the floor later this afternoon that would set up a procedural vote early next week. So, essentially two different plans that could be culminating right now, and there's just not that much time to find the middle ground before that Friday deadline. Sara.",

And I, in person, with Israeli leadership, also urged them to keep this campaign short and focused and then to try a longer campaign against Hamas, in partnership with other regional actors because there is a real risk that the level of civilian suffering and death that is occurring right now in Gaza will simply inflame the feelings of not just Palestinians but the whole region against Israel. That is a real concern for me about Israel's security and the future of the region.Secretary Blinken laid out yesterday a hoped for a future where the Palestinian Authority would provide security, governance, support in Gaza. That's a stretch from what the PA is currently able to do. But there's also been negotiations with regional partners, like Egypt, about whether or not there are other countries willing to step in and provide an alternative to Hamas. I understand why Israel cannot tolerate having Hamas immediately on its border given what happened a month ago. But the future here is murky. And in a long conversation with the president and his senior national security team last night, a bipartisan group of 10 senators exchanged ideas about what the future might look like for the Palestinian people, for Israel and for the region.",

Hamas is trying to get their wounded fighters released so that they can be cared for in hospitals outside of Gaza. So far there have been some releases, but, obviously, opposition by the Israelis to releasing Hamas fighters.So, it's been a difficult series of negotiations. There's also other ongoing negotiations about getting fuel into hospitals in Gaza, getting humanitarian relief.
