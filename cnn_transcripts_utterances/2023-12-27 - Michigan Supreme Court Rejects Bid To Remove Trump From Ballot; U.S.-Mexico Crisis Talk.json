Will this ruling have any impact on Trump's legal fight against his ballot ban in Colorado?Also this hour, we're standing by for a readout on critical talks that just ended between Biden cabinet officials and the president of Mexico. Did they reach any new agreement on ways to ease the surge of migrants into the U.S. as the problem weighs not only on border cities but also the White House? Also, we're following these disturbing new images out of Gaza, Palestinian men and at least two boys apparently stripped down to their underwear while being detained by the Israeli military. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Kaitlan Collins, and you're in The Situation Room. Our top story this hour, a new ruling in the multistate effort that is underway to disqualify Donald Trump from running for president again, Michigan Supreme Court now weighing in, rejecting an attempt in that state to bar Trump from the primary ballot. CNN's Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider has been going over this decision. Jessica, what reason did the Michigan high court give for outright rejecting this 14th Amendment related case?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kaitlan, the state Supreme Court really tossed this aside on procedural grounds rather than getting to the merits. They said they just didn't have the power to decide that question of whether Trump should be on the ballot because the case raised political questions.And in this very short opinion, they also agreed with the lower court that the secretary of state in Michigan just didn't have the authority to determine who was eligible to be on or off the primary ballot. So, this was, in a sense, a win for Trump, a minor win, though, since Michigan's highest court really didn't go to the merits. So, we're expecting, though, that Trump's team will appeal -- remember that Colorado decision last week that took him off the ballot there? His team, Trump's team needs to appeal by January 4th to keep him on the primary ballot that's determined on January 5th. And eventually, Kaitlan, the U.S. Supreme Court really could take up this dicey issue of whether the 14th Amendment's insurrection ban would exclude Donald Trump from the general election ballot. But we're a little ways off from that.",

We just discovered some of the secretary of state's comments on social media that she had made after January 6th, saying that she was negative about Trump or his actions.So, the way this is all played out is that earlier this month, the secretary of state had a hearing on whether Trump should be removed from the ballot. She has said she'll be issuing her decision at some point this week. But just today, Trump's legal team asked her to recuse herself because of those comments, they say, that they found where she's in one of them at least condemning the January 6 Capitol attack, in another one speaking out against Trump's acquittal after his impeachment proceedings. So, the secretary of state, Kaitlan, in Maine, has made no comment about this. It's likely she won't recuse, that her ruling probably will come soon. But, again, she was the one who administered this hearing. So, it's likely that whatever she does decide would probably get appealed to the courts in that state.",

This filing, Kaitlan, is actually notable because all of the proceedings here have been paused in this case. And Jack Smith, he continues to file on this, despite the fact that that March 4th start date to this trial probably actually won't go forward because of the appeals process playing out.

I mean, really, what the court said is it was a procedural issue, that they were not in a place and they were not the arbiters to decide who could and could not be placed on a primary ballot. That was something up to the political parties and the political process as they went through, and that this case was a little different because no one had to declare their eligibility to be a candidate on that primary ballot. And so they passed on that.But the importance, I think, goes deeper into the likelihood that the Supreme Court takes this up and takes a good look at it. And the reason that we have a case like this before the Supreme Court, and that is so there can be some uniformity across the different jurisdictions. You can't have somebody not eligible in Texas under this amendment, but yet they are eligible in some other state. And the Supreme Court will get to that in short order, I think.",

I will say, though, that the Michigan Supreme Court decision, I think, underscores that this Colorado decision really is an outlier. You'll recall that many state Supreme Courts across the country had previously rejected this theory up until the Colorado Supreme Court ruled. The Michigan court now has just followed in the footsteps of all those pre-Colorado courts.So, at the end of the day, I don't think it has a huge impact on the Supreme Court's willingness and likelihood to take the case. I think the Supreme Court is very likely to grant Trump's appeal. I think they're very likely to decide this case, and I think they're very likely to overrule the Colorado Supreme Court.",

They thought, if anything, that it would be ruled against Trump in a lower court and then they'd appeal to the higher court. They were surprised, at least some of them, that it ended up being, that the Supreme Court of Colorado ruled against Donald Trump. But while Tom says these cases might not have any impact on one another, to the layman who's not well versed in the law, they are potentially linked. And that's what Donald Trump's team is going to try to do, to show any way that they can that the Colorado ruling is an outlier. And this is a statement that we heard from Donald Trump and his team. They wrote, the Michigan Supreme Court has strongly and rightfully denied the desperate Democratic attempt to take the leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election, me, off the ballot in the great state of Michigan. But, again, they were not super concerned about this, as far as legal battles that Donald Trump is facing.

And so it basically says, look, judge, let's make him talk about the relevant evidence. Let's not talk about the little green men on the moon, so to speak. And that's the reason that you have it, is to keep the trial focused, but to get some advanced ruling so that during the course of the trial, you cannot just object, but you can remind the judge, judge, you recall you've already addressed this, would you please admonish them to not continue to talk about it? This has been the subject of a pre-trial ruling. So, these are standard type motions. You expect a prosecutor to file them. It is a little unusual that during this stay period, during the time that things have kind of stopped, pending some appeal, that we're continuing to see the Jack Smith motions, I think that's probably because they want to keep this at the forefront and also show the voter, and I think generally the American people, that they're continuing to work even as they're asking the court to move ahead expeditiously.",

The U.S. secretary of state and the Homeland Security secretary both there, pressing the president of Mexico to help the problem that is weighing not only on border towns but also on the White House ahead of a presidential election year. I want to check in with CNN's Rosa Flores, who is at the southern border. Rosa, obviously, we're waiting to get an official readout of whether officials feel that real progress was made here.

We were expecting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to ask Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to stop migrants, in essence, from coming north. All of that is code for upping enforcement on the Mexican side of the border.And, look, we've seen this before whenever there's been prior surges and representatives of the United States go to Mexico and have these talks with the Mexican president, whoever is in office soon after that. A lot of the times, we see upped enforcement. Mexico's National Guard all of a sudden showing up on the northern border of their country. And also sometimes Mexico ups their deportation flights. We've seen that during prior surges as well. Mexico will send deportation flights and/or flights or buses from their northern border to either central Mexico or their southern border. We're also expecting the United States to ask Mexico to control the railways. And what that means is for Mexico to establish checkpoints in their freight rail system. And, Kaitlan, we've seen this, migrants use what's called Avestia (ph), or the freight rail system in Mexico, to travel very quickly from Southern Mexico to Northern (INAUDIBLE). A lot of the times, we see very large groups of thousands of migrants arriving at one point in time in areas like Eagle Pass, for example. It's because of those railways. So, the United States was expecting to be asking Mexico to install checkpoints to control their freight rail system so that that could stem the flow of migrants. Kaitlan?",

It's what doesn't, Michigan doesn't require that they be qualified to be a candidate or elected in the general election.

So, this is true to form for what Governor Christie has been in this race, for really pushing it to Donald Trump for what he sees as a threat to democracy and being able to call it out. How much will that message resonate in terms of primary voters and caucus-goers, we'll certainly see in a couple of weeks. But you got to hand it to Christie. He has been consistent on this issue and certainly is not backing down.",

If he got out of the race, that support would likely go to someone like a Nikki Haley, obviously not Donald Trump if they're supporting Chris Christie.Is it true that the Biden White House, as Nikki Haley has been arguing, would be more worried about a Nikki Haley as a Republican nominee, that she would be more electable?",

You have to make sure and deliver the punch directly to Trump but not do it in way that's going to alienate his base because there are some former Trump supporters that are looking to turn the page and move elsewhere and someone like a Nikki Haley is a good alternative.As Jamal said and as we've said, she is a younger generation leader looking for a more optimistic vision and look, I think she has done quite well in terms of taking it to Trump. She has gone after him for adding to the debt. She's gone after him for some of his positions on foreign policy and the fact that he's been a loser. Her big ace in the hole right now is New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who I'm sure we'll hear from tonight. I spoke with him on the radio this morning and he said, look, Nikki Haley is perfect certainly for New Hampshire. Live free or die state. She's about individual responsibility and reducing government, but he says she and he are going to show that Donald Trump is -- has been a liar. He has been a loser. Did not build the wall and certainly added to the debt. So, we're going to see that.",

In that case, vassal forces means South Korea coming from Kim Jong Un there. So, he is pushing his weapons programs and his nuclear programs even further as he orders this -- to accelerate here in the face of what he accuses of U.S. of doing, of expanding its own efforts in the region. It's worth noting that just ten days ago, North Korea tested the Hwasang-18 intercontinental ballistic missile. It is the third solid fuel ICBM test we've seen coming from North Korea this year. It also came with a short-range ballistic missile test. So, Kaitlan, you can see here, Kim Jong Un seeing the U.S. working with South Korea and Japan, he's pushing his country even harder as well.",
