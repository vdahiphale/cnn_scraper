      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We begin with this breaking news: Several US military bases across Europe are on heightened alert right now due to a potential terrorist threat. And one of those bases is in Germany, where the US-European command is headquartered. A US official tells CNN that they haven't seen this threat level in at least 10 years. Joining me right now from the Pentagon is CNN correspondent, Oren Liebermann. Oren, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Fredricka, according to two US officials, at least several US military bases in Europe have elevated their threat level to what's known as FPCON Charlie -- Force Protection Condition Charlie. That is the second highest level of alert within the US military, only Force Protection Condition Delta is higher than that.And according to the US Army, this is what Charlie means. It means that it applies when an incident occurs, or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. Now, it is unclear at this point if this is in response to a specific threat against a specific facility or if its more general and the US is looking out for the possibility of an attack against one of a number of US military facilities in Europe. The US-European Command, when we reached out to them, would not confirm Force Protection Condition Charlie across at least several bases in the European Command theater, but they did say that they are constantly evaluating and will make changes to their Force Protection Condition when necessary and put in additional safety measures.   We have seen at least one base announce that publicly, that is the US Army garrison in Bavaria, which covers several different locations. They have stated on their website that they are at Charlie, so that elevated threat level and they have curtailed or shut off a number of services while this happens. Again, that is all from public statements on their social media. Now again, were not sure and it is unclear at this point if this is a specific threat, but if you look across Europe, officials in a number of countries, including for example, Germany and France, are already at an elevated threat level, especially with less than a month to go until the Paris Olympics and with the European football championships already having started. The interior minister in Germany said several days ago that they are on the lookout for a number of potential threats including the potential of terrorism. And then in France, since March, they have been at their highest level of alert, and that continues to today, especially as we close in on the Olympics. Meanwhile, the US Embassy in Paris points out that there is an elevated threat level against any large gathering, and certainly the Olympics qualifies as that. Military bases., apparently also taking precautions now.",

He is supposed to be delivering us a statement somewhere in the next hour or so from his office here.The fact is that he is not completely out of a job just yet because the projections that we have give the National Rally Party, the extreme right-wing party 230 to 280 seats. In order to have a majority in the parliament, they have got to have 289 seats, which they at the moment, according objections we have do not have. Now, we've heard in the last hour from the leader of the left-point, the New Popular Front it is called, the left-wing grouping and he said basically that if their candidates are in third position in any of these election districts, they are going to stand aside in order to form a blockade against the right-wing -- extreme right-wing coming to power. So what is going to happen here in the next week or so is we are going to have to see a lot of horse trading going on as the candidates that are -- there are three candidates who pass the bar of 12.5 percent votes, they're going to have the opportunity to form a coalition, essentially with other candidates in order to stop the right-wing national front and we expect to hear that from Mr. Attal, the prime minister, something similar to that in the next hour or so.",

BITTERMANNsaid that he is hoping there will be some kind of a broad generalized coalition against the extreme right. But, more than that, there is not a whole lot that he can do. What he is looking forward to is something that the French call Cohabitation, which means a power-sharing basically, and we've seen that before. We saw it with Jacques Chirac back in the 90s, who had to give up part of the power to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the left-wing prime minister, and the two of them did not get along on issues. The president has powers over Defense and over foreign policy, but the prime minister has the purse strings and so the prime minister effectively can shut down and change operations, for instance, in Ukraine, for example. The president could want one thing in terms of supporting Ukraine, but the prime minister could go to the Parliament and cut off the money.

He had a fundraising blitz over the weekend where he also told donors and conceded that he did not have his best debate performance. But again, that he would \"work harder.\" So he acknowledged to the concerns and the panic that many have had since Thursday night's debate.   [15:10:07] Now, we have also seen on the airwaves multiple allies coming out in defense of President Biden saying much of the same as well, which is keep your focus on the president's record and also trying to defend what viewers saw. Take a listen to what Jim Clyburn had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): When we look at the past performance of these two men that are the frontrunners in their parties, we get a lot of indication about what their future behavior would be. So Joe Biden should continue to run on his record.

There has been a split among donors who are wondering who potential replacements could be for a Democratic nominee, while others say this is a waste of time. It is time to back President Biden and move on from this debate.Now, the Biden campaign says that they did rake in millions over the weekend as again, as a result of this fundraising blitz, $33 million in total. The majority of that being grassroots donations. They have had a lot of strength in that space and it is often what they point to, to say look, there are first-time donors that are still coming to the Biden campaign and voters who are still backing the president, despite again, these headlines about the president's debate performance and the panic that has set in across the Democratic Party.",

They know it is going to be a close race. They know they're going to see some polls that reflect poorly on the campaign and the president, but they often try to dismiss those and just try to keep the focus on what they're seeing in their own internal polling and these flash poll since the debate and just trying to move forward. But again, Fred, it is clear over the last 48 hours, there is still a lot of work ahead and there is certainly still a lot of defense from all corners.",

And of course, former President Trump was impeached twice, and that did not -- that was not successful. So the Supreme Court could find that any official actions taken by the president warrant immunity, or they could find that these were not actions that are official actions, right? These were actions that former President Trump took as a candidate and therefore should not get immunity.   So I am not sure how they will decide, but it is very consequential because it determines basically how presidents can be held accountable moving forward.",

Because on some level, you wonder if the court is worried about seeming like they are being two deferential to January 6th defendants and President Trump and all of the things coming out of that particular event.

On Saturday, we were talking about a tropical storm, on Sunday, we are talking about a major hurricane. Look at that eye that has developed in the last 24 hours. It is clear, it is symmetrical and it is a sign of an incredibly strong and destructive storm developing. We could be looking at some catastrophic impacts for the Windward Islands as we go into the workweek. This is the farthest east that we have had a hurricane in June in the tropical Atlantic. It is the third earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic and it is the earliest major hurricane within 100 miles of Barbados and Grenada. Simply put, we do not get storms this strong this early in the season. Look at the destructive hurricane-force winds that could hit the Windward Islands as we go into the workweek. We are talking about some destructive, catastrophic impacts. Storm surge could be up to six to nine feet in some locations coming in with the intense hurricane force winds. We will continue to find Beryl head towards Jamaica as we go into the middle of the week, then eventually the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico by Friday. We are talking about rapid intensification because these ocean temperatures are just so incredibly warm. Middle and upper 80s, that is about three to five degrees above average and much more typical for August. That is why we are talking about a major hurricane about four to six weeks ahead of schedule. Hurricanes love warm ocean waters. It is their food and their fuel. As our oceans become warmer because of climate change, that is more food and more fuel available for rapid intensification. We can see strong storms become even stronger at a faster pace and we have seen that trend in recent years.",

But the law does say that it has to be a reasonable price for these test kits. So hopefully, that means they are inexpensive in a lot of places, or hopefully completely free in others.

As you well know, having spent time diving and being in the water, spending time in a space where you can't hear anyone speak, where you are embracing Mother Nature and all her majesty especially with these apex predators, these dinosaurs in the ocean that have been around longer than trees, it is like a meditative experience. So telling the story was an incredible opportunity and specifically getting into the plight of sharks and highlighting how there is this conflict between them and fishermen folks.",

And here you are, enjoying the majesty, too, of these sharks.Most people fear sharks and that also is why many of them get killed, too, right, out of fear or there are other motivations, too. But talk to me about what is learned about the conservation of sharks, how it is possible, how this free diving is also helping to facilitate that appreciation.",

So I got an opportunity to go free diving with a good friend of mine, Jason Washington known as Cayman Jason, he is a world-class award-winning photographer in the Scuba Diving Hall of Fame.His contribution to conservation is his ability to shine a new light on these animals. As you noted, there is immense fear when it comes to sharks. A lot of that has to do with the movie \"Jaws\" and the portrayal of sharks as these blood-thirsty killer animals, these mindless hunters, and they are not that. They are sophisticated and graceful. They have a politics about them, and they have personality, too. As a matter of fact, when we were free diving with them, we were warned about a shark named, Butt Face and sort of unruly nature the way -- it is a funny name -- the way that it sort of doesn't follow the typical rules, the typical behavior of tiger sharks and when we got down there, we realized it was just kind of an unruly sort of animal, but I never felt scared. It never threatened anyone. It was really just interested in what we were doing. And you saw in it curiosity, which is something that I don't think people appreciate about these animals, as well as the fact that they are threatened by overfishing worldwide. One in three shark species is actually at risk of being close to extinction. So it is important to protect them, but also to consider the plight of fishermen, too who say that here in the United States, regulations have allowed their numbers to flourish, but that means more competition and it makes it much more difficult for them to make ends meet and that is what is at the crux of our story.",

And I mean, because they actually seem like they are really cooperative and they know what she is doing as opposed to feeling threatened by her. How is that?",

She is an amazing diver and she has contributed to the Bahamas enacting some of the strictest prohibitions on fishing and protections for sharks in the world and she has promoted eco-tourism too as an avenue for the islands to generate a ton of money from tourists that want to see these animals up close.She makes the argument that these animals have become familiar with her. She has more than a hundred that she has named and she recognizes that they have a certain comfort with her and that allows her to reach into their mouths, the mouth of a shark and remove hooks that the sharks have latched onto as fishermen are in the area. It is really incredible to watch. You have to tune in at 8:00 PM tonight.",
