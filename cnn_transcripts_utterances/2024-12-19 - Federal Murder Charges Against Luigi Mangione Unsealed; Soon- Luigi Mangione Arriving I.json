They were just unsealed, and as Luigi Mangione is moments away from arriving back in New York.That is where we find our senior crime and justice correspondent, Shimon Prokupecz, who is not only waiting for him, but has been looking through the unsealed document.

      "sentences": "So, Dana, four new charges against Luigi Mangione. This is way more serious, certainly now. Now we have a federal case and the state case. The federal case charging him with two counts of stalking murder. And there is also a firearms charge that, of course, for the 3D gun that he allegedly used here and along with the silencer.The FBI will be taking Luigi Mangione into custody this morning, once he lands here in New York City. They will then process him. And then at some point, he will be here behind me at the federal courthouse to face the charges. This is really, really significant. This has been kind of a whirlwind of a morning. We were expecting him in state court on those murder charges and the terrorism charges. But now this morning, suddenly, the FBI coming in, the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's Office, filing these charges. As the NYPD was bringing Luigi Mangione back to New York City, they used their own plane to pick him up in Pennsylvania and to bring him here to New York City, and then he will be transferred into the FBI custody. Significantly, also, I want to say that in this new complaint that the U.S. Attorney's Office just released. There is new information. New information about the notes that we have been hearing that Luigi Mangione wrote himself allegedly. In the notes, what the U.S. Attorney's Office says, and the FBI is that, it is marked August 15 and that the notebook describes how, quote, the details are finally coming together. And that allegedly, Luigi Mangione writes in this notebook. I'm glad, in a way, that I've procrastinated because it allowed me to learn more about company one. They don't name the company in this case. And they say the notebook entry also stated that, quote, the target is insurance because, quote, it checks every box. There is more information from other notes that Luigi Mangione allegedly made in this notebook coming from October 22 and it stated, one and a half months. The investor conference is a true windfall. And most importantly, the message becomes self-evident, it says. And then it goes on to say that the notebook describes an intent, to quote, whack the CEO of one of the insurance companies at its investors conference. And then the Department of Justice says, as described above, October 22 was approximately six weeks before the date of the murder of the victim, which occurred on the date of company one's investor conference. So, some new information here, it goes to the level of planning the weeks that Luigi Mangione allegedly planned that he had waited to do this. There are also some new pictures that the Department of Justice is releasing in this complaint. So, there is new information, and we will probably learn even more when the court appearance happens later here in the day. And as you know, sort of, as this case has been, you know, things just suddenly happen. And certainly, this is all new here information for today.",

      "sentences": "Well, the notebook was actually referenced in the three-page letter that Mangione was allegedly found carrying where he talked about the claim of responsibility. But he said, you'll find the planning and the to-do lists and the other elements in the spiral notebook, which they make reference to in this federal complaint.But it is based on the federal anti-stalking laws and the use of interstate commerce, you know, so that they can show he traveled across state lines with the intent to commit these felonies, allegedly that he used interstate commerce in terms of research, telephones, emails and so on to facilitate this crime. And that all of this was used in furtherance of that murder. So, what you have now is two distinct cases, and interestingly, a little law enforcement role reversal here, where the state authorities are charging terrorism, offering a potential life sentence without parole, and federal authorities, which would usually be the lead on terrorism, charging stalking and weapons possession, either way, federal supremacy takes hold here, where they were able to writ him out of the Pennsylvania jail into their custody. But the bulk of this investigation is done by NYPD detectives. From the beginning, they're going to team up with people from the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force in New York City, which is a combination of FBI agents and New York City detectives. And it will really be between the prosecutors to figure out which case goes first, which case follows, or if a plea deal is reached, which will dispose of both cases with a single plea, but that's all down the road.",

And that's where we are right now. We're waiting at the heliport in lower Manhattan. I can tell you here on the scene, we see FBI officials. We see NYPD officials. We see officials with the JTTF. There's a bunch of dark black SUVs. Unclear if, when that helicopter lands. If they'll drive out an SUV onto the sort of tar mask, so to speak, or if he'll make actually this little-long walk to the actual vans that are here to be brought to 500-pearl where he is going to face those federal charges that were just on seal.

      "sentences": "Well, this is an important moment in the case. As you see, they are now boarding the aircraft that has carried Mangione from Pennsylvania, that is a New York City police department aircraft, which is regularly used to scan for radiation along the coastline, often assist with surveillance operations in terrorism cases, for the counter terrorism bureau and the Intelligence Bureau, and is used on occasion for prison or transport, which is what we are seeing today.This is. And its pm the occasion for case that really took every single resource of the NYPD from the moment those shots were fired until the moment detectives understood this was not a happenstance. This was a planned hit. This was an organized shooting, and now we are continuing to wait for Mangione to get off the plane. But from the movement, shots were fired until the moment detectives. This one is the homicide with the Manhattan homicide squad. But that also means hundreds of detectives conducted video Canvas canvasses for witnesses, and found from store to store, bank to bank, building to building, NYPD cameras, and here comes Mangione, coming down the stairs now in his orange jump suit from the Department of Corrections of Pennsylvania, and he is being walked by NYPD detectives who traveled to Pennsylvania overnight to pick him up at that hearing, He will be brought to the NYPD helicopter. There are two of them on the ground. He'll be going into the larger of the two, where he will be taken to where Brynn Gingras is at the Wall Street heliport. As you said, this is a 40, 45-minute flight. And from there, he will be placed into the custody of the FBI and NYPD Task Force officers assigned to that FBI squad and be brought to 500-pearl speed in Manhattan, which is the federal courthouse where we will not see him. He will be taken in through a garage entrance into an elevator that takes him and the vehicle he's in and everybody else in it down to a lower level. And then he will be processed and brought before a magistrate, unless they make the decision to go to the FBI offices and go through a booking procedure. They could do that either way.

I don't believe that this is necessarily the spectacle he had in mind, although ironically, Dana, his manifesto begins with, you know, the words -- it's actually addressed to the feds. It says to the feds.And then the next line is about how he respects the work they do for our country. So, the letter anticipates that he might have been called, but remember, at the time, he was still in this disguise, he was far away, and it really begged the question, was he going to continue to seek other targets because he still had that weapon with him, or was he done",

He has become a cause celebre for an entire sect of the population who is frustrated with healthcare, with insurance, with medical costs. And given that, it also makes him some kind of a security risk in a different way.So, the controlling features of not going on a multi hour road trip in a car where other cars could have followed or tagged along, moving him through the airplane, to the helicopter, very much, by the way, consistent with how they transported terrorists and other prior cases that were charged as terrorism. This looks very much like the day that they brought back Najibullah Zazi to face charges of a bomb plot in New York, but this time, it's not international terrorism. It's a brand-new form of what authorities are charging as a new kind of domestic terrorism, which has made him both a criminal suspect and a populist figure online.",
