There are dozens and dozens of tanks, dozens and dozens of armored fighting vehicles. And what the IDF is saying that it has done here is pulled its ground forces out of Khan Younis. They've been in there for the past three or more months since December. And the IDF says, this is effectively marking an end of ground operations in Gaza in their current form.Now we've been down along the border today. The war is clearly far from over. We've seen airstrikes going into the Khan Younis area and the 162nd Division, the IDF says, along with the Nahal Brigade, will remain in the north of Gaza. This perhaps potentially changes the dynamic a little around the negotiating table in Cairo when the CIA chief, the Mossad chief, the Egyptians, the Qataris as well all get there to discuss how a ceasefire and a hostage release can be arranged with Hamas. There have been so many sticking points. Potentially this changes the situation. However, what the IDF is very clear about that they maintain a significant force, particularly in the north of Gaza, the potential for a ground operation into Rafah remains, and that they say these troops here from the 98th are coming out to recover and recuperate, and prepare for any future operations -- Jessica.",

Now sources say that President Biden in his 30- minute call with the prime minister last week ticked through some of what he wanted to see. The primary focus of all of that was getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza. But that included opening land crossing that you were just talking about with Nic, as well as ramping up supplies into Gaza and opening up a port to get more aid into Gaza as well.Now, during that call the prime minister said that he was going to get that done, but the president went even further saying that he wanted to see it done by that evening. And so that is what happened. The Israeli security cabinet did approve those measures and now the White House is welcoming those, saying that while they're happy to see that there have been changes still a lot on the horizon and still some frustration.

I mean, the only way out right now is an Israeli-Hamas deal, a negotiated deal, it's been on and off since mid-November during the last hostage release, exchanging 45 Israeli hostages, including whether the Americans will be part of this exchange or not is unclear. But the elderly, the infirmed, and the women for 45 days, roughly six weeks of quiet, and what you could describe as a temporary ceasefire.That will allow more humanitarian assistance to surge into Gaza, but it doesn't solve the problem because Hamas will continue to hold 50 Israeli soldiers as hostage. And they're going to want an insurance policy for the lives of the senior Hamas leadership the Israeli are trying -- understandably trying to kill, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. So this is going to be a very unsettled period even if, and I hope there is this exchange now being negotiated in Cairo, even if that takes place.",

But Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's putative successor, and Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff whose son tragically was killed several months ago in Gaza, they are pushing very hard for Netanyahu to focus and perhaps become more flexible on an exchange. And that what's on the table now, I suspect. The number of Palestinianprisoners that Hamas demands in return for the 45 or so Israelis and how many Palestinian teams will be allowed to return to northern Gaza. Hamas wants as many as possible. The Israelis are looking for much, much smaller numbers. So maybe there's a degree of urgency in the part of both Israel and Hamas to do this deal, but I have to say the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Khan Younis, if you're Yahya Sinwar, the military architect of the October 7th terror surge, you're sitting 20 meters below ground in Khan Younis or Rafah, you see the Israelis are pulling back and were pulling out, is that going to give you an incentive to cut a deal or to hold up for more?

They maintained I think one brigade in charge of an east-west road and roughly 5,000 as an Israeli brigade. So clearly, and Mark Hertling knows what he's talking about, it's an inflection point and a transition, a downshift from a comprehensive, highly kinetic ground campaign to more mobile, perhaps more surgical airstrikes will continue or surgical efforts, intelligence driven, maybe identify where the hostages are again. Continue their search for Hamas' senior leadership and deal with whatever residual rocket capacity there exists in Khan Younis.Rafah remains a very much an open question at this point, but I think we're literally weeks away, if not more, from any major Israeli ground campaign against that southern Gazan city.",

So whoever did maintenance on it last would have checked that to make sure. And then the second set of eyes would look at it to make sure that it was done.But the last line of defense is the preflight inspection. The pilot is supposed to do the walkaround before each flight, and check those latches. They check a lot of things on the airplane, but that's one of the things that pilots need to look at. And it's not easy to do. You've got to get down and look underneath and feel underneath to see if those latches are done, and those are the two things that I would look for right now, were those two things accomplished during that pre-flight and if there was maintenance, was it accomplished properly and signed off properly as being re-secured?",

The Iowa UConn semifinal had more viewers than every World Series game last year, every NBA Finals game last year, every Masters Final Round since 2013. So this game, huge.Iowa's Caitlin Clark, Dawn Staley, South Carolina, facing off. Both driving forces behind the boom of women's sports. Clark breaking another record in the final, dropping 18 points in the first quarter, the most in any quarter of a tournament game. She finished with 30. But in the end, the Gamecocks were too much. Their bench alone scored 37 points. Iowa's bench scored zero. South Carolina becomes just the 10th team to finish a perfect season 38. No, they are. That's Coach Dawn Staley's third title as a coach. She displayed her trademark class afterwards, giving all kinds of credit to Clark. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
