Voters have just days left to decide who will control Congress, this as President Biden just announced a short time ago he plans to give a major speech tonight. A lot of big names also hitting the campaign trail in the coming days. Former President Obama is in Arizona today where he's campaigning for Democrats Katie Hobbs and Mark Kelly. Former President Trump stumping for Republicans in Iowa, Ohio and Florida this week, and both former presidents expect to be key in that battleground of Pennsylvania this weekend. It is Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney though making waves in Michigan with her endorsement of a Democratic congressional candidate, Elissa Slotkin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  If we want to ensure the survival of our republic, we have to walk away from politics as usual. If the people in our party are not doing the job they need to do, then we're going to vote for the people in the party, because we are Americans above all else. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're told it will be about protecting democracy.CNN White House Correspondent M.J. Lee joining us now with some details here, all of this, of course, coming on heels of what prosecutors have said was a politically motivated attack at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home in San Francisco. Her husband, Paul, of course, was the one who ultimately was attacked. What more do we know about this speech, M.J.? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. President Biden's schedule has just been officially updated to reflect the speech that he is going to be giving in Washington, D.C. tonight on the theme of protect protecting democracy. And what we are told is that he intends to directly address election deniers and anybody who wants to undermine the election process. And a big theme that he hopes to address are these recent threats of politically motivated violence. Now, we know from speaking to Biden advisers that this is the kind of speech that they have been contemplating on the president getting for some time. But the recent thinking really has been shaped by what they have seen as a surge in Anti-democratic language coming from -- including some Republican elected officials, Republican candidates, and also, again, these threats of violence. Of course, President Biden himself and his top advisers deeply alarmed by what happened over the last week with this threat and violence against Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, which, as you said, authorities have now said was politically motivated. So, all of this has gone into the thinking behind why the president is going to give this speech tonight. And I should, of course, note that the idea of the president talking about the theme of protecting democracy, that is not new for this president. This goes all the way back to his 2020 campaign, protecting the soul of America was, of course, a central theme, but it does just go to show that six days out from Election Day, the stakes are really high and that is what the White House trying to show tonight.",

And what was interesting and telling is that the crowd was really a full Republican base. If you looked around, people in Trump hats and certainly the Republican base showing out for him. And he really pitched to find the independent voting friends, their conservative Democratic friends and give them this message. Listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR.

      "sentences": "Yes. What you're seeing throughout the poll is that Republicans are on the front foot, both because they have a motivated base, a more motivated base than Democrats, and because of this focus on the economy and more trust that the Republicans will handle economic matters better than Democrats.Let's look at the first poll here. It's the issues important to likely voters. 51 percent of likely voters said the economy and inflation are the top issue that they care about. Voters are confident in the GOP's handling of those issues more than -- over Democrats. Abortion is 15 percent, voting rights at 9 percent, gun policy, immigration, climate change and crime are down the list. Why this matters? As you hinted at in the Oz bite there, they're focused on the economy. Republicans want to talk more about the economy than they want to talk about abortion. That has been the case for months now. And you're seeing in this closing message last few days of the campaign, that is why Republicans are focused on this issue. Now, let's look at the generic ballot for Congress. That is basically when you ask a voter if the election were held today and you could choose between a generic Democrat and a generic Republican, who would you choose today? In our poll, 47 percent said a Democratic candidate, 51 percent said a Republican candidate. Now, that's just narrowly outside the margin of error in the poll, Erica, but why that matters is a lot of these races are going to be decided by those slim margins. The fact that Republicans have that four-point lead in this generic ballot says a lot about what could happen on Tuesday night in terms of especially House races.",

A big reason for that is they think they're going to win. You're going to be more enthusiastic if you think your candidate is going to win.But we saw that in the polling as well. 35 percent of voters said they were extremely enthusiastic. 24 percent said very enthusiastic. 27 percent said somewhat enthusiastic. The reason this matters, frankly, is that right now, all of these campaigns are focused on getting out the vote. It's easier to do that if your voters are motivated to vote, if they're excited to vote. So, as you're putting money into getting people out to vote, Republican have the edge there as well because their voters are frankly just more excited.",

It could end up being like 2020, maybe not to the scale where we see insurrectionists at the Capitol, but we might see some violence at the polls against election workers. You may see intimidation.The only thing with these speeches and what we saw back in September was that some people found that this speech that Biden gave that had some darker imagery, it had military personnel around him, and he called out Republicans directly, it was seen as alienating Republicans. It was seen as putting them off. And right now, some of the independent-leaning voters who may be Republican leaning, they might be put off by a speech like this, right? They may not want to be preached to by the president. And so I think there's a real risk to having a speech like this six days before the election rather than sticking with the status quo and talking about the things that people really are at top of mind, which are inflation, economy, pocketbook issues.",

Now, we're going to talk about this issue. I mean, it's fascinating.And then you see that clip of Mehmet Oz that Jessica Dean just played, where he says, look, you don't talk about anything when you go out there and try to win people over, you talk about the economy and you talk about those kitchen table concerns.
