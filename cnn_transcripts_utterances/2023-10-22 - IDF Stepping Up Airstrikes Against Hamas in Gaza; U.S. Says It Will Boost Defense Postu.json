I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong with our ongoing coverage of Israel at War.It's 5 p.m. here in Hong Kong, noon in embattled Gaza. Where we're now hearing that another small convoy of trucks with food and medicine is preparing to cross from Egypt into Gaza. 20 trucks were allowed to cross early Saturday. And Egypt's Red Crescent says another 17 trucks are ready to go today. Well, meanwhile, a ground invasion by Israeli forces could come at any time. On Saturday, the Israeli military announced its bombardment of Hamas targets in Gaza will become more relentless than ever. Hundreds of armored vehicles along with thousands of Israeli troops, and now poised at the Gaza border waiting for orders. On Saturday, the IDF again dropped leaflets over northern Gaza, wanting civilians to evacuate self or risk being considered a partner of Hamas. The Israeli military says it carried out an airstrike early today on a mosque in the West Bank in order to stop a, quote, \"imminent terrorist attack.\" The White House says President Biden has been kept informed on all the latest developments. On Saturday, a reporter asked if he was trying to get Israel to hold back on its offensive. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But as you said, the information that we have is from the Egyptian Red Crescent, which says that 17 trucks carrying food and other types of aid are on the border on standby to cross when or if they get the red light.We have seen for days and days now, aid piling up in Egypt ready to cross into Gaza. But the forces that be that control that border have only let a limited amount actually in. And so there was a lot more than just those 17 trucks which could, in theory, go into Gaza, if they were given the green light. We saw 20 trucks entering yesterday. But the Palestinians say that look that is a drop in the bucket compared to what they need. They say that normally 500 trucks cross the border every single day to supply the essentials to the more than 2 million people who actually live in this enclave of the Palestinian territories. We have seen, according to the U.N. some 60% of healthcare facilities in Gaza have shut because either there's been bombing nearby or because they simply don't have fuel to run their generators and of the 20 trucks that we saw enter yesterday, Anna, they had food, they had water, they had medicine, but they did not carry any fuel. So whatever those hospital facilities have right now, at least for the time being. That's all they're going to get.",

So basically, the top 1/3 or so of the Gaza people are supposed to leave. This is where the majority of the population actually lives. The difficulty, though, is that we have been seeing even today, strikes that are outside of that area. So even if people do manage to go south to other areas, they are far from safe. Deir el-Balah, for instance is in central part of Gaza, it is seen virtually a daily strikes on -- on apartment complexes and other sites on a pretty much daily basis.We saw leaflets being dropped on Thursday, telling people to move south. We saw them again yesterday. But the ones dropped yesterday had different language on them, which stands out and I'll read it to you. It says, \"Urgent warning to the residents of the Gaza Strip, your presence in north of Wadi Gaza puts your life in danger. Everyone who chose not to evacuate from the north of the Strip to the south of Wadi Gaza might be considered as a partner for the terrorist organization.\" So the IDF yesterday confirmed that they did in fact drop those leaflets but sort of walked back some of that language saying that there was no intention to consider those who have not evacuated from the affected area, fighting as a member of a terrorist group, stressing that it does not target civilians intentionally. It says that the translation of these leaflets which has spread online was imprecise. It said though it didn't elaborate on what was in precise exactly. The translation that I just read you by the way, that CNN's translation. That's not anybody else's. The IDF spokesperson was asked yesterday what Israel would do in the event of this ground operation to try to prevent civilian casualties. And, you know, he repeated what -- what Israel has been saying all along that Hamas uses civilians as human shields. And then he said this. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESPERSON: What we will be doing is first and foremost trying to distinguish between who is a combatant and who isn't. And we will target the combatants, the Hamas terrorists. We have tried to evacuate the civilians and we still try to evacuate them from the northern part of Gaza, because that is where most of the combat will be. And we continue to warn civilians in various locations to stay clear of Hamas so that they don't endanger themselves. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They start running out of the medicine and medical supplies as well as a fuel which is needed to have electricity because they are completely relying on backup generators to have electricity.

He did not go into details like, was this terrorism. He did not mention Hamas, specifically. Instead, he said the United States is to blame. Why? Because the United States is monopolizing, as he put it, the Mideast peace process in general, excluding Russia from being part of that. And then Putin would argue, American diplomacy failed. So it's essentially America's fault.And if you can see the same kind of logic, if that's what you want to call her messaging, in what's happening in Ukraine, Putin also would say that the United States, the -- the West, are behind what's happening in Ukraine. And there are many other connections. You know, I just mentioned one, that you're hearing kind of the same messaging about the developing world, the Global South, this is something that back in the old Soviet days, the Soviet Union would took the side of revolutionary movements. And you could say, Hamas, Hezbollah, et cetera. Russia has better relations with them, even to this day. So Russia has now picked that up as a revived message, let's say and says, developing world, we're on your side, we're on the side, against the elites in the West, et cetera.

Plus, Russian warships were patrolling the Raptors.The Ukrainian say, they also managed to destroy Russian military gear before racing off across the Black Sea using larger boats to carry fuel for the jet skis on the long journey back to Ukrainian held territory. Musician says these missions are militarily essential. It helps our forces in the trenches, he says. We distract the enemy's attention towards us and the enemy is forced to relocate their personnel and vehicles to the Crimean seaside. Ukraine has started a major campaign against Russian military targets in and around Crimea, hitting the HQ of Moscow's Black Sea Fleet, damaging a submarine and a Russian landing ship as well as hitting an airbase. The Ukrainians use drones and cruise missiles for some of the attacks but rely on a network of undercover partisan groups inside Crimea for information and targeting. One of the groups agreed to answer our questions, but only in writing for security reasons. We constantly monitor all military facilities on the territory of the Crimean Autonomous Region with the help of our agents and residents of Crimea, who constantly inform us the ATESH Group, writes. A wide and developed system of agents allows you to make a choice. One of the key targets Ukraine has hit several times, the Kerch Bridge linking occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland.
