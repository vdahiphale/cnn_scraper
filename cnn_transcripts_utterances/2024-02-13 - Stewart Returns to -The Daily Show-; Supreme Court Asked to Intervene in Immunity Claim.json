The footage of the person who couldn't remember basic facts, who couldn't answer questions under questioning was not Joe Biden, it was Donald Trump. And so I think moving forward, what Democrats need to do is to kind of show the ridiculousness of what Republicans are trying to do. Their fecklessness, there un-seriousness of trying to govern, and where they go when they absolutely have no substance, they have no issues with which to offer the American people. And I think, you know, everyone thinks that Hur coming to testify is going to be not something positive for Joe Biden, and certainly Republicans are going to try to make it so, but he's also going to be facing Democrats in that questioning. And Democratic senators or Democratic members of the House who understand what actually is going on and how Hur overreach, and they're going to be able to really show that Republicans, especially in the House, are desperate to weaponize something like this report because they absolutely have zero to offer the American people and the debacle within the Republican Party that they show themselves just how unserious they are as a party every single day is something that Democrats are going to be able to use to show in this election that Republicans do not deserve any kind of power because they don't know how to govern.

The courts are looking at whether their relationships started way before they admitted in paperwork and questions over a home that may have been paid -- may or may not have been paid for with public funds that -- where they were meeting.

Let's break that apart.I think more practical, if -- if one of the prosecutors, you know, ultimately had a relationship with Ms. Willis, and that predates his assignment to the case, and that $650,000 that Wade made, then that's a concern because the argument would be that before there was this relationship existing, a pre-existing situation, and all those monies that he made, ultimately, some of that came back to ADA Willis -- DA Willis, pardon me, and could have influenced her decision making in the case. His argument is, no, I was brought on beforehand and this relationship evolved over time. So, inappropriate, potentially is their argument, but in terms of something that would have her removed from the case, her argument is no, but it certainly raises red flags.
