He'll hold a solo news conference but this time, the stakes couldn't be higher, as calls for Mr. Biden to step aside are growing louder, and the political ground beneath him appears to be shifting. Campaign funds are starting to dry up. Big-name donors are calling for the president to exit the race, and more Democratic lawmakers are coming out in support of finding another candidate.

We've got all the angles of the story covered for you today. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty, as well as Natasha Bertrand, join us now live in Washington on this very important day.

We have seen a number of defections over the course of the last two weeks since that debate performance. And their sense on Capitol Hill is that if he doesn't perform well tonight, that that potentially would only grow, and that many members are waiting for the end of this press conference, waiting for the end of the NATO, to potentially come out and say one way or the other if they're with him or against him. Now, at this hour, as you noted, top Democrats on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats, are meeting with White House aides. This comes at the invitation of the Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, who wants to assure members that Biden is the nominee. That's why he invited these White House aides up there. But we know that Schumer himself has expressed some reservations. He has stood by Joe Biden publicly but that certainly is the tone right now on Capitol Hill as he faces this very important press conference later today.",

But Jeffries himself, he has stood by Biden publicly. He has said that he's with Joe Biden. It hasn't been a full-throated defense, though, and not notable. And we know that right now he is gathering information from his members. And he says, according to two sources, that he will take those concerns to the White House, to President Biden. So, I expect that we'll hear more potentially about his strategy, when that potentially would happen. But he has tried very hard to remain in listening mode. His opinion matters so much here. He would be potentially, if the Democrats take control of the House, the next speaker of the House. So, he has a lot at stake and he's hearing from his members that are in vulnerable districts that they worry that if Biden stays on the ticket, that they would lose that chance to win back control of the House.

So, even if it goes very well for Biden, I don't think it really changes the underlying political equation here. But if there is a repeat of the version of the president that people and lawmakers saw at that debate, if he looks confused, incoherent, if he looks very old and not up to the job, I think that will just redouble the panic that is unfolding on Capitol Hill about his election prospects. So, in your piece on CNN.com, you say three factors could make his position untenable, a fracturing of his support in his party, the drying up of fundraising and damning polling data. And you also say that as Biden greeted world leaders at the NATO summit, pieces were falling into place that could make this fateful trifecta a reality.

He understands politics and the realities of running for election. Perhaps at that point, something could happen that would change his mind. But I'm not sure that there's going to be one big issue.

He's not done that so far. He's done an interview. He'll do this news conference. He'll do another interview. But it's far short of what people want to see.

There is a growing perception that Donald Trump could not just win the White House, but he could lead Republicans to keep the House, recapture the Senate at the same time when there is a very radical conservative Supreme Court, which is actively reshaping the fabric of American life. That is an absolute nightmare scenario for Democrats. And that's why some of them think that it's time to change the ticket, that they're heading towards a disaster, a potential Trump landslide, and it's not too late to fix it, even though it would be very difficult.

Donald Trump will take center stage again. He will name his vice presidential nominee.
