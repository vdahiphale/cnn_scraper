The problem is this section has actually never been applied to a candidate for president and, in fact, it's only been applied a couple of times since the 1800s. Also recently, several judges in Michigan, New Hampshire and Minnesota, they've rejected similar lawsuits by groups who have tried to take Trump's name off the ballot there. In those cases, the judges have said, you know, it's either too early to decide that in the election cycle, or in one case, they ruled it was really a political question that needed to be decided by Congress and not the courts.

The judge actually said, he believes it will take double that, but let's just use four months. That means we'll be on trial August, September, October and through November during the election.And keep in mind, because this is a criminal trial, Donald Trump has to be physically present. So, what the D.A. is proposing to do is to physically remove Donald Trump from the campaign trail, from the convention, through the election. I don't see any realistic way the state judge in Georgia allows that. And if he does, it's unprecedented, but it wouldn't shock me if the federal court stepped in and said, you simply cannot do this.

He only made them available for the media.So, now, Johnson is giving the right exactly what they want. And it comes, perhaps not so coincidentally, the same week that he angered his right flank after putting a clean stopgap spending bill on the House floor. But I want to read you part of the statement that Johnson released after this decision. He said, this decision will provide millions of Americans, criminal defendants, public interest organizations and the media an ability to see for themselves what happened that day, rather than having to rely upon the interpretation of a small group of government officials. And, unsurprisingly, Trump supporters are cheering this move. They believe it will somehow vindicate the former president and his role on that day. But as a reminder here, the DOJ has said that he has charged over 1,000 individuals with illegally breaching the Capitol on January 6th.

We got Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert and others out there calling people who have been convicted by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of having assaulted police officers, hospitalizing officers, bloodying police officers, breaking their noses, breaking their ribs and so on, calling these people political prisoners, or even these days, they're calling them hostages, if you can believe that. And then Mike Johnson says he's releasing this for criminal defendants. It's hard to think of a message more antithetical to law enforcement and certainly the Capitol Police who have been telling us not to do precisely what he and another Republican speaker did in sharing this information with Tucker Carlson or trying to put it into the hands of the right wing.
