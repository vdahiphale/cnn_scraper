CNN profiled the story Karela Jacinto as part of CNN's \"FREEDOM PROJECT,\" which seeks to raise awareness about modern-day slavery. Jacinto says she's very careful about who she gives her testimony to, and how and when she does it. So she was very surprised, Brianna, she told me when she found out Saturday that she was involuntarily put in the middle of a social media storm. This storm was prompted by what appears to be the use of her story, we heard that before, during the Republican response to the State of the Union address by Alabama Senator Katie Britt. Years ago, Karla Jacinto told me that when she first went public with her story, Mexican politicians took advantage of her for political purposes. I asked her if she feels it has happened again, but now here in the United States, and this is what she told me when I reached her in Mexico City. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARLA JACINTO, SEX-TRAFFICKING VICTIM (through translation): Yes. In fact, I hardly ever cooperate with politicians because it seems to me that they only want an image. They only want a photo. And that, to me, is not fair. I work as a spokesperson for many victims who have no voice. And I really would like them to be empathetic. And I think she should first take into account what really happened before telling a story of that magnitude. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Two, she also said she was never trafficked in the United States as Senator Britt appeared to suggest. Three, she was kept in captivity from 2004 to 2008 when President George W. Bush, a Republican, was in office, as opposed to the current administration as the Senator implied. And finally, four, she met the Senator at an event at the border with other government officials and anti-human-trafficking activists, instead of one on one. Jacinto told me Brianna, finally, no one reached out to her to ask for her permission to use her story as part of a political speech. \"Someone using my story,\" she said, \"and distorting it for political purposes is not fair at all\" -- Brianna?",

I think that's not exactly true. I think all of those involved in the writing of the speech, I think that could have been buttoned up a lot more and really done a better job of outlining the timeline of when she talked to this woman and when this actually happened. But to make a direct allegation or claim that this is the result of Joe Biden when this happened years ago really takes away from the issue at hand. And I think it was an unforced error on the part of this speech. And we're talking about that instead of the real issue at hand, which is the larger implications and consequences of Biden's border policies. Not just at the border, but we're seeing it as immigrants are sent to other cities, in New York and Chicago and Denver. And this is -- we're not hearing just Republicans, but Democratic leaders in various cities and states saying enough is enough. Biden sat by and did nothing about this for three years. Now, Democrats are pushing back, saying it's time to address this border crisis. And now we're in an election cycle and he's actually deciding to do something about it.",

They're looking at the fact we had a young female Senator responding to an old male president that is very unpopular and has a real fight on his hands going against Donald Trump in November. That is what they're talking about. And they're listening to the key points that she made with regard to him and his liberal policies and the impact that has had on a moms and women and families across this country with hurting the economy, national security, our border, education and crime on the streets.

Some health care providers are even considering taking out loans in order to keep operating. The details in just moments. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [14:48:50] KEILAR: New today, the federal government taking the extraordinary step of urging insurance companies to make advanced payments to health care providers. This, following a massive cyberattack that disrupted the insurance processing system. Change Healthcare, which is part of United Healthcare, was targeted by the attack that left U.S. hospitals and pharmacies unable to process bills. One health care provider telling CNN they're hemorrhaging money because their invoices aren't being processed. To give you a sense of just how big this company is, they process 15 billion transactions each year, not $15 billion in transactions, 15 billion transactions. We have CNN cybersecurity reporter, Sean Lyngaas, here with more on this. Is this even close to being fixed?",

They're going to be targeted because they have a lot of money and cyber criminals know to go after the big guys to extort them. So there's no shortage of warning signs in terms of recent years and cyberattacks on the health sector. I've talked about hospitals getting hit. But this is different because it's the central nervous system of the payment of health insurance. So when that goes down, one in three, patients in the us, in terms of how they get their prescriptions, has been affected so or potentially affected. That's a huge one.",

The good news is that experts, they don't think that we're going to see a skyrocketing price of gasoline this spring or summer, not going to see a repeat of the unprecedented spikes above $5 a gallon that we saw two years ago.One of the big reasons for that cautious optimism is the fact that the United States is pumping more oil than any country ever has before. And all that U.S. supply, that is offsetting some of the production cuts out of OPEC. Now, of course, there's always risks out there. If the war in the Middle East really spreads out, if there's a major hurricane that hits U.S. gulf coast refineries, all bets are off. Still though, GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan, he tells me that he is still confident that the U.S. will not have $4 a gallon gas nationally for the entire year.
