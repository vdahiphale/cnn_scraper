Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONEN NEUTRA, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE OMER NEUTRA: We are just hoping that he is doing everything it can. The situation is dire. It is urgent. We've seen him putting all kinds of hurdles. We know the Israeli people are going out in large numbers and calling the government to do what their job is, to bring the hostages home, 101 hostages left and they are dying there and every day is a huge risk for each one of them. So we urge him to do what he is tasked to do in Israel, but just as well, we are calling on our leaders here in the United States to do what they are tasked to do. We are calling on President Biden, on Vice President Harris to do everything in their power to reach a deal and bring the hostages back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He asked the prime minister, said have another Cabinet session, make another vote on this.This is the point that -- it is where Israeli troops are along the border between Gaza and Egypt, that appears to be one of the major stumbling points in the negotiations and he believes that the prime minister is micromanaging mismanaging by directing where the troops should be. Now the prime minister did agree to reduce the number of troops that it is having any troops there that is a blocking point for Hamas. So what we've heard from them defense minister today, and let's not just forget what is going on here. This is the prime minister and his defense minister arguing over a fundamental part of what and how the country should be run and how decisions should be made. When the country is at war where else would the defense minister be calling out the prime minister? The country is still at war with Hamas, threatened by Hezbollah to the north, threatened by Iran further to the east in the region, so let's not underestimate whatever is being said. The actual nature of what is happening at the moment, these deep, deep divisions in government manifesting by the people's voices and actions in the streets here as well.",

I think from my own experience, negotiations succeed only when you have two liters, two parties that feel a sense of real urgency and it seems to me, despite what I would consider to be critical urgency to redeem the hostages, yes, to make sure October 7th does not happen again, but the Israeli government has a longstanding, had a commitment to redeem both Israelis alive and dead on the battlefield.As far as Hamas is concerned, it does raise critically important questions about Sinwar's motives here. He spent 20 plus years in Israeli prisons. He speaks fluent Hebrew. He knows precisely how the issue of live and dead Israelis play in Israeli politics. It seems evident to me that if Sinwar was actually interested in a deal, he wouldn't have issued orders that approach any idea of forces, these hostages would be executed, including as we know, one -- tragically one, particularly for Americans, one American. As far as Mr. Netanyahu is concerned, I think you've got an unprecedented situation in Israel, an open riff between Yoav Gallant accusing the prime minister, abdicating his responsibilities morally. They've argued, the IDF has argued you could always return to the Philadelphi Corridor, you do not have to occupy them physically, but again, with Benjamin Netanyahu, reorganizing principle is rule, is retaining power. And again, I think, we will wait to see. Histadrut is going to come out with the trade unions tomorrow with a big strike, 800,000 affected workers. And this has been happening since 2023 when Benjamin Netanyahu fired Gallant for statements that he had made. So again, I think it is a pressure point, but I am not sure how it is going to play out with respect to advancing these negotiations.",

As grotesque and as savage an organization as Hamas is, the government of Israel, the IDF, the Biden administration has made a calculation that the only way on it is, the only way to de- escalate the war is through an agreement with a terror organization.And once you buy into that as the only way to go forward, then in effect, it is up to Netanyahu and Sinwar to do what is necessary to close this. And Alex, you know, that even if they agree to a phase one deal, we are talking about a limited exchange of hostages for large numbers of Palestinian prisoners and a six-week ceasefire Hamas is going to continue to hold the male hostages until they get what they want, which is a permanent cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. And it seems to me under no circumstances given what we are watching play out, particularly with the Israelis -- IDF discovered yesterday that any Israeli government is going to agree to those terms. So it would be great to get six weeks, maybe you can build on it right now, time is a cruel adversary to the hostages, their families, and to largely civilian population of Gaza and it is an ally, I am afraid to Yahya Sinwar and Benjamin Netanyahu.",

The police just moved in here with a water cannon. They didn't use the water cannon on people. There was a big fire in the highway right behind me.That is the police water cannon going through. Big fire, trees down on the highway. The police moved in to put that fire out. There is also police on horseback here. They are not engaging violently with the crowd, but they are moving through here in a really determined way to put out the fire and I am just going to ask Pete to join me here, ask these gentlemen to clear out the way so we can maybe get a better shot there at what is going on. Pete, if you look here, I am just going to swing over the barrier, get in the road, Pete is going to come over the barrier with me now. So we are in the highway now. Now, you can get a better picture, Alex, of what is happening here. This is the police water truck. It is clearing off the fire in the highway. It looks like, and if you can turn around a little here, just to paint the whole scene. So you've got police on horseback, motorbike. Police on horseback here, keeping this big crowd just on the hillside, keeping them back, and I will just have Pete swing around with me this way as well. You could see up the street there, the crowd who just moved out of the way when they saw the cameraman. The crowd is still on the street. The police are trying to clear them away. So what you're looking at here really is a crowd control with fires here that have been burning out. We are just moving away to get a little bit away from the sound. Just going to step out in the road a little bit here, Alex, so that you can see what is going on. You have the police up here. This is, as you can see, you're joining us in a very active, very mobile bit of this demonstration. The demonstration was in the center of the city. It was around the main Defense building. It is all about convincing the prime minister to do a deal on the hostages, but here you have a line of police vehicles, policemen on this side of the road over here, and here you have the crowds. So it is moving. A few minutes ago, the focus was down the road there where we were a hundred meters away, a hundred yards away. Now, the crowd is here. It is not a violent situation at all. There is not violence down here, but it is a real sense of people as we were speaking about before, want to use this moment, this moment to find a way to communicate with the prime minister that they really want to see change. And the way that they are trying to communicate that at the moment is by shutting the highway. We've seen them try to shut the highway. And when I say highway, this is the main highway that swings north-south in Tel Aviv. The road is clear, but there is no traffic on it at the moment, so it is not really open to the crowd, is trying to make it clear, trying to make their protests clear, and trying to get themselves heard by the prime minister -- Alex.",

They have been singing songs about how the hostages are stuck in tunnels under Gaza that they want to get them back home again.It is joyous is the wrong word, but it is not angry per se, but it is persistent. This crowd is persistently remaining on the highway tonight. They moved off from outside the big defense headquarters about a mile or so away, came down to the highway. So I'll just spin around and ask Pete here to turn around the blue flashing lights. You can see here these are some of the police vehicles that are waiting. The big white truck was pulling away down the street there. That's the police water cannon vehicle. Now that is pulling away. You can see a few police officers on horseback hear. But it is a pretty relaxed environment at the moment here and that really is because the police are not in the business right now of confronting the protesters, really just sort of containing the situation. It does mean that this main highway through Tel Aviv this evening is closed, at least in this direction. That's the north, that's the south -- that's the north, sorry, I've been turned around a few times. So, that's the north in that direction, so they are trying to get north around Tel Aviv. It is going to be tough to do it tonight. Again, they are continuing, sometimes they are lighting fires here at the moment to kind of draw attention to themselves. But the vast number, the numbers that we heard before from the organizers, potentially as many as 300,000 people in the protests throughout the city. We couldn't verify those numbers, but they were certainly big. It is a much smaller number that's gathered down here. I would say perhaps just a few hundred down on the highway. I don't know, Pete, maybe you can turn the camera around take a look up on the bridge there. There are plenty of people -- there are plenty of people here that are here, watching what is happening. There was a lady on a megaphone that we heard speaking before and she was directing people this way, go this way, she was saying. This is the way to go change your country. Go this way. Go this way. So everyone wants to see what is going on. They want to change the course of the country. Again, this is a feeling that the country is on a cusp, but they've been here so many times before. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a political survivor. It was very telling that his statement today was relatively short. It wasn't live, it was recorded. There was no opportunity for anyone to ask him questions. So, it is still at the moment at a stage of public polite, peaceful protests. Tomorrow things may get a little different when some of the unions may go on strike, when the municipalities and cities like Tel Aviv go on strike, hitting the facilities that people rely on in their cities. So how deep do those potential strikes affect the country? How deeply do they affect the country, that could have -- that could contribute to how the prime minister handles the current situation and whether or not he has to change his position -- Alex.",

At that Pennsylvania stop, she is going to be joined by President Joe Biden, her boss, who will be making a rare campaign appearance in Pittsburgh. That is in the western part of the state and that state is a critical must-win for both the Harris and the Trump campaigns. Now, we have a new poll out today that gives us a bit of a snapshot of where this race stands with just 65 days to go until Election Day. This comes from ABC News-Washington Post, and IPSOS and you can see there that it has Harris leading Trump 50 percent to 46 percent among registered voters. Now that is very close, but it is outside the margin of error, so it does give Harris a bit of a lead. With me now to discuss more about the race for the White House is Domenico Montanaro.

National polls, obviously don't tell you a whole lot about what is going to be happening in the states, because obviously, the Big Seven states that we are all watching are where this really matters. But what we've seen is that Harris has picked up anywhere from about four to six points on average in those swing states where she now has a narrow, but consistent lead in the blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, particularly in Wisconsin, seems to be doing fairly well, especially because of her advantages with women. In the Sun Belt States out west, Arizona and Nevada as well as in the east, North Carolina and Georgia, she has now made the race essentially an even tie.

Harris has some deficiencies when it comes to White working class voters, people who Biden has done well with. He has a much longer history, for example, with union voters, with labor who have very deep ties to Biden and deep support and respect for him, and Harris can certainly we use that. The campaign from what I understand is going to really try to target where and how they use Biden. Certainly, Pennsylvania is going to be a huge key. We heard Biden say himself that he has already reached out to Josh Shapiro after he didn't become the VP to say, hey, buddy, you and me, we are going to campaign throughout the state, so we will see. I think that that is actually what we are going to see. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, shocking, the blue wall if they're able to hold all three of those, Harris probably wins the election.",

And that is why they are on the streets here tonight.Since you were last down here with us on the highway, the main highway runs north-south through Tel Aviv, people have let another fire here. This is still a peaceful protest. The police away off down the street on horseback. They've got a water cannon truck there to put out fires. But people here are singing. The placards again are the ones that we've seen all evening, over the previous weekends, demanding that the prime minister make a deal and do a deal now to get the hostages home. There is immense anger and frustration that these six hostages died. The sense is that it was needless, that prime minister could have cut a deal if he was more flexible in his negotiations and this is what the crowd wanted, gather here today on the streets outside the Defense Ministry buildings earlier on. Now, down here on the highway so they are heard, and why do they feel that they need to do this? Because the prime minister they feel ignores them. About two-thirds of the country support a deal to get the hostages, the remaining 60 or so who are still believed to be alive and the others, north of 30 or so believed to be dead, to get them returned. It is a message that they have been trying to communicate with the prime minister that he resists and his Cabinet is still backing him on his decisions. So, they are taking to the streets, tomorrow in Tel Aviv, the municipality here would be going on strike, so do the big unions across the country will be going on strike. These are the instruments on the streets here, these are the instruments that people in a democracy have to show their dissatisfaction. And they are being shown in a very peaceful way, and the police really seem to understand that. If you sort of look, some up here -- look down the street, still people, and this is what it is about. It is about the hostages, it is about the women, about the girls. This first phase of the peace deal was supposed to see 33 people release. It would have been the elderly, the very young, the sick and all the women and there have been videos of these young women being beaten or brutalized by Hamas on October 7th and that's why people are here, they just want their message to be heard and acted upon -- Alex.",
