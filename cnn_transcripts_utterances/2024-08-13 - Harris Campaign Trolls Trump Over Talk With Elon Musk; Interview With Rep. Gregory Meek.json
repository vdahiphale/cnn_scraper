I think that's his most appropriate or accurate response, because he can't seem to get his forces together and really bring force on the ground against -- when Ukrainians went in, they went in with electronic warfare, they went in with drones, they went in with a really well- conceived plan of protection. So it's not just the troops on the ground. It's the combined arms, the combat multipliers that they brought in that have enabled them to be so successful and that are frustrating Russian efforts to stop this.",

But, Wolf, our allied governments have to support Ukraine in this. TheUnited States is not supporting, and the new British government has just denied the Ukrainians the right to use the long-range Storm Shadow missiles. So they're opening up the Ukrainians to less-than- optimal results on this. If we want a peace in the region, we have got to follow what President Zelenskyy is saying. This is the most direct path to put the pressure on Putin to call off the aggression, pull back, and resolve this issue. This is much more effective, as of right now, and if it will be fully supported, then another renewed assault to try to bust through to Crimea. This is a moment of time, of opportunity. But if the United States and Britain don't provide the assets to reinforce this, then it's not going to have the desired effect.",

But the United States has to find a way through this, because the alternative is a stalemate that isn't a stalemate. Some kind of a freeze in place would simply result in Russian rearmament and a quick restart of the conquest of Ukraine. So, this is, it seems to me, an opportunistic way to bring Russia to the negotiating table if we put the combat power that we have made available to Ukraine, let them use it in this to go after exactly what President Zelenskyy said, the manufacturing, the launchpads, where they take it from, and keep Russian forces at bay, take away their own offensive striking power, and this way bring Russia to the negotiating table.",

So I'm hoping that Israel and Hamas both come and they have a negotiation. I think that the president's agreement, cease-fire is in place, something that I think that all sides had agreed upon. The devil is in the details and the implementation of it. So I believe that, if we can get a deal done there, then it would make sense for all sides to say, stop the violence and the war, so that the Middle East does not blow up, causing thousands of deaths on all sides. And that's what we are focused on preventing. So I hope that we do the cease-fire and let diplomacy work. BLITZER:  A far right high-ranking member of the Israeli cabinet made another provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, the mosque built on the Temple Mount. The visit comes on the day that Jews commemorate the destruction of the temple, Tisha B'Av, this Jewish commemorative day. It's a fast day for a lot of Jews. Hamas condemned the visit, as did families of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Do you believe Israel wants a cease-fire?",

They will talk together about why it's not being -- going forward. I met with the families of the hostages when they were in Washington, D.C. I, like them, desperately want those loved ones home and a cease-fire. And so I would hope that all parties get to the negotiating table. Let's get this deal done. Let's try to de-escalate what's taking place and then hopefully move toward a two-state solution, so that there can be peace in the area. Wolf, I have a problem with the number of the innocents that are dying. And it seems to me, if we don't get to a cease-fire, no -- I want to get rid of Hamas. I don't want Hamas to be governing. But what's happening is, if we continue the way we're going, Hamas will rejuvenate itself by getting new members. As you kill some, you will get new that will automatically join. That's not the way to peace in the Middle East.",

I hope no one tries to put any new conditions to this, and let's stick with the basic principles of -- the cease-fire agreement is, so that we can move in a rapidly -- in a rapid form. That is the way I believe that we will stop innocent lives from being lost and we will see individuals -- because individuals, Wolf, in the streets of Israel are all asking for peace. Individuals here, around the world is asking for a cease-fire. And I think that's the way to go. So I'm hopeful that all sides get there, something is negotiated, and we can de-escalate what's taking place in the Middle East right now.",

And it's smart in a lot of ways, because it allows him to go directly to voters. And no offense to all of us who are on CNN and a lot of other networks, but he doesn't have to have anything filtered to connect with voters. He's able to do it directly. I think it was actually a really smart idea. It contrasts also sharply with looking at Kamala Harris' schedule, I mean, the fact that here we are three weeks in to being the nominee of her party, and she still hasn't sat down for a single interview, answered a single question about why she's trying to flip-flop on some of these radically left- wing positions that she's held in the past. And I will just comment real quickly on that clip you played, Wolf, because I served the State Department. I'm actually in Vienna right now as part of the E.U.-U.S. forum. We were just with Ric Grenell for an event, Ambassador Grenell. And he brought up something in the discussion we had actually that was very interesting. He said, the important thing is to be able to not just have a threat, but a credible threat. And so when Donald Trump is saying, I would say way, not no way, that's a way of backing up words with deeds with foreign leaders. And that's the reason you saw didn't see Vladimir Putin rolling into Ukraine or a lot of the other types of activity that he's taken since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been in charge.",

You had 73 million impressions.In fact, there were about 1.3 million people who tuned in to watch it, which was the size of maybe a White Dudes for Kamala call on zoom. There may be more to pick it up or watch on YouTube as we go throughout the day. And that's fine. But what you heard last night and why many Democrats are just very thrilled every time Donald Trump opens his mouth is this kind of lispy, old, rambling off-kilter speech that Donald Trump gives. It's no reassurances to anyone that he's going to be able to home in a message on Kamala Harris, which they haven't been able to do, or, two, actually and effectively lead the country at 78 years old. Whether or not he's hovering over a phone or whether or not he is rambling in Montana, he still is 78 years old and will be the oldest person to ever be president of the United States of America. In fact, I want to recall something that Elon Musk actually posted on X when he was supporting Ron DeSantis. He questioned whether or not an executive could be 82 years old. And just to compare the schedules briefly, this is the second time that Donald Trump has come down to his lobby and performed this duty of either a press conference or talking to Elon Musk. But Kamala Harris has actually gone to voters and she's gone out on the campaign trail. We have actually covered it here. Every major news outlet has covered her speeches and getting thousands and tens of thousands of people. I think Donald Trump has been to one place outside of his lobby at Mar-a-Lago, and that was Montana. And so we can contrast the energy, we can contrast the style, but, right now, one campaign is going upwards, and the other one is plateauing. And I'd rather be the campaign going up than plateauing any day of the week.",
