I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you live from New York.Today on the program, I bring you interviews with Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and with the former British prime minister, Tony Blair. We'll skip the take this week. There are simply too much breaking news. We'll get straight to it. The crisis in the Middle East, it is in unchartered territory. On Friday, Israel killed longtime Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in a massive strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. The attack is part of a recent major escalation of Israeli air strikes against the Iranian proxy group in Lebanon. More than 1,000 people have been killed since the uptick last week, and hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have been displaced. The attack on Nasrallah was a triumph for Israeli intelligence, but it also raises many questions. Joining me now from Tel Aviv is Ronen Bergman, staff writer for \"The New York Times\" magazine. Ronen, welcome. You are fantastic at reporting on these kinds of issues. How did Israel's intelligence figure out when Nasrallah was -- explain this operation because it seems like they've been trying to do this for years. How did they succeed?",

But they were preparing for this moment. And this is a 15-years long operations to be deeply penetrating the inner circle of secrets of Hezbollah. And just to give an example, on October 10, the IDF brought a plan to kill Nasrallah in a bunker in Beirut.This was not executed because of American pressure for Mr. Netanyahu didn't want that, but Nasrallah has been moved to a much secure bunker later that year and the Israelis knew that he is there, that the whole ballroom was moved to that place and knew when he's going to come, when he's going to chair this meeting of the jihad council, not just he was killed but many of his lieutenants and Iranian generals were killed as well. The Israelis dropped 83 bombs, some of them bunker-busters in order to verify that everybody are dead.",

This is the war they've been planning as opposed to the Gaza one that took them by surprise. And what the Hezbollah seems to have miscalculated on, and I want to hear your thoughts on this, is that Israel was frustrated by this idea of having this -- you know, this low-grade war in the north where its people, 60,000 Israelis displaced, they couldn't get back.They already have a low-grade war in Gaza where they can't, you know, they're finding themselves mired. And so here what Israel decided was, we're going to do something very aggressive to break this dynamic and, you know, take advantage of all this intelligence we have. Does that -- is that a fundamental shift in Israeli thinking that they're willing now to take risks they were not?",

Pezeshkian often regarded as a moderate saved some of his harshest words for the U.S. saying the order for this terrorist attack was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve themselves of complicity with the Zionists.Well, I sat down with him in New York this week before the killing of Nasrallah. It was his first interview with Western media. I want to show you the interview because it really offers important insights into the mind of a man who is atop Iran's government. I want you to hear what he told me about Hezbollah's military capabilities. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MASOUD PEZESHKIAN, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Hezbollah alone cannot stand against the country that is armed to the teeth with all the capacities it has at its disposal. Now if there is a need Islamic countries must convene a meeting in order to formulate a reaction to what is occurring. What can Hezbollah do alone? The Islamic and regional countries must first sit together. And we must not allow Israel to create another Gaza in Lebanon. This will not come from Hezbollah's hands alone. Hezbollah cannot stand alone against a country that is being backed by the United States and the Europeans.",

We wish to communicate to the world that we are not seeking nuclear weapons. America is lying that we are doing such a thing. America is pumping out incorrect information about us to the world. We accepted the JCPOA and were adhering to it. If we were seeking the nuclear bombs that they tell the world we seek we would not have accepted the JCPOA. If the United States of America is seeking peace in the region, we seek peace. We have no eyes on any other people's territory. Iran has never invaded any other country. Look at the past two centuries in history. We are not seeking to invade any other country. If we produce weapons, if we produce missiles, it is to defend ourselves. When Iraq's Saddam Hussein attacked us, and was raining down missiles, and chemical bombs on our cities, the Americans and the European countries were all defending them. We were defenseless, but we reached the conclusion that we must be able to defend ourselves. Now, I understand that on this planet earth, in this vast galaxy in which we exist, we are meaningless. It really is not worth it for humans in this very brief journey to tear each other apart. Man is above this. If we understood this, we wouldn't be tearing each other apart. We would help one another.

Her death sparked months of protests, which the government responded to with violence killing more than 500 people.When my guests, Masoud Pezeshkian, ran for president this year, one of his campaign platforms was a pledge to stop the harassment of women by the morality police. That put him at odds with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran, who has said that removing the head covering is forbidden. More now with President Pezeshkian.

So I want to understand because a lot of what they would bother people about in Iran is they would bother women who were not wearing a complete veil or chador.Are you saying that women in Iran are permitted now to not cover their head completely? PEZESHKIAN (through translator): Without respecting or disrespecting this job, you do know that any change takes time. The same way change would take a certain amount of time elsewhere. Behavior modification from both the side of the government or the ones operating outside of their norms, all of this naturally takes time. We must allow them the time to behave properly in an acceptable manner. Those who are displaying inappropriate behavior in the government or those who are members of the society at large and are confronting a set of beliefs and culture, what is of utmost importance to us is respect for people's cultures. That is a sign of development to us. Humans can do whatever they wish when they're by themselves.

In order for us to take out our frustrations on our citizens, on our people, it is our responsibility and duty to serve them diligently and sincerely. And we will not fall short to this effort. So, it doesn't matter. We must not even behave in such a way that would make people take to the streets. It is our actions and type of behavior that makes these events occur.

So, I judge everything and accept everything based on scientific evidence, on social science-based evidence. If we are to realize this fairness and justice, whether in our country, the region, or the world we need reforms. Meaning, we cannot keep behaving and talking and being in the same way while expecting changes in the society. There are certain rights being trampled upon in the land upon which we live.

So, this is -- the book is really an attempt to say whatever the circumstances there are certain clear lessons of leadership and governance that you can learn from looking at what's happening around the world. Now you're right. Today is a much, much tougher environment. But I think the lessons are still the same about how you lead, about having clarity of direction, about being prepared to do the things that are difficult, not necessarily popular, about assembling the right team around you.

And I will say about populists, they -- generally in my experience, they exploit a grievance, but they don't create it, right? The grievance is there. So, in my view unless you control immigration today, you're going have a big problem. But when it comes to protectionism, for example, or anti-globalization sentiment, fine, you can go down that path if you want but you're going to find the cost of living goes up. You'll find it's much harder for businesses to operate. And one clear economic lesson of history is the more countries close in on themselves the less prosperous they become. So, some of -- some of these things, I think, you have to say, OK, this is a new phenomenon. We have to deal with it. And that's different from the time that I was in office.
