Good morning, Kasie.And there certainly are some pretty clear signs that the Russians are also coming to terms with the fact that the Syrian Arab Republic under Bashar al Assad no longer exists. In fact, you can see right up there that above the Syrian embassy here in Moscow, as of this morning, flies the flag of the Syrian opposition. Of course, now, most probably, the official flag of Syria. We have asked the folks here at the embassy actually, and they say that this embassy continues to function and is functioning as normally. Meanwhile, we're also getting some information here from the Russians. The Kremlin this morning telling - on a conference call telling reporters that the decision to grant asylum to Bashar al-Assad and members of his family was made directly by Vladimir Putin. He directly signed off on this decision. Of course, we know that last night Assad and family members arrived here in Moscow. The Russians also admitting that they were taken by surprise how quickly the forces around Bashar al-Assad folded, how quickly that regime folded as the opposition forces were closing in on Damascus. And, of course, other cities inside Syria as well. The big question for the Russians right now, they were, of course, the biggest backers - or one of the biggest backers of the Assad government is what happens to their military assets inside of Syria. The Kremlin there also saying at this point in time, they simply don't know. They are saying that all of that will depend on what happens over the next couple of weeks, the next couple of months. The Russians are saying that they are in touch with all of the armed groups on the ground, they say. They do say that their forces on the ground are on high alert, but that right now the situation around their bases remains calm. Kasie.",

Among them, former Democratic congresswoman turned Republican commentator, Tulsi Gabbard, who sat down with then President Bashar al-Assad in a highly controversial 2017 meeting. She has also previously declined to say whether Assad is a war criminal. And now, of course, those positions have emerged as a key obstacle for Gabbard as she prepares for her Senate confirmation hearing.
