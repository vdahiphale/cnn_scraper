So, glad you guys are both here. I do want you both to weigh in on the answers that Nikki Haley keeps giving on Civil War and on racism in this country. There's a difference in saying America is not a racist country now and never was a racist country now. She also talked about her own personal experience with racism, Cari. Phil laid out so wonderfully last hour how it was -- you saw it, how it was built into the founding three fifths clause, the founding fathers being slave owners, presidents being slave owners. Why is this such a difficult question for her to answer?",

And it's also disappointing for me to hear her refer to herself as a brown girl who knows that when you tell children this is a racist country, they immediately feel some type of way. They feel inferior.So, this brown girl says, I like to know where I'm at and what I'm dealing with and I am aware of what I have to overcome. I grew up very well aware of the fact that this country was racist, the three fifths clause things in which we don't even teach in school right now, I had to learn on my own through my parents. And for me, that helped me, It helped me understand where we are. When Nikki does this, when she tries to do this erasing of history, because that's what it sounds like to me, erasure, it's so disrespectful to my ancestors, it's disrespectful to the people who helped build this country, for her to say that it didn't happen or that she doesn't want to believe it happened. Now, what if, in fact, she does become president? Let's just fast forward, right? Let's just play the what if game. What if she does become president and she says this is where she goes, and she touts that this is not a racist country, someone is going to believe that. And then all of this history that we have, this complicated history with this beautiful country that we love, goes away for a percentage of people who look just like me, who say, well, that's not fair, that's just not true. You can't change history. And it's so disappointing. And I don't know if she's trying to get along with people. I don't know if she's trying to speak to people. In fact, I do. I know she's trying to win some people over who are in the middle, but she's being completely disrespectful to an entire group. RICH LOWRY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, NATIONAL REVIEW:  Yes, I think there's an implied fundamentally, when she says it was never a racist country, it's never fundamentally a racist country. And a lot depends. Are you going to judge the founding by 21st century standards or by 18th century standards? Because the founding generation, unfortunately, did not invent racism, they did not invent slavery, which were persistent throughout all of human history. And the great advantage and benefit of the founding was they advanced these ideals that eventually eroded the legal racist regime in this country were a great tool for Martin Luther King and others. And she's not saying we're perfect. I mean, she says she experienced racism herself, but the idea she said last night used the term self-loathing. So, I think there are a lot of people who -- the history is complicated, that's absolutely right, but want to erase the complication on the other end and say, oh, it was all about racism. That's all this country has ever been about, and that's false and a lie.",

Yes, we do have immunity in our courts, in civil cases, we don't know about criminal cases. We may learn as a result of this. But the problem is it doesn't apply to anything that a president does. It has to apply to something within the scope of the job.He gave the examples of Obama or Biden ordering a military strike, for example, or a border policy. Those are obviously within the scope of what you do as president. Therefore you would have civil immunity, maybe criminal immunity. The things Donald Trump is charged with, the question is, are they inside or outside that scope? Prosecutors say they're outside the scope. You cannot be covered for something outside the scope or else that would lead to, to coin a phrase, chaos and bedlam.",

      "sentences": "50 pages, we're going to tick through it in a couple of minutes. Donald Trump, this is the 14th Amendment case, trying to get him restored to the ballot in Colorado.Trump's team makes five primary legal arguments. First, they argue that the president does not count as an officer of the United States. You may think, how could that possibly be? If you look at the 14th Amendment, it lists certain offices, senator, representative, elector of president, not president, not the president, Trump's team is saying, but the other side's going to say, well, it also says hold any office under the United States. There's textual arguments both ways on that. Argument two that Trump makes is, there was no insurrection, I did not engage in insurrection. That's really a factual question. Trump says, I've not been charged criminally with insurrection. That goes a certain distance, but that doesn't answer the question. He has not been charged by Jack Smith with insurrection. Supreme Court is not going to touch that. That's not for them. They don't make factual findings. The third argument Trump makes, and this one we've talked about before, and I think there's something to this. He argues it's not up to the states. Colorado doesn't get to decide whether it's qualified. Maine doesn't get to decide. It's up to Congress. And to that end, they cite Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, which says the Congress shall have the power to enforce by legislation the provisions of this article. So, the question is, is it up to Congress? That's what Trump says. Or can the states decide? That's what Colorado says. Okay, those are the top three, but there's two other sort of new ones that I found really interesting. There is one argument Trump says that the 14th Amendment says you cannot hold office, but I can still run for office. Now, when I first read that, I thought what the heck's the difference, right? If you can't hold office, how can you run? But here's the catch. The 14th Amendment actually says that Congress, by a two-thirds vote, can essentially undisqualify somebody. And so what Trump's argument is, is, well, I can run, there's a scenario where I run and win, and then Congress undisqualifies me, in which case I can't take office. I actually ran that by a friend of mine, who's a law professor, who wants Trump off the ballot. I said, what's your answer to that? He said, I don't know. I mean, we'll see when the other side files the brief. And then the final argument that Trump makes on the last side is something called the electors clause, which says if it is up to the states, the Constitution says it's actually up to the state legislatures. And Trump says this came from the courts, the Colorado Supreme Court. Therefore, even if it's up to the states, they did it wrong. So, there you go, 50 pages, five arguments, two minutes.",
