Israel Defense Forces have begun small operations into Lebanese territory to prepare for a ground incursion against Hezbollah, according to several sources. The incursion into Lebanon will be more limited than what was initially planned, according to U.S. officials. And here was President Biden's response.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They do believe it's imminent. This could happen in a matter of hours. This could easily happen today. And this really comes against the -- the -- the Biden administration's wishes. You heard the President there saying that he would be comfortable with them stopping these raids. So that really highlights the fact that the Biden administration is either unable or unwilling to -- to prevent Israel from carrying out this incursion into -- into Lebanon, which could, of course, threaten the broader region and really lead to significant escalation. I have been told that this that we saw -- we've seen the raids earlier today there. They're going to be expanding into a -- a broader but limited campaign. And -- and this comes, a U.S. official told me, after weekend discussions in which essentially the U.S. managed to talk Israel back and -- and -- and encourage them to do something that's more limited in scope. So what we should expect to see, according to the White House, is Israeli troops going across the border, taking out this Hezbollah infrastructure, and then coming back across the border in -- into Israel. The U.S. has really been seek -- seeking assurances that this would not look like the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, which was much bigger. It lasted for -- for more than 30 days. But American officials are quite clear right about this, afraid that it could ex -- it -- it could broaden out, both in terms of scale and time. And that's something they say that they continue to talk to the Israelis about.",

      "sentences": "Well, one of fear. Actually, many people are afraid that, despite what the Israelis are telling the Americans that this could be the beginning of a much broader invasion. To go back in history a little bit, back in 1982 then Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon told the Israeli cabinet, which -- which told the Americans, that Israel would launch a limited incursion into Lebanon.They ended up besieging Western Beirut. So people here remember what has happened in the past, and the fear is that the kind of destruction and massive displayment -- displacement, with over a million people being having to flee from their homes as a result of the bombing could really just be the beginning. The fear is that there -- if the Israelis make a sizable incursion, really push into the south, that you could have even more people heading elsewhere, similar to what we saw in 2006. This country is bankrupt. It simply is not capable of handling those kind of numbers. Now, as far as how is Hezbollah going to react, we don't know at this point. We did hear Naim Qassem, who is the, what, a senior deputy to the late Hassan Nasrallah, saying that -- that the Hezbollah has not collapsed, de -- despite the pain and the sacrifices, he said that they would continue to confront the Israelis in support of the Palestinian people and the people of Lebanon. And what we've seen in the past is that the forte of Hezbollah is guerrilla warfare in those very same mountains of Southern Lebanon, where they fought the Israelis until May of 2000 dry -- essentially driving them out of the country, and then again in 2006. So if the Israelis go beyond anything more than a limited incursion, it could become much more dangerous indeed. Boris, Brianna?",

      "sentences": "Yes. This really wasn't an embarrassing episode for the Biden administration, because they spent days hammering out this ceasefire deal that they announced on Wednesday. They said this will be a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah so they could start diplomatic conversations to -- to get to a -- a more permanent peace.And then very quickly, we heard Netanyahu coming out and saying that the IDF will continue fighting with its -- with its full might. What we're being told now from the U.S. side is that Israel had worked with the Israelis on this tech -- Israel had worked with the Americans on this text. They had -- they had agreed to it. They had, in fact, greenlit its announcement on Wednesday. And then overnight, the U.S. says they changed their mind because they saw this opportunity to go after Nasrallah, and so they essentially reneged on this ceasefire and continue with the military operation. That's not the case according to the Israelis. They say that this was an honest misunderstanding, that they had no intention of implementing this imminent ceasefire. So still quite a bit of disagreement, there still quite a bit of embarrassment, but American officials insist they're still very much focused on getting to a ceasefire so you can get to some quiet on that border.",

This is a picture here behind me of Lake Lure. I just -- I just can't stop watching it and looking at, you know, it looks like there are trees, but there's parts of homes. Just talk to a guy from Hendersonville. He had a seafood restaurant, and it doesn't exist anymore. It's completely gone.Fifty employees don't even have a building to go back to. And we're going to hear stories about this all the way through, all the way the Blue Ridge Parkway, all the way down even into parts of South Carolina and even into Georgia. When you get the numbers like this, 20 to 30 inches over just three days, that's the area that really got hit so hard. Now the water is trying to get down into the ocean. That's going to be another kind of a problem for the people that are down river from all of this water. Then here's the rainfall right now into parts of Virginia, into Maryland, some of the heaviest rainfall really will be one to two inches. We're not talking about a major rain event today, but when it's already falling on saturated ground, you don't need any more whatsoever. So we have three more storms out in the ocean, I, J, K, Isaac, Joyce, Kirk, and we have one more that we're watching here that could get into the Gulf of Mexico. That would be the L, the Leslie storm. Right now, the computers are not impressed, and that's good news, because when it gets in the Gulf of Mexico, the water's so warm, anything can happen, at least for right now, we don't see that type of development. But there's the next storm. It would be Leslie, let's hope not. Yes.",
