And one man in China risked it all by tweeting out videos of protests which the Chinese government didn't want the world to see. I'm Christina MacFarlane in London. Hello, and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. And we begin with Russian president Vladimir Putin saying more prisoner exchanges between Moscow and Washington are possible after U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner landed back in her home state of Texas just a few hours ago. She was swapped with convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout after spending 10 months jailed in Russia. Thursday's exchange did not include another American who the U.S. State Department says is being wrongfully detained in Russia, Paul Whelan. A short time ago the U.S. National Security Council's John Kirby sat down with my colleague Kaitlan Collins to talk about White House thinking on the Griner-Bout swap. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION: The deal really kind of came together in the last week or so, and it just became readily apparent to the president and the entire team that it was either make this exchange, get one back, and the only one that they were willing to trade was Brittney for Mr. Bout, or get none, and leave her there. And I can think we all would agree that not even one more day in a penal colony for Brittney was a good outcome, so the president made that tough decision and executed the deal.",

And we spoke with a senior administration official last night who explainedthat essentially it's in Russia's best interest to continue having these conversations because there are things simply that Russia wants and the United States has been clear in saying they're willing to entertain those asks in an effort to try and get Paul Whelan home. A commitment that President Biden and those folks around him in the national security space have made to Paul Whelan's family. It's important to note that yesterday the Secretary of State Tony Blinken said that every offer that they possibly could make to get Whelan home as part of this swap with Griner was made. But we're also learning from senior administration officials that that doesn't mean that they've essentially, you know, completely hit a dead end here. Maybe they are at a halt for the time being. But a senior administration official explained that they are looking at new things that they can offer to Russia. They are very clear eyed about the fact that they're going to have to offer something more. Something different to the Russians here. And of course this comes on the heels of President Putin saying that another swap is possible. So there is a sense that there is some momentum here perhaps or at least some goodwill on both sides because they both have things that they want.

The Russian president spoke off-the-cuff at an award ceremony for Russian soldiers. Champagne glass in hand, he claims the relentless assault on the Ukraine's ability to keep its power on and its people warm is Ukraine's own fault. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Right now there has been a lot of uproar about our attacks on the energy infrastructure of our neighboring country. Yes, we are doing it, but who started it? Who hit the Crimean Bridge? Who blew up the powerlines from the cursed nuclear power plant? Who isn't supplying water to Donetsk? Not supplying water to a city with more than a million people is an act of genocide. No one has ever said a word about that. Total silence.

It is ignoring the reality that it was Vladimir Putin who started this war more than nine months ago when he sent a convoy driving from the Belarussian border straight towards Kyiv, thinking somewhat -- who knows if he was deceived or if it was just ignorance or brash ego, but thinking that the Russian troops would be welcomed with open arms by the Ukrainians after the relatively easy and illegal annexation of Crimea back in 2014, which I was here to cover at that time. But this time around, even though the Ukrainians were not immediately prepared to fight off the Russians, they certainly have done so with incredible success on the battlefield, although at a great cost in terms of human life and suffering of people. And so with Russia losing on the battlefield, unable to regain any of the lost territory to the Ukrainians, the Ukrainians even launching counteroffensives, they have been striking the power grid in an attempt to demoralize the people of this nation who are now days away from the official start of winter with sub-zero temperatures, and an inability in some cases to heat their homes. which is why the government has set up tents that people can go to to get warm. They're doing the best they can to help people stay alive and stay out of the frigid temperatures, but these Russian strikes are certainly, you know, harming the situation. There was just one, you know, it seems almost like every couple of weeks, or even less than two weeks, the Russians are lobbing dozens of missiles directly at the power infrastructure that relies on Soviet-era parts that are not easy to replace. Certainly the United States can't send them over. Even though they can send generators, but generators don't solve the problem. And so they're even asking for other Soviet nations for help in getting power -- badly needed power repair supplies in. And yet there's Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin, holding up a champagne flute, blaming the bombing of the Crimean Bridge two months ago, which Russia used as an excuse to start this assault on the civilian power infrastructure, while not acknowledging the fact that all of this, this entire, unnecessary, brutal situation was caused by one person and that's him.",

People talking about that first 45 minutes in their last 16 games as the best 45 minutes they can remember in World Cup history. But Croatia are aside who have some experience. They have a coach who knows how to get his team to dig deep and make themselves tough to beat. And they have been giving Brazil a run for their money as things stand. Terrifying was actually the word that Zlatko Dalic had used to describe this Brazilian set up in the run up to this match because of their strength in depth and they're attacking force in particular. Neymar, of course, coming back from his injury, knowing that one more goal from him will see him equal that record, 17-7 goals for Brazil scored by Pele. But equally, Dalic said we have nothing to lose, and that is just what his side have been showing so far. Yes, they haven't scored many goals but equally, they haven't conceded any.

And despite the Dutch's best efforts in the likes of Virgil van Dijk to try to talk about the team they're not just playing Lionel Messi, they're playing the Argentinian team, it is impossible to look ahead to this match without talking about the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner who scored three goals in four games so far in this tournament. And like you rightly pointed out, everybody talking about the exit of Argentina from this competition, probably being the last time we see him in an Argentinian shirt. But equally on the other side, if Argentina win and it's the Netherlands go out it's likely to be the last time we see legendary coach Louis van Gaal on the touchline as well. 71 years of age, having won all that he's won in this game. He's come back here for a third stint in charge of the Netherlands, really wanting to make amends for that semifinal exit on penalties at the hands of Argentina in 2014. He's been enjoying this moment. We've seen him singing and dancing with the team as they've been back, getting back to the hotel after their victory over the USA.

This is not only an issue for Nigeria and the condemnation that they're receiving from the Nigerian public for these allegations of human rights violations. It's also an issue for the United States of America. Over the last two decades, Nigeria has been the recipient of hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. military assistance, of U.S. training. Also, they have been approved for U.S. armed sales. Any allegations of human rights violations causes great concerns in the United States because it would place the U.S. administration itself in violation of U.S. law, of the Leahy Act, which prohibits the United States to give military assistance to foreign governments accused of human rights violations. A year ago, when the judicial panel investigating what happened at Lekki toll gate found that CNN's investigation had actually been true, that the Nigerian authorities, that the Nigerian army was guilty of firing live fire into demonstrators protesting police brutality, we asked the U.S. State Department and they said that if this was true, that they would want the perpetrators held to account and that it would call into question U.S. military support. Two years later, nothing has happened. The question remains whether these latest allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Nigerian military will have an impact on the U.S.' support.

      "sentences": "When it comes to this fast, evolving and growing relationship between China and Saudi Arabia, it'sabout more than just oil, but at the same time, nothing matters more than oil because as the world's second largest economy and its biggest oil importer, China obviously needs reliable and diversified sources of energy especially at a time when Xi Jinping is trying to jumpstart a sluggish economy because of the impact of his Zero COVID policy, which is finally easing. So Saudi Arabia really plays a crucial role in this strategy. Now in recent years, Saudi oil had been the biggest source of China's foreign oil until early this year when Russia started flooding the global market with cheap oil after its invasion of Ukraine to counter Western sanctions. Now Saudi Arabia has since reclaimed the top spot. But they obviously very much want to keep it that way by ensuring that China remains its loyal big customer even when competitors are offering cheaper prices. And there are some geopolitical implications here as well, with reports saying both sides already talking about pricing some of the oil transactions in the Chinese currency. Now that could pose a challenge to the so-called petrol dollar system which is critical to the U.S. dollar's position as the global reserve currency. But that in a way very much speaks to Xi Jinping's desire to reshape a U.S.-led world order. And the Saudis are very much aware of that and they're trying to adapt to that, especially at a time when they seem to reconsider relying solely on the U.S. as a security guarantee with decreasing U.S. military presence in the region. So in their joint statement after the summit, the two flexed to deepen their cooperation and coordination in the field of defense, but even more notable was the language in earlier Chinese readout about a summit really highlighting Saudi's firm support for China's efforts to deradicalize its population and also it's firm opposition to outside interference in Chinese internal affairs in the name of human rights. All of that really thinly veiled references to China's policy on Xinjiang where Washington has accused Beijing of committing genocide against its Muslim minorities. That's something China has always denied, but having that kind of firm support by the world's preeminent Muslim power is very important for Xi Jinping, and something he could definitely use.
