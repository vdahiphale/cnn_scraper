She really doesn't care, do you? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news F you to America.

We'll be speaking to Ty in a moment. \"Axios\" tonight with a simple headline: Trump's middle finger, and that image. But this is a bipartisan disdain. Republicans and Democrats alike aghast at the announcement, which is clearly intended to mock the office of attorney general. Otherwise, how to explain nominating someone who has said this about the agency he has been selected to lead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Eric Schmitt would be a solid choice for AG. But Dem opinions on Gaetz aren't that interesting the good ones will come from my GOP colleagues to justify a vote for that -- and I'll just let you read it off the screen.

The entire team was expecting the backlash and that they don't care about what they are seeing.Now, essentially, this person said that Gaetz is perfectly positioned for what Donald Trump wants in an attorney general, somebody who he believes that being Donald Trump is an effective communicator who can go out there and put out the message that Donald Trump wants out there when it comes to the Department of Justice. And its something that Donald Trump said that he has seen Matt Gaetz do time and time again. You played some of the clips there talking about getting rid of the Department of Justice, talking about defunding the Department of Justice. All of this is a larger plan that Donald Trump has openly spoken about when it comes to how he wants the government to be run and part of that means a Department of Justice that operates completely at the behest of the president of the United States as part of the executive branch. So one of the jobs that he needed to fill and one of the most critical jobs in this administration, is an attorney general who will go along with those plans and Donald Trump, I'm told, met with a series of individuals over the last several days and was unimpressed that he made this decision almost last minute. It was today and wanted to go with somebody who he had seen pushing forward the same level of messaging that he wanted about the Department of Justice. And it's not just the messaging. You've said this. We know we've heard this from Donald Trump's allies as well. Matt Gaetz is the truest loyalist to the -- to what that term means. He has been nothing but next to the president every step of the way, whether it comes to the election in 2020. And now whether it comes to how he views the Department of Justice. At the end of the day, Donald Trump wants to get rid of the deep state. When he talks about the deep state, he is Department of Justice and using a lot of the messaging we've heard Matt Gaetz also use publicly when trying to talk about what their plans are for the Department of Justice moving forward.",

So this is a serious thing that they're doing. And in their minds, it doesn't really matter if the Democrats don't like this. What matters to them is that they have the votes in the Senate. Now, it should be pointed out that there is this sort of new procedure, a new move to allow for recess appointments, that John Thune now, the Senate Republican leader has basically agreed to, and Matt Gaetz was among those who helped sort of formulate that plan and policy with former President Trump to get Thune to do that.
