At least 11 people were killed and more than 20 were injured after Russia showered Kyiv and other major cities with an unprecedented 81 missiles. It is a clear escalation in Moscow's air assault, once again targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure. Just take a look at the damage caused by a strike in a residential area of Lviv. It left five people dead. Moscow calls the bombardment an act of retaliation after an alleged Ukraine attack on Russian soil last week. Ivan Watson has the very latest from Ukraine's capital.

      "sentences": "This is just one of dozens of impact points of Russian missiles that were fired against Ukraineovernight. Fortunately, nobody was killed here and it was pretty frightening, considering the explosion took place at about 7:00 this morning, shattering windows in this apartment block over here. Despite the shock and the fear, residents here say they still went to work today. They still taught at schools, went and worked at their banks. But the Ukrainian military says that the salvo of missiles was enormous. At least 81 of different kinds that were fired from land, sea and air, also including Iranian Shahed so-called suicide drones. The Ukrainian air defenses were able to shoot down dozens of these deadly projectiles. But there were still impacts in the Western city of Lviv. Authorities say at least five people were killed by one of the blasts. The Ukrainians say critical infrastructure was targeted -- power plants, the power to the Russian occupied Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant cut off, forcing the employees there to use diesel generators to try to power a nuclear power plant. That's raising real worries; 15 percent of power knocked out here in Kyiv this morning, 150,000 people in the city of Zhytomyr (ph) are without power as well. There have been a number of these types of Russian missile barrages launched in past months, often targeting the electrical grid but it has not succeeded in paralyzing the economy so far. The Russian ministry of defense has claimed responsibility for this, saying it's retaliation for some kind of attack that took place in Russia's Bryansk region on March 2nd but CNN has not been able to confirm that. The Ukrainian government has denied any links to whatever did take place there. But let me just point, out there's a children's playground right here next to the cars that have had their windshields shattered and so on. And it just underscores the fact that, when Russia fires these missiles periodically at Ukraine, no one is safe. This is a threat that everybody in this country has to live with -- Ivan Watson, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But also Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is supposed to take off from here after meeting with Austin to fly for an official trip to Italy. So the protesters here are essentially trying to prevent that from happening. Benjamin Netanyahu may instead be arriving to the airport by helicopter. These protesters though, amongst them, we have talked to former military pilots, former fighter jet pilots, who say that they feel as though they would no longer fight for a country if they don't believe it is any longer a democracy. Now the traffic is still moving, albeit slowly. We've spoken to some passengers who have had to get out of their cars, to take their suitcases by hand and walk all the way up to the terminal in order to make their flight. But some of them are receptive to the demonstrators here, saying they understand what they're fighting for, they support it. Of course, all of this related to the judicial reforms that the Netanyahu government is trying to undertake. They want to make it possible for the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, to overturn supreme court decisions with a simple majority. But these protesters say they will continue coming out to the streets. They will continue these days of disruption until they stop these reforms from going through. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

At some point while police were able to get some of them off, they would come back down. At one point police ended up having to essentially use dozens of officers, as well as mountain police, to essentially squeeze these protesters off of the street. The protests have been continuing all day across Tel Aviv, as well as across the entire country. This is just another day of disruption for what's been about 10 weeks straight now of regular protests. Some days seeing more than 150,000 Israelis take to the streets against these judicial reforms. Becky, I don't see them running out of steam anytime soon. In fact what we're seeing now is more and more people joining the protest. Today we actually spoke, as you heard there, to some former fighter jet pilots, who said they simply wouldn't serve for a country that they don't believe is any longer a democracy. And actually, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin just had his press conference with the Israeli defense minister and even he addressed these protesters and these judicial reforms. He quoted what President Biden has already said, essentially saying that the genius of Israeli and American democracy is checks and balances, as well as he called it an  independent judiciary. That is a clear message, Becky, from the Americans, not just now, from the president, from the secretary of state but now from the U.S. secretary of Defense, wading in and essentially calling on the Israeli government to speak to the other side, to come to some sort of consensus, because, clearly, not the entire population is on board. And these protesters say that they will keep going. They will keep taking to the streets. They plan to keep disrupting the Israeli way of life until they see these judicial reforms change. Becky.",

He worked with Israel, he had a good relationship with the former chief of staff and is now building a good relationship with the current defense minister. It's where he went from there, that, as you pointed, out and as Hadas pointed out, was very interesting. He did take a swipe at prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempt to do judicial overhaul. I'll read the quote in full, because it's so significant, that Austin even chose to go in this direction and say, as the U.S. Defense Secretary, that, essentially, Israel should find some other way to work around it. He said, \"As President Biden has said, the genius of American democracy and Israeli democracy is that they're both built on strong institutions, on checks and balances and not an independent judiciary.\" And the president also noted that building consensus for fundamental changes is really important to ensure that the people buy into them, so they can be sustained. It was quite a surprise to hear Austin go in this direction, to clearly talk right there about some other alternative to what we're currently seeing happening in Israel's government. He then went on to continue talking about aid to Ukraine, as Russia's war reaches the one year mark, pushing Israel to do more. He noted Israel has given nonlethal aid but essentially called on Israel to cross that line and to provide more aid than what they've already done. He then talked about the West Bank, maintaining the position the U.S. has had in the past, which is calling on the Palestinians to prevent incitement and to condemn terrorism. Then he called on Israel not to take any steps that could inflame tensions. He opposed settlement expansion and he also said he was significantly worried by settler attacks against Palestinians. So he really did go down a list of the concerns, not only from Iran, where, of course, you have cooperation between the U.S. and Israel but then also the other topics that the U.S. has been watching, as Israel has had the protests unfolding, violence in the West Bank and so on and so forth.",

What does that mean? Because he's actually an American. In any event, we spoke overnight. He has chosen to take this step because he feels abandoned. He feels out of options.

We need to do everything it takes. They view it as these nationals being used as pawns in a cynical political and often economic gain. In the past, for instance in the U.K., we have seen the release of Nazanin Zaghari- Ratcliffe, who was held for many years, both inside prison and then under house arrest. And finally, after the U.K. government agreed to pay hundreds of millions of pounds to Iran, of money that was actually Iran's money that had never been repaid, then she was released. So that might be an avenue to bring back the remaining Americans, because there is apparently still money out there that Iranians claim as their own. But this happens within the context of the protests and the crackdown on human rights in Iran, which has scared away the West from doing any other business. So what many say is that you should be able to compartmentalize, to continue the protests and the sanctions or whatever it takes to get Iran to comply with human rights regulations. But also bring back your nationals and enter, for humanitarian reasons, and enter a security agreement on nuclear talks so that there can be a safer world by reenacting and reimposing the JCPOA, the nuclear agreement, with Iran. So two things are necessary and, at the moment, only one of them are being done; that is criticism over the human rights violations in Iran.",

That's interesting if you consider that ASML has sold some $8 billion worth of products to China since 2014. Samsung is a major customer. And they, of course, have lots of manufacturing facilities in China. So then you start to wonder, how big a restriction is this actually in reality? Looking at the statement from ASML, it may be pretty niche (ph) and only impact the second most advanced chip making machinery. They already do not sell their most advanced machinery to China.

The consequences, whether it's from scams and fraud all the way to election campaigns like, disinformation campaigns, just think about the role audiotapes have played in political scandals, like Watergate to the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in the Trump 2016 election. This is really powerful and convincing stuff. I should mention, Hany Farid, our expert in the piece there, he pointed out that even two, three, four years ago, to make deepfake audio to sound that realistic, you would have needed hours of Anderson Cooper's voice.

You just brought  up some of the issues that we may face. The issue is, how do we face those? Because they are challenges and someone has got to take those on because, as I said, the genie is out of the bottle. AI technology is here to stay, isn't it? It's always good having you on, mate.
