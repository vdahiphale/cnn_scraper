So we're not seeing big losses or we're not seeing dramatic moves. Those are the markets. There's much happening in the world that I need to bring to your attention. An IDF commander is describing today as the most intense fighting since Israel began its ground invasion. Meanwhile, the UN is warning there's nowhere safe to go in Gaza. A rally tonight in Rome to denounce antisemitism following an increase in the number of reported incidents. And IBM and Meta spearheading a new alliance that's dedicated to the open development of AI. There's more to this than meets the eye. Live from Dubai tonight, it's Tuesday, December the 5th. I'm Richard Quest in the UAE. And here, as elsewhere, I mean business. Good evening, tonight, Israel's says it is in the heart of southern Gaza's largest city. An IDF official says the Khan Younis is being encircled by Israeli troops. At the same time, operations continue in the northern part of Gaza. Video from the central of the region indicate there have been multiple strikes in Deir al-Balah. One Israeli commander is describing today's fighting as the most intense since the ground invasion -- the ground operation began. The Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke during the last hour and said Israel will fight Hamas wherever they are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (voice over): The fighters of the IDF will continue the war and will take apart Hamas everywhere in the Gaza Strip. Yesterday, there was a tremendous fight. The earth trembled in Khan Younis, and Jabalya trembled. There's no place which we don't get to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He backed away from actually confirming that report. But what he did say was that, effectively, it would be a great ratio if indeed it was true, saying that it was far better than what was seen in some US battles in Iraq, for example, which we cannot confirm at this time. But it does point to the acceptance in Israeli military circles of the numbers of civilian casualties that we are seeing in Gaza. And it's certainly at odds with the kind of pressure that we've been seeing from the United States. As we've heard from US officials, making clear to the Israeli military that they cannot prosecute the war in the south the same way they have in the north, that the numbers of civilian casualties must be lower. And we've seen the Israeli military move in that direction with this map of evacuation orders. Ordering evacuations is a big focus on that, but we are also seeing how unfeasible many of those evacuation orders also are. And as of yet, we've yet to see a real change in the way in which the Israeli military is prosecuting this war.",

There is a lot of Republican support, as well as Democratic support in the Senate for pushing aid forward. But I think what we're seeing for the first time and the most serious time really are serious doubts about the US capacity to manipulate its own political problems in order to get that aid through to Ukraine. And this is something that's really, you know -- the mess in Washington now, Israeli affecting America's capacity to wield leadership in the Ukraine war, in the west, and more broadly across the globe here.",

Now, bearing in mind, he's been doing this for some months over the military's reproductive rights policies, what changed his mind? Let's face it. There have been many people putting pressure.

Even Republicans inside the Senate were pretty angry about this because theywere hearing a lot from the military about just how painful this was in terms of military readiness. What Tuberville was trying to do was protest Pentagon policies that actually paid expenses for servicemembers who had to get fertility treatment or abortion, and they had to travel together. On the border front, this it's very much like the Ukraine situation. It's a single senator, in this case, or a group of House members in the Ukraine case. So they're using their power to stop the governance in Washington to frustrate the Biden administration's plans both at home and abroad. Before, you know, military -- the military was always sacred. Foreign policy was supposed to be immune from the ideological divisions back in Washington. That is no longer the case. And I think a lot of it is to do with the transformation of the Republican Party in Trump's image -- this Make America Great Again theme that Trump has perpetuated, which is becoming more and more powerful again because of the possibility that he might end up back in the White House. And there are many members of the modern Republican Party who support Trump, who are quite happy if the government doesn't work, if the Congress isn't able to fund the US foreign policies they don't agree with like Ukraine aid or they will use their power to gum up the government to advance their own social policies like opposition to abortion. So I think this is -- while these are discreet issues, I think they tell us a lot about where American politics is, and where it's going to be going in the next year or so.",

The research suggested some traders anticipated and profited from Hamas's attacks in Israel. Now the regulator says that it's investigated the relevant time period and did not find any abnormal trading within Israel's stock exchanges, making clear, of course, that it can only talk about what happened within Israel exchanges, not, say, for example, on ETFs on other exchange.

But, Richard, I think that the really important part here is that the Israeli regulators, they're acknowledging that they only reviewed trading activity that took place in Tel Aviv on the Israeli stock exchange. And what's important to remember is that this research from Columbia and NYU, it goes beyond that. And actually, the central focus was on a bet made against an Israeli ETF, the MSCI Israel ETF.

It's one of the most anticipated games in history, set for release in two years. Rockstar Games will be pleased if it sells like anything of its predecessors. The \"Grand Theft Auto\" franchise is one of the world's most lucrative. More than $8 billion  since the last came out in 2013. And \"Grand Theft Auto VI\" alone made more money than any film released. Clare Duffy is in New York. At this point, transparency requires me to tell you I have not played them. But I am always gobsmacked by the sheer size of users, dollar made. I mean was this an official leak? A sort of leaked leak? Or was it a real leak?",

Last, year there was unreleased game footage that was leaked as part of what the company called \"a network intrusion.\" I will note the company's stock dipped after last night's leak. Shares were down about 1 percent today. But in some ways this leak and the coverage around the leak adds to the hype cycle. There's already astronomical interest in this next installment of \"Grand Theft Auto.\" But I don't know if we would be talking about it if it hadn't leaked 12 hours in advance and the trailer had gone up as planned this morning, Richard.",
