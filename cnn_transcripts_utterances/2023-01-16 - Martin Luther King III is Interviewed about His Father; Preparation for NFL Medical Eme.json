And there won't be restrictions put in place. We should be making it easier for them to vote, not harder. Our laws in some states have made it harder for people to vote and yet we're not - we've not passed the John Lewis bill or anything to make it easier.And it's going to be quite difficult for any of that to happen with this Republican-led Congress.

But opinions are like butts, you know, everybody's got one.But my issue is, I think that's a huge representation of bringing people together. It's called Embrace. And I think the artist did a great job. I'm satisfied. Yes, it didn't have my mom and dad's images, but it represents something that brings people together. And in this time of a - of day and age, when there's so much division, we need symbols that talk about bringing us together. It's personal for me because had my mom and dad not met in Boston, maybe I wouldn't be here. So, I'm grateful, number one, that it talks about the love story. And so people will be debating about it for a long time, but for years. And then the other thing -- final thing I'll say is, it also represents mom and dad. Many monuments are done just around dad, but it represents the kind of relationship they had, working together, and they were a partnership.",

Now, where do you get the most traffic? So, let's take a look at the urban areas, 2022, worst traffic, the average driver per year. I would have thought it as New York City.",

So perhaps that's a plug for you.Now, in terms of the trend line that you were looking at. So, this, I think, gets at the point that you were pointing out, that it's gotten better - or it's gotten worse, I should say, since the beginning of the pandemic. So, this is the traffic in the top ten urban areas. We're now at 101 hours per the average driver in the top ten urban areas. That is way up from where we were in 2020 when it was 53. Nearly back to 111, where we were in 2019. Now, here to me is the most interesting trend, which is compare that to the mass transit delay - or the people -- number of people that are using mass transit. The traffic congestion is now 88 percent of where we were in Boston, Chicago, D.C., and New York City. But the rapid transit usership is just at 50 percent. So, people are getting back in their cars, but they're not getting back on the trains.",
