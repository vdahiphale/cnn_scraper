I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we go first to Texas where an all too familiar tragedy is once again playing out -- a massacre, this time at an outlet mall on Saturday leaving eight people dead, seven more injured in Allen, Texas. That's just north of Dallas. And a warning, some of what you're about to see is disturbing. A witness dash cam capturing the horrific moments the gunman got out of his car and immediately began firing, ambushing unsuspecting people walking by and we're pausing this video before the shooting begins, but other witnesses were recording as the attack unfolded.

CNN's Ed Lavandera is there in Allen Texas. Ed, I understand that you have just learned new information about the gunman -- the suspected gunman -- and what are you learning?",

We were in the neighborhood where we are told by neighbors and this is an -- we were at an address that matches Garcia's parents and we were told by about a half dozen neighbors that we spoke with this morning there in that neighborhood that about an hour after the shooting took place here at the outlet mall in Allen, Texas that investigators which included FBI and Dallas Police officers were in that neighborhood speaking with the family of Mauricio Garcia, and that that lasted for several hours. At one point they had the entire street blocked off in that area as many people were trying to figure out where this law enforcement and why this law enforcement presence was there. Many of the neighbors had no idea that it was connected to this story unfolding, in this breaking news unfolding here at the Allen outlet mall. So the identification of this suspect, 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, we were also told by this source that he had been staying in some sort of transient housing. \"The Dallas Morning News\" describes it as an extended stay hotel situation. So, we're trying to decipher and kind of read through all of those details as well and we will continue to do that throughout the day. But this comes as we have been able to see this image of the body of the suspect there on the ground after Allen Police say he was shot and killed by one of their officers. And you can see in that image, the gunman dressed out in tactical bulletproof vest, other kind of tactical equipment. What's interesting is that as neighbors in that area where Garcia's family live, we were told by one person that many people in the neighborhood had identified and noticed him from that picture based on the shoes that he was wearing in this very graphic image. Here at the scene, we are told by city of Allen officials that despite all of this, a continuing and developing situation, that there will be no press briefings by officials here, that the Texas Department of Public Safety has now taken over this investigation -- Fredricka.",

President Joe Biden in his statement saying that there were children among the dead. Again, we have not received confirmation from local officials there. What they said was that nine people were transported to the hospital yesterday. And of those nine, they said that two were pronounced dead when they arrived at the hospital. At the moment, the latest information that we have is that three people are still in critical condition and there are four people that are in stable or fair condition. Again, we do not have ages. We do not have genders or names, but it is also important to point out that in addition to the people that were injured, in addition to the people that were killed, there are also a lot of victims who were there and maybe not physically injured, but went through a lot while they were at the mall yesterday. People who saw the shooter, who saw the victims who are extremely impacted by this, who had to hide, who had to help people hide, who had to help people connect with their family members because people didn't know where they were or what was going on as there was so much commotion and so much fear.

Unfortunately, parents, depending on the ages, everyone was rushing to this shopping mall. They're kept away from it. There's focus on reunification, which is absolutely correct here. I am pointing to the pictures of the family unification areas. So you know, parents or family members would certainly know.I think the ages are relevant, only because every life matters, but obviously, we hope to protect our children and teenagers who are just hanging out in a mall. The pictures we are showing are what look like high schoolers, the trauma that they will face. And so I'm very respectful of law enforcement and their pacing. You had a dead suspect, they were at his house an hour later. You know, the investigation is going to go to motive, but it's not like, you know, we're searching for a suspect or that there is a manhunt or some, you know, secret intelligence, I mean, he was dead. They knew who -- his car was there, they knew who he was an hour later. It's just becoming harder to find the law enforcement reason for why we can't get these disclosures.",

This is their children and the schools their children will be returning to on Monday.

And really, they tell me that they're looking at this as an all-hands on deck moment. They are planning for the fact that there will be an increase in the number of migrant arrivals here in New York City after Title 42 expires next week. In fact, some of those numbers have been growing over the past few days. Sources on the Adams administration tells me they are expecting to see up to 800 migrant arrivals per day. And just last week, 500 arrived on a single day. The problem with this, Fred, is that the city is running out of shelter space. New York City is unique unlike other cities that are also experiencing an influx of migrants, where the city of New York is legally required to provide shelter. So the Adams administration is looking at a host of options, including leasing out college dorms, putting up tents in Central Park, and also using unused airplane hangars in John F. Kennedy Airport. Now, they are also looking to build tiny container homes. All of these are just a range of possibilities that administration officials tell me they have been looking at because they expect these migrants to be arriving over the next few months. Now the city for the past year has been saying that they need federal aid. The federal government has provided some funding in the last few months, but it goes nowhere near what the city has been requesting and as the numbers continue to grow, the mayor really under pressure here to provide those services to make sure that people are taken care of and that they have the shelter that the city is legally required to provide -- Fred.",

Trump's defense has largely focused on why she did not file a report at the time or scream during the alleged attack. I want to talk about this more with Jessica Bennett, contributing editor in \"The New York Times\" opinion section, and she also teaches journalism at the New York University and is the author of \"Feminist Fight Club.\" Jessica, great to see you. So, one of the reasons women often don't come forward, you know, as Carroll noted, is because they feel belittled by the questions. It's like being, you know, victimized again, and you wrote, in an opinion piece for \"The Times\" that -- I'm quoting now: \"This isn't to say that those making rape allegations shouldn't answer questions, but we don't ask victims of other violent crimes, if they screamed out to the contrary, not screaming is considered a way to not further provoke. Why then when it comes to victims of sexual violence are those tropes so baked in?\" So as you ask those kind of rhetorical questions, have you come any closer to getting some of those answers? JESSICA BENNETT, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" OPINION SECTION: Right. Well, you know, it's not just that we don't ask victims of other violent crimes these questions, it is that there's actually ample data to show that many people in a victim situation explicitly do not scream. You know, there is psychological evidence to show that people may freeze. All sorts of crazy things can go through person's mind when they feel that they're in danger. So, we're kind of reiterating these same old questions that actually do have answers. There are plenty of reasons why women wouldn't scream, and also why she wouldn't report to police.",
