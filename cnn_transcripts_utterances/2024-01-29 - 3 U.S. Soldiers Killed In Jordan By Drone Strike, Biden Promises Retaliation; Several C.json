What would it take for the U.S. to reinstate that funding?JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we're obviously deeply troubled by that, obviously, by our action by pausing any of the funding. We want to make sure UNRWA looks into what happened, investigate, get to the bottom of it. I don't have anything else to share on what will -- what the next steps of that will be but investigation needs to happen. They need to look into it. We're deeply, deeply troubled by what we've heard. We're in touch, obviously, with the U.N. We're in touch with Israel and others. And so, that's -- we're going to continue to have those conversation and stay in touch. BERMAN: Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that some of the protests here in the United States against the Israel-Hamas war are supported by or connected to, in some way, Russia and Vladimir Putin. What evidence has the White House seen of anything along those lines? JEAN-PIERRE: So, I'm going to let the speaker speak for herself. The former speaker, obviously, speak for herself. I don't have anything to add to what the speaker has laid out. We've been very clear here on where we stand with our -- where we stand with Israel in making sure that they are able to defend themselves. Obviously, after the horrible, horrible attacks on September 7th by Hamas, they're -- the terrorist organization who have said -- leaders in that organization have said that they would do October 7th over and over and over again. Obviously, we want to make sure that they protect innocent lives in Gaza, the Palestinian lives. One life lost is too many, so we're going to continue to have those conversations. But I just don't have anything to say as it relates to protest. The president has been clear. We have been clear here at the White House. We believe that Americans have the right to peacefully protest, to voice their concerns. And so, I'll just leave it there.",

This deal is a fair deal, right? It would be, they say, it would be a fair deal. It would be a comprehensive deal. It would be a historic piece of legislation to deal with a system, an immigration system that was broken in the last administration and for decades. And so, we're seeing a bipartisan camaraderie here, if you will. People coming together in the Senate side -- on the Senate side, saying, hey, let's work on getting something done for the American people. That's what the president wants.

Majority of Americans want us to do the job here in Washington, D.C. and get things done. Congress needs to act. Congress must act.

I have really watched you lead at -- lead the alliance through some very challenging times. You've kept NATO united and resolute through the most serious threat to transatlantic security since the end of the Cold War.Over the nearly two years since Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever. NATO became even more capable last year when Finland joined. And I'm very pleased that the Turkish parliament voted last week for Sweden to join NATO as well. And we're looking forward to welcoming Sweden to NATO soon. Now, we'll talk today about ways to further strengthen transatlantic security as we look to next month's defense ministerial meeting in Brussels, and to the 75th anniversary summit that we'll host here in Washington later this year. Deterrence and defense will always be job number one for NATO. And we've always -- and we've made excellent progress on implementing the decisions that our leaders made at the Vilnius Summit. With our approved regional plans, we're ensuring a theaterwide, multi- domain deterrent. And if any adversary challenges that deterrent, the alliance is ready to fight and to win.

Manchin has spent months teasing the possibility of launching a third- party presidential bid this year, but his path to the ticket would lean on support from the No Labels group, which is right now experiencing some turmoil, to say the least.CNN's Isaac Dovere joins us now to share some of your reporting. Can you sort of give us an idea of what is going on exactly with the No Labels group? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, look, that group has put itself forward as the third way alternative, thinking about a unity ticket, and they have been getting ballot lines all across the country on states for a ticket. But they have set their own deadline as mid-March for when to decide what they're doing. I asked a number of leaders of No Labels. How this would work? Who would be involved? How's -- who's going to make the decision? How you pick the people who are going to make the decision? Couldn't get clear answers on any of that. And that's with weeks to go before this is all supposed to go down. And it's also as Joe Manchin, as you said, is going around the country. Starting to talk about how he might actually go forward with the presidential run, telling people privately he sees a potential path if Donald Trump gets convicted and Joe Biden has a health scare. But very much not wanting to be a spoiler. Very much not wanting to be what leads to Donald Trump being back in the White House. These are all coming together when, obviously, there is a lot going on as this campaign starts to take shape. Really, it looks like as a likely Biden-Trump rematch.",

That's one perspective.If, however, we're truth tellers, and we know that the Senate is so tight that nothing can get done without bipartisanship, and that there has to be a deal where the President agrees to sign it, it has to be passed by both chambers of the Congress. The House seems to be obstructionist here, and that's going to be the real challenge. The Senate and the President are going to work together. So, is it a zero-sum game? No, because the reality is nothing gets done in this Washington, D.C. without bipartisanship because the margins are too tight. But if people don't understand that, then they buy into the Trump crazy. And you saw what Oklahoma did, right, to Senator Lankford?
