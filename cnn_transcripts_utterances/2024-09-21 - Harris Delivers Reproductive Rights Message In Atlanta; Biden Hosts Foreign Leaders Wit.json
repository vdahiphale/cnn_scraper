But the short answer is yes, there are protocols for submersibles, including deep dive submersibles. The first shallow dive passenger submersible was actually in the U.S. Virgin Islands, all the way back in 1987.And the Coast Guard came up with specific protocols for submersible passenger vessels as early as 1993. A key element of doing this is what's called a classification society like Lloyd's or DNV, or the American Bureau of Shipping. And what commercial vessels will do is work with a classification society that outlines. Here are these specifications for different types of vessels, including submersibles. So, one of the things that the former CEO of OceanGate had asserted was that you can't innovate with those kind of rules. However, under those rules, there have been a series of novel designs developed for submersibles that also have the certification and the classification society blessings. So, what that does the classification society, the certification is it provides third party overview. If you are developing a submersible, you may think it's a great idea, you may have very good reasons for that. But it is a healthy process to have a third party, qualified entity, really take a critical look and help you understand whether or not improvements are needed. WALKER: Yes, you would think that there would be so many layers of safety before such an expedition. You know, I was also struck by testimony from, I think, it was a former employee of OceanGate, who claimed that he was fired because he didn't sign off on an expedition because he said he was concerned about the integrity of this prototype carbon fiber hall that OceanGate eventually used for this Titanic expedition. I mean, what did you make of that, and when it comes to the integrity of the hall itself? And also, what do you expect as the outcome, you know, of these hearings?
