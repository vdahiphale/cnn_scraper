Making things even more difficult, some of the areas are under winter weather warnings for snow and high winds and very low temperatures. Turkish President Erdogan today pleading for other countries to send their most experienced search and rescue teams. There's currently really no way to assess even a rough idea of how many people are missing right now, trapped under these giant piles of concrete and twisted metal. Videos captured the moment this building collapsed in central Turkey today. This was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region in more than 100 years. Now, there have been some moments of hope today. This video shared by the White Helmets volunteer group showed rescuers pulling a young boy out of the rubble in northeast Syria. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh starts off our coverage today from Istanbul, Turkey, with the country's leaders have declared a week of national warning.

Moments later, two aftershocks. A Turkish TV crew reporting live during the makings of an apocalyptic scene. The reporter grabbing a young girl as the rubble and smoke settles around them. Rescue efforts beginning immediate immediately. In southern Turkey, a young man trapped, desperation in his eyes, then in the predawn darkness, a moment of joy, hauled from the wreckage. This was a residential building full of families asleep in their homes when the massive earthquake struck.

When China put out an explanation that this was a weather balloon, the Pentagon pretty much instantly rejected that and said since there was the ability for this to maneuver somewhat. The National Security Council said a short time ago it had a propeller and rudders and gave it limited maneuverability. It could loiter, so it could stay over the air in one spot and monitor. And it's for those reasons the Pentagon has already said they are confident this was a surveillance balloon, a spy balloon designed for intelligence gathering and to look and see what could be picked up. They have also said it appears it did not have any ability or technology above and beyond Chinese spy satellites, but, Jake, what it can do that spy satellites can't do, as we just saw, is loiter, and stay over an area for an extended period of time.

When we put that question to the experts they say they will get a sense very quickly if it's working based on how the burn is going, whether or not they see this toxic material releasing from these engines. They say this whole thing should take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours if all goes as planned -- Jake.",

And once that burns, the byproduct of that is hydrogen chloride and phosphine. In this particular area, if you are in what they call the red area, which is very close to the derailed cars, according to the experts here, they say if you inhale this toxic gases, it can be deadly.If you are and what they call the yellow zone, a little bit further, out remember there's a one-mile to two-mile radius around East Palestine. If you are in the yellow area, even in that area, you could have adverse effects from this. So, that is why they were urging people last night to get out. They are feeling is last night some 100 additional people actually evacuated. In terms of how many people are left, we really pushed them on that issue. They say by their best estimation some 30 people might be left in that area. So, you can see why they were urging people to get out -- Jake.",

CNN's Sam Kiley is southwest of Bakhmut in Zaporizhzhia. And, Sam, a Ukrainian commander in the area describes Bakhmut as a, quote, unwinnable fortress.

It has a very big industrial outer ring.Now, all of that lends itself to defense and makes it very difficult for Wagner, which is hard to fight against open fields, to get to the city. And not just Wagner, but the other Russian regular forces, too. So, it has been particularly from their perspective a meat grinder. Now, Prigozhin, as always, is seeking some kind of publicity on the almost daily basis, this time suggesting that the Ukrainians might be able to hang on. Indeed, President Zelenskyy has said that he would be reinforcing troops there. I'm in contact with soldiers by foreigners, volunteers and Ukrainians on the frontline who don't believe that the city or the town, rather, is worth hanging onto indefinitely with an unending cost of life, particularly as it has been so bloody for the Russians, ultimately. But Ukrainians are spread thin. They are short of man. They are short of material. Those two assets that the Russians have plenty, what they have over the Russians is some more moderate equipment coming in. And above all, motivation. So, there is a debate going on within the Ukrainians as to whether or not it's really worth holding on in terms of a military strategy to this town. It doesn't really serve the Russians, even if they were to capture. It doesn't serve them particularly important strategic window.",

Now, New Jersey Republican state and federal lawmakers say they have a hunch as to why so many whales are showing up dead on their beaches, pointing to a Biden-backed offshore wind farm project that it's just in its early survey stages.Scientists say that their concern too about the whale deaths, but they do not don't agree with the wind farm theory, citing a few other possibilities, including increasing population, migrating food sources due to warming oceans, and more whales and busy boating areas, which makes them more likely to get hit by ships. Let's bring in whale expert and marine biologist, Michael Moore. Michael, thanks for joining us. An official from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says, quote, there are no known connections between any of these offshore wind activities, and any whale strandings regardless of species, unquote. Now, we know that birds can be killed by wind farms, although house cats are statistically a bigger risk to birds. But are there any proven risks, proven, risks to marine wildlife from wind farms?",
