An official says backup generators maintained the supply, but water started spewing out of melting pipes, leading to low pressure. Here's the governor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH GREEN (D), HAWAII: I've authorized a comprehensive review of what happened in the early hours of the fire and the hours thereafter. We will build back together. We will find out what we could have done to prevent such loss of life, to the best of our ability. As of now, the best information we have is that, in those hours when the fire sparked, there were several fires across Maui. One fire was deemed to be out. It must not have been completely extinguished, because when the winds rose up, winds guesting as high as 81 miles per hour, the fire spread rapidly, we believe between 60 miles per hour and 81 miles per hour across that part of the island. And that meant that fire traveled 1 mile every minute, resulting in this tragedy. With those kind of winds and 1,000-degree temperatures, ultimately, all the pictures that you will see will be easy to understand. Because that level of destruction in a fire hurricane is something new to us, and this age of global warming was the ultimate reason that so many people perished. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Right?Often when we talk about these disasters, it is several -- it's not the entire area. And that's what happened in Lahaina. What can these business owners count on from the federal government? What does \"whole of government approach\" mean to them? Do they get made whole?",

And so beyond just the businesses, just the impact that's reverberating across the state.For us, it means people think about small business and you think about the role SBA plays day in and day out, building businesses across this country. We are uniquely positioned to help homeowners, businesses, renters and private nonprofits. So a business owner that was impacted as an individual, we can help them. For business owners, we saw businesses of every size just burned to the ground, business that -- a traditional store front where you can walk in, have a meal or buy something local; to those entrepreneurs that may simply run a table at a fair selling some of the things that are made in that community. So this town is so deeply dependent on tourism, and we're coming up on one of the busiest times of year for them. And so for us, focused on helping them with the capital they need to start back up and to make sure they're resilient. And so this is going to be an effort that we're going to work with very closely with FEMA, local state officials. We did meet with local chambers of commerce, economic groups. We visited some business owners that were impacted. And so the challenge is real, but SBA is going to bring every possible resource. Not just our disaster programs, but everything we do, day in and day out, bring to the table to help these communities get back on its feet.",

We've heard from local residents saying that they don't want to see tourists at this moment in time, given the scale of the disaster.There's a difficult balancing act here, and I know you guys end up kind of in the middle of it, to some degree. I guess my biggest question is, how fast can these businesses, if tourists are not coming, how fast can they expect the federal government and the support provided by the SBA to reach them? What is the length of time this is going to take?",

So some of these business owners are still in shelters. This community was devastated. And so there's not a lot of structures around. Some parts of the island are obviously still operating. These parts of the community, the governor was clear when we met with him. Parts of Maui are open. If -- this community, particularly it's impacted, and people ought to respect that space. But while those folks are still getting to some safety and some stability, we are in the shelters with FEMA providing those resources. We are there, ready now. Some people, as you mentioned, simply aren't ready yet, but when they are, we'll be here to help.",
