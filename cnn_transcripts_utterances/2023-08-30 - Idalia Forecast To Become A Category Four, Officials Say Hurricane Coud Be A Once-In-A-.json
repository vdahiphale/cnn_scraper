Breaking news, hurricane Idalia has rapidly intensified over the warm waters off the Gulf of Mexico and is now forecast to become an extremely dangerous category four storm, before it makes landfall in a matter of just hours.The storm is packing 110 miles per hour winds and is already causing flooding in some of the coastal areas. Our teams are out across the entire storm zone, Chad Myers is in the CNN weather center with the very latest forecast. Carlos Suarez is in Tampa, Brian Todd is in Tallahassee, and Gloria Pazmino is in Clearwater. Let's go right now to Chad Myers who is in the weather center. Chad, Governor Ron DeSantis is now saying that the Florida gulf coast area has not seen a storm of Idalia's magnitude since the 1800s. It is now forecast to be an extremely dangerous category four hurricane when it makes landfall. Put all this into context for us.",

There you go, that's the area right there that he is talking about and that is the area that has not seen anything this significant in a long time.Remember, we did have the category four, then five here in Matthew and - - Michael. That was a big storm, it was an impressive storm but not on the order of what we are talking about on this coast. So, what we are talking about is likely a record low pressure making landfall here. Likely a record category, which would be category four. A record storm surge, possibly up to 16 feet. So a lot of things going on here, a lot of moving parts and an intense, deepening storm with an eye that has been very impressive for now, it seems like five hours. That means the storm is rapidly intensifying. I don't have an update on the 1:10, maybe to 1:15 yet. We are waiting on an airplane to get in there. In fact, one of our reporters will be on that airplane, and be able to report back to us live. 130 miles per hour is the forecast at landfall, slightly after sunrise coming up here in about eight hours. Here you go, there is the eye of the storm. Something else that has just popped up here, a tornado watch for these cells that are coming on shore on Florida's west coast. Some of them are spinning, some of them will have waterspouts, some of them will have tornadoes. That is the likelihood. The big threat here, after the storm surge, is how far and how inland this wind field will be. 110 mile per hour winds all the way across the Florida, Georgia line. That is an entire area right through here that will have thousands, tens of thousands of trees knocked down because of this wind. Power lines downed, roofs damaged. that is simply, almost an EF1 tornado. That is how much damage is going to be in this large swath. Even hurricane conditions to Brunswick, to Jekyll Island, and even towards and north of Amelia Islands. This is going to be a big wind maker, a big surge maker, and then, as we work our way into tomorrow, we are going to see the potential for very, very heavy rainfall. And possibly heavy rainfall where people evacuated to. It could see six inches of rainfall in these spots, that could cause freshwater flooding, not the salt water flooding that we're worried about pushing on shore into St. Marks and towards Steinhatchee and possibly into Cedar Key. This is an area that we have to watch out for, if we think about South Carolina, we're not talking about low country here, we're talking about some of the topography here. That rain is going to run off of these creeks, streams, down the hills, and we could see flash flooding from this just as another aspect of this storm.",

      "sentences": "Well, Laura, as you said, an hour ago I was explaining to you that this thing just comes in waves and we are in the middle of a wave right now. The rain is coming down and that wind is just sweeping right through this area where we are standing.It is really strong, you can see the palm trees are swaying back and forth as that rain and that wind moves through. These are the outer bands of the storm, hurricane Idalia making its way to the western part of the state. Chad Myers was just describing everything that this thing is carrying. Tornadoes, possible wind damage, the storm surge, all of that is what we are watching out for here in Clearwater Beach. Now, Clearwater Beach is part of Pinellas County. This area is about two and a half miles long, there is a big, long beach that is right in front of us in this direction. It is very flat and that is important. What does that mean? It is flat and that ocean is shallow. You can walk about half a mile into it and the water might just be barely up to your waist. So that creates perfect conditions for a storm surge. Another key factor here that we have been talking about all day long, the Gulf of Mexico. The waters which this storm is traveling over right now are extremely warm. Those warm waters are acting like gasoline for this hurricane. It is making it gain strength and speed as it moves forward, and if that ocean that is directly in front of us, if it comes anywhere where we are right now, the expectation is that we could see anywhere from four to seven feet of storm surge. Laura, I'm a little over five feet tall, so any amount of water that is more than that is obviously going to be catastrophic and extremely damaging. Now, people here for the most part have heeded the evacuation warnings, but I do want to show you this residential tower that is directly behind me. You can see that a lot of the apartments are completely dark, probably meaning that people got out, but there are a few people who are clearly still at home. Their lights are on. There was a couple that was walking by early this morning who told us that they were going to ride this out. Hopefully that is going to be okay, hopefully they are going to be safe. But, as we were just telling you a minute ago, with every passing minute conditions just worsen significantly. The water really coming down now and we expect conditions to continue to worsen with every passing hour as we await the arrival and landfall of this hurricane, which is said to cause historic damage to the western portion of the state, Laura.",

DIANNE HART, (D) FLORIDA HOUSE: I am watching very closely because, I am at home right now. I am feeling the bands. The rain is pouring down and then it stops, the wind is blowing. So my worst fear is tomorrow morning for people who did not evacuate when they were asked to evacuate. Fears that the surge may be between six and seven feet tomorrow, so I understand that our authorities will be going out tomorrow morning if they can to actually check on people and are asking them to please stay inside. If you are in the house, do not come out. There are some areas that will be flooding and we expect them to flood over the bay shore area, on the Davis Island area. My understanding is that we have some outage right now over in the bay shore area. So, we are already beginning to feel the effects of this storm. Right in my very neighborhood where I live, we are pretty high. So we don't expect any flooding in my community, but we are going to have some flooding in some other areas right here in our city.",

Joining now to discuss, CNN economics and political commentator Catherine Rampell. Catherine, I'm glad you're here tonight. Thank you. I mean, gas prices we've mentioned obviously matter less than people's lives. Full stop. And this storm is still incoming. But the question people are asking right now is how could this storm possibly impact things like prices in the coming days and weeks ahead?",

That may be modestly we moving prices. Not to mention the fact that there's been a gas-leak contamination issue that's been relatively widespread recently in the last couple days in Florida.Beyond the state, I think it's too soon to say whether we'll see any national impact on gasoline prices, in part because, while there may be disruptions in supply to the state, the oil refineries that are near -- that are closest by in the Gulf look like they're out of the path. The oil that's actually extracted nearby the state also seems like it's unlikely to be hit at this point. So you know, in terms of actual effects on national gas prices, right now it looks like there are likely to be limited. But this is potentially a catastrophic storm. So it's a little bit hard to get a handle on how all of the different kinds of terminals and other linkages fit in the gas -- within the petroleum industry may be linked and affected.",

I think most recently Farmers last month.They've gotten skittish, understandably, because Florida has been hounded by storm after storm. There's been a lot of very extensive damage that the insurance companies have had to pay for. And so they've said, we're out. If this storm is as catastrophic as many fear it may be, that's certainly going to make that market even less stable. And you might see further insurers decide to pull out or, at the very least, prices will go up within the state. And I think you might see some contagion effects elsewhere in the country, as insurance companies get increasingly nervous about what had been, you know, once-in-a-century storm, was a once-in-a-century natural disasters happening on a quite regular basis and -- and put -- you know, hitting a blow to the bottom lines.",

It's going to get to 1:30 before it makes landfall in about eight hours or so. It has been building this bubble of water underneath it now for hours, and it will eventually make landfall there in the Big Bend area of Florida. So yes, it's the water that's been building here, moving to the North. It's still moving. But all of a sudden, land gets in the way. Down here, what's getting in the way, the possibility of a tornado or two. That's not out of the question. But as this storm makes its way on up toward the Big Bend area, that's when the surge is going to be, from Crystal City, all the way over to Steinhatchee and possibly even into Apalachicola. That's where most of that surge will likely be. So let's get to it. This is what we're talking about. We're talking about a very flat piece of land. And why does that matter? Because when the water goes up a foot, literally ,your shoreline can lose 300 to 400 feet. And then if it goes up two feet, all of a sudden, you've lost 1,000 feet. And if it goes up what they're forecasting, 10 to 15 feet. Oh my gosh, how far inland is that going to go? And that will likely be miles. Likely miles inland that this is going to push this water. This is an area, very fragile, its wildlife. They're going to have to try to get out of the way. People are going to have to get out of the way. But boy, just run away from the water, because this surge is a very dangerous thing.",
