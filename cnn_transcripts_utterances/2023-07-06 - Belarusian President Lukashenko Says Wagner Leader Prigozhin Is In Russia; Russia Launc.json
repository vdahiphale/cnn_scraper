The leaderof Belarus says the war -- the Wagner boss is in Russia, not Belarus, as he speaks to CNN. Russian missiles hitting Lviv with a devastating effect. We speak to the mayor of the western Ukrainian city. And then Meta launches Threads, its highly-anticipated answer to Twitter. So what can we expect from the newest social media contender? But first, tonight, where in the world is Yevgeny Prigozhin? When we left off last month, if you remember, the bombastic mercenary chief had agreed to exile in Belarus. This after ending his rebellion against Russia's top generals and laying waste to parts of eastern Ukraine. But now, the Kremlin says it won't comment on the Wagner leader's whereabouts, and the president of Belarus who, if you remember, reportedly brokered the exiled deal says Prigozhin isn't in his country. CNN's Matthew Chance has details from the Belarusian capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko invited us here to the Palace of Independence, this marble-clad edifice in the center of Minsk. It's one of his presidential offices for a press conference, and what he says was a conversation about all the dramatic events that have been unfolding over the past couple of weeks. Of course, the main interest was the whereabouts of Wagner, the Russian mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. So, I got a chance to ask Alexander Lukashenko what update he could give us about that mercenary group that of course staged a military uprising in Russia just last month. I wonder if you could provide us all with a bit of an update on the whereabouts of the Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Is he in Belarus or not? ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, PRESIDENT, BELARUS (through translator):  In terms of Yevgeny Prigozhin, he's in St. Petersburg, or maybe, this morning, he will travel to Moscow or elsewhere. But he's not on the territory of Belarus now.",

He said the deal is still on the table. Is what he insisted, but it has not been finally agreed yet. Meanwhile, in Russia, on state television, we've been seeing these extraordinary images of what they say is Yevgeny Prigozhin's house or one of his houses in St. Petersburg where police have raided, and they have seized gold bars, cash, passports, some with false names, with Yevgeny Prigozhin's photographs and wigs, strangely, which could be obviously used as disguise, weapons as well. And you know, all implies that Russia is sort of moving to discredit the Wagner leader, possibly ahead of arrest, although that's not been confirmed. I spoke to the Kremlin earlier today, and they said at the moment, they're not commenting on it. But clearly, the deal for Wagner and its leader to be exiled in Belarus is at the least being renegotiated, and that could end very badly indeed for Yevgeny Prigozhin.

And in response, the Israeli military responded with artillery shelling and the Lebanese news reporting it was about 15 shells that mostly landed in open areas, and there was no injuries reported on either the Lebanese or the Israeli side. Now,  no one has claimed responsibility for this. But as you noted, the Lebanese security sources pointing the finger at Palestinian militants, which then, of course, brings up the question, what is this potentially connected to? Is it potentially connected to all the events that we've been seeing in the occupied West Bank, in Jenin? Keep in mind, we saw those five rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas on the night that the Israeli military began withdrawing. Could it be connected to that or could it be connected to -- there have been a few sort of minor scuffles along -- among the border, involving -- some involving Hezbollah setting up tents. And there's other issues that have been happening along the border. It could be connected to that as well. But there are so many sensitivities about this border and also about involvement, potentially with Hezbollah. Keep in mind that the last time there was a major conflict on this border or major action on this border, was back in April when 34 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel. Once again, the finger was pointed at Palestinian militants. And that was in connection to events that were happening here in Jerusalem. But there's always sort of a question about whether Hezbollah is going to get involved. And every time, I talk to Israeli security officials, Israeli security sources, they always talk about how their biggest concern about Israel's borders is Lebanon. Because a war with Hezbollah is on a whole other level than other -- any sort of recent conflicts we've seen recently between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This would be, you know, incredibly destructive, both for Israel and for Lebanon. And that's why there are so many sensitivities about whatever happens amongst that border. Then, we also had today not only the action on the Lebanese border, but another shooting attack, actually, in the occupied West Bank. This is near the Israeli settlement of Kedumim. We know that an Israeli was shot dead and then after a search of some kind, Israeli forces then stopped what they said was a suspicious vehicle. The person in the vehicle began firing at them, they fired back at this person, ending up killing him. We've seen images of this car, this white van that the assailant was allegedly driving, and it had Palestinian license plates. And now, Hamas has taken credit for this shooting, tying it in direct connection to what happened in Jenin this week. Of course, Hamas had called on all of its members to strike Israel wherever they could. We saw that ramming attack in Tel Aviv that Hamas took credit for. And now we have this shooting attack that Hamas is taking credit for. And I think we're going to continue seeing this sort of -- this sort of back-and-forth of potentially more attacks. And we will probably see more Israeli military operations because keep in mind, of course, that Israeli officials, Benjamin Netanyahu has said they reserve the right to go back into Jenin if they feel as though they need to. But in some good news, Isa, for Jenin, the United Arab Emirates just announcing a $15 million donation to UNRWA; the U.N. agency specifically to help the people of Jenin. Isa?",

He was joined inside a courthouse by his Washington based attorney as well as a new attorney that he has hired that is able to practice here in south Florida.

Peters, Florida. That is the city where this trial is expected to take place for the former president as well as Walt Nauta. The 40-year old is accused of moving boxes that contain classified documents from a storage room at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort to other parts of the property and lying to federal investigators about the whole thing.

And as you noted, prosecutors say they have surveillance video showing someone we believe to be Walt Nauta moving boxes across the Mar-a- Lago resort property before the FBI searched it. The Feds have said that Nauta lied to investigators about the whereabouts of these boxes as well as lying about the fact that he did move them, apparently.",

As for when this trial might actually get underway for both these men, right now it does seem likely that the judge handling this case is going to have to postpone this trial from an August date to December at the earliest.",

In Syria and in the region writ large. What happened is the three Russian fighter jets especially harassed at least three American MQ-9 drones that were, according to the Pentagon, conducting in anti ISIS mission over Syria. The Russian fighter aircraft started releasing parachute flares in front of the drones, ostensibly to block their view. One of the fighter jets got extremely close to one of the drones and engaged its afterburner, again, to try to block the view of the drone and forced the operator of the drone, who was operating remotely, to take evasive maneuvers. We did ask the Pentagon whether these drones were forced down as a result of this harassment. And it does not appear any of the drones crashed, like that American drone did over the Black Sea a few months ago, when a Russian fighter jet harassed it in that instance. But the U.S. does say that this is becoming an increasing instance. Russian fighter jets have become extremely aggressive toward not only American drones operating in the region but also manned American fighter jets operating in the skies over Syria. The top commander for the Air Force in the Middle East said recently that it actually appeared Russian fighter jets were trying to dogfight with American fighter jets over these skies in Syria. Obviously an alarming statement because it implies the Russian fighter jets are trying to get into aerial combat with American planes. So they are really emphasizing here that they need the Russians to act in the professional and safe manner. The Russians, however, don't seem to be heeding that advice, Isa.",

The app named Threads debuted today with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying some 30 million people signed up for the service in the first 16 hours. For comparison, Twitter has a user base of some 300 million. It's also worth mentioning Zuckerberg has long-standing feud with fellow tech billionaire Elon Musk, who bought Twitter last year. I want to bring in our technology reporter, Brian Fung. A strong start, I think it's fair to say, for the platforms, for Threads. Talk to me about the platform, the functionality, the limitations.

      "sentences": "Yes, the best way to think about Threads is it's a bare bones version of Twitter. It's lacking a lot of the other kindof major features that Twitter has, like direct messages or a comprehensive search function. Twitter also has -- I'm sorry -- Threads also has an algorithmic feed, kind of like Instagram, where it doesn't show you only the content from people you follow but also content from accounts you don't follow and basically trying to recommend new content to you. The character limit on Threads is about 500 characters, which again is a bit different from Twitter. But overall, it seems there is a strong start for Threads here with many users praising its basic features, even though there are still some limitations here. And the main thing I think that is really going in the favor of Threads right now is a massive installed universe that Meta can draw on from Instagram. The way you sign up for Threads is through an Instagram account. When you think about the sheer number of people who have Instagram already and that is a huge number of people that Meta can push Threads to and encourage them to sign up and potentially draw them away from Twitter to this new Twitter like app, Isa.",

And those apps were really popular. Right now, what is happening is Twitter seems to be getting less popular as it restricts people from being able to view tweets as much or interact with the platform is much. People look to increasingly be looking for a way to find other alternatives, whether that is Threads or Bluesky or Mastodon, all of which have seen an incredible growth in just the last few days alone as Twitter has clamped down on the ability for people to view tweets. To your other point about how often people's Instagram followers are very different from what their Twitter followers look like, I think what Meta is banking on here is that, for most people, the average user, their social grasp on both networks may look rather similar. It's really only for a professional users or high profile people who may need to use Twitter for work purposes, that they have this division between a personal Instagram account and a professional Twitter persona. So it's possible that Meta here is making the bet that most people, for most people, this will not be that big of an issue.",

One of the aspects of the story which links these to miners are the gas canisters themselves, the nitrate used for the processing of the soil, of the ground taken out and then the gold separated from it. That does indicate very firmly that this has something to do with these illegal miners. Also the location of this incident is right near one of those disused mines.

It follows U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken's visit just two weeks ago. Janet Yellen is expected to receive a warm welcome because of her economic pragmatism. She wants to improve communications and lower the temperature between the world's two largest economies. Beijing sees her as the voice of reason in the Biden administration, where she has pushed to maintain economic ties with China. She's argued against tariffs and restrictions on investment in China and while giving testimony to Congress in April she warned that decoupling would be disastrous. Her itinerary is yet public but she plans to meet with her Chinese counterpart and other high-ranking officials. But she's not expected to meet with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Yellen's meeting will not be without tension. The Treasury Secretary has spoken out against China's human rights record and believes American supply chains need to diversify away from China. Yellen will try to convince Beijing that the U.S. is not trying to harm or contain the Chinese economy by blocking access to sensitive technology, such as semiconductors, in the name of national security. Beijing is not buying it. Just this week, China retaliated by announcing it would restrict the export of certain minerals critical for the production of semiconductor chips, solar cells and other tech products. A short time, ago we heard from China's commerce ministry, criticizing U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China saying, quote, \"The U.S. approach not only infringes on Chinese companies' legitimate rights but also undermines interests of many countries and regions and will hinder global technology exchange and trade cooperation. \"This will eventually backfire against the U.S.\" At the end of the day, the world's two largest economies are deeply entwined with $700 billion in trade between China and the U.S. each year. The economic global uncertainty only adds to the importance of the relationship.
