Protests sparked by the death of a woman in the custody of the morality police have entered day 40. Chants of \"freedom, freedom, freedom,\" continue on the streets of the capital. Iran's security forces have responded with tear gas. Videos posted on social media show the continuing turmoil in Iran 40 days after the passing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in custody after being arrested for failing to adhere to the regime's strict dress code; 40 days is the traditional mourning period and an important marker for the people of Islamic faith. CNN's Nada Bashir has more on how the protests turned into a movement and an uprising against the regime. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The final resting place of Mahsa Amini, a place of mourning and, now, of protest. Amini's name has become synonymous with a movement that is posing the biggest threat to the Iranian regime in years, sparked in the wake of the 22-year old's death while in the custody of Iran's notorious morality police. Detained for allegedly contravening the country's strict dress code. But now, as the Iranian people commemorate 40 days since Amini's death, a significant mark of both mourning and remembrance, the movement has grown into something far more wide reaching than its initial call for women's rights.",

As the report says, this is no longer just about women's rights, though this continues to be a central focus of the protest movement. Really, this has grown into something far greater. This has really gained momentum and we are now hearing chance for regime change in many of these protests. And in response, the crackdown continues to be brutal and it continues to be deadly. Just in the last few hours, we've seen video of anti riot units now marching on Tehran. We've seen Iranian security forces present, in several locations across the country, particularly the country's universities,, where there have been days and days of demonstrations, protests, marches held by the students there. They are not going to classes. They are protesting against the regime. You could even see students at at least two universities now protesting head on with the Iranian government's spokesperson, chanting those anti-regime messages that we heard over the last few weeks. That crackdown is continuing to intensify. We've heard from human rights groups like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, detailing this use of excessive and lethal force. We heard from one human rights organization based in Norway, Iran HR, which has been tallying its own death toll, though it is difficult for CNN to independently verify that the death toll. They've pegged the number at at least 230 people so far, although some say that figure could likely be higher. It is difficult to completely verify that figure. We've heard, of course, also of the mass detentions of protesters across the country. We've heard from the Iranian public prosecutor, saying, according to state media, they have now charged more than 300 protesters for allegedly threatening state security. They say, according to state media, that at least 1,000 protesters have now been detained since these demonstrations began in September. Also, we heard from human rights organizations, including The Committee to Protect Journalists. They warned that figure could be much, much higher.",

During his first session of Prime Minister's Questions, the gloves did come off. Rishi Sunak was challenged to call a general election. Instead, the new PM told lawmakers that difficult decisions must be made to restore economic stability. At one point, Mr. Sunak was accused of not being on the side of working people.

Gas prices have fallen sharply as winter approaches, due in part to fuel storage tanks reaching capacity and mild temperatures. Another possible reprieve could be on the horizon. A Czech minister says his counterparts in the European Union are on board with supporting a price cap on gas and electricity. It is still split on how to do it.

Actually, early this week, gas delivery within an hour went into negative territory, in terms of the price. Mark Why won't we see this continue? Frankly, Europe right now almost has more gas than it knows what to do with. To a certain extent, this is a success story. It's been hard to procure gas from elsewhere in time for winter. It wanted to see storage facilities across Europe 80 percent full for November. It smashed that. Gas storage facilities are over 90 percent at this stage. It also shows you Europe's limitations. They can't really take in much more. It's also very limited when it comes to LNG, in terms of infrastructure. When we look at some data from Vortexet (ph), about 35 LNG vessels are thought to be hovering, floating around Europe, waiting to be taken in.

Most government offices areclosed as well, because people are having to deal with this. People can't go to school. We went to one school in that report. The school is completely submerged. The water gets all the way over the top of the football goalposts. So that's how serious it is. What's happening here is very similar to what we saw in Pakistan a short while ago. And that is why climate change is often called the multiplier effect. Though, some Nigerians are unhappy about the government blaming this on climate change, because they think it is just plain negligence. The fact that the Nigerian government has not declared this a national emergency tells them that they feel the government says it's overwhelmed but clearly it is overwhelmed and should do more to save the livelihood of the people here, because once water recedes, it is very likely they will find more bodies under this rubble. These lives have been devastating across not just this state in Nigeria but 33 out of 36 states.",
