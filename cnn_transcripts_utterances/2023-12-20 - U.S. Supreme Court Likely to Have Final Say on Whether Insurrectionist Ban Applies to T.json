We don't know where that's going to go, but I do think that both Israel and Hamas, I mean they are under a tremendous amount of pressure I think for the Israeli government, obviously, the public opinion, the public sentiment, the global support eroding, none of that is helping.I think the fact that they mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages, that has been terrible for the prime minister and his government. And then I think for Hamas, the belief among U.S. and Israeli officials was always that once the military operations resumed in southern Gaza, that they would feel that pressure and that at some point, they would think that the pause needed to come back.

There is some discontent about his policies on any number of issues, most presently, Gaza and Israel. And so, he's got a real tall order and a lot of Democrats are like, he has to get to it now.

That is their theory, that things are going to turn around as soon as people feel that we have moved on. They feel the growth in the economy, they feel that the recession which a lot of people predicted would happen this year didn't happen.That's it. Just wait for people to feel like it has improved. Even in Republic rhetoric, they talk about fighting inflation. It's low enough now that the Fed is talking about lowering rates next year. And that's something all Democrats say yes.

In a separate provision of the 14th Amendment, it talks about how the right to vote is -- might not be given to those who have previously been convicted of a felony or other infamous crimes. So, that same provision of the constitution also expressly uses words like \"criminal conviction,\" whereas this section of the constitution talks about the words \"engaged in insurrection.\" It doesn't seem to really require a criminal conviction.So, I think it's a very popular rhetorical point, but I'm not sure it's the kind of legal argument that's going to have as much weight when it gets to the United States Supreme Court.

What did the newspaper articles of the time say, what did the justices' writing at that time have to say about this law. So, I think there's going to be a lot of pressure at least to have an original focus as much as the court can.But there is also no question that for the originalists, it might end up being the kind of case that harms the former president of the United States and perhaps one who appointed them to the court. So, it does set off (ph) these tensions in the court, but I think that's why they are insulated. They hold their offices for life.

So, I think there's a risk that more of these states jump on.And I think the pressure from the Supreme Court will weigh in (ph) sooner than later for no other reason than the practical concern that voters out there now have a very serious question in their minds about whether or not this candidate is eligible to vote for, whether or not he is going to be eligible to serve in office. I think voters are going to want to that certainty and decide, should I waste my vote? Am I risking wasting my vote? Should I vote for somebody else?

So, what communities are worried about is that what you are looking at could become a state problem, a state issue.
