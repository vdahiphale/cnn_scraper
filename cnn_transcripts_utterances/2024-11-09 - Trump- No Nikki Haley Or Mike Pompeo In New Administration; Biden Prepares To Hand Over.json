This is the last race of the presidential race for CNN to call and gives him a final total of 312 electoral votes. CNN's Alayna Treene joins us live from Palm Beach, Florida with more on this.And you know, you might hear that say, well, we already know that Trump is president-elect, but Arizona, it's interesting because he lost, of course, to Biden, right? In 2020 by less than 11,000 votes. I believe it was the thinnest margin between the two. And I think it is a reflection of how he was able to gain ground this time around. And he's already plotting his next administration and who's going to be in it and not Alayna.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So the day after the election, the Biden administration actually moves to limit drilling in Alaska's Arctic Wildlife Refuge. This is a very pristine area in Alaska that is home to many endangered animals. They're trying to prevent expansive drilling in that area. It's just like one of the steps that the administration is trying to take when it relates to protecting climate and energy and environmental initiatives. After President-elect Trump appears ready to issue executive orders and proclamations trying to undo some of the policies of the Biden administration, really the focus in the coming 10 weeks will be for Biden trying to shore up and strengthen the existing initiatives to try to prevent Trump from undoing that.One area where they really want to focus on is trying to get more money and weaponry directly to Ukraine at a time when U.S. Support for Ukraine remains in question under Trump and Republicans in control potentially of both chambers. You also have plans for them to try to dole out and implement the legislation they've passed, like the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate initiatives, also semiconductor chips, manufacturing. They want to get as much money out the door possible there. And then there's the issue of judicial nominations. Biden Yesterday actually nominated two additional federal judges. There are close to 20 now who are still being considered up on Capitol Hill. That's something Senate Democrats are eager to do, trying to get more judges confirmed. But what remains unclear there is whether Republicans will try to cooperate with them in any way. So those that's just a sample of what the Biden administration is trying to do to shore up their work, their legacy. But they also are well aware that there is a lot of stuff that Trump could undo. And he's made it quite clear that there's many portions of the Biden administration that he potentially wants to take executive action on that he just didn't agree with.",

      "sentences": "In the end, I think the answer was no. Some might have done a little better, Some might have done a little worse. Biden certainly himself would have done worse. But as you note from my story, Pam, I mean, you know, we know people are familiar with the idea that when an incumbent president is unpopular and runs for reelection, they've always lost. George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Trump himself in 2020. What's less remarked upon is that even when an incumbent president, who is facing a high level of disapproval, chooses or has to not run for reelection, his party has also lost the White House. Truman in 1952, it went to Republican Dwight Eisenhower. Lyndon Johnson in 1968, it went to Republican Richard Nixon. George W. Bush In 2008, it went to Barack Obama.I mean, the discontent with Biden's performance not the only factor in this election. Obviously, in any election, there are many things that matter, but by and large, by far the most important factor. You know, 60 percent of voters in the exit poll said they disapproved of Biden's performance, and over 80 percent of them voted for Trump. 70 percent of voters said they were dissatisfied with the economy, and over 70 percent of them voted for Trump. That was a headwind that, in the end was probably impossible for any Democratic candidate to overcome. And in many ways, 2022 sent a false signal to the party, kind of a false positive about the degree to which it would be possible to run away from the discontent with Biden in a way that I think ultimately had very profound consequences.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, like as I said before, you know, 2020, there's a really important point here about how 2022 sent a false signal to Democrats. You know, what we saw in 2022 was that in the states where the parties weren't competing, whether they were blue states or red states, in the states where not a lot of money was being spent, Republicans improved everywhere because they were lifted by this rising tide of discontent about Biden and the economy. But Democrats, of course, did much better in 2022, in the battleground states where both sides were competing, places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona, which we just mentioned. And what many people, myself included took from that, was that while the broad discontent was likely to reduce the Democratic position and the popular vote. The Republicans were likely to run better in both Texas and New York in this election.The 2022 precedent suggested they could build kind of a moat around the swing states and in the places where they were knocking on doors and making campaign appearances and buying ads, they could shift enough voters away from their discontent over Biden and the economy toward other issues, democracy, abortion, you know, views of Trump himself. And to some extent, they did, in the sense that she ran better in the swing states, lost less ground than she did in the states that weren't, you know, competitive. But not nearly as well as 2022. It turns out that I think, you know, when people are voting for governor or senator, it is one step removed from voting for president, who they do attribute the authority and the ability to affect those national economic outcomes. And in many ways, this was the key dynamic that the discontent with Biden, the discontent with the economy, the discontent over the border really radiated everywhere. I mean, Trump improved in 90 percent of the counties in the country between 20 and 24. And something that uniform says to me that it wasn't tactics, it wasn't messaging, it wasn't which ad ran in which state. It was a shared national verdict of discontent that really affected voters in all 50 states.",

They're worried about climate change rules. Some states have passed their own vehicle emission standards. But one of the biggest concerns that we're hear so far is over what the President- elect's mass deportation plan will ultimately look like. Several Democratic governors are vowing that their state police will not be involved no matter what that plan looks like. And some others have expressed fear that if they do fight the incoming administration, President Trump may target Federal funding for things like infrastructure projects, disaster relief, and other federal dollars that flow into their states. That, by the way, is why some governors were a little less eager than others to really go after the President- elect immediately.In a state like Maryland, the biggest employer is the Federal government. So their governor, Wes Moore had this to say at a Cabinet meeting on Friday. He said, \"We're ready to push back on this new White House when necessary. But where we can find common ground, we will.\" That was a tone that several Democratic governors in states that aren't dominated by Democrats sort of took.",

Of course, that didn't work. And in the efforts to restrain Iran and its nuclear program, Russia was on the U.S-European side of the bargaining table. Now it's pretty clear that they have switched sides. They need something from the North Koreans, and they're getting it in the form of ammunition, artillery, and now upwards of 10,000 troops. It's not clear what the North Koreans are getting in return. But the expectation in Washington is that they will get help on their missile program and maybe on the nuclear program.So, you know, it's very possible that Putin has concluded that it's in his interest to have a Kim Jong Un with the capability of being able to threaten to hit the United States.

He is accused of killing 14-year-old Liberty Libby German and 13-year-old Abigail Abbey Williams and leaving their bodies near a hiking path more than seven years ago.Now, the case has drawn a huge amount of attention since then and questions remain about whether prosecutors can secure a conviction due to a lack of physical evidence tying Allen to the crimes. Susan Hendricks has followed this case closely from the very beginning. And she wrote Down The Hill: My Descent Into The Double Murder In Delphi. Hi, Susan, and great to see you. So tell us more about this and where the deliberations stand right now. SUSAN HENDRICKS, AUTHOR, \"DOWN THE HILL: MY DESCENT INTO THE DOUBLE MURDER IN DELPHI\": Yeah, Pam, great to see you. It's been so long. If you think about it, those girls would be 21 and 22 years old right now. The family has been waiting so long. Law enforcement has kept very little detail out in the press and most of it to them. And finally, I've been in the trial every single day. We're hearing details and what we have learned is that Richard Allen, while in prison has been confessing to this. We also hear what was on Libby German's phone. For so many years, it was known as the Bridge Guy and what he said dies down the hill. But when you saw what was on her phone, 42 seconds, I was looking over at the family and you heard their voices and they sounded so young. And what we heard on it, were all leaning forward. It was Libby saying, there's no path here. And then Abby saying, do we go this way? Is he behind me? And then dies. And then someone says like scared, and then down the hill. So we've heard that, we saw crime scene photos, Pam. Libby was completely naked. Abby was dressed in Libby's clothes. So for years authorities knew this. But they do have an unspent bullet in between the bodies that the authorities say is Richard Allen's gun. But nothing, as you said, you can explain that away, the battle of the experts, as it goes.

He walked her down the aisle. But I believe it's him and those confessions. But the Defense explains that away and says this. Look, he was in a maximum-security prison. No other inmates had been in there that weren't convicted, innocent until proven guilty. He should have been in jail. Well, the authorities say, look, we couldn't hold him in Carroll County. He would have been hurt because all the talk about killing two young girls. So we put him there and then he was a suicide risk to himself.So he was in a special area. But the Defense is saying that's not true. He's in solitary confinement. He was losing his mind, and therefore he confessed. But, Pam, I heard about seven confessions that they played. I'm not saying that where he was didn't affect his mind, but he sounded very calm, saying to his mom, I did it. I killed Abby and Libby. Oh, no, you didn't. That place is messing you up. No, I did. Why would I say I didn't if I did, as calm as that. But you never know. So it really -- the family's on kind of high alert, pins and needles, wondering. It could just be a holdout. But today, this is key. They asked for the evidence of what's on Libby's phone and an interview he did in 2022 to say, hey, we're looking at you again.
