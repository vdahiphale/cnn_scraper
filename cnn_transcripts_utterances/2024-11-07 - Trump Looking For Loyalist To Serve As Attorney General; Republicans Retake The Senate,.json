Former President Trump is now president elect Trump, and he's headed back to the White House with a mandate to carry out an expansive agenda, one well beyond the economic issues that swayed many Americans to vote GOP. We have new reporting on who may be going with him and what they're planning for day one.Plus, you can't love your country only when you win. President Biden just restated that message to the nation in the White House after Donald Trump's resounding victory over his own vice president. And the blame game. Democrats are in deep despair, and they begin their long and arduous journey of examining how their coalition crumbled. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with the seismic shift coming to Washington. In 74 days, Donald Trump will retake the reins of this country with a Republican controlled Senate and potentially entire GOP legislative branch, at least run by the GOP. First, the question is, what is the Trump team going to do when it comes to who they're going to hire? And we're talking about 4000 government positions. Right now, the president elect is clearly focused on his top roles in the new administration. Sources say, those could be announced in a matter of days. And one of the top qualifications needed for those jobs is classic for Donald Trump loyalty. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach, where she's been working all of her sources in Trump world.

Like, we're going to be trying to absorb the equivalent of water coming from a fire hose, pretty much every day. So maybe the best way to digest it all is to take it with bite sized pieces. Let's start with John, where she talked about the attorney general, chief of staff also, but attorney general, because I don't think that there is a position in the future Trump cabinet that is more consequential for how he intends to very open about how he intends to use the government, use the Justice Department for his own. I wouldn't say benefit, but the separation right now that Joe Biden put in, which is the traditional way to do it, is going to be blown right open.",

The Supreme Court has said, presidents have pretty much blanket immunity. The constitution doesn't say the attorney general has to be some distant, far away figure. That has just been an American norm. Donald Trump does not follow American norms.The old saying in Washington used to be personnel as policy. A lot of people out there think Trump doesn't care about policy. I think that's a mistake. He doesn't care about the minutiae policy. He's not Bill Clinton. He's not going to be going looking for the semicolons in a document. But we know he cares about immigration. We know he cares about certain issues that he's going to push. And we know that he learned from his first experience when he found people fighting back against him, what he calls the deep state or establishment Republicans, the Rex Tillerson, the Jim Mattis. Those people aren't coming to Washington. Trump is bringing a team that he views, that you know, that are with him. That when he says, jump, they say, how high. So, his team is going to be his people this time, they learned that lesson. For better or worse, they learned that lesson. The bigger question for me is, you know, he's going to have a Senate majority. How big, right? Is Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, and the one or two other voices who might say, please sir, no. That's too much, sir. No. I suspect not. I think one of the things -- yes, Trump's going to bring his people. The biggest thing to me is that the Republicans who used to stand up to him, are gone.

We have not called that yet. In the House, it's trending to become a Republican led House. We've not called it yet because there are several seats in California that are outstanding.But it is, once again, if the Republicans do hold the House, it's going to be a narrow majority. And one-party rule. Yes, you can get a lot done, but it's difficult to legislate in one-party rule. You have to be really coordinated to get things done. People have a different variety, different ideology within the House Republican Conference. You have to worry about people in swing districts, swing states, people like Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins in the Senate, which is why that one additional seat that Dave McCormick could get a pad to the Senate Republican majority, could be hugely significant. If you lose, Collins and Murkowski and one other, you can still pass something with J. D. Vance breaking the tie. So, every vote so critical, but it's going to require a lot of coordination.

I mean, there is a long list of people, but at this point there's a long list people who want to be in the cabinet, who want to serve right around him. So, this will be fascinating. But the biggest sort of dynamic here is that Trump knows much more about this job than he did four years ago or eight years ago, excuse me. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: Good. It's not just that Trump knows more. It's also the apparatus that has been built out in the lead up to this. So, Heritage Foundation has worked day and night basically since the first Trump administration, to train to figure out who would be loyal, to make sure that they have civil servants that they can put in there. I mean, if Trump moves forward with one of his plans that he tried to execute at the end of the first administration, which was to make it so he could have more political appointees across the board. Then you're going to see the gutting of the civil service and him putting in more of his political appointees that are already waiting in the wings, because groups like Heritage Foundation have had them ready to go.",
