And of course, certain factors had to align meteorologically speaking, a low- pressure system that stalled out near the Arabian Peninsula, a record high amount of atmospheric water vapor, of course, also involved.And really just a confluence of weather events that is not common but does happen occasionally over the Arabian Peninsula, conspired to produce what was truly an exceptional rain event. In fact, in Dubai specifically the amount of rain that fell was around a double that of the annual average and really shattered any previous record for the amount of rain than had ever been observed in a single day in this part of the world.

This is not the case.\" Russia, Georgia's neighbor who it fought a brief war with in 2008, has a similar law on foreign agents and is widely viewed as being a suppression of civil society and press freedom. Georgia's ruling party still aspires to become a full E.U. member, but the block has described the law as not in line with E.U. core norms or values. President Salome Zourabichvili has promised to veto it, but the Georgian Dream seemed prepared to foist the bill on Georgians, kicking and screaming. Sebastian Shukla, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Humanitarian group Islamic Relief says many young children could soon starve to death in a crisis that's been largely ignored by the rest of the world. And CNN's Larry Madowo has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fourteen thousand killed. More than 8 million people forcibly displaced from their homes. Accusations of rape, murder, and horrific abuses. Sudan is on the brink, begging the world to see what's happening and send real help. BASHIR AWAD, SUDANESE RESIDENT (through translator): All countries of the world are busy with the rest of the world, but we are third-world countries. No one is concerned about us. That is why we all suffered. MADOWO (voice-over): Suffering so grave that half the population need humanitarian aid. A brutal war between the Sudanese armed forces and a rival paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, just entered its second year. Nothing was spared as civilians trapped in the conflict zone are traumatized. DR. MAYMOUNA AL-BAKRI, SUDANESE RESIDENT (through translator): we were inside our house when we were looted, robbed, and beaten. all of this happened to us. MADOWO (voice-over): The U.S. is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to Sudan. And just days ago, Washington pledged another $100 million in emergency aid, bringing the total amount donated since the start of the conflict to $1 billion. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused the warring parties of blocking vital aid to civilians and egregious abuses. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Both the SAF and RSF have carried out war crimes, including rapes, torture, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses. MADOWO (voice-over): Commanders for the SAF and the RSF have previously denied such allegations. With the world seemingly powerless to stop it, Amnesty International warns that the war in Sudan is likely to continue and cause more civilian suffering.",

A tsunami alert has been issued amid fears it could collapse into the sea.Tuesday's eruptions sent a column of smoke and ash more than a mile into the sky. Eruptions were even stronger Wednesday. So far, no reports of death or injuries, but people have been told to stay on alert for potential dangers like flying rocks, hot cloud discharges, and tsunamis. Well, with chronic hunger on the rise, once again, in Bangladesh, there is a solution, it seems, from one TV show. Some people are calling it the \"Hunger Games.\" CNN's Kristie Lu Stout explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the far-flung corners of rural Bangladesh, an unlikely Internet sensation is making quite a splash, with billions of views and counting, and millions of subscribers. This is \"The S.S. Food Challenge,\" often called \"The Hunger Games\" with a social twist. It's also reminiscent of another global rage: \"Takeshi's Castle,\" an epic gameshow from Japan in which players overcome obstacles to win. While the comparisons are inevitable, the beginnings of \"S.S. Food Challenge\" are rooted in necessity, rather than the sole thrill of it. OMAR SUNNY SOMRAT, CREATOR, \"S.S. FOOD CHALLENGE\": The journey of \"S.S. Food Challenge\" started in 2020. But when inflation began surging in Bangladesh, and the price of edible items go so high, it was a vital topic. Then we come with the idea of giving edible items as rewards. STOUT (voice-over): Rising living costs have been a sore point for Bangladesh, a country where around a fifth of its over 170 million people live below the poverty line.",
