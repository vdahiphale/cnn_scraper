But one very important, sort of, mechanical, to keep the metaphor going, data point is that we do have the way these special grand jurors voted. And I'm looking at this long list, and everybody who was indicted from Rudy Giuliani to John Eastman to Donald Trump himself, 20 said yes, and only one said no, and you know it was very, very lopsided.Going down to Lindsey Graham, Sara, 13 said yes, seven said no. So, it was more split for him. Same goes for the other two now former U.S. senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. That David Perdue got 17 yeses, Kelly Loeffler 14 yeses. So, that to me is very, perhaps, instructive, indicative of one of the reasons, perhaps, why Fani Willis decided, you know what, I'm not going to go there on those. It's not -- even with regard to this special jury, how they viewed the case and how strong the case is on those particular individuals, perhaps it's not as strong. The other way to look at it and we're not really going to get the answer until we talk to Fani Willis and to the people who were in her office, is that she might not have wanted to have that constitutional fight. It's already a very big fight that she is having with -- starting with Mark Meadows. The question of whether or not she even has jurisdiction to be prosecuting a -- Mark Meadows who worked for the federal government. And it is likely she's going to have to have that same fight with Donald Trump. Having that fight with a sitting U.S. senator, who is going to claim that she has absolutely no reason and no ability, no jurisdiction to indict a sitting U.S. senator is probably something that I would guess she saw a bit of a distraction which is why she decided not to go for the indictment there.",

      "sentences": "What's so interesting, Kate, is when you look at the map, the way the special grand jury voted on each of these individuals, I think there are going to be a lot of questions for the district attorney about some of the decisions that she made here. You can see why this is such a valuable tool for prosecutors to, kind of, test their case and see how it's viewed by a jury in the same district.And when you look at the lawmakers, when you look at Former Senator Kelly Loeffler, Former Senator Perdue, or the current Senator Lindsey Graham, you can see the way they voted. You can see multiple people voted no to charging them. That would throw up a red flag to any prosecutor. You can see maybe why she chose not to follow through with charging them. I mean, this special grand jury recommendation even suggested they could have trouble proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt. When it comes to the Trump advisers, and Evan touched on this, the map is different. You see the vote breakdown for Cleta Mitchell, for Boris Epshteyn, for Mike Flynn is actually identical to many of the people they charged. You see only one person voting no. So, it really does beg the question why the district attorney, why Fani Willis made the decision not to pursue charges against those Trump advisers, though we have identified Boris Epshteyn as one of the unnamed, unindicted co-conspirators. So, I think this is going to raise a lot of questions about exactly how she made these decisions. Who to charge like when it comes to Rudy Giuliani or John Eastman, the special grand jury voted the same way they did for Cleta Mitchell. So, was it that Mitchell provided something incredible useful to her? Will she be called at trial? What was her gameplan here? What was her strategy?",

The only one where they recommended charges was that broad issue that I just brought up of overturning the 2020 election. It was not specifically for the phone call that Lindsey Graham made.Now, Donald Trump, the phone call is listed, and it is one of the counts that they voted on for Donald Trump and some others involved. But Lindsey Graham's phone call is not mentioned here at all specifically. Is there anything we can read into that, Tim? TIM HEAPHY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, FORMER LEAD INVESTIGATOR, JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE:  Yes, first of all, the select committee didn't speak to Senator Graham nor Ms. Loeffler or Mr. Perdue. So, other than what's been reported, it's not really clear what their role was. I think for Loeffler and Perdue, they were repeating these false claims of election fraud, and that given their position was arguably part of the scheme to prevent the transfer of power, to undercut confidence in the election. Senator Graham with the direct conversation with Secretary Raffensperger. There's evidence of actual, you know, taking a step further beyond public statements. But the clip you played earlier of his explanation was an inquiry rather than pressurized, you know, attempt to get Secretary Raffensperger to do something. So, I could see why the prosecutor would, based on that potential defense and the, sort of, lack of granular evidence of anything beyond public statements would stop short of charging them. And as Dana said earlier, you are avoiding a huge distraction in litigation over whether this is speech and debate protected. And prosecutors always make these hard discretionary calls about who to include in an indictment. It doesn't mean that there isn't some evidence that would support their inclusion. But for lots of reason, cooperation, avoidance of issues, they're not included. So, absent scene (ph) what they really actually saw or what the evidence is against them that the grand jury considered is really hard to look beyond her decision.",

So, there's just not a lot of information.The rest of the report is, sort of, a recitation of the law and the statutes that may be implicated by the report. There's just not much information to go on. So, that's just -- I will tell you practically, I am a little relieved by that, if I were the prosecutor, because that tells me I feel like I've got less information out there that might come back on that somehow try to influence the jury pool or something. There's just not a lot of information out there. At the same time, I think it gives the defense attorneys, sort of, a good look at other people to talk to, at least these other names as we've talked about that people who were not charged. It gives them, sort of, the witness thoughts. It gives them the grand jurors thoughts. [10:45:00] They'll have experts look at this and say, why -- wonder why they didn't -- won't recommend so and so, or wonder why the vote was different on, you know, Mr. X and -- than it was on Ms. Y.

Like to have it out there now, that a grand jury recommended charges against certain people who weren't charged, tars them or affects them without then any corresponding subsequent opportunity to, sort of, clear their name, right?This is why the grand jury proceedings should be secret. This is a weird process. It's a special grand jury. But it puts people like Kelly Loeffler, and Lindsey Graham, and David Perdue, and Michael Flynn in a hard situation because they've now been, sort of, accused in this report. But there isn't a proceeding at which they will be able to defend themselves.

Were they interested in e-mails between you and somebody else?I mean, you'll get as much information as you can because it's -- if they're not actually cooperating with the state. If they turn around and say, look, I cannot talk to you. You'll have to talk to my lawyer. You can pretty much, you know, read into that, you know, without a Rosetta Stone, you don't need that to interpret the fact that they are probably cooperating with the government at this point. So, you'll get some information like that. I do think again, you may, sort of, look at their role. Look at how their role may have been publicly defined and think about what information the grand jury had before would have made a decision one way or another, and especially as you are count up the votes. But, you know, this is a lot of speculation on a pretty skeletal report. And you know, try to analyze it if you are one of the lawyers representing one of the defendants to see what you can glean from it. And you'll also look to see if there -- are there inconsistencies? Are there irregularities in the process? And I think, probably having looked at this report now, it strikes me that one of the greatest avenues that we'll likely see or most likely avenues we'll see from a defense bar will be to challenge the irregularity of the process and the use of some of these information, ultimately in the indictment. And again, that motion, I think, is likely pending already. But clearly, there was information before it. And we now see that the D.A. is treating some people differently despite the recommendation.

They do not have control over what he puts out onto the internet.We also know that several of his lawyers at various times, at various investigations have essentially begged him to not put anything inflammatory in writing. To not post anything. To not talk about the cases. But yet, he still does. This is the way that he feels, like he is communicating with his supporters, with his voters. But I do want to note one thing, you talked about the importance of this case. When I have spoken to the former president, interviewed him, asked him questions, when I talked to aides around him, they know how serious this case is. And this case really angers and agitates the former president. He has been no -- after his arrest in Georgia, he was very upset, we know that. He was very angry. He was lashing out. This is a case that has continually plagued him. Now, he maintains that he did nothing wrong.

Let's first start with the lawmakers, Senator Lindsey Graham and Former Georgia senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Now, these are probably going to create the biggest headlines here, particularly Senator Lindsey Graham because he's a sitting senator.But when you look at the vote count, sort of, how the members of the special grand jury came back, it's clear they were divided on whether these individuals should be charged. There was a recommendation, but it was not unanimous and it wasn't just one person voting no. So, it's pretty clear why the district attorney would not proceed with charges, because this is the most friendly environment possible for her case, right? You don't have lawyers in the room with witnesses. You don't have a defense presentation. There isn't a high bar. You can indict a ham sandwich, is of course the famous saying. This is not beyond a reasonable doubt. So, if you have problems with a case in -- before a grand jury, you're going to have big problems in a real courtroom. It's pretty clear why she would not proceed against these three individuals. When it comes to the other group that we're all talking about, which is a group of Trump advisers, Cleta Mitchell, Michael Flynn, and Boris Epshteyn. Well, Flynn and Epshteyn tend to advise Trump at the national level, after the election. Where Cleta Mitchell was actually on the ground in Georgia. But here, these recommendations, the math, the votes from the special grand jury, mirror those of people who are actually charged like Rudy Giuliani or Former President Trump. So, that's going to actually raise a lot of questions about exactly why they were not charged. But, Kate, I think another big question that's going to be out there is whether we should have access to all of this. Of course, CNN was one of the media outlets that pushed to have this historic document unsealed. But usually, grand jury proceedings are done in secret to protect witnesses. To give them the freedom and the sense of security to speak freely, and also to protect people who are not ultimately charged. Because now we have all these names out there. We have the math for how they voted in terms of recommending them to be charged, but they don't actually have a mechanism or a process to clear their name besides that fact that they weren't charged. So far in the state of Georgia, what we've seen is consistently they have erred far on the side of transparency. We have cameras in the courtroom, so anyone can watch these proceedings, even the mundane scheduling and logistics proceedings. We also saw the members of the special grand jury. Their names were published with this indictment, and many of them have been doxxed online and faced threats. And now, we get access, again, to this historic document. Its' something CNN and other outlets pushed for. But there is a balance when it comes to transparency, I think that's going to be part of the conversation going forward as well.",
