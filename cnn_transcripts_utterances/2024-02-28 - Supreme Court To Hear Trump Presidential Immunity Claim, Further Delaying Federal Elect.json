ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR, \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\": Tonight on 360, the Supreme Court agrees to decide whether Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for election subversion and throws into chaos the timeline of a criminal trial. Also tonight, new evidence the former president cannot raise the money to pay New York's $450 plus million civil judgment against him. Evidence supplied by his own legal team of how hard up he is. And later, the results of President Biden's annual checkup, the questions it answers and those it doesn't. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin a very busy night at the Supreme Court, where about two months from now, nine men and women will hear arguments about whether president should enjoy total criminal immunity for their acts while in office. Perhaps even up to and including, as appeals court judge Florence Pan got Trump attorney John Sauer to concede, ordering Navy SEALs to murder a political rival. Now, that notion, the need for total immunity, is at the heart of the former president's appeal, which the high court today agreed to take up. It goes to a question as old as the country, are presidents above the law. Oral arguments are set for the week of April 22nd. The court's decision could then come by June. And even if it goes against Mr. Trump, his January 6th trial is on hold until then. We'll be joined shortly by constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe, but first and Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid. So what does this move by the court mean for the former president and for Jack Smith?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, in speaking with sources on Trump's legal team, they're still not confident they're going to win on the merits of this issue of absolute presidential immunity. But they know they are winning on their larger strategy to delay, delay, delay these federal cases until after the election. If Trump is re-elected, he can have his attorney general dismiss Jack Smith and these cases, so great news for him.But this is a considerable blow for the special counsel, Jack Smith. This is the second time the Supreme Court has rejected his pleas to just weigh in and quickly resolve this question of immunity so he can move along with his case. As you noted, these oral arguments are not until April 22nd, so we expect we probably won't get a decision until late June. The judge overseeing the federal election subversion case has said she would want to give the two sides two months to prepare for trial, which pushes it into the late summer, Anderson, and just makes it not impossible, but much less likely that this trial will go before November.",

So the first criminal trial that Trump is expected to face is in late March. It begins on March 25th.Now, this so-called hush money case, the District Attorney, though, frames this as an election interference case. They argue that the hush money Trump paid to former adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election was meant to interfere with that election, to influence it. Now, that trial is expected to go until maybe early May. And then you see the classified documents case is on the calendar. I'll tell you, it's really penciled in for late May. And tomorrow, I leave for Florida because the judge overseeing that case is actually holding a scheduling hearing on Friday. Anderson, it is widely expected that she will delay that case. The question is, will it be delayed once? Will it be delayed multiple times? Will it go before November? It's an open question. Then you see, of course, the political events, but the Fulton County case is scheduled for August. That's when Fani Willis previously said she wanted to bring that case, again, a state case, also a case that's outside the pardon power. But right now, these efforts to disqualify Willis are likely going to delay those proceedings. So it's really a wild card down there in Georgia. If any cases will start in August, and if they do, Anderson, they're expected to go on for months. It's unclear if Trump will be tried. So right now, the only thing we know for sure is that Trump is currently expected to face his first criminal trial in Manhattan, starting in just a few weeks.",

They don't share Jack Smith's sense of urgency and I think there's a couple of ways you can look at this decision to take the case. There is a way to look at it and say, well, they've done Donald Trump a great favor, which certainly they have in the outcome. But there's also some truth to this. This is a classic case that the U.S. Supreme Court would take.I agree with Jeff. I think they're going to rule against Donald Trump. But this is an unknown issue. We've never had a ruling from Supreme Court directly on the question of criminal immunity. It goes to the heart of executive powers, of separation of powers.

And now they have succeeded potentially with this. And Elie saying it is up to Judge Chutkan, of course it is. But you have to look at the legal landscape here and that's what Trump's team is doing. Because, of course, we've also got the classified documents case in Florida that still has to be scheduled. And if it gets pushed and that is something that's happening when this June decision comes out from the Supreme Court, then the Trump team does not believe that this January 6th case is going to go forward because they believe it's going to be too late. They can't just restart that trial immediately in June once the Supreme Court decision comes out and I think that's a really pivotal moment here.

If they shared that sense that there's an imperative public necessity, they could have decided to leapfrog the court of appeals, grant certiorari back in December. Even now, having decided to take the case, it's obvious that the dynamic within the court is leaning very heavily pro-Trump. Because although everyone seems to agree that at the end of the day, the court is not going to say that former presidents have absolute immunity from any criminal prosecution for anything they might do while in office.

It doesn't make any sense to stretch this out this way.Just the fact that they are waiting two months when all of the issues have been teed up, where everyone knows how the story ends is disgraceful, frankly. And the way they phrased the question presented is scary in its implications. Instead of asking whether a former president has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for trying to prevent the next president from taking office, a narrow question, the only question they had to decide, they put the broadest possible question, whether and to what extent does a former president have immunity for acts alleged to be within the reach of his office. Well, Trump alleges that everything is within the reach of his office. Jack Smith alleges the opposite. Right now, it looks like they could decide that broad, abstract question and then send it back to the Court of Appeals for a further decision, applying their new criteria on whether that immunity, whatever it is, and there's not going to be much, extends to what was charged in this case. That is a formula for having this case never decided, especially if Donald Trump wins and gets it dismissed.

Donald Trump attempted to overturn an election and seize power. Our justice system must be able to bring him to trial before the next election. SCOTUS should decide this case promptly.\"Reaction now from two Democratic members of Congress who played key roles during the impeachment of the former president, Congressman Dan Goldman and Jamie Raskin. Congressman Raskin, first of all, your reaction to the Supreme Court taking this up and the timing of what this actually means. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, I reacted very similarly to my friend, Liz Cheney. The people have a right to know what happened and I think the Supreme Court, which is lopsided with gerrymandered right wing appointments, is really slowing things down here. The D.C. Circuit Court opinion was perfectly clear and totally compelling in saying that there was no basis at all to Donald Trump's fraudulent claim that a president is absolutely immune to criminal prosecution for criminal acts undertaken allegedly in pursuit of his office unless he's first impeached or convicted in the Senate, which, of course, has never happened in American history. And so that is the claim of an entitlement to Roy (ph) to be a king, to be a dictator and so it's very dangerous. I hope that the Supreme Court now, having taken up the case, will follow the unanimous bipartisan ruling coming out of the D.C. Circuit and will find that there is no such immunity built in the Constitution. On the contrary, it's totally antithetical to the idea that nobody is above the law and the president's job is to take care that laws are faithfully executed, not to violate the laws by doing things like ...",

Short time later, the nation's oldest sitting president joked with reporters that his doctors think he looks too young.His health assessment comes at obviously a critical time with him facing questions about whether he's physically and mentally capable of serving another four years in the White House. He did not go -- undergo a cognitive test today because the White House said that doctors didn't find that necessary. That's obviously raising questions. Joining us is Dr. Sanjay Gupta, our Chief Medical Correspondent, also CNN's Political Analyst, Kate Bedingfield, former Biden White House Communications Director. So Sanjay, Biden's doctors say he continues to be \"fit for duty.\" What else does this -- the president's health summary reveal or not? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, it's pretty similar to what we saw last year. There wasn't a lot of changes during the interval -- the interval history, as they call it. The biggest thing compared to last year was that he now uses a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. You've heard of this, it basically gives you continuous pressure, so that you can sleep at night. Much of the other things that you may see on the screen there are things that we've known about for some time. He takes a statin medication for cholesterol. He takes a blood thinner because he has atrial fibrillation. One of the biggest things I think that they focused a lot on in the six-page summary was his gait, his walking, and the stiffness of his walking. There's about 20 specialists involved in his physical exam today. Many of them around this issue of his gait, so neurologists, radiologists, orthopedics, physical therapists, and what they concluded and they wrote about this, they said, first of all, we rule out things like a stroke or MS or Parkinson's disease. This is most likely due to arthritis of the spine. Pretty significant arthritis of the spine, but not bad enough where they think it warrants any kind of treatment right now. They say it's about the same as it was last year, but it's obviously very noticeable, which is why I think they spent so much time on it. But that was where a lot of the attention was focused.

I think what they were doing is trying to follow the medical guidelines and also be incredibly transparent. I mean, they put out, as Sanjay was just saying, they put out this report every year.

You may remember this, Anderson, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. This is the one that President Trump took, Former President Trump took a few years ago. And you could -- I don't know it's up on the screen -- but you can see what it's like, numbers and letters connecting that drawing, a three-dimensional cube, memory test, drawing a clock. It takes about 15 minutes or so to do. It's pretty simple. And it's a screening test. It's not diagnostic, but screening in the sense that OK, there's something here, let's explore this a little bit further. Not saying someone has dementia or anything like that, but just more of an indication that we should explore this further. You know, it's not an absolute that he doesn't need it.
