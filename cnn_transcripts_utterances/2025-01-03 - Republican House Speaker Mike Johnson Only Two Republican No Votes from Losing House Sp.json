So Johnson's job hangs in the balance this morning. We've got a brand new whip count.This morning, investigators find chemicals typically used to make explosive devices inside a home as they piece together a possible motive for the horrific terror attack in New Orleans. And breaking just moments ago, the U.S. surgeon general issues a new advisory warning that alcohol, the drinking, could increase your risk of cancer. And feel like your iPhone is spying on your conversations? Turns out it could be. Apple now shelling out $95 million to settle a privacy lawsuit. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner. Kate is out this morning. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. So Mike Johnson is the speaker of the House this morning. The question is, will he be speaker tonight? We are standing by for the vote that could cost him his job. His biggest problem is math. Republicans hold one of the slimmest majorities ever. And if two Republicans vote against him, that could cost him everything and cost President-elect Trump something too. One Republican has already said he is a hell no, that he would still vote against Johnson even if you pulled out his fingernails, which seems like a pretty serious political position there. Let's get to Lauren Fox live on Capitol Hill counting the votes this morning. Jim Jordan right there behind you, smiling to our camera. So where is he? Where is everyone on this vote this morning?",

Just remember, back in 2023, two years ago, then Kevin McCarthy, who became the eventual speaker, he had to go 15 rounds to get that job. It was a five-day battle to get the speaker's gavel. But we are waiting to see whether or not Speaker Mike Johnson is going to be able to do this in the first round. Yesterday on FOX News, around 4:00, Johnson was being pretty optimistic, saying he thought that they could get there in a single round of votes, saying he thought that he would be OK today. But we should just note there is already one hard no, and that is Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. THOMAS MASSIE, (R-KY):  I am the one hell no. They say there's up to five or six who may be voting no. You can count on me to be a no.

Now, we also know they've added hardened security to the area. Just down the street here, there are police patrols still ongoing. But here's the thing.

From that standpoint, we know some of those security improvements will be put in place. There will be hardened. Of course, you talked about that other report, so there'll be plenty of questions about why it wasn't done before now. But New Orleans says it's going to be getting ready for the big events they do.

That maybe alcohol, at in moderation, maybe red wine, maybe it's good for you. Increasingly, that's been going in the opposite direction.And so today the US surgeon general is issuing this advisory, noting that alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity, and notes that even though this scientific research has been emerging, the majority of Americans actually don't realize that risk between alcohol and cancer. In their release, they're noting that alcohol consumption increases the risk of at least seven different types of cancer. And as part of this advisory, the surgeon general is also calling for an update to the health warning labels on alcoholic beverages to include this link to cancer. He notes that there are 100,000 cases and 20,000 deaths associated with cancer that are linked to alcohol in the United States every year, and so those seven different types of cancer that have the link to alcohol consumption are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, esophagus cancer, liver, mouth, throat and voice box cancer. He notes that more than 16 percent of breast cancer cases are attributable to alcohol consumption, Sara.

How about scenario two, if one votes against him and then two abstain, i.e. vote present, then that two would deny Johnson the speakership.
