He apparently told one person that he was going to win in November, that he had upped his resolve for that.And at one point he was asking what the media coverage had been of the second assassination attempt. All of this to say that it does seem as though his reaction to this has been very different than what we saw in Butler, Pennsylvania. Right after that event, we saw him call for unity, say that the country needed to come together and he was the one who could do it. Now we see a much different approach. What we have seen in his statements that he has given, including an interview, is essentially blaming the Biden administration, the rhetoric from the Biden administration saying that is the reason he got shot. I think we have some of the excerpt here from his interview that he did with Fox News Digital where he says he, the shooter, believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris and he acted on it. Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at when I am the one who is going to save the country and they are the ones that are destroying the country, both from inside and out. Again, sources say though that he is in good spirits and that the campaign is not going to change any of its previous plans. He had several events this week in Washington D.C. as well as Michigan and Uniondale, New York. They say everything on his schedule is going to stay exactly the same. Wolf? BLITZER:  All right, Kristen, thank you very much. Kristen Holmes on the scene for us as well. I want to break all of this down with our experts right now.

They are farming that stuff out to the specialists, whether they're from headquarters or Quantico or wherever.They're cutting leads to other field offices like Charlotte and Honolulu to interview family members and associates. This is exactly what you would expect to find. Ultimately, all of that information will come back to FBI Miami. They are the, what we call the office of origin or the lead office on the case. And they will piece together each one of those facts, each one of those elements of evidence and put it in a timeline that allows the investigators and the prosecutors to have the most complete understanding, a truly rich picture of who this guy was, what kind of path he went down and how he ended up sleeping in the woods for 12 hours outside the president's golf club, the former president's golf club, waiting to take a shot at the former president of the United States.

And it sounds like they did, because the system they had in place for yesterday worked the way it was supposed to.The advance agents found the threat, they eliminated the threat, and they got the president out of danger. The problem is the system they had in place was insufficient to identify an attacker with a rifle hiding out probably, I don't know, 20 yards from the tee box for the seventh hole. So, There's got to be some rethinking of the sort of methodology, as they refer to it, that they are using to protect this president under these circumstances. The fact that they didn't know that person was there and that they were there for as long as they were raises some real concerns about how they're thinking about protecting the perimeter, that edge of security, which sometimes can come very close to the principal you're trying to protect.",

Listen, ultimately, this is going to come down to them and it seems like leadership wants to send a message here that the union isn't in the business of routinely supporting Democrats and are making them work for this endorsement. But when it comes to the issues, the vice president maintains that she supports them.

You're not really hearing quite as much of that going on right now, but I will say one other last piece of this is that since the assassination attempt in Butler, you have seen Donald Trump's numbers on a personal rating level, favorable, unfavorable rating go up because in moments like this, you do see Americans unify, rally around political leaders of either party when there are situations like this as it should unify Americans.",

I want to start by saying, I condemn any kind of violence, but political violence has no place in this country. It only seeks, as President Biden said today, it only seeks to divide us, to bring further hatred. There is nothing to be gained by political violence. I have not seen the background. I did just listen to that reporting as to the suspect. It's very troubling, because when people are struggling with delusional ideas, we see what can come of it. It's disturbing to hear what weapons he may have had in the past, weapons of mass destruction and what weapons he had just yesterday. It's disturbing to think how long it appears he was on the property. One report says that he was he came onto the property about 2 o'clock in the morning, so spend some time there. So as I said, I'm very sober about this. Our task force is committed to making sure we get at the truth as to the first assassination attempt. I've been in touch with our ranking member, Jason Crow.

His post said this, and I'm quoting, and no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala. Let's bring in CNN media correspondent Hadas Gold.

He owns, controls one of the most popular platforms where he has the most number of followers compared to anybody else on this platform. He has legions of fans. And he is now also one of the most well-known, I would call him a conspiracy theorist.Now, his post could be incredibly dangerous, because it could be seen as promoting an assassination attempt on the President or the Vice President. Now, as you noted, this post was in response to a user who said, why they want to kill Donald Trump, and then you saw his response. And I think it's important to note that emoji, because that emoji is sort of a, hmm, questioning emoji. Now, he was widely criticized when this came up. And he initially resisted calls to take it down, saying he was just trying to make a point. He later said he was trying to make a joke. But then he seemed to be convinced maybe there's other things going behind the scenes. But another user who responded to said that his intent may be misinterpreted. So then he posts this. It turns out that jokes are way less funny if people don't know the context and the delivery is plain text. He also posted later, one lesson I've learned is just because I say something in a group and they laugh, it doesn't mean that it's going to be all as hilarious and a post on X. Now one thing that's interesting, Wolf, is Elon Musk often seems to violate the own terms and services of his own platform. And one of those rules for the platform is that you're not supposed to incite, promote or encourage others to commit acts of violence or harm. But as I said, he's the owner of the platform. He often flouts his own rules. X did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. They never do essentially respond to requests from the press. We do know, according to \"Reuters,\" that the Secret Service is actually aware of this post. They haven't really commented on it. All they say is that they are aware of it and that they investigate all threats related to their protectees. That's a statement to \"Reuters.\" And also the White House has weighed in calling Elon Musk comments, what they say are irresponsible. Wolf?",

And he has also endorsed some of the biggest conspiracy theories out there, and he often spreads them and promotes them on his out -- on his own platform without seeming to do a basic fact check. He's promoted the false claim that the Biden administration is allowing undocumented immigrants to vote in the U.S. election.He's also been promoting memes related to the whole people eating pets in Ohio, conspiracy theory that has been debunked. And again, he has also regularly flouted X's own rules, for example, not long ago, he posted an artificially generated image of Kamala Harris in a seemingly communist uniform. And X's own platforms say that you cannot do that. And yet he still posted it. But I actually think what's even more dangerous than Elon Musk promoting conspiracy theories is that he has removed the guardrails on X, what used to be called Twitter. He's removed the trust and safety teams, the fact checks and things like that. And that is why these conspiracy theories can now be all over this platform, and often you even see them being promoted on this platform and being placed right in front of everybody's eyes. And that is what is most dangerous.",
