He suggests the jury that found him guilty of falsifying business records wanted to hurt his run for the White House. In a speech at Trump Tower, at the bottom of those famous escalators, he insulted everyone from the judge to President Biden, to immigrants, also Michael Cohen, before walking off without taking questions. Trump and his allies are downplaying the charges as petty and inconsequential, yet, we should note a foundation of American democracy elections are at the hardest case. Prosecutors successfully argued to the jury that Trump engaged in a conspiracy to quote, \"hoodwink\" voters by covering up a scandal involving a porn star that could have damaged his 2016 campaign. Trump chose not to take the stand, of course, he had the right to and testify under oath. He is now accusing the judge of silencing the defense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this helps that probation department come up with a sentencing recommendation for the judge. Both Trump's side and the prosecutors will make their own arguments both in legal briefs and then before the judge on sentencing day of what sort of sentence the former president should get. It's unclear what the prosecution will do. District Attorney Alvin Bragg was asked that yesterday, he said it would be in their papers, so, these are things that will have to come together, but this is a class 'A' felony. It's one of the lowest felonies in New York State, the judge can sentence Trump to no jail time and probation because there is no minimum prison sentence as part of this felony conviction, or he can sentence him to as much as four years in state prison on each count. Now, because he is a first-time offender, he's almost 80 years old, and because Trump is convicted of this non-violent felony, his side will obviously argue that he shouldn't serve any time in prison. Is really unclear what the judge will do. It's up to him to decide what he thinks the appropriate punishment is. Certainly doesn't help that Donald Trump is attacking the judge now as he is awaiting his judgment. But this is -- you know, it is a decision for the judge as he takes into consideration all of those measures and what will be the right amount of deterrence both for Donald Trump and for anyone else, that is a key part of a judge's decision generally, Jim.",

They plan to file an appeal on the grounds the jury was biased against Trump, and the timing of the trial was unfair. We should note that the defense did have the ability to object to particular jurors as part of the normal process. While he is awaiting sentencing, Trump is free to campaign around the country. And early on Friday, he spoke to a crowd about the verdict, maintaining his innocence, and once again, criticizing the judge. So, what is next for Donald Trump after this guilty verdict?

We have Weisselberg who's still doing time for covering up for Donald Trump, and as a result of which, it's hard to imagine the people who executed the cover up are going to do time, and the guy that they were covering up for and headed it all up would not get any kind of jail sentence.

There was polling earlier this year that had as many as 65 percent of independents saying that he should not be president again if he is convicted of a felony. But Jim, I'm not sure how, you know, how predictive that really is. I suspect this is going to be slow burn as people kind of grapple with the question of whether they really can vote for someone who is a convicted felon, be the chief law enforcement officer and commander- in-chief of the U.S. The complicating factor and maybe the controlling factor here is that the voters who are most likely to move away from Trump because of this, are also extremely negative about Biden's performance and dubious that he can do the job for another four years, worried about his age.

We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Rafah early this week, following an Israeli strike against targeting Hamas. And even as we work to surge assistance to Gaza, with 1,800 trucks delivering supplies these last five days, 1,800, humanitarian crisis still remains. I know this is a subject on which people in this country feel deep, passionate convictions, and so do I. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You can see that over the course of the last several weeks, a big swath of Eastern Rafah buildings have been flattened and turned into rubble. That is not the case, we should note, right now in Central Rafah, where the Israeli military today, for the first time, said that they are now operating.

Thanks very much, Jeremy.Well, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Ukraine can expect a very robust NATO package at the Alliance's Washington Summit that's taking place in July. Today, Blinken is wrapping up a meeting with NATO foreign ministers, that's happening in Prague. This meeting follows U.S. President Joe Biden's decision this week to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons for limited strikes inside Russian territory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine. And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved the use of our weapons for that purpose. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, this is certainly a significant decision by the Biden administration,as the Ukrainians for a while now have been saying that they're essentially fighting with one hand tied behind their backs, where they're getting attacked by the Russians from Russian soil towards the Kharkiv area of Ukraine. And they can't really fight back with those Western-made weapons if they were to fire into Russian territory. Now, the big difference now is that the Ukrainians are going to be able to fire back using U.S.-made weapons, but only in a restricted manner. Now, they can hit Russian troops that are amassing on the Russian side of the border, getting ready, for instance, possibly to attack Ukraine. What they could also do, for instance, is they could try to shoot down Russian jets using U.S.-made surface-to-air missile systems. Of course, the Russian Air Force recently has been a lot more effective than before at targeting Ukrainian positions, in some cases with some pretty heavy munitions. One of the things, however, that the Ukrainians are not going to be able to use is some of the most potent weapons that the U.S. has given the Ukrainians, those longer-range ATACMS missiles, with which, for instance, they could hit the air bases that Russian jets take off from. So, they can now use American-made weapons to target Russian territory, but only near the front lines in the Kharkiv area, or towards the Kharkiv area, where the Russians are conducting that new offensive. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian president is saying that this is a good first step. The Russians, for their part, of course, absolutely irate about all this. The Kremlin is saying that, of course, this means that those U.S. weapons, and as they put it, the handlers, would also become targets for the Russians. How this will change things on the battlefield is unclear. Nevertheless, for the Ukrainians, this certainly brings with it a lot more combat firepower that they could now use defending that very key front line, Isa.",

Keep on fighting, Mr. President.\" We've also heard from Italy's Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini. He actually described the conviction of Trump as judicial harassment in his words. And he said, \"In Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the left, who,\" he has said \"for years has tried to eliminate political opponents through legal means.\" And, of course, important to note that these are countries where we do see a significant far-right political presence. On the other side, we have seen some of the U.S.'s closest allies being a bit more diplomatic in their responses. There was a question put to the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, earlier this morning. He said we wouldn't be expected to hear from the British Prime Minister commenting on another country's domestic politics or judicial processes. He said that he is squarely focused on this country's election. Of course, we're both in election years. Both countries will have to work together regardless of who is elected. So that is certainly a key point of focus here in the U.K. And that was certainly expressed by the opposition leader, Keir Starmer, who said that he has respected the judicial processes of the United States, but that this is an unprecedented situation in his words, but even so, that the U.K. would work with whoever is to be elected in the U.S.",
