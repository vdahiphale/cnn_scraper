And that really suggests that there is likely a lot going on here that we don't know about. And this case could be more complicated than it seems at present.Now, in order to take on this task, Robert Hur, he's going to have to create a staff, a team. He's going to need resources. Potentially his own office. This deals with classified information, so people will need the right clearances, perhaps the right facilities. And many of the people he could tap for this are already detailed to the other special counsel's investigation. So, he has a lot of work to do over the next few weeks to set up his office, set up his team and move forward with this investigation. And we expect he'll likely issue subpoenas, he could interview people. Unclear at this point, certainly, if he'll use a grand jury. And, of course, a big question about whether or not the president himself would ever answer questions in the course of this investigation. Now, in terms of who is Rob Hur, how will he approach this job, we spoke with many people who worked with him yesterday, including his former boss, Rod Rosenstein. He said that Hur was actually his liaison between Rosenstein's office and the Robert Mueller investigation. So, he knows exactly what he is getting himself into. And, Erica, he has sterling conservative credentials. He appears to come from central casting. You know, Katelyn, our other colleagues, we were talking to ourselves earlier this week, we're like who -- who could they possibly get to take on this job? This is exactly right. Attorney General Merrick Garland absolutely nailed this selection.",

You know, I was struck, just about 24 hours ago exactly, I was speaking with former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, who told me -- I asked him specifically, what would the threshold be here for a special counsel? And he said, it comes down to a question of whether they believe there's reason to open a criminal investigation. Caroline, based on, again, what we know publicly at this point, does this say to you that there is perhaps evidence of criminality with these documents that were found amongst President Biden's papers, or do you see this as a political move of the attorney general trying to save face here?",

And I think Paula really hit the nail on the head in that this would lead me to believe that there is more that hasn't been reported because Renato is absolutely right, the threshold matter to even get to appointing a special counsel is that Merrick Garland had to believe there was some basis to pursue a criminal investigation. And based on all the reporting we've seen thus far, that just isn't there.You know, historical prosecutions of this nature show that there has to be an aggravating factor. Not all unauthorized retention of classified documents is criminal. And so, you know, obviously the aggravating factor in the Mar-a-Lago case was the obstruction, right? Here, we don't see any of that. We see that the documents were immediately turned over to the National Archives. DOJ was informed. There doesn't seem to be that extra hook. Unless Merrick Garland is making just a purely political decision here, I think that there has to be something that we're not privy to.",

I think, if I may just take one more moment, what has been happening in recent administrations that has not been really discussed very much since all of this broke is that there has been for some years a sense in - among people who work in the executive branch of the government that classification of documents is important, but it's not critical, so that - so that in every administration I can remember recently there have been people who walked away with documents because they wanted to write books, they wanted to write memoires, they wanted to have something they could take to their publishers. And there's got - there got to be a sense that, how do you sneak documents out to play with however you want?So, I attribute a lot of this to the kind of sloppiness and to the view that Pat Moynihan, Senator Moynihan, put forward a long time ago, and that is, we put classifications on too many documents, there are too many secrets, and, as a result, people get complacent about what it is that's -- that's classified.",

If the House Ethics Committee finds anything, then they will take action. Also, if the federal investigators, if there's any charges that are brought, conference rules would strip him from any committee assignments. But he is allowing the process to play out. And when I asked him about the concerns, the very real concerns being from a number of his own colleagues, from even some Republicans about the national security implications of allowing someone who has questions about his past, who could face potential fraud charges from Brazil, to have classified briefings, McCarthy didn't seem to have that much of a concern.

But the one thing I do know is that you apply the Constitution equal to all Americans. The voters of his district have elected him. He is seated. He is part of the Republican conference.

An incredibly rare occurrence. And with the support of Kevin McCarthy for him to continue to serve, it is unlikely that that would get that -- reach that threshold. So the only possibility of him stepping aside is if he were to simply decide it is time to resign. And what we have heard from George Santos time and again, he is not resigning. He refuses to do so.
