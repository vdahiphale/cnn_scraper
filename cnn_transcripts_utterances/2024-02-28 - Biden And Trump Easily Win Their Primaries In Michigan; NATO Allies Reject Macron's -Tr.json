And breaking news, evacuation orders issued in Texas as dangerous and fast-moving wildfires spread across hundreds of miles. (MUSIC)",

It's wonderful to have you with us. Voters in Michigan have spoken. President Biden and Donald Trump easily winning their primaries last night, making a November rematch more likely than ever. But the outcome did expose weaknesses in both candidates. Biden captured roughly 81 percent of the vote, but 13 percent of Democrats checked the uncommitted box. Their way of protesting the president's support of Israel in its war with Hamas. President Biden did not mention those detractors in a statement that he released last night. Instead, he simply thanked the Michigan voters. Meanwhile, Donald Trump easily defeating his only remaining Republican challenger, Nikki Haley, in a call to supporters, Trump looks ahead to the general election, telling them, quote, we win Michigan, we win the whole thing. But of course, Nikki Haley's still hanging on. She told CNN's Dana Bash last night she's going to continue to campaign and is looking forward to Super Tuesday in just a week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We are in all the Super Tuesday states now. That's what this is all about, is making sure that we hit every state and let you know, look, there is a voice out there for you. There is a way out. Yes. We are fighting through. Yes.

Thanks so much for being here. I want to start with the uncommitted vote. And if were able to put the Italian where it stands up on our screen. That would be great because it is significantly larger than organizers had even initially set their own bar for. They had said that they wanted to get at least 10,000 votes. That was about the margin, there it is, in Michigan back in 2016. But look what they where they landed, that is ten times the goal that was set, that is 101,000 votes its actually closer to the margin of victory that Joe Biden had in the general election in Michigan in 2020, which was about 150,000 votes. I mean, that is a very strong message there. What does this say right now about the state of the Democratic Party? And what do you think it says about what may happen in November?",

This was a big moment and it goes to show just how important issue of Israel and Biden's handling of the situation in Gaza there, how big an issue that's going to be. We've seen this divide in the Democratic Party. You know, since the attack on Israel in October and the fall of that, we've heard again and again from more progressive and younger voters who are upset with the way Biden has whole heartedly backed Israel and they want to see a change there.And this just a very practical in real warning that this is to be taken seriously. This is not something to be brushed off. Again, this is an issue that is particularly important in Michigan. So, we are looking at something that this state in particular is going to care about more than potentially other swing states come November. But still, Michigan is a very important swing state.

They are voters who are giving warning signs to both of the top candidates on either party, reminding them that there are voters who are not thrilled about them becoming the nominees.And Nikki Haley did receive hundreds of thousands of voters in Michigan who said that they wanted someone other than Donald Trump and that's something that Trump is going to have to contend with. We know that they are very aware of the Trump campaign, of their issues with suburban voters. And this is again just another sign that they need to figure that out before November, if they're going to have a chance at winning election for the presidency, right?",

A NATO official and several European leaders also stressed that there are no plans to send in ground forces. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator):  In a very good debate, it was discussed that what was agreed from the outset among ourselves, and with each other also applies to the future, namely, that there will be no ground troops, no soldiers on Ukrainian soil sent there by European countries or NATO states.

I mean, it's absolutely seismic and extremely worrying for a lot of people around the world. But, you know, just as interesting was that follow up where you had all of these European leaders coming out, stating really clearly that they had absolutely no plans to send troops into Ukraine. And obviously, this all plays massively to Putin. All he wants is to create this divisiveness in the West. He wants to see it all breaking down and that's, you know, I think from Moscow's perspective, it was -- you know, this weird sort of self-flagellation across Europe. So, helping Moscow's narrative ultimately, when I think it was intended to sound as though that this was Europe being tough against Moscow.",

So European countries, America are the aggressors and the ones that cause the war in Ukraine.Obviously, our perspective on it is that he went into Ukraine illegally and he's the aggressor. But this allows him to suggest that you got -- this won't be under the banner of NATO because I'm sure America wouldn't sign up to it, but its NATO countries in Europe going -- coming towards the Russian border and attacking it. So it works on his, in his favor on the international stage in terms of discord, but on the domestic stage as well. In terms of the fact that NATO is on the attack, not him.",
