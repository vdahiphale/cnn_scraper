We're going to show you -- this is what the skyline there looked like just about 15 minutes ago.We've also been keeping a close watch on Southern Gaza, specifically Khan Yunis where explosions -- new explosions have been reported. I spoke with a doctor last hour who described what they are up against right now in Southern Gaza trying to treat patients. But he said they are -- said it is terrifying and supplies are running out. And we also have news from Israel. These are the pictures of two lives lost. The Israeli-American -- an Israeli-American and her granddaughter who were thought to be hostages of Hamas, but who are now -- have now been found dead. This is according to their family. 80-year-old Carmela Dan and her 13-year-old granddaughter Noya Dan were kidnapped from their kibbutz by Hamas in the October 7th attack. According to a relative who lives in the United States, the IDF confirmed their death to the family yesterday. John?",

But as recently as this morning, they said there could be 203 hostages in Gaza. This would be their 13th day in captivity.With me now is retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, CNN military analyst. We talk a lot about what might be happening in terms of an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza, which could be coming soon. But I want to ask you directly and you put together this slide here. What do you think we can expect from Hamas in the coming days? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, your team, first of all, the NEWS CENTRAL team helped me put this together. Because what we did is went -- we went through a couple of after-action reviews from the 2014 Operation Protective Edge. And what struck me, John, is everything that think tanks, scholars, both in the U.S. and in Israel said Hamas was going to do, we've seen so far. I mean, more rockets, we know about that. But expand the tunnel complex. They're doing that. And we've seen that in some of the maps we've talked about. Incorporate new tactics. Boy, the operation on the seventh of October, a land, air, and sea approach with squads doing assaults on cities with the great intelligence that you all had been reporting about, that's new tactics and technologies. We haven't seen a terror group do that at that level of sophistication yet, in -- at least in my career. We have good allies, all of these individuals. And by the way, I misspoke this morning. I said PMC. It should be professional military groups --",

But across the area, Hamas wants to get more support for what they're trying to do.And then finally, and this is probably the most interesting thing, expand the victim doctrine. That's been the recurring phrase and a lot of these reports that date back to 2014. What's the victim doctrine? Well, it's members of these terror groups and the surrounding area saying everything that happens, that's not good, blame it on Israel. Denigrate their reputation as a nation-state, especially their Israeli Defense Forces and their intelligence community. We've seen that since they wanted this operation. We saw it within the last few days on a hospital. As soon as it was attacked, there was the message. Hey, this is an Israeli rocket, when now proof seems to indicate that it was not.

Compare that to two years ago where it was just 41 percent who said the Israelis. And the Palestinians were right behind it, 30 percent.

Do your sympathies lie more with the Israelis or the Palestinians? What we do see is a tighter split here. But still, the plurality clearly says Israelis at 48 percent, Palestinians that just 22 percent.That is a drastic change from where we were two years ago where in fact the plurality of Democrats sided more with the Palestinians at 46 percent to the Israelis at 23 percent. So, we've seen a massive shift overall. And that is driven in large part by the massive shift we've seen among Democrats, perhaps responding to Joe Biden's such strong message in support of Israel.",

He's 18 points underwater. Look at the U.S.-Mexico border, he's 40 points under. Look at Israeli policy, he's actually above water, a plus three percentage points, 21 points higher than his overall job approval rating.

Is there that distinction in your mind, in the other direction? Are people -- do people separate Jews from Israelis?COTLER-WUNSH: So, first of all, it's a very important question because criticism of the government, any government of any democratic country, is not only acceptable, it's a must in democracies. And we know Israelis more than any, plenty criticize their government. The difference is, and that's where the antisemitism piece and the masks are off is between criticism and de-legitimization. The questioning of Israel's very right to exist, identifying or holding up signs that say we are Hamas, is like holding up signs after October 7 that say we are al-Qaeda, we are ISIS, we are Nazis. Where we have to be very clear for Jews and non-Jews alike that it is not to do with criticism? The genocidal terror that attacked Jews on October 7 does not see any place for the state of Israel to exist in any borders. It de-legitimizes its very existence. And that is a very important differentiation, including that's in the IHRA, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism that clearly stipulates that there's a difference between criticism and de-legitimization.",

And I have heard you note in other conversations that the civilians in Gaza are not to blame for the terrorism of Hamas. You have three children who are currently serving in the IDF in the midst of all of this. What do you say to those -- and we've heard from these demonstrators in the Arab -- on the Arab Street, what do you say to them who say the lead up to this, this is the fault of Israel how we got here?COTLER-WUNSH: Anybody who cares for the Palestinians in Gaza or anywhere else, anybody who cares for peace, anybody who cares for humanity needs to be speaking up unequivocally against one thing only. And it is the genocidal terror organization, Hamas, that holds those Palestinians in Gaza as human shields. Actually, their headquarters are below a much larger hospital than the one that we heard of the other day. They are not only human shields and weapons, there are human sacrifices of an organization that has no value for human life. There is no ability to conflate between Palestinians and Hamas, the genocidal terror organization, and we have to remember. But one proxy of a genocidal regime in Iran, alongside many other proxies that are fueled by the same genocidal understanding of our civilization, the only place that goes is destruction. And so, I implore anybody who cares about Palestinians to understand that Hamas is holding civilians as human shields, as weapons, making sacrifices, preventing them from being able to arrive at the humanitarian corridors created, stealing the humanitarian aid that is provided to Gaza, launching rockets. As we speak, more than 6600 rockets have been launched in the 12 days alone since this began from densely populated areas in Gaza without any regard for the civilians it's endangering in a double war crime as they target the children in Israel.",
