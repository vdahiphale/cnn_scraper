This is empty Capitol, so the ones who have decided to rush Donald Trump's defense are the ones who have in large part been coordinating with him behind the scenes, trying to make the case in their view that the Justice Department was biased for going after Trump in this time of the campaign season, and in their argument, these Republicans saying an attempt to distract from the House GOP investigations into the Bidens. That is the message from Speaker McCarthy himself, who said everyone in America could see what was going to come next. DOJ's attempt to distract from the news and attack the frontrunner for the nomination, President Trump.Now, there have been few Republicans who have been alarmed by all the contents in this indictment. One of them was Senator Lisa Murkowski. She is one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Donald Trump at the second impeachment trial. She said in a statement yesterday, she said that additional evidence presented since then, since the second impeachment, including by the January 6th Commission has only reinforced that the former president played a key role in instigating the riots, resulting in physical violence and desegregation of the Capitol on January 6th. And of course, Dana, silence still from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said very little about Donald Trump since after saying that he was practically and morally responsible for the violence that day.",

That's the central element of what we laid out and the facts that we found, and then once they gravitated to the rally, once they gravitated to the fake elector strategy, they decided to have that event, a culmination of all of their work, where the president knew he was going to out there and speak. He knew he was going to whip up the crowd and point to the Capitol and to say that he was going to march with them. That was the central point of that day, was his effort to point to the Capitol and to tell them -- tell the crowd of rioters that they needed to give some spine to the Republicans. BASH",

This trial will be held where I am, in Washington, D.C. 92 percent of the residents here in Washington voted for Joe Biden in 2020. The judge is an Obama appointee. You might have just heard Ron DeSantis making the argument that they would potentially indict -- not only indict but convict a ham sandwich because of those realities here in Washington.

He's not entitled however to his own version of facts. And so, it's going to be up to his defense attorneys, as well as prosecutors, to simply lay out the facts and to ensure that this is a jury of our peers. That's how the justice department -- that's how the justice system works and to ensure fundamentally that there aren't two sets of justices. And that's what was so important about our work to chase the facts, to make sure that we laid out the evidence, and to ensure that ultimately accountability is held.Mitch McConnell had talked about accountability.

What about the indictment? Not commenting. At this point, his posture is to let others make that case, to let the prosecutors make the case, to let other Democrats to make the case, and he has been hands off. I think he is trying to figure out that messaging, but for now, if Trump's argument to the center or to the few radical persuadables is that the Biden Administration is trying to censor rivals, it makes no sense for the president to take the bait.",

We'll see how successful they are in doing it, talking about the need for norms and democracy, and trying to stay away from the specifics of this case.

His Vice President, his Attorney General, his Director of National Intelligence, his top cybersecurity official, his senior White House attorneys, his senior campaign staffers, state legislators, the court, they all tried to communicate the truth. Mr. Trump, the Special Counsel says, knew what happened, knew the truth, that there was no election theft. So he tried to be the thief allegedly and turn the power afforded to him by the constitution into hammer to break it.Mr. Trump now hopes the constitution he wanted to throw away will save him. His lawyers claim it is the constitution that allowed their client to lie without care or consequence. A verdict of four more years may spare Mr. Trump from a prison, but such a verdict may sentence democracy to a far less-fortunate fate. And that is an important conversation to have because we understandably talk about every single new development, the new nuggets in the indictment. But, we wanted to kind of take a step back and look at what this all means in totality, when you have this kind of indictment by a man who is trying to be president again.",

I think it is critical to look at these indictments separately. There could be indictment fatigue, if you will, because it sounds like there is so much. I was in Michigan yesterday, talking to voters and a Michigan State Republican Senator who endorsed Donald Trump the first time around, was really dismayed by this. And he said, \"Yes, it is empowering the former president,\" but he urged caution because he was talking about what's in this indictment versus the other. So he believes the democracy portion of this, the January 6th portion of this is different than the others.But more than that, it is about the office. This is not just about Donald Trump. As I was flying back to Washington this morning, looking over Mount Vernon, George Washington left the White House, left the presidency after two terms. That was the plan, the model. So it is about more than Donald Trump.",

Often you hear Republicans talk about a deep fidelity or a deep allegiance to originalism. This is a former president, as Peter Baker outlined in his piece, called for eliminating the constitution, so it would benefit him. That's in deep conflict with the philosophy that Republicans have espoused for decades. And so, these are the larger questions that we have to grapple with as a country.",
