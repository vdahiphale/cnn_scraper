      "sentences": "Yeah. Sara, what's really fascinating about Gabbard is that if confirmed, she will be perhaps the most markedly or most publicly anti-surveillance official to ever lead the part of the U.S. government that is tasked with doing surveillance on foreign entities.In 2020, back when she was still a Democrat and she was in Congress, she introduced a series of bills that would have been pretty profoundly antithetical to how the intelligence community thinks. Two of them were aimed at persuading the government to drop its prosecution of Edward Snowden, the former national security agency contractor who revealed the existence of bulk NSA collection of Americans' data back in 2013, as well as Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. Both of these men are seen really as almost enemies of the state within the intelligence community even as they've attracted some support from kind of the sort of libertarian wing of the Republican Party as well as some progressives in the Democratic Party. Gabbard also, in 2020, introduced this piece of legislation that would have wholesale repealed one of the most powerful surveillance authorities that the U.S. government has to spy on foreigners overseas -- something called Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Now, that is legislation that has drawn some criticism from civil liberties advocates who say that it impinges on Americans' data privacy as well, but to wholesale repeal it without replacing it would be tantamount, according to some former U.S. intelligence officials to effectively blinding the commander in chief. This is an authority under which as much as half of what's known as the president's daily brief is drawn from every day. So whether or not Gabbard as DNI would be able to actually kind of dismantle this program unilaterally probably a really logistical task -- a really logistically difficult task that would face a lot of pushback. But it really speaks to this kind of profound distrust that she has in the intelligence community and the people that collect intelligence on foreign entities, and in ways that could potentially reshape the way the intelligence community gathers and spies -- gathers information and spies on American adversaries, Sara.",

      "sentences": "All right, with us now, Christine Quinn, executive committee chair of the New York State Democratic Committee and president and CEO of WIN. And Shermichael Singleton, CNN political commentator and Republican strategist.I want to go back to the news that broke overnight about Pete Hegseth -- the details inside this police report of this incident -- this alleged sexual assault that happened a few years ago, the details of which he denies. But I want to read a Wall Street Journal editorial. This is from the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal -- the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal. And this was yesterday, before the details of the police report came out. It said, \"Mr. Hegseth denies wrongdoing. But the senators holding confirmation hearings next year also might inquire about what, if anything, he told Mr. Trump's transition team regarding the woman's claim and the legal settlement. Whoever leads the Pentagon needs to have the president's trust. If Mr. Trump wasn't informed about this political liability before announcing the nomination, he might reasonably wonder what else Mr. Hegseth hasn't told him.\" Shermichael, what about that? SHERMICHAEL SINGLETON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well look, The Wall Street Journal is owned by Rupert Murdoch. I mean, this is certainly not a small editorial from the editorial board, and I would imagine the president- elect is probably aware of it. I mean, it is important if you're advising the president-elect and you're on the transitions team. Part of the process is to vet some of the individuals that he would like to consider. And it is important this early on to try to protect the principal as much as possible. He just had a great election -- a great election victory. Republicans won across the board. And objectively speaking, John, you want to be able to hit the ground running hard with that significant amount of report and the mandate that many Republicans argue that the president-elect has, particularly for the first 90 days, to try to move the needle on some consequential issues. And so the question becomes if you're an adviser how much political capital would you like for the president-elect to expend on some controversial picks? He's not the first person to nominate individuals that have had some controversy in their past. And so I think the question is when you're doing that negotiation with some of those Republican senators you have to give them the opportunity to question these individuals. And the individuals obviously have the right, I would argue to defend themselves against some of the claims and allegations out there. But again, this early on, is this what you want the focus to be? And ultimately, the president-elect is going to have to make that decision.",

And if that is who they want, your job as an aide, as an adviser is to do what you can to attempt to move the needle forward. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be successful though. And I'm almost certain the advisers to the president-elect are probably saying sir, if this is what you want, we're going to try, but we can't guarantee our success.

And that's something the Biden administration has been attempting and been very careful to mitigate the risk about. So, yeah, those are all things that are part of this.

But the fact of the matter is he's being appointed to what, in my opinion, is probably the most important ambassadorship, NATO. Because an ambassador in a normal country talks with the president of that country. He does some messaging for the United States. But the ambassador to NATO takes votes as part of the 32-member NATO Council. So this is an individual who would be basically sharing information with 32 other countries in Europe. And with the turmoil in Europe right now, not just in Ukraine but in other countries, that NATO ambassador becomes very important. And they have to know detailed military assessments, military operation, and that's not something you learn off the cuff if you've never been in the military -- and Matthew has not. So that appointment concerns me as well given the fact that President- elect Trump said he wants to pull out of NATO.

And American has been trying this out at a few different places -- some smaller airports, like Albuquerque and Tucson, but also one of its bigger hubs just outside of D.C. here at Reagan National Airport. And it says they'll be rolling this out at Austin-Bergstrom, which is a really big destination, and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International, which is the busiest airport in the U.S. for the holidays, and then about 100 additional airports behind that. This is pretty critical, the timing here, because American is expecting about 8.3 million passengers over the Thanksgiving rush, 77,000 flights. You might ask what if I'm flying with somebody in an earlier group, like a companion or something? And American says they've actually thought of that.
