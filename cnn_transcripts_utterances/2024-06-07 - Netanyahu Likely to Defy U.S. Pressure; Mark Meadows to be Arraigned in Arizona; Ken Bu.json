And it concluded that Netanyahu is likely to continue to defy pressure from the Biden administration and from the international community to define a really clear vision for post-conflict Gaza. Remember, Netanyahu has been in this - in the middle of this very tense balancing act in-between the right-wing elements of his very fragile governing coalition and the demands of the United States and the west.Now, the CIA, in its assessment circulated this week, found, quote, that \"Netanyahu probably believes that he can maintain support from his security chiefs and prevent defections from his right wing of his coalition by discussing the future of Gaza in vague terms.\" Essentially, Netanyahu likely believes that he can by himself a little time here by only talking about what a post-war vision for Gaza would look like in really vague and undefined terms. Now, this is largely what CNN and others have reported. But what's significant here, Kate, is that this assessment really highlights the degree to which what the U.S. intelligence community and what the CIA believes is likely to happen in Israel is in direct opposition to what the Biden administration wants to happen in Israel. The Biden administration has been putting an enormous amount of pressure on Netanyahu to both bring a close to hostilities and come up with a really clear picture of what security and governance is going to look like in Gaza once the fighting stops. Now, as we saw earlier, Biden, of course, has indicated that he believes Netanyahu is listening to him, but the CIA assessment really highlights the degree of divisions within the Israeli government that may make it difficult for Netanyahu to do what it is that Biden wants.

The Arizona attorney general is alleging that Meadows participated in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona. And today, Mark Meadows will be informed formally by the judge of those criminal charges he faces. They include a felony conspiracy count, a felony count of fraudulent schemes, and felony forgery counts. Now, those all relate to the fake elector plot, the effort to organize and submit those fake certificates claiming that Donald Trump won states like Arizona, when he actually did not. And, you know, Mark Meadows is not the only person who's expected to appear before an Arizona judge today. Mike Roman, who's a former Trump campaign aide, we do expect him to similarly make his appearance before a judge. And like the other defendants in this case, which include Rudy Giuliani, and which include all the fake electors from Arizona, Mark Meadows and Mike Roman will be expected to have their mug shots taken, just like any other criminal defendant.",

You haven't seen all the facts of this, the details of this indictment in case, of course. But how much trouble do you think Mark Meadows could be in in Arizona? REP. KEN BUCK, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, if he's convicted of all the charges, it will be a substantial term. It's obviously a state case in Arizona, not a federal case.
