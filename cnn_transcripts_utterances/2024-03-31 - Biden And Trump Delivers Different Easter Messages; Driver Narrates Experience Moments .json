      "sentences": "Hi, everyone. Welcome to the \"CNN Newsroom.\" Thanks for being here. I'm Omar Jimenez in New York. Tonight, the two candidates for president are delivering very different messages this Easter Sunday. Joe Biden is wishing Christians everywhere a Happy Easter and saying, quote, \"with wars and conflict taking a toll on innocent lives around the world, we renew our commitment to work for peace, security and dignity for all people.\"Donald Trump, on the other hand, lashing out with dozens of angry posts in all caps on Truth Social, blasting his political opponents, prosecutors and judges, saying, in part, \"Happy Easter to all, including those many people I completely and totally despise because they want to destroy America.\" This, of course, just a day after sharing an image of his political opponent, Joe Biden, tied up and bound in the back of a pickup truck. Trump tonight is appearing to test the limits of his gag order in the New York money case where he's going to face trial in two weeks. Trump is also ramping up attacks against the judge in that case. Judge Juan Marchand's daughter posting a link to an article showing her picture just days after attacking her as a, quote, \"rabid Trump hater.\" So, here now to discuss this and more is CNN senior political commentator and former senior adviser for President Obama David Axelrod. So, David, look, a lot of times on holidays like these, we do see contrasting messages between former President Trump and others in high office. What do you make of these two very different Easter messages?",

He takes these holidays and he turns them into prophecies of catastrophe ahead unless he's elected. And, you know, this is this is how he rolls. This is his message that the world is doomed, that the country is doomed unless he is elected and everything's going badly. And, you know, he's the strong man who can change it.And, you know, I mean, this is sort of baked in the cake. The thing about the judge and his daughter is something we should spend some time on, though. You know what he's clearly doing, he's got a trial coming up in late April. That trial could very well end in a conviction, a felony conviction for him that carries with it significant penalties. I think he's concerned about that. And what he is doing is what he always does, which is he is branding it. He's branding it as a vendetta, a political conspiracy. He's trying to link the judge to Biden through his daughter's political consulting firm. And he's trying to cast doubt about the whole process so that if it does go against him, that he can dismiss the whole thing as a political vendetta. And he's going to keep talking that up. The danger, Omar, is that people listen to this. And he put the judge's photograph in his feed. And, you know, these are -- this is very, very dangerous. I mean, we saw it happen before the midterm elections, the attack on Paul Pelosi intended for Nancy Pelosi. You know, people take his word seriously. We saw it happen on January 6th.",

He and not just the president, but all those who support him and all those in positions to speak out should be speaking out about this.I mean, what it does remind people is what you're buying with Donald Trump. You know, you're buying this kind of incendiary rhetoric, this dark, menacing rhetoric that divides and incites. But it's also important as president of the United States to try and calm things down. And I think he should be very, very clear that, you know, we can compete and we can have competing visions. What we shouldn't be doing is inciting people to the point of violence and putting innocent people at risk. And that's what President Trump or former President Trump is doing with his rhetoric.",

I do think Biden -- Jonathan Martin wrote a column in the \"Politico\" on Friday asking why Biden wasn't contacting more of these Republican leaders who have said they can't be for Biden. And what he can't do is promise them that they're going to agree on every issue although certainly with Mark Esper, they probably have more in common on national security issues than Esper had with Trump. But they do agree on the fact that democracies rest on fundamental rules and laws and norms and institutions.

We think a lot about what it means to be a Christian in America, but what we don't want is a Christian America. And what Donald Trump is doing is acting and selling -- by selling this Bible, is acting as if the documents of the founding of our country, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, should sit inside the same book as the scriptures of the Christian religion and the Jewish religion.

CAMIKA SHELBY, SON DIED BY SUICIDE AFTER ANTI-GAY BULLYING: Never in a million years did I think I would pull up at home and find my child lifeless.

      "sentences": "We're cooking.ROSALES (voice-over): In 22 days, Camika will mark five years since Nigel, remembered as warm and gold-hearted, died by suicide after he was bullied for being gay. Do you still talk to him? C. SHELBY: Yeah, yeah. It makes it -- it's like a comfort thing because I believe he can hear me. ROSALES (voice-over): Last year, she settled a more than $800,000 civil lawsuit with the Huntsville City Board of Education in the death of her son. Part of the deal required several district-wide policy changes to better acknowledge and protect LGBTQ students, including an update to its anti-discrimination policy, specifically prohibiting harassment based on a student's sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. Now, she questions whether Nigel's legacy is at risk. C. SHELBY: If these bills actually go into play, what was I fighting for? Who are these bills actually protecting? ROSALES (voice-over): In Montgomery, a series of bills are advancing that opponents warn are intended to slowly chip away at LGBTQ rights. One determines gender as dictated by your birth certificate. Another bans non-approved flags, including pride flags, from flying on public property. Then there's House Bill 130, dubbed as \"Don't Say Gay\" by opponents. The bill intends to broaden a 2022 law to all public K-12 grade levels and flat-out bans instruction and discussion about gender identity and sexual orientation. REP. MACK BUTLER (D-AL): This bill just strengthens the law that's already in place and goes a little bit further, making sure that we keep a political agenda or a social agenda out of our schools and let children be children again. ROSALES (voice-over): HB 130 would also prohibit teachers from displaying flags related to sexual orientation. Groups like the ACLU of Alabama fiercely hitting back against the legislation, saying it would rid Alabama classrooms and students of inclusive discussions. Republican Mack Butler, who represents the town of Rainbow City, authored the legislation. He argues these conversations belong at home.",

Camika argues his bill amounts to alienating and erasing students like her son. C. SHELBY: It's dangerous. You are basically making it official that they don't have a safe space. School is not supposed to be a place that would make a child want to end their life. ROSALES (voice-over): Representative Neil Rafferty, Alabama's only legislator who publicly identifies as gay, mourns the bill could seriously interfere with the school curriculum in unexpected ways. REP. NEIL RAFFERTY (D-AL): It is a super problematic bill. It has become so vague that can even talk about Martha Washington being married to George Washington because Martha Washington was a woman, wife, right, who married a man, George Washington. So that's a heterosexual relationship.",
