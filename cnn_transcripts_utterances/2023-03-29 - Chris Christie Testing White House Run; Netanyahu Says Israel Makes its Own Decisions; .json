And it sort of worked in the sense that Marco Rubio came in fifth in that crowded field. The problem is, Chris Christie came in sixth. And after close to 200 appearances in New Hampshire, he got, I think, 7 percent of the vote. He made more appearances than anybody else. He'd staked his whole campaign on New Hampshire. So, he -- I can understand him feeling nostalgic going back to New Hampshire. He had all of those high hopes in 2016, but it crashed and burned back then, and it sounds like he may be setting up to do it all over again.",

I read this as him saying, this is not going anywhere. You know, that both substantively but, more importantly, politically, Donald Trump is talking about the past when elections have to be about the future.

But it is very good to see this. And, frankly, it's something that would have been unthinkable a while ago. And I think for the audience, it's important to keep in mind that, you know, in the decade or so since the Sandy Hook massacre, you know, you've got Every Town for Gun Safety, you've got Moms Demand Action, you've got March for Our Lives. You've got things like this chaplain speaking out. It's good this is going to come from below. You know, we've seen and we've exhaustively covered the fact that Congress seems to be stuck, paralysis.

But yesterday we heard those frustrations just burst into the open. These were very sharp critiques by the U.S. president, who, in addition to saying that he hopes a compromise will be reached and that Netanyahu will just walk away from this original plan, he also said that Netanyahu will not be coming to the White House in the near term. Typically, the Israeli prime minister is invited to the White House for an official visit quite quickly after coming into office. It has now been months. And now it doesn't seem as though this is going to be coming anytime soon. That underscores the frustrations that the Americans have with the Israelis.But as you noted in the introduction there, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, although he talks about the alliance between the U.S. and Israel, and he talks about how he is committed to bringing a, as he says, a broad consensus on these reforms, he is pushing back, essentially saying, don't get involved into our business. And we're hearing even harsher critiques from other members of his government. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister of national security, saying Israel is not a star on the American flag. And even others going further, saying that the Americans are being fed what they call fake news on what this overhaul will do. But this is an incredible critique that underscores currently the situation, the relationship between the Americans and the Israelis that has -- you know, Joe Biden talks about -- he has been a stalwart supporter of Israel for so many years. Netanyahu talks about how he's known Joe Biden for more than 40 years. They talked about what a great relationship they have. This is really a crisis moment in the relationship between the Israelis and the Americans and the opponents here, the opposition in Israel, are critiquing Netanyahu, saying that he is in dangerous Israel's most important relationship, its strongest ally, one that is vital for Israel's security.

So, we're drawing in that cold air from the north.Now, go back a week when we had that storm intensify and approach the San Diego Bay region, or San Francisco Bay region, that actually created all the wind and power outages. Well, it's not going to do the same. It's actually going to stay offshore as it strengthens. But what I'm really concerned about is later this week when it starts to interact with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico. Now, there's severe weather setup setting up across the nation's midsection. So, that's a major concern. Look at the storms lining up over the past month or so. We've had about 12 atmospheric river events. And, of course, that's created flooding concerns, but also done quit an exceptional thing to our drought conditions, eradicating extreme and exceptional drought across the central valley compared to last year to the current status. Now, impressive snowfall totals, as Don just mentioned. Some of the snow burying houses. This is video coming out of mammoth mountain where they've been shoveling over, get this, 50 feet of snowfall. They're about to set their record for the most amount of snow later today, when it starts to snow from the storm I showed you just a moment ago. Similar picture kind of unfolding across the Sierra Nevada's. This is broken up into three different sections, northern, central and southern. Get this, the southern Sierra Nevada's has never had this much snow. They're sitting at 283 percent snow water equivalent. So that's compared to average to date. And that's, of course, going to pay dividends once we get into these warmer spring and summer months. But, of course, if it gets too warm too quick, rapid runoff, rapid snow melt, and that means the potential for more flooding. How does this compare to average? Well, we didn't even break average for the past three years, but this year we're going into the stratosphere.
