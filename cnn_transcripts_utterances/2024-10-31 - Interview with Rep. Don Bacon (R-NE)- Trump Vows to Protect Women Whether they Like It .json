We can't forget that this is the first presidential election since Roe vs. Wade was overturned, making abortion rights a motivating issue for many voters, specifically women, which former President Trump at times has struggled to appeal to.And now he's promising to protect women, whether they like it or not. That's despite some advisers warning against it. Joining us now is Republican Representative Don Bacon from Nebraska. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. I have to start asking you - REP. DON BACON (R-NE): Thank you, Boris.",

I have to start asking you about those comments from the former president, in part because to let our viewers know, you were locked in a tough re-election battle in a district in Nebraska that's centered around Omaha. It's a district that President Biden won.And so the presidential election, in large part, will affect turnout for your race. I wonder what you think of former President Trump saying that he would protect the women of our country, whether they like it or not.",

      "sentences": "I'm not too sure what he means by that, Boris, I'll have to ask him. I would say abortion in Omaha is about the fourth highest issue and priority. The economy is by far the number one issue. Then it's border. Then it's crime.And I would say also in Omaha, we have a very large Evangelical and Catholic population. So it's not totally one-sided. It maybe leans a little more there. But I just try to share with people, at least when it comes to the federal level, when you have a filibuster, you're never going to get an abortion law passed anyway. It's all going to be at the state level. And I don't think it's, in reality, a very high level issue at the federal level because it will never be voted on. SANCHEZ: So essentially, would you say that you support a federal abortion ban, as you apparently told a Nebraska newspaper, I think earlier this year or last year, but you just don't think it's actually feasible to accomplish?",

Though we should point out that the Democrats are saying if they're in charge of the House, the Senate and the president, they want to get rid of the filibuster. I think that would be a mistake.Now, I did say I would support a late-term federal abortion ban. I think it's a shame if you've got a healthy mom and a healthy baby to have abortions at the seventh, eighth and ninth month. But by the way, most Americans agree with me on that, too. I mean, I think it's only like one out of five adults support a late- term abortion ban for a healthy baby and a healthy mom. And so I think the majority of Americans would agree with me on that.",

I don't think you did it on the latest time it came up. You also deleted parts of your website kind of outlining, as you described it, a pro-life stance and that showed that you had perfect ratings from groups that support a national abortion ban.I just wonder, it's got to be difficult for someone in your position to talk about this issue realizing that Republicans have had a hard time at the ballot box connecting with voters on this, right?",

I mean, they want to we want to probably make some modifications, try to make it better.What I have found is if you're a low income earner, ACA is great. You get subsidies and you're getting it at a lower cost. You got pre- existing condition coverage -- that I've always voted for, by the way. But what's hard is if you're earning about $90,000 between you and your spouse or individually, you lose all those subsidies. And what we have found is people are paying triple in many cases of what they paid prior to ACA. And so some people are hurt by it. Some people are helped by it. And my position would be and I believe the speaker's position as well. Let's keep making it better. Let's keep making it more affordable. There are some great programs out there that we should look at. I'll give you an example. In Omaha, there's an insurance company that when you walk out of the hospital, they pay your entire bill right up front, right as you're walking out. And the hospitals will charge you half when you pay that back quickly. And so therefore, that insurance company is able to have, you know, charged its customers half the premium. So my point is there may be some ways that we can modernize and find ways to cut costs. We should do so.",

He said he's working with a small group. He would not tell me who he is. He wanted to remain anonymous.But he had enough information and photographs that would seem to indicate he is part of this. He also explained their reasoning. He said this is really about what he put as resistance fatigue, essentially saying that so many voters, so many Americans have become desensitized to what he and others see as the former president's worst qualities. And so we wanted a week away from the election for this to be front and center in people's faces in states like Philadelphia, which is the statue that you're looking at right there. That one popped up in Philadelphia yesterday, in states like Pennsylvania, I should say. That appeared in Philadelphia yesterday. It is Trump, an eight-foot statue replica of him strategically positioned right behind a sculpture of a naked woman there. And on the plaque right below the statue is Trump's quote from that infamous Access Hollywood tape where he boasted about kissing and grabbing women. The city of Philadelphia hauled the statue away yesterday because they didn't have a permit for it. But I can tell you an identical statue to that one popped up in Portland, Oregon over the weekend. That one was vandalized. It was beheaded. It was destroyed by people and it vanished into Monday morning. But we now know that four of these statues in three locations, Portland, Philadelphia and here in D.C., have popped up in recent days. The replica desk you mentioned, as well as the tiki torch in Freedom Plaza by the White House, which we have learned was destroyed yesterday by somebody who was arrested by Park Police. So clearly a lot of people do not like these statues. And the man that I spoke with, he said, we're five days away from Election Day. There could be more art, but we'll see.",
