What is the plan? Will it be in the daytime or the nighttime? But the NYPD wanted Columbia to agree to be the complainant, to be the one that called the police, to be the one that asked for this action. So, what we're going to see now is they will set their police perimeter, around the perimeter that the students had set, outside Hamilton Hall. They will issue the verbal warnings that you are to disperse, to the people outside. Those people will have a choice, which is they can stay in place, and face arrest for criminal trespass, or disorderly conduct. Or they can disperse. And they'll get that chance, when those warnings are given. Then they've got to make entry. And that's going to require the Emergency Service Unit, whatever cutting tools they need to use, to get past barricades that have been put in place. And then, those people, who are inside the building, will be arrested, charged with criminal trespass, suspended by the school, where they contemplate further action, including expulsion. But as Chuck Ramsey said, a moment ago, this isn't going to happen over five minutes. The warnings have to be given. They have to be given a chance to disperse. The entries have to be made. The building has to be searched, quite a large building, top to bottom, to look for people in place, people who may be hiding. Then the building has to be cleared. All of those people, who are charged, or arrested, are going to be taken to the Mass Arrest Processing Center, or MAPC, as they call it downtown. They have buses set up, where they'll begin to process them even before they're brought down there. And some will be issued summonses. Some may be held over for court. But this is an operation that as we look at it at 9:18 PM, is going to go on for the next several hours at least.",
