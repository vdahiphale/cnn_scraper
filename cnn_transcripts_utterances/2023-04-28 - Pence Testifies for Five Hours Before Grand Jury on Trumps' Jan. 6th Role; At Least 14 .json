I can't wait to watch the rest of the rounds to see who gets drafted next, where that's going.But we start this morning with big headlines coming out of Washington after former President Donald Trump tried but failed to stop his former vice president from testifying. Mike Pence, of course, appeared before a federal grand jury investigating Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. It is the first time in modern history that a vice president has actually been compelled to do so, to testify about the president that he served alongside. Pence is now the highest ranking Trump White House official to testify in Jack Smith's probe. We know that the special counsel wanted to question Pence about conversations he had with Donald Trump leading up to January 6th. Pence rejected Trump's demands to block Joe Biden's victory and, of course, there was that heated phone call the morning of the insurrection. That's when Trump called Pence, quote, a wimp and another vulgar word, according to White House aides who have testified. Not long after that call, we watched as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol chanting, hang Mike Pence, forcing him to run and escape to a secure underground location. So, the Secret Service agents who were guarding him for months, Pence did refuse to testify in the special counsel's probe until a judge ordered to do so. As we know, he also never talked to the House select January 6 committee.",

I would start with the morning of January 6 with that heated phone call with the president. No one else has testified directly about the conversation. The only accounts we got were second hand. And then I want to walk the vice president through the day, look at one point, as our evidence showed, he was about 40 feet away from rioters inside the Capitol. That puts a personal perspective on those events. This is not just about the Constitution and electoral certificates. This is about real people who are in real danger. So, I think Jack Smith will methodically walk him through his day and then he'll probably want to ask about all the things the president did not do, did not call him, did not check on him, he was not involved in any of the phone calls about the deployment of the National Guard or other things that the vice president was doing to secure the Capitol.

But this is a firsthand account.So, they'll want to know context. They'll want to get actual words. They'll want more detail than he said to the Federalist Society in his big speech or he has said in his book or subsequent interviews.

We didn't ultimately get a decision from the vice president that he was not going to cooperate until the very end. Because you want to sort of build up to that by getting as much information that will inform those interviews. So, it does suggest to me that Jack Smith is going everywhere, where there is potential evidence and he may very well be, since he is hitting these substantial witnesses close to the end.",

If you look up there, you can still see the smoke coming out of the apartment building there. A missile just slammed into this building.We know that on site now and while we've been here we've seen another two bodies carried out. At least 15 people killed here, we understand, three of them children. We talked to an eyewitness, who was one of the first people on the scene here. He said he could hear women and children screaming in the rubble. I'm just going to walk you through this rescue and recovery operation that's going on here right now.

I don't if, David, you can get in to see them behind me, but there is line of firemen scouring the ground there where that digger is trying to pull the rubble out. This is an apartment building that has 46 different apartments in it. The missile struck here at 5:00 in the morning while people were sleeping. So, most of the victims so far, we understand, were all asleep in their beds. There are dozens injured. And, frankly, we've been talking to the officials here, they still don't have a real accurate figure of how many people they're still searching for. One of the rescuers we talked a couple of minutes ago told us they still believe there is another couple of children in there that they're trying to find at the moment. And there is a line of relatives I'm looking at over there desperately waiting just beyond that big crane there, desperately waiting for news about their loved ones. This is a slow and difficult process. Of course, Ukraine and the officials here very, very familiar with these devastating Russian strikes.

Alabama's Quarterback Bryce Young was picked first by the Carolina Panthers, a huge night for Alabama. Two of his other teammates were also picked in the top 12. I love to see Will Anderson, as the Houston Texans also snagged Ohio State Quarterback C.J. Stroud as the second pick before trading up to grab Will Anderson at number three.

He fell entirely out of the first round.For more analysis on all of this, let's bring in Ryan Clark, who is an NFL analyst for ESPN as well as a former pro-Bowl Safety and Super Bowl champion with the Pittsburgh Steelers himself.
