I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We're now just three days away from the first primary of the 2024 presidential election in New Hampshire. And the candidates in the Republican race are looking to win big there to put them on a solid path to the nomination. Former President Trump and Nikki Haley are both hitting the granite state hard today while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is speaking with voters and hoping to gain ground in South Carolina, a state that holds its GOP primary in about a month. We have teams covering all the twists and turns on the campaign the trail. Let's get started with CNN's Omar Jimenez in rather frigid and snow but very pretty Manchester, New Hampshire. Omar, this could be a pivotal race. Nikki Haley is making a big push to try to gain the momentum she's been talking about from Iowa. What is she saying and doing today?",

And as you mentioned, yes, a very critical primary coming up in a few days that could really set the tone for what we see the rest of the primary schedule. Her campaign has tempered expectations a little bit, saying that even a strong second place finish would be acceptable for them.That said, it's hard to imagine given the amount of ground and the lead that former President Trump has built after his landslide victory in Iowa, that that would set them up in a good way. Now, what we have heard from her so far today is that she has been on the offense against former President Trump, in particular criticizing something he said at a rally last night at a rally where he appeared to confuse Nancy Pelosi with Nikki Haley when he said Nikki Haley didn't do enough on January 6th. Well, Nikki Haley wasn't in D.C. that day, wasn't even in elected office at that time. Take a listen to some more of what the former South Carolina governor had to say.

They've been getting stronger and stronger and stronger over the past decade, to the point that the Iraqi government is putting pressure on the United States to pull all its troops out of Iraq.But this attack today, the mayor of a nearby town who had a good view from a distance of what is happening, said that multiple, multiple missiles were being fired at the air base and that many of them were intercepted. But some, we know, got through, U.S. service personnel injured. We don't know how many and we don't know how severe. And also this is a joint base as well, Iraqi troops there. The Iraqi commander has said that at least one of his soldiers was injured. We don't know how badly that soldier was injured. But these Iran-backed militias that operate in Iraq have been responsible -- and operate in Syria, by the way, as well -- have been responsible for 143 attacks against U.S. service personnel in their bases in Iraq and Syria the Hamas attack October 7th here in Israel. These are connected. These militias in Iraq and Syria, and specifically we're talking about Iraq here today, are proxies, if you will, of Iran. They get funding. They get support, they get training, they get weapons from Iran. So this strike at Al-Asad Airbase injuring U.S. service personnel today, it seems, we don't know explicitly, but it would look as if it might have been a response for what the Iranian feel and saw was an attack on them in Damascus today.",

He was convicted of killing his pregnant wife Laci and their unborn child, and he was sentenced to death in 2004. That sentence was overturned by the California Supreme Court in 2020, but the conviction was upheld. And now the L.A. Innocence Project says key evidence was missing from his trial.Beth Karas joins us now to discuss. She's a former assistant district attorney. And you covered this trial extensively for Court T.V, Beth, we probably even talked about it a million time, but how surprising does this come to you now that the L.A. Innocence Project believes that there's more to it and really wants to look into it further? BETH KARAS, COVERED SCOTT PETERSON FOR COURT T.V.: You know, I suppose I'm not all that surprised, because of the good work that the Innocence Projects all over the country do. However, I do think this is an uphill battle for them. Let them test whatever the court will allow. I'm sure the prosecution will turn over discovery they claim they don't have from the original trial. But I really don't think it's going to amount to anything. Many things that they're talking about were dealt with by the Modesto police, tangents about sightings of Laci and the timeline and whether or not she was pawning jewelry. They were having financial problems before she was killed, and whether or not she pawned a watch that showed up and maybe somebody connected to this watch is somehow involved. All of that stuff had been examined and investigated by the Modesto police. But if they want to do it all over again, OK.",

      "sentences": "Look, the police went down the most obvious route, the person they believed was responsible right from the night that Laci was reported missing, when Scott told some people he had been golfing, and then when the police are there in the park looking for her Christmas Eve night, he told them he was fishing in the bay in a boat nobody knew he had 90 miles from Modesto. And they said what were you fishing for in the bay? And he didn't have an answer. He was stumbling for the kind of fish he was fishing for.Then when they looked at the boat, they're like, this isn't like a saltwater boat. It's a little boat that wouldn't do well in choppy water. It's for fresh water. Moreover, he had fishing tackle for fresh water. He was not fishing. He was coming up with a story for the police. Right from the get go the police knew his story wasn't adding up. When they had a command center and he was supposed to be putting up fliers of the missing Laci, he's sitting in his truck making phone calls, not putting up any fliers. Those little things he did after the fact which raised their suspicion. So then they had to go back and take a look. Now, this whole effort to get this reexamined again is based on there being a burglary across the street from the Peterson home the day that Laci went missing is what the Innocence Project and others believe, or believe that Scott is innocent. But that was examined. The burglary was a day later. It was after Laci disappeared, and the burglars were interviewed. I've seen the report. They were like, oh, it was Christmas and I didn't have gifts, and obviously the people across the street weren't home. The mail was in their mailbox, so we broke in. WHITFIELD: So given the track record of the Innocence Project, pick your jurisdiction, why would the L.A. Innocence Project risk its reputation if it didn't feel pretty sound that there's more there that should either call for a new trial or exoneration all together, because isn't that at the root of why they would involve themselves?",

And there's a difference between there not being enough evidence to support a conviction and actually the wrong person. They're saying the wrong person. I can buy an argument that maybe there's not enough evidence to support it because it's all behavior. It's like his behavior and how he was acting and the affair and his actions after the fact. But the wrong person, highly doubtful.But this is what the Innocence Project does. They look at cases they think have a good shot at perhaps turning up some relevant exculpatory evidence. So I don't know that it would hurt their reputation if the van mattress that they're going to test for DNA, hopefully, and see if Laci's blood is on it turns up nothing. That won't be surprising to me, but if it does turn up something, well, I'll be darned, because I do not think that they're barking up the right tree here, but who knows? They have done good work in the past, and I am a big supporter of the Innocence Projects around the country.",
