And, later, the FDA just approved the generic version of a GLP-1 injectable, making the drug more affordable for people who have type 2 diabetes. Hello, and good morning. I'm Rahel Solomon in New York, and you are in the CNN NEWSROOM. This morning, American Airlines is boarding flights again after a -- quote -- \"technical issue\" forced the airline to briefly ground all planes, plunging travel plans across the country into chaos on Christmas Eve. CNN's Lucy Kafanov is with us from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, and we also have CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean, who joins us from Washington. Pete, let me start with you. How big of a problem are we talking about, and how much do we know about what exactly caused it?",

      "sentences": "It's going to be a bit of a struggle here, Rahel.And American Airlines says it's all hands on deck now to get things back to normal. What we know now is that this was an outage of a system that is key to American getting flights boarded and on their way. The carrier has about 3,900 flights scheduled today. And here is the good news for the half-million people traveling on the airline, no major cascading effects just yet. Here's the latest data from airline analytics from Cirium. About half of all American flights departing from its Charlotte hub are departing late, about 20 percent departing late from Miami. But the big thing to underscore here, no major cancellations just yet. So the real story now is delays. And American spokesperson Sarah Jantz tells me that's to be expected throughout the day, but today's airline schedule really a fraction of what it was yesterday and most of the travel rush has already happened. And American insists to me it does have the staff in place to get things back on track quickly. This outage really started about 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, flights held on the ground by American for about an hour. Also impacted American regional flights operated by its subcarriers, meaning a lot of folks on morning flights or connecting flights waiting and waiting. This is the new statement from American. \"A vendor technology issue briefly affected flights this morning,\" American says. \"That issue has been resolved and flights have resumed. We sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience this morning.\" History has shown, Rahel, that these airline technology issues can have a huge impact. And, in July, the crowd strike outage caused a meltdown for Delta Air Lines. It canceled about 5,000 flights in total. And, remember, it was only two years ago that Southwest holiday meltdown was just starting. It canceled 15,000 flights over a week. The Department of Transportation has been pretty hard on airlines, trying to keep them accountable for these meltdowns. And outgoing Secretary Pete Buttigieg says the Delta investigation is still ongoing, but airlines are really hopeful that the new Trump administration may be more sympathetic to them when it comes to things like we saw today.",

And now we're trying to get a better understanding of exactly why it has taken so long. We have learned that the suspect went into the hospital overnight. We don't know the details of why that is just yet. But you're looking at an image of Sebastian Zapeta-Calil. He's 33 years old. And that was yesterday when they walked him out of the precinct where he was processed. Now, we know that he came into the United States in 2018. He was deported shortly after that. And then, at some point, he made his way back into the country and eventually up here to New York City in the last few months, where he has been staying at a number of different homeless shelters throughout the city. Now, we are expecting the suspect to be facing murder-in-the-first- degree charges, as well as arson charges, after police say he walked over to a woman who was sleeping inside of a subway car and set her on fire. We have seen the images of the suspect following that incident, which were critical and helped police find him. He was arrested several hours after the incident. Now, although the suspect has not appeared in court yet, we have been in touch with the Brooklyn district attorney.The incident took place in Brooklyn, and he has said this about the incident. He said that: \"The depravity of this horrific crime is beyond comprehension. This gruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman will be met with the most serious consequences.\" That's from the Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez. Now, we are expecting the suspect to be arraigned, but the fact that he is now hospitalized certainly raises questions about just how much longer it's going to take before he appears in court and presumably enters a plea in this case. In the meantime, Rahel, we are also waiting to learn more about the victim. Law enforcement officials believe that the woman also was homeless, that she was likely taking shelter inside that subway train where she was sleeping early on Sunday morning when this horrific incident happened. It is -- the details are really disturbing. And although crime in the city's transit system has improved in the last few months, it is these types of incidents that are very high-profile that continue to place a focus on this really complicated issue of homelessness, mental illness, and people who are in the subways and creating a public safety concern -- Rahel.",

His lawyer said that she's concerned that her client can't get a fair trial. The judge assured her he would. Mangione faces 11 counts in New York, including one for first-degree murder and two on second-degree murder. Now, if found guilty of the top charge, Mangione could get life in prison without parole.

There's a whole long internal process at DOJ. As a prosecutor, I have done this, have to fill out this long packet of paperwork. You send it down to the attorney general. The A.G. has people review it, and then ultimately DOJ comes to a decision whether to seek the death penalty. More often than not, that determination is actually, no, we're going to seek a life sentence, but not a death sentence. If you do seek a death sentence, then you have your trial, and if you get a conviction, then you have essentially a second mini-trial after that, where the jury has to decide whether the person gets a death sentence or not. It's hard to predict what they're going to do with Mangione here. Most of the time, when the feds seek a death sentence, you have some sort of extenuated circumstance, you have multiple murders, you have some element of torture or some other horrific act.

Now, if we're looking at that -- remember that, as you said, there's two cases here. The state case, there could be room to plead. You go from a first- degree murder down to a second-degree murder. The federal statutes are harder, because there's just federal murder statutes. Maybe they would agree to plead him down to just a gun charge, but the other complicating factor, if you're Mangione here, you have to work out a plea with both. You're not going to plead just to the state and then go to trial and the feds or vice versa. So, Karen Friedman Agnifilo her work cut out for her here.

But, that said, if I just said to you, how often can you get 12 people to agree on anything, it sounds pretty hard. But, again, our court system has a way of pulling people together, forcing them to get real and get rational about the facts.

And then to have this hurricane was just life-changing for everyone here. A lot of people were going to be without work, and we wanted to try and keep our payroll going. Our customers showed up, as they always do. We actually hired 20 other people to help out in our fulfillment department.",

      "sentences": "Botanical Bones is a superfood dog treat brand. I started my business shortly after we adopted our dog, Carnaby, from Brother Wolf Animal Rescue.And when I saw that Brother Wolf had lost their shelter in the floodwaters, I was just heartbroken because I know that my business wouldn't exist without them. So we're donating back to Brother Wolf for every order this holiday season to help them with their rebuild efforts. GINGER FRANK, FOUNDER, POPPY HAND-CRAFTED POPCORN:  We feel really fortunate to have fared well, be up and running in business, and be able to give back to our community and help them recover. This is a bag that we commissioned a local artist to do a design for, kind of represents all the things that we love about Asheville; $2 from every bag that's purchased on our Web site goes back to small business recovery from Helene, in retail stores, $1. ALLISON BLAKE, CO-FOUNDER, SOULKU:  So, SoulKu was started with my business partner and I. We just create beautiful, simple pieces of jewelry. They have lots of meaning behind them. We know money is tight. If you do not spend your dollars with these beautiful, unique businesses, what you love, what you know about Asheville and our Blue Ridge Mountains, it's not going to be here.
