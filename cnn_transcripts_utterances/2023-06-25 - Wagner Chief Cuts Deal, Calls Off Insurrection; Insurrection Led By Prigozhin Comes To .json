For the first time in my years as reporting on Putin here, I've never seen a challenge like this directly to Vladimir Putin. There has not been one, and he is going to come out of this, even though normality has been referred to the face of this to the streets of Moscow, and is driving through them this morning. I've been speaking to people in this city and around the country, and they are very relieved that a deal has been done to avert this crisis.But, the relief is only skin deep, because everybody knows that cracks have appeared. And the power, the strength, the invulnerability of Vladimir Putin, and that could result in all sorts of unknown consequences. I was fascinated to see those images you were just playing of the Wagner forces leaving the city of Rostov, but they were being applauded. They were being celebrated by many people in the streets, many people try to shake their hands, have photographs taken outside of their tanks, you are getting Prigozhin himself who was lorded like a celebrity. Those images will be incredibly disturbing to the Kremlin, because it implies, and what it shows, actually that Prigozhin, no matter what we think of, him no matter what atrocities he has been implicated in Ukraine, no matter what the manner is in which he speaks, he has sort of touched a degree of public sympathy inside Russia, and people are, they might not say it publicly, but people are very disturbed about the way this war has gone. Some of them think, many of them think, that Russia needs to take the gloves off, which is what Prigozhin and his hard line pro war activists have been advocating for. And I think, you know, what we are seeing here is what we saw in these images, at least, is that public sentiment really bubbling up. And, of course, the Kremlin will have to watch those images, and will be very unsettled by the support, the popular support, it seems, that Prigozhin seems to have.",

Because, remember, 24 hours ago or less than that, we had Wagner forces on the outskirts of the city, more or less, or at least in the Moscow region threatening to move in to the capital of Russia that the city was being fortified, roads are being dug up, they have been dug up around the city to try and slow the advance of those Wagner forces.And people were bracing in the Russian capital for bloodshed and for a fight. So there is a great deal of relief that that has been averted with this very strange deal, which involves Prigozhin going to Belarus. That was quite clear on what his status in Belarus will be. I've reached out to Belarusian officials, and they are able to tell me that. But again, beyond that relief that people are expressing, there is also concern about what comes next, because the idea that Vladimir Putin is just going to draw a line under this and go, well, you know, that was a chapter that is now closed, is very realistic if you look at what he is done in the past. There are concerns that there may be a crackdown on Prigozhin supporters, it is not clear what the fate of Prigozhin will eventually be. And those Telegram bloggers, the military bloggers, the ultranationalists as well, there is a possibility that new media laws could be introduced, or tightened up to crack down on what they say as well.

Will he put in power people who are more effective to prosecute this war in Ukraine? And I think we may also see an uptick in the aggression Ukraine, unfortunately, as a result of this to show that he is in command that he is going to win this war, because, of course, Prigozhin has by now said that the war was needless, Ukraine did not threaten Russia, and that was part of his appeal as well.",

And so, to get rid of Wagner would mean to be a diminution of Russian influence and power in other parts of the world. So, I think we have to watch this very carefully, we have to see ifPrigozhin, in fact, does go to Belarus, do we know whether he is there, what happens to him when he is there.

Now, in public statements that they have put out, the overwhelming message has been that they are in support of Ukraine. President Biden spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, in the United Kingdom yesterday, and the readout of that call, specifically so that they talked about Russia in the situation there, but also that they were in support of the war, or of Ukraine, as it continues to fight its war.

And so you wonder how unplugged Putin really is.You had seen signs of this during the height of COVID where he had retired to a locations that no one knew exactly where he was, acting very in insulated fashion, and one simply has to wonder whether or not what he must of been listening not willing to listen to the intelligence they were being given to him, or basically the fear providing this bad information to him.

That is certainly true, they are very concerned about that, but clearly, even FSB and other internal security forces, they appear to be so thinly stretched in Ukraine where they also have responsibilities that they proved an able to inform or do anything about what Prigozhin tried to pull off.

So, you know, one of the explanations as to why he stopped might have been that he might have thought, when I make it to Moscow, what am I going to, who are my allies it how hard is the impact going to be?

It was only later in the day that we heard, for instance, from one senior adviser to President Zelenskyy who said that Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group, had almost nullified in his words Putin, that he humiliated Putin as a result. But when all was said and done and Prigozhin stopped his so-called march for justice on Moscow and went back to base, turned his men around, things sort of went back to normal. So what we saw overnight were those air strikes in Kyiv that left five people dead from falling debris. Now, what we do know from the Ukrainian military is that they have made some progress in the area around Bakhmut, which in May was taken over by Russian forces. According to Ukrainian officials, they were able to take a stretch of trenches outside that city, about a kilometer long, that's about 0.6 of a mile. But they did say in the process that they were able to kill, wound or capture an entire Russian battalion. Now, we don't know how many men that is.

And then number two, I'm very interested to find out what happens internally. Look, the outreach of America has always been over the course of decades into Russia has been into the liberals and the reformers. That hasn't done as much good, has it?

Now, if they stay a separate force off to the side but still in the command and control up to Shoigu, that may work. But I guarantee you, Prigozhin and Shoigu have been at each other's throats.

Unlike in Russia, the KGB was never disbanded or even renamed.And he has often resorted to strong arm tactics. When a Belarusian dissident was a passenger on a plane flying over the country in 2021, Belarus' air traffic control called in a bomb threat and the man was arrested. Before entering politics, Lukashenko ran a collective farm. He has often had himself filmed as president digging up carrots or potatoes to show how he never forgot his roots. But the Belarusian strongman has always had an eye on the future, balancing relations with his powerful neighbors while apparently d grooming his young son, sometimes dressed in military uniform and often present for meetings with world leaders to take over. Now his intervention to broker a truce in Russia and decision to host Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin may spell a new chapter for the autocratic leader. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN -- London.
