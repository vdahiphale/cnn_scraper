Well, whoever comes out on top will be Britain's third prime minister in just a matter of weeks after Liz Truss stepped down on Thursday. Well, our Scott McLean has been following developments and joins us now live from outside 10 Downing Street. And Scott, Johnson's decision not to stand late on Sunday now makes it all the more likely that perhaps Rishi Sunak will be the next prime minister. But it was a very late call from Johnson step down after a feverish weekend of rumors. Presumably, this will now give Penny Mordaunt a shot at well, Scott, at reading that 100 vote mark.",

He's a professor of politics and contemporary history and the head of the Department of Political Economy at King's College London. Thank you so much for your time this morning.The suggestion was, Andrew, that if Boris Johnson had managed to make that 100 vote count, that he probably wouldn't have had enough supporters, enough ministers to actually formed a government. How much have the party and the country here avoided more political chaos with Boris Johnson deciding to withdraw last night? ANDREW BLICK, PROFESSOR OF POLITICS AND CONTEMPORARY HISTORY, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON:  I think had Johnson secured that support, decided to go forward and actually really had the support, which he claimed he had, which is not clear, the vote would have gone to the members. And there is a reason whereas for supposing that the members might well have chosen him. But I think as you said, at that point, it would've been an incredible pushback from within his own parliamentary party. And I think although these things don't happen very often in U.K. politics and I hesitate to make this kind of pitch, I think there's a real chance the Conservative Party would have actually split over this issue and would have found people within the Conservative Parliamentary Party looking very carefully. Not only were they able to serve as ministers, but were they even be able to take the whip (ph) to be conservative members while Johnson was leader of the Conservative Party. I think that's how bad it could have gotten, particularly when you consider he's still under investigation for his small contempt of the House by the House of Commons Standard Committee, which could even have led to him being removed from the House of Commons while serving as a prime minister.",

But that doesn't necessarily mean that the political chaos is over, even if it's Penny Mordaunt or Rishi Sunak to go forward especially in Rishi Sunak's case. I mean, he caused a lot of turmoil, of course, and many in the party hold him responsible for Boris Johnson's demise when he decided to quit the cabinet back this summer.So, is he going to be able to be this unity candidate that the Tory Party need or on the evidence of what we're hearing about the number of MP votes that he has, is that indicative of the fact that he is going to be able to do that?",

He is the most favored candidate, but there is still a section of the party which do not want him, which will not be happy about this. It is significant that people he wants might have expected to to back Johnson, such as Suella Braverman, such as Lord Frost, David Frost, actually (inaudible) their hands behind Sunak.And it would suggest there was some momentum in Sunak's direction. However, one point here is that Sunak is the potential leader who was rejected by the conservative membership not that long, over a month ago. Sunak, as you say, was involved closely in the downfall of Johnson, having served under Johnson for a long period of time. He has baggage. He was found to have broken the law over lockdowns, just as Johnson was, which is something which is not being talked about much now. And there's a lot of scrutiny also of his financial affairs while he was chancellor of the exchequer, nothing actually found to have been actually wrong, but lots of scrutiny. So, well, those factors could play into it. And when we look at those who have swung around from what you might call the right of the party to backing him, one wonders, what are they actually expecting out of him? And if he doesn't deliver it, how are they going to turn on him again? Are we going to see this kind of split re-emerging, which I think is always a strong possibility.",

Interestingly, at their own request where Sergei Shoigu, and I think there obviously many points to look at here, but one that I find particularly interesting is that the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd, Austin, spoke with Sergei Shoigu for only the second time during Russia's war in Ukraine, just a couple of days ago, two or three days ago.And the fact that the follow-up from that is the British, the French, and the U.S. should request follow on phone calls with Shoigu, suggests that Lloyd Austin in his first phone call heard things of deep concern and wanted to make roundly clear that the allegations that Sergei Shoigu is putting forward are false, very likely warned Russia of potential consequences about escalation. Russia is continually being warned by the west against further escalation here. President Zelenskyy said that if Russia is already making these false allegations, then this means that Russia has already prepared itself such a dirty bomb. And we do know that President Putin over recent weeks has chosen to listen to the hard- liners more. And at a fork in the road where he's had reversals and losses in Ukraine, has chosen to double down in the fight and listened more to the hard-liners than others in his administration. So, this is a very real concern. It may also point to a complete paucity in Russia's intelligence about what's actually going on in Ukraine. That can't be overlooked, either. Russia's intelligence at the beginning of the war was woefully inadequate. They thought they were going to walk in, that it would be an easy victory. They lost thousands upon thousands of lives based on that false understanding of the situation here. But at the moment, this is being taken as a very real threat by Russia and seriously enough for all those defense ministers, Britain, France, U.S., to call up, tell Russia it's not true, it's not going to happen.
