These candidates were making their case for why they can be the best alternative to Donald Trump and be the best option for Republicans to win back the White House. Here's a sense of their argument that they offered to voters at this point. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've got to start doing this in a way that we can win a general election. It's time for a new generational leader. We've got to leave the baggage and the negativity behind. We've got a country to save. RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Here's the thing, you can't do any of it if you don't win. There is no substitute for victory. And we need to dispense with the culture of losing that has beset the Republican Party in recent years. Iowa shows it can be done. Florida shows it can be done.

He allegedly said, \"I'm a veteran sniper, and unless you change your ways, I got my scope pointed in your direction, and I'm coming to get you. You're a dead man walking, you piece of -- expletive.\"This voicemail first provided to the U.S. Capitol Police that then brought on board the FBI. Federal investigators then visited on May 24th, 66-year-old man. They spoke to him, and he reportedly said that he was extremely angry with certain politicians over the handling of entitlement programs for veterans, specifically that a particular senator was blocking military promotions. Landry reportedly could not recall exactly what he said on the voicemail, but he also notably denied any sort of intentions or desire to commit violence. Landry was nonetheless charged with threatening to assault, kidnap, or murder a U.S. official in connection to the performance of officials, to that official's duties, and a judge ordered him released on Friday, pending a bail review hearing. This schedule for next month, we have reached out to his defense and are currently waiting to hear back, but this certainly highlights what has been a recent trend of -- threats of political violence in the past, directed at state and federal officials. Many people lately feeling more boldened to actually make calls like this one, but you know, you hear from the intelligence community and the biggest concern is those who do not raise those red flags, those that do not leave voicemails or leave Twitter traffic.
