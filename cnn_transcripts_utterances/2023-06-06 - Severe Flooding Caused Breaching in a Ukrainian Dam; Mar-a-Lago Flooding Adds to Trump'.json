It has been occupied though, by Russia since pretty much the beginning of this war. We're learning more in the last hour about the potential effect on civilians from the predicted flooding. Apparently, they're already seeing signs of flooding, according to the head of the Kherson Regional Council. A Ukrainian official, he says, that the water levels are expected to reach critical levels, really in about an hour from now. Estimates on that are varied, though he says signs of flooding is visible in settlements. The water is rising and they're already starting evacuations in civilians from areas.",

Certainly, if areas are flooded causing the Dnipro River to do that becomes much more difficult.One adviser to the Zelenskyy administration this morning claiming that Russia has done this in order to sort of deter Ukraine from doing so.

A swimming pool flood Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort late last year is raising more suspicions among prosecutors looking into the former president's handling of classified documents of possible obstruction. It comes amid the investigation winding down as CNN's Katelyn Polantz reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SR. CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: The top federal prosecutor investigating Donald Trump and the way he handled classified documents after he left the presidency, that prosecutor took a meeting on Monday with a team of defense lawyers representing Donald Trump. They all met at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C., along with a career official from the Justice Department, who also sat down with Trump's lawyers. [03:05:00] This is a sort of meeting that appears to be coming and that final stage or in a final stage of this criminal investigation around the former president and around what happened at his estate in Mar-a-Lago, and potentially, other places throughout his business empire. We don't know exactly what happened at this meeting at this time, but it is quite significant that people in the Justice Department would agree to meet with Trump's lawyers whenever they had requested this. And so, there are potentially some additional people who could be brought into a grand jury investigation. We do believe one witness is going to be speaking to a grand jury in south Florida this week. There may still be things happening in this investigation, but this is quite a significant moment for the Justice Department and for Donald Trump's legal team, as they prepare for the possibility of a federal indictment against the former president. And then, also, we at CNN, we're able to understand a little bit more about the obstruction of justice part of this criminal investigation. That's because we have learned and we are able to confirm of a flood that happened at Mar-a-Lago, at the resort, in October of last year. That flood flooded a room because there was the draining of the pool at Mar-a-Lago and the water from the pool went into a room that stored I.T. equipment, including some of the videotapes and the surveillance system of the property. The obstruction of justice investigation has looked at a lot of things over the course of the past year, but one of the things that they have pursued, that the prosecutors have pursued, was what was happening and how was the Trump Organization or Donald Trump himself, responding to multiple requests for surveillance tapes. And would you also know that the maintenance worker that decided to drain the pool at Mar-a-Lago, and then caused this flood in the room, that person was captured on surveillance tape moving boxes. And so, it is a moment that prosecutors have been asking about, as they ask about many different things that have happened around those surveillance footage, and also the moving of boxes at Mar-a-Lago in this ongoing criminal investigation.

Authorities also launched an official investigation, Monday, into one of the country's deadliest actions in decades. It killed at least 275 people and injured more than 1000 others.CNN's Ivan Watson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is what happens when a passenger train moving at 80 miles per hour, that's run around 128 kilometers per hour, slams into an immovable object. You get enormous train cars like this thrown over, overturned as if they were children's toys. Now, just days ago, this was the scene of one of the deadliest train disasters in modern Indian history, and already, the railroad has been reopened and we can see what looks like a brand-new modern train moving down the tracks here. That is even as scores of people are still looking for their missing loved ones from the accident that took place on Friday night. Now, the initial accident, authorities say, was caused by a switching malfunction. So a passenger train was moved onto a track where there was a parked freight train loaded with iron ore. And that crash sent some of the train cars into the other track, where there was an approaching passenger train coming from the other side, so that mistake led to absolutely catastrophic results. As you can see, the railroad here has been reopened. We have another train moving through right now. And the railroad system in India, it dates back in origins to when this country was a British colony. And it is essential to this country. More than 13 million people a day move around on trains in India. So that's part of why the authorities have worked so hard to reopen the rails after the train crash. I'm going to show you over here, this is an example of a railroad station in the Indian countryside. And it also happens to be just within sights, if you see the lights down there, of where the terrible train crash happened on Friday night. The very next day, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he was supposed to go inaugurate a brand-new high speed train. Instead, he had to rush to the crash to survey the recovery efforts and to meet with some of the survivors. The Indian government has great ambitions to modernize this country, but as this terrible tragedy has highlighted, there's also a lot of work to be done to maintain aging and essential infrastructure.

The signal house was very close to where the crash actually took place. This was taking place just at the scene of a disaster zone. So, the authorities have promised a high-level investigation, and they also promised to bring people to justice. What is not clear is whether or not the train that collided, that passenger train, was equipped with one of the train collision avoiding systems.Some reporting here in the Indian presses say that they did not have that, which could've perhaps prevented this terrible disaster from taking place. The big question would be that maybe before rolling out lots of high speed trains, do you need to have your slower trains to equip with something like this. Then, there is as the railway has been reopened, and we saw crowded passenger trains again rolling through the crash site a number of them yesterday had slower speeds, I might add, but packed full of passengers, so you could get a sense of how full the train was when the accident took place Friday night. And so, as those trains are starting to roll again, Laila, you do also still have that very grim work of identifying the victims of the initial crash. Again, at least 275 people killed. The latest statistics coming out of the Odisha government more than 180 victims have been identified, but there's still a lot of work, difficult work, to do and the authorities have put a toll-free line out, they're trying to get information and help with that. They've also pledged for free transport of the victims bodies back to their home places. And that's a very big deal for families who may be at very low income levels, and this would be a very big burden for them. And of course, any of this talk, compensation, which is also being pledged half a million rupees to the families of each victim who died, that's around $6,000, a bit more than that. None of that will replace the loss of a loved one. Laila?",
