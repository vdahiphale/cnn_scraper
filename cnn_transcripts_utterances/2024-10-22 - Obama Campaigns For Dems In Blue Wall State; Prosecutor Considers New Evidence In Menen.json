BRYAN LANZA, SENIOR ADVISOR, TRUMP 2024 CAMPAIGN: We'll take it. I mean, listen, she clearly doesn't want to campaign. She feels what she does interviews, he underperforms. We prefer her to do more interviews, but we're going to make our message clear to the American people. This -- this election is going to be about the economy and it's going about immigration. And we're going to talk about that every day. She's going to hide or maybe she needs 10 hours to prepare for a couple of interviews.

If she were to just turn around and doing a lot of commentators are asking her to do, I mean, just like take a hard swipe at them, that's going to look inauthentic, right?

Then in the second trial, that was a lot of evidence that was not present, that was presented on the first trial, that was not presented in the second trial. And they were found guilty. And there's no question that they murdered their parents. However, we are reviewing two different possibilities of relief, right? Approximately a little over a year ago, their defense team brought in what we call a habeas claim, which basically is, hey, there was evidence that should have been presented to the jury that wasn't if that evidence were to be presented, the outcome might have been different. That's one way up potential relief. And then there's another way in the California law says, hey, you have people that have been in prison for a very long time. They have rehabilitated, they are safe to be reintegrated in the community and then the question is, should that occur? Either one little vehicles has to be evaluated by a court and approved by a court. And I'm looking at both.",

That's people chosen, Trump supporters before the election who were supposed to serve as real electors if Trump won. But he lost. And at the behest of the Trump campaign, these electors signed phony certificates, falsely claiming that Trump won their states anyway, Arizona and Georgia, Pennsylvania, and on and on.Trump then tried to use those fake certificates to stay in power by pressuring then Vice President Mike Pence to reject Biden's electors on January 6 in Congress. And then to recognize the fake Republican ones. Republican Georgia State Senator Shawn Still is one of those fake electors. He's running to keep his state sentence seat in Georgia. He was one of the 18 indicted last year in the Georgia election interference case, along with Donald Trump, charged after he filed -- he filled out paperwork claiming falsely, illegitimately, that Trump carried Georgia in 2020. Still's opponent Democrat Ashwin Ramaswami joins us. Ashwin, thanks for joining us. So you worked on election security at CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. You did that for more than three years, then you decided to run for office for the state Senate seat. Is there something that you experienced at CISA trying to protect cybersecurity that made you feel like running for office, was the next step? ASHWIN RAMASWAMI (D), GEORGIA STATE SENATE CANDIDATE: Yeah. S what I saw is after the 2020 election, Donald Trump fire the director of CISA, Chris Krebs. That's the moment when I realized that more important than just securing our elections are making sure that we have people in power. We're going to do the right thing. And that's ultimately why I decided to run because what I saw was a threat to democracy was greater from my own hometown in Johns Creek. Shawn Still has been criminally indicted for trying to overturn the election results. And whereas we need folks are going to focus on things like overturning are abortion ban, protecting children in schools. And I couldn't stand by and see my community representative by someone with such poor judgment, such port character. Not only is he criminally indicted, he also lied about being a veteran.
