Iranian media reporting several explosions near the city of Isfahan.Details still coming in, but a U.S. official confirming to CNN this is Israeli retaliation for Saturday's Iranian drone and missile strike on Israel. The official says the target's not nuclear. Iranian state media report the country's air defenses have been activated in several provinces and flights to and from a number of major cities have been suspended. CNN's Alex Marquardt is live for us this hour in Washington, but we begin with Nic Robertson in Jerusalem. Nic, I know a lot of caution already, because what we don't know is far greater than what we do know. But what have you been hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, they've been telling us all week and how frightened they are at the prospects of what could come next, if Israel did decide to undertake this counterattack against Iran, which has now come.I spoke with a senior U.S. official earlier in this evening who made it clear that this response by Israel was not endorsed by the United States. The U.S. did not give the green light for what we saw play out tonight. Now, throughout the course of the week since that massive Iranian strike against Israel last weekend, some 300 ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones being targeted at Israel, the U.S. has repeatedly said Israel, of course, has the right to defend itself. It has the right to respond. But they certainly did not want Israel to risk escalation. What we have heard from the Biden administration is take the win. They told Israel to take the win, recognize that you defended yourselves formidably last weekend. There was almost no damage. No one was killed in that attack. And that was a response, you'll remember, Michael, to the Israeli strike two weeks prior in Damascus against a building at the Iranians claim was a consulate building in which seven IRGC members, including a senior commander, were killed. So in the view of the Biden administration, the playing field had been leveled. Clearly, Israel did not see it that way, and they felt the need to respond to what truly is a -- was a historic and unprecedented attack by Iran. So in the course of the past few days, Israel has been telling the U.S. that they did, they do, they did intend to respond to Iran but in a limited way, in a narrow way. And what we have reported is that the scope would be quite limited. The expectation would be that Israel would go after military targets. I was told tonight that -- that nuclear and civilian targets were outside the range of what was expected. And that does, indeed, seem to be what we have seen play out tonight. Now, when you hear Isfahan, and you know anything about Iran and its nuclear program, you instantly worry that perhaps the nuclear facility there was an Israeli target. That was not the case. I was quickly told by a U.S. official that the nuclear facility was not the target. We heard from Iranian officials that the nuclear facilities are secure, but there are a number of other military facilities around there that certainly could be targets and fall within that narrow scope of what the expectation was. I'm told that earlier today, Israel did tell the United States that they intended to carry out, in more concrete terms, an attack against Iran, but didn't put a terribly fine point on it, put a range of several days. Of course, it came quite quickly. It came tonight. We started getting indications earlier in the evening that this could happen. And then we started to see reports on social media, videos on social for media. And eventually, it was confirmed by a U.S. official to me, not too long ago. I should note, Michael, the Biden administration has not said a word. We have not heard anything either from the IDF or from Israeli officials. But here in Washington, I think what that says is this is firmly an Israeli operation. The U.S. doesn't want to be speaking publicly to this, in case Iran would take it -- see it as, for example, American participation. The U.S. has made clear that they did not support this operation. And that is really important, because should Iran choose to respond, certainly, American service members, American diplomats, American assets could be in harm's way in Iraq and Syria, and Jordan and elsewhere. And when we heard the foreign minister speaking to our colleague Erin Burnett several hours ago, he made clear that, if Israel chose to respond, that there would be an immediate maximum response, in his words, against Israel. So that is something, certainly, that Washington is bracing for now, Michael.",

Joining me now from Washington also, retired U.S. Air Force colonel and CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton. Always good to see you, sir. I mean, it was -- it was hugely significant when Iran took action with its missiles directly at Israeli territory, not using proxies. How significant, then, in the geopolitical sense, and security sense, how significant is it that Israel hit Iranian territory directly? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, I think it's pretty significant, Michael, and it's great to be with you. There are so many aspects to this. But I think it was very clear that what the Israelis for doing was responding directly to what the Iranians did. They took the time to actually see how the Iranians were executing their attack. Of course, they shot down about 99 percent of the missiles and drones that were thrown against them back over the weekend. And now we have a situation where it's, in essence, the reverse. What the Israelis have done is they have responded practically in-kind to what the Iranians did, but they've proven one thing. And that is the reigning air defense system is no -- is nowhere near the capability of the Israeli air defense system. And that, of course, is a significant message to Tehran. It also indicates that the Israelis can basically come in with impunity, if they so choose, to attack Iranian targets. And that, of course, is a significant factor that should be part of Iran's calculations for any future escalation.",

But what they do have to do is they have to be prepared to not only to defend any -- you know, themselves from any incoming attacks that could potentially be logged against U.S. facilities. Although the Iranians seem to be very careful about this. And they seem to be saying that we don't want to involve the U.S. at this juncture, at least. So it's, you know, in an interesting situation where we're monitoring this on the U.S. side, but we're looking at it as a -- in essence, a non-participant would look at something like this, more as a spectator than anything else.",

And it also depends on the availability of those assets. It was quite a significant a show of force that was put on by the U.S., Britain, and France, as well as other countries, to help Israel in this particular situation. And the fact that that was carried out and carried out, I would say, successfully that, of course, makes the bar higher to achieve something similar the next time this happens.

Because what they want is this to simmer down into end to be something that is of less consequence or, at least, a less hot conflict.But the situation is such that I don't think we will see a de- escalation as long as each side feels necessary to respond to the other. And that, of course, gives you that ladder of escalation that could result in some pretty dangerous things happening. Right now, there seems to be some discipline in the messaging from both sides and in the attacks from both sides.

Whereas we could have given a much harsher response to the Israeli regime. Following that, we announced that this response is within the framework of legitimate defense, according to international laws. We will not continue. However, in case the Israeli regime embarks on adventurism again and takes action against the interests of Iran, the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level.

So that attack filed because the Israelis had time to intercept each of the individual waves alongside the U.S., the U.K., and France. With this attack, you've seen Israel's -- Israel launch a very limited attack at very high-tech capability. We have F-35s probably firing from inside Iraq or Syria to targets inside Iran and reach their targets, irrespective of the Iranian air defenses.

And the Iranians, you know, can retaliate in ways without necessarily attacking Israel directly from Iran. They can activate Hezbollah, for example, in Southern Lebanon to launch large-scale attacks into Northern Israel. They can use proxy forces in Iraq and Syria to launch attacks, as well. So I do think there is a risk that, particularly if the Israelis do go ahead with their plans to intervene in Rafah, that the Iranians could take advantage of that and try and do something in the North. And of course, as I said, a precedent has been set. So Iran could then choose to strike against Israel.

Perhaps countries are wanting to let the dust settle on this a little bit, gather all of the facts before saying anything. Just given the volatility of the situation in the region. And look, for the fact -- the past almost three weeks now, you have had countries in this part of the world furiously trying to convince, first, the Iranians not to strike the Israelis, not to further escalate tensions, inflame the situation, cause a regional war. And then in the last week, you've had them trying to convince the Israelis, and the West and the United States to try to compel the Israelis not to strike Iran, which could obviously provoke a further attack. And there's really been a flurry of diplomatic activity happening, both in private and in public, as well. Just yesterday, you had the Emiratis on the phone with the Iranians, urging them to sort of restraint, dial down the temperature a little bit. Over the past week, you've also had the Egyptians saying that they've been in touch with both the Israelis and the Iranians with a very similar message to try to cool things off a little bit. Obviously, the Saudis have been taking calls from the West and from around the region. And here in turkey just this week, you have the foreign minister in Qatar to visit not only with the Qataris, but also the leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh. And Hakan Fidan said that it's Turkey's position that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is trying to inflame things, trying to drag the region into a war in order to maintain his grip on power. And this week we also heard from the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His criticism, one of many, has been that the West was quick to denounce Iran's strike on Israel, strikes on Israel, I should say. But was not so quick to denounce what started this all on April 1st in the first place, which of course, we know was Israel's strike on that Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus. And the Iranians have made very clear over the last week or so that, if Israel were to strike back after its barrage of missiles onto Israeli territory, that there would be a harsher response, a more decisive response. Because they say that look, yes, maybe 99 percent of those missiles were shot down. But the intent there was to warn. And the next time, well, that may not be the same. Of course, President Biden, in the aftermath of the strike on Israel, his message to the Israelis had been, look, you shot down 99 percent of these. Take the win. Whether or not Iran can be convinced to do the same, given that perhaps this was rather limited, and the incoming may have been shot down. It seems at this point, can Iran be convinced to do the same and just let sleeping dogs lie?",
