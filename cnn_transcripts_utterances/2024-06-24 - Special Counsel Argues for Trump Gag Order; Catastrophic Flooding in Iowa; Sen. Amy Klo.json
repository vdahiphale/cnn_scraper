At the top of the hour, Judge Aileen Cannon will hear a new motion to dismiss the case with Trump's lawyers arguing that special counsel Jack Smith's office was illegally funded.Then, this afternoon, Smith will make his case for a gag order for the former president in this case. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the Florida federal court. Katelyn, what are you expecting to happen in court this morning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is day two of a three-day stress test of this case. All throughout this case Donald Trump's lawyers and his co-defendants layers keep making requests to try and either get the case dismissed or to have more hearings. They want delays or they want Donald Trump not to face those charges.So today, this morning, the focus of the arguments to try and get the case dismissed and have the charges against him tossed, it's going to be about the special counsel and the constitutionality of that prosecutor's office at the Justice Department. Is it properly funded? Is the money that's being used by the Justice Department to pay for the special counsel something that Congress would allow in the way that the money is set up? Now, this is one of those issues that has made its way through other courts. And the special counsel's office has been allowed to proceed to trial with charges against defendants. But Judge Aileen Cannon, she's her own judge. This is her court. She wants to have part two of the hearings on this particular issue this morning. And then in the afternoon, that's when prosecutors are going to be coming in and making their arguments to Judge Cannon. They want to limit Donald Trump's speech in this case because they think that he is threatening law enforcement by making misleading statements about the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago in August of 2022. They think that could be harmful to agents that have worked on this case, potentially causing them to face harassment or threats. And also they worry about the trial whenever it may be. We don't have a date yet. But they worry that the statements Donald Trump continues to make about law enforcement, it could threaten what witnesses will say, or it could somehow hurt the integrity of the trial. Not clear yet, though, if Judge Cannon will make any decisions today and how long these issues are going to be argued in court. Sara.",

Americans polled say, when you look at them, you know, it is Trump, not Biden, that is better at dealing with these two issues. That is an aggregate of polls. You see the Fox News, Quinnipiac and Marquette poll. The same thing goes when it comes to immigration.How do you think Biden can convince the public that he is the one that can handle these two issues? We'll start with inflation. We'll start with the economy where people are feeling like they cannot afford what they used to be able to afford.",

      "sentences": "OK, first on polls. I've seen a number of polls showing Joe Biden gaining strength right now. So, let's put that aside because you have one poll after a poll.On the economy, you're going to see a president that's been leading on the national stage. Someone who's taken us through the most difficult time, the pandemic, when so many people were out of work, getting that vaccine out there to make people - make sure that people have their health care. You're going to hear the story of that and how the work he's doing to bring down costs from going after monopolies, to taking on the pharmaceutical companies. I can't tell you how many times Donald Trump said that's what he wanted to do. It is Joe Biden that has finally gotten that law passed in - the bill passed into law, a bill that I've led, that said that Medicare should negotiate with the big pharma companies to bring down prices on drugs like Eloquence, drugs like Xarelto, drugs like Januvia, Guardant, blockbuster drugs. And this is the legacy that you're going to see where Joe Biden is going to be able to talk about the work he's done on bringing down costs. On immigration, something else you brought up, Joe Biden has clearly leaned into it. He wants those emergency powers to close down the border. What happened? We were about to pass that in Congress and Donald Trump ways in and says, no, no, no, don't do that. And you can see the result. So, I just - I think it is a moment, when you have so much noise on the internet, every time when there is a big moment, Joe Biden has risen to the occasion. At the State of the Union, at Normandy. You've seen him rise to the occasion. So, that's why I think this debate, when people have just that minute, when there's not the noise, there's not the interruptions, and there's just some clear-cut questions on the visions that these two candidates have going forward, there's going to be a clear difference on that stage. And I don't know what Donald Trump's going to show up. This is the first time we've seen him on the stage since he's had these 91 felony indictments and 30 plus some convictions. So, we don't know who's going to show up. But what I do know is a Joe Biden's on the right side of the issues for the people of this country.",
