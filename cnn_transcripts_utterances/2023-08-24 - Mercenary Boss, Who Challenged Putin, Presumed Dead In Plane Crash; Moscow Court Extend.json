A catastrophic event appears to have hit this private jet that contained pretty much most of the top elite of the Wagner Group, including Prigozhin himself, according to Russian officials. You heard the eyewitness there. Now we are hearing that Russian forensic scientists whose cars were seen at the scene there have now arrived at the forensic bureau in Tver where this, indeed, occurred -- that is part of Russia now -- piecing together what they will present as an evidence chain as to what's happened here. Big caveat -- we are dependent entirely upon Russian state media and Russian officials for telling us the fate of Yevgeny Prigozhin. Why is that important? Well, this is the man that led an armed rebellion exactly two months ago against Vladimir Putin, essentially criticizing how the war was fought. But he ended up spiraling into a chain of events where he essentially was confronting Putin directly -- and the biggest challenge that Putin had in his 23 years in power. A deal caused that armed rebellion to stop, but Prigozhin was somehow miraculously still at liberty for two months. This plane crash ends that question as to what was to happen to Prigozhin next, potentially. We don't have final confirmation he was on board, and we may never get it. We may always be reliant upon Russian officials for that -- Poppy.",

He had already had his pre-trial detention extended in May, so the fact that they did it again was hardly a surprise, especially given the political climate in Russia and given the worsening relations with the United States. And given the fact that, of course, the elephant in the room here is that Evan Gershkovich is potentially a high-value swap for Russia in terms of a prisoner swap.I think -- look, it's clear now that there is a long road ahead for Evan Gershkovich. This pre-trial detention now stretches to November 30, and it could be extended beyond that. Both Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed spent more than a year in pre-trial detention. Then you get to a trial, which on espionage charges is likely to be long in itself. And both precedent and, in fact, comments from the Russian Foreign Ministry would suggest that Russia will want this trial to play out before any discussions on a prisoner swap can be held -- Victor.",
