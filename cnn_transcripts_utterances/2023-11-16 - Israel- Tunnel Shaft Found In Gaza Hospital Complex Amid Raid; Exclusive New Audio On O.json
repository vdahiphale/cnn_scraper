This as CNN obtains video of a family evacuating from northern Gaza. A neighbor shot in the head as he tries to flee with them in that secure zone.Plus, more breaking news, exclusive audio of Trump into OUTFRONT, talking about going to the Capitol on January 6th to deal with what he calls, quote, the problem. Why the special counsel may already be seizing on this new sound. And, she's known Chinese President Xi Jinping for 40 years, since he first came to her home in Iowa. Tonight, she opens up about the man she calls a friend and she had dinner with last night. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. Israel says it has now found evidence of a tunnel underneath Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa. The discovery coming 48 hours, pretty much exactly 48 hours, after forces first entered the compound. Now, according to this video, which it is important to say was both filmed and released by the IDF, you can see what they say is an entrance to the tunnel, it appears to be reinforced with concrete. You see pipes, cables, and debris outside it. We weren't able to geolocate this video. And here is exactly where that tunnel shaft is located. As you can see, it is located not far from where people are sheltering. But, it is some distance away from where Israel last night released video of those weapons found behind an MRI machine. According to the IDF, the tunnel is near a booby-trapped car, which contained a large amount of M.O. and weapons. Now, I want to be clear that CNN can't independently verify the images at this point. The Hamas-run government media office in a new statement tonight, for their part, says the health ministry has repeatedly asked for, quote, teams to visit and expect all hospitals, in order to refute the false incitement narrative. They say there aren't tunnels under there. But, the IDF claims that this one video is part of what will eventually be proven to be, a sprawling, multilevel command center for Hamas. In fact, Israeli forces have now been inside that hospital complex for 48 hours, hunting for tunnels. As Al-Shifa's facilities director paints a sad, horrible picture of what is taking place inside the hospital with civilians, telling Al Jazeera, quote, we have been forced to amputate the limbs of some of the injured, because their wounds have been infected due to a lack of resources. And in an ominous sign, Israel is now dropping leaflets across southern Gaza, calling on civilians there to evacuate. Now, you remember a few weeks, ago when those leaflets were being dropped, in those early days, they were trying to get them on the ground to find them in northern Gaza. But south is where and people have been told to go. They were told to go there in order to be safe. And tonight, we have exclusive new reporting, on just how dangerous that journey to southern Gaza even is. Our Jomana Karadsheh has the story of (INAUDIBLE). He says that he, along with his family and neighbors, were given just 30 minutes to evacuate their homes in northern Gaza, a track along which -- along what Israel has repeatedly said is a, quote, safe corridor.

This is your area of deep expertise. So I want to show again the video, filmed and released by the IDF, of what they say is a tunnel shaft, inside of the Shifa hospital complex. You know, surrounded by loose wires, dirt, looks like chunks of concrete. What do you see here? MAJOR JOHN SPENCER (RET.), CHAIR OF URBAN WARFARE STUDIES, MODERN WAR INSTITUTE AT WEST POINT:  I see basically a section of a tunnel shaft, for sure. And I actually see a tactic which is to avoid the biggest threat which is a tunnel entrance and an exit that they have already lost IDF soldiers. So, this is something I have been seeing the IDF do, when I think there is a tunnel complex, not try to find where it leads through the buildings, but find it and access it through construction equipment to try to negate that, to get the information out like we know they need to as fast as possible. But I definitely see a tunnel.",

Now, Major, Israel has had forces inside the hospital complex forexactly 48 hours. Are you surprised, by the extremely limited evidence they've provided at this point or not?",

I wouldn't say I'm also not surprised, because we all want to see, it is evidence that Hamas was using the complex.

And unlike the video the IDF may produce, we can't even geolocate it.But they are putting it out. It's really detailed. It's got conference rooms and flags hanging and chairs.

If you recall after her testimony, there were many people, including they were saying people from the Secret Service, denying that Trump wanted to go to the Capitol, and try to go to the Capitol, and they stopped him.So, this corroborates Cassidy Hutchinson, and really helps bolster and make her a credible witness to testify at the trial. The other thing I think it shows is he really talks about going twice, right? He said, first, I want to go with the crowd. And, he knew the crowd was there to stop Mike Pence from certifying the election. So, it goes to the intent that he had, that same intent that he wanted to make it so Pence wouldn't certify the election. But he also said afterwards, I thought about, I want to go to stop the problem, as he called it. Which is interesting, because he could have stopped the problem, he knows he could have and, he didn't for, what, free hours, right, he sat there. And so, that part of it I think lacks credibility.
