The deficit, I mean, the United States spends so much just on interest on the debt that we could be spending on helping veterans or helping children or whatever. I mean, that's empirically a problem. If they wanted to actually solve that problem. Right? I mean, there's a 60 vote threshold in the Senate. Unless Republicans have 60 votes in the Senate and the White House, they have to deal with Democrats. They just have to.

Looks a bit defeated with the Republican defections, two more than he could afford to lose with this narrow majority. We were about to proceed to a second vote. But we should note the final vote tally was never called because the gavel never came down because negotiations were still apparently happening. That's what happens in Congress. Time can stop in its place if the House leadership wants it. We did see Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on the phone there. Other members were huddling together, talking. Then Congressman Keith Self of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina flipped their votes to Speaker Johnson, which made his victory official. It's a win for President elect Trump as well, who strongly endorsed the House Speaker. Here now is Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson of South Dakota. He was a key player in these negotiations to avoid a government shutdown last month, he's supporting Mike Johnson for speaker. Congressman Johnson, good to see you. So shortly after the speaker vote, there was a moment that we're going to show on the -- on T.V. right now. You kneeling down and huddling with now Speaker Johnson on the House floor. What were you guys talking about? REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): Well, I've got a good relationship with a number of the holdouts. I try to have good relationships with every single Republican in the House.

There would be no time served at any jail or prison. There would be no probation that Trump would be required to abide by. It would just be that the case is over, the judgment is entered, and that would allow Trump to then begin to try to appeal the conviction itself.You know, he has been taking all these steps to try to get the verdict thrown out, to try to get the indictment dismissed. And the judge, Judge Juan Merchan, has repeatedly dismissed those efforts, including today. But he's now going to, assuming that Trump does not postpone the sentencing here January 10, would be final judgment. And that would allow Trump to continue to try to appeal it, although Trump's lawyers have indicated for months that they will try to stop Donald Trump from being sentenced. So their next moves would be to try to go to an appeals court to get an emergency action to stay this sentencing, to postpone it so that Trump is not facing any sentencing before he is sworn in as the next president. Now the judge in this decision, in addition to saying he's weighed these various factors, he says that he was not going to dismiss the indictment, calling -- focusing on both the jury's verdict and the sanctity of that verdict, but also rejecting a number of Donald Trump's arguments, especially ones that Trump had made about the strength of the evidence in this case. You know, saying that it would be -- it would cause immeasurable damage to the citizenry's confidence in the rule of law if he were to dismiss the indictments on some of Trump's arguments about the strength of the case. So while it is bad news for Trump that he is scheduled to be sentenced in this, certainly good news for him that the biggest concern that he could face potential jail time, potential other sort of remedies against him. The judge signaling here that he will not sentence Trump to any incarceration, will not put any restrictions on him, including probation, as he assumes his second term as president. Jake.",

We saw an actual ramming attack before the holiday season overseas and that they had a giant crowd in a narrow street and did not do enough to secure it if you were securing it from a ramming attack. Now, today the FBI, DHS and National Counterterrorism Center put out a law enforcement bulletin to all their local and state law enforcement partners saying that the FBI, DHS and NCTC are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks, pointing out that during the surge of ramming attacks we saw in 2016 and 2017. And Jake, you remember when I was the head of counterterrorism in New York City, we had such an attack on the bike path on the west side highway, ISIS inspired, which caused us to make changes that because of -- because of that, when there is a successful ramming attack, particularly in the west, that it may inspire more.

What can the Trump administration and what can -- can state and local authorities do to try to get ahead of it?JAMIL JAFFER, FORMER COUNSEL TO ASST. ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR NATIONAL SECURITY: Look, it's a really tough problem when you've got people who are committed to attacking others, willing to give up their own lives to do it and do it in a low tech way where they're killing a relatively small number, 15, any one innocent dead is too many. Fifteen dead is terrible, right? But if you're conducting these types of attacks, it's very hard to combat. Now, the ways you can go around -- get -- get around it is, one, try to identify these people ahead of time. That means surveillance, right? That means identifying these people. We have a lone wolf authority that used to be in law, expired four years ago. Congress failed to reauthorize it.
