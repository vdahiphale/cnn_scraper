I want to play actually the video that was being talked about by the judge and counsel. Just before going to the lunch break, this is a video of Trump and prosecution believes Keith Schiller at a Trump rally at around the time when this key phone call was supposed to have happened. The prosecution, they want to admit this video into evidence or a picture of the scene into evidence. And that's going to be a crucial moment. Paula, a couple of things about this. One, there's a dispute here about whether this is in fact Keith Schiller, whether they can prove it. Do they need to bring in another witness in order to positively identify him? And then secondly, why would the prosecution want to establish that Keith Schiller and Donald Trump were together at that particular moment?",

Now, they did get him to say that, yeah, maybe I could have talked about both. But what this video would suggest is that Trump and Keith Schiller were in proximity that night. So it would have been possible that Schiller could have quickly gotten Trump on the phone. Cohen could have briefly mentioned the hush money payment and therefore not been caught in a lie. Now, Todd Blanche fought against the admission of that video as hard as he has fought against the admission of anything so far in this trial. It's not much, but again, it would potentially undermine one of his big successes on cross.",

And again, we have no idea that Michael Cohen would have actually talked to Donald Trump or talked with Keith Schiller and Donald Trump about the hush money payment, but just the idea that they were actually together, given what we know, given we know that Michael Cohen had texted Keith Schiller right before about this 14-year-old prankster. And again, as you said, this is really Todd Blanche's big punch that he landed. And as you noted, Abby, most people who are around Donald Trump were used to getting phone calls on his behalf. It was Molly Westerhout, who we heard from, Hope Hicks, Keith Schiller, anyone who was in his vicinity. That's usually who you would call if you were trying to get in touch with. And so it's not out of the realm of possibility. This would give a little bit more protection to Michael Cohen after that punch landed from Todd Blanche last week.",

And one of the things that they did in the questioning of Michael Cohen today, was bring up this issue of Bob Costello, who was sort of, kind of, not really- and actually, Donald Trump is walking back into court right now. Just to note, he did not stop to say anything or address the cameras. He's going straight into the court. We're expecting court to resume in just a couple of minutes. And obviously, we will be getting those alerts on the left of your screen there. Prosecutors are also back in the courtroom. But Bob Costello, Paula, is a figure who is looming a little bit over this. They got some questions in about him today, about the relationship between him and Michael Cohen. I have to admit, it's a little bit complicated. And the big question for the defense is going to be, do they open that can of worms when they have the opportunity to? Or did they do enough today to kind of seed some doubts about Michael Cohen's account?",

They can't change the fact that Michael Cohen stole money from the Trump organization on the key transaction. They can't change the fact that there are texts that undermine a key portion of Michael Cohens testimony anout that October 24th call, and that's where they're going to pick up, Wolf. But I think they've started to claw back a little bit, and I think the most important points that the prosecution scored on redirect this morning was just when they asked Michael Cohen, and it's a standard sort of prosecutor gambit, but just who's on trial here, you or Donald Trump? Donald Trump. So you want the jury's focus sort of shifting away from that witness box and back over to the defense table.",

Number one, do you remember speaking with Donald Trump and or Keith Schiller about the Stormy Daniels case? Yes. And just give the one-word answer. Did you believe when you carried out the actions you did that you were acting at the direction and with the full knowledge of Donald Trump? That's a compound question. You wouldn't ask it that way. But the answer is also yes to both of those. No further questions. Again, it's not worth bickering with the defense through the witness. Just get out there what their case is and fix it in their closing argument and say, look, no witness is perfect. He has some credibility questions. However, much of what he has said has been corroborated and supported by the documents, full stop.",

And they have to show that Michael Cohen, while not the perfect witness, was corroborated time and time again, that he was corroborated by David Pecker, that he was corroborated by the banker, that he was corroborated, you know, by even by Hope Hicks in a way so that what they have to do is say, look, you know, the guy's not perfect, but we didn't hire him. Donald Trump hired him and also show that Donald Trump was a micromanager and knew about most things, although maybe not the extra bonus for Michael Cohen. But knew about most things that were going on within his organization. And this was something so big and so important that it would have been absurd for Michael Cohen not to be talking to Donald Trump about it, that it would be completely unbelievable for Donald Trump candidate for president, not to know about this, particularly in the days after the Access Hollywood tape.",

There's no doubt the video is accurate because we played our own video there. And that's from a network pool feed from the week before the election. So I think that takes us back to the important moment here. This was October 24th. You can see the video there. This was after a rally in Tampa, Florida. So if the judge decides to allow this, it shows that they were at the same place. And Michael Cohen could have been speaking on the phone with Donald Trump as well in that very brief phone call. So that's why this is important. We're basically in cleanup right now of everything we've heard so far. But we're also nearing the end of this. So I think, again, going back to the retired judge you had on this morning and spoke with this afternoon, he said it landed flat in the courtroom. So the jury may not realize that this is a big deal that he stole. There have been so many allegations and things so I'm not sure. I was struck by his comment that it landed flat--(CROSSTALK)",
