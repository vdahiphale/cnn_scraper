They say that this individual had, quote, \"U.S. blood on his hands.\" They say that they had been watching him for some time and they targeted a vehicle that he was in, in one of these bases in eastern Baghdad. And according to a source within the group itself, he and another fighter were killed. Now it's not clear at this point whether or not they had told the Iraqi authorities ahead of the strike. We also heard from an Iraqi government official, a military spokesperson in fact, say that they believe that this was a blatant violation of the sovereignty of Iraq. So of course, some conflict there. But we have to remember that this comes in the context of an increase in the number of attacks on U.S. forces, in both Syria and in Iraq by these Iranian-backed militia groups. And we are seeing now the U.S. carrying out this retaliatory strike.",

And, of course, that could potentially bring Iran into the picture, which potentially then brings the U.S. into the picture because of Israel.

Certainly the United States, from the outset, post October the 7th, has said to stay out, has warned Iran to stay out and, as you say, on a state to state basis, we have not seen the uptick in activity by Iran itself. But it is these proxy groups around the region. When you talk about the proxy groups, we're talking about Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Hezbollah in Syria and Hezbollah in Iraq. So certainly, this is a region that is tense; whether we are looking at a wider regional conflict at this point remains to be seen at the beginning of what could be a really difficult 2024. Good to have, you thank you very much indeed. Israel says it will begin pulling thousands of soldiers out of Gaza this week in preparation, they say, for a new stage of the conflict. But despite, that there is still intense fighting in places, particularly the southern city of Khan Yunis. Gaza's Hamas-controlled ministry of health says 22 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike there earlier today, reporting 125 new deaths in Gaza in the past 24 hours. Now Israel's defense force, the IDF, says its operations in Khan Yunis have significantly impaired Hamas' ability to command its forces in the area. Meantime, mourners formed a procession in Beirut today for the funeral of Saleh al-Arouri. He was the deputy head of Hamas' political wing and his assassination inside Lebanon sent shock waves through the region. It has also sparked fears of this wider regional war, although Israel has not acknowledged that it played a role in the attack. We have team coverage on this. CNN's Nada Bashir is in Beirut and journalist Elliott Gotkine is covering the latest on the ground from Tel Aviv. Let's start, Elliott, with you, if we can, and what is happening on the ground. As I understand it, now Saudi Arabia and several European nations have joined the United States in condemning comments by far-right Israeli officials, calling for the resettlement of Gazans outside of Gaza. This adds an extra sort of layer to rhetoric and concern, which, of course, is leading to a further level of tension in the region. Just explain where we stand on that.",

This is the Martyrs cemetery in the Shatila camp, a historic camp established after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forcibly displaced after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. So as you can imagine, there is a strong sentiment in this area of support for the Palestinian causes and for many people here, for many people that we've spoken to, Saleh al-Arouri was revered as a symbol of Palestinian resistance. As you mentioned, number two in Hamas' political bureau, somebody who is considered one of the founders of the al-Qassam brigade, Hamas' military wing. That is exactly the reason why he was also seen as a primary target for Israel following Hamas' attacks on October 7th. You heard previously from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to target Hamas leaders wherever they may be located. And while Israeli officials have neither claimed nor denied responsibility for Tuesday's strike, this has certainly escalated tensions. Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, has accused Israel of carrying out what he described as a cowardly assassination on an official, against saying the U.S. believes that Israel was not behind the strike. Important to note that strike on Tuesday in Beirut took place in a Hezbollah stronghold. And, of course, al-Arouri was somebody who was already a senior official within Hamas, somebody who had very close ties and links with Iranian officials and, of course, close ties and links with officials in the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. We did hear yesterday from the secretary general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. He addressed Tuesday's strikes and he issued a warning to Israel, saying that the response from Hezbollah, if Israel were to seek a war with Lebanon, would be, in his words, limitless. And he has issued similar warnings in the past. But of course, we have seen these tensions escalate on Lebanon's southern border. That continues new daily exchange of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli military on that southern border. We heard those warnings from Israeli officials, including Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, that if -- that time is running out for diplomatic solutions, that Israel may have to seek military action. And of course, we have also heard from the Lebanese government, saying that Lebanon does not want to see a war break out, it wants peace on the southern border. But again, those tensions seem to be escalating and mounting as the days go by. There are real fears that the war between Israel and Hamas could certainly expand and spill over more broadly into the region.",

Hezbollah is running the show as it relates to what's happening down on the border and, of course, being a proxy that is highly influenced by Iran, it means that Iran is also directly involved in this. I think that the Lebanese government is relegated to issuing statements or asking for the United Nations to condemn Israel. But I think that there is still an important role to play here for the Lebanese government as an intermediary. Clearly what we're seeing with the visit of the U.S. presidential envoy to Israel, Amos Hochstein, is expected to be an effort at diplomacy. And the U.S. does not talk directly to Hezbollah but does communicate through the Lebanese government. There is still a pathway to resolve these differences through diplomacy. And as you know, I was recently in Beirut, talked to officials, talked to those who are in a position to know. And I think that Hezbollah and others are open to the diplomatic compromise that would meet Israel's demand to have Hezbollah withdraw from that border. But in return for solving some of those disputed territories and disputed points along the blue line, the border between Israel and Lebanon. So there is a pathway. The U.S. administration is involved. But that pathway is a difficult one for sure.",

We heard that a couple of times yesterday. And his answer is a bit nuanced. He will say, look, he has been drawing distinction to basically initially start this year by running to complete the work of the former president. But now he is sort of arguing that Donald Trump was not effective in office, talking about immigration, how he did not build that border wall. One of the central pieces of the argument from the Florida governor is that he could serve two terms in office, that he could serve longer than Donald Trump. But the question is, is he Trump lite or is it something more than that?

Just for background here, the 14th Amendment ofour Constitution says that anybody who engages in insurrection or rebellion is disqualified from holding further office. The problem however is that we've never been told by our Constitution itself, by our Supreme Court or by Congress exactly how that is supposed to work. What happened here in United States starting a couple of years ago is that there's starting to be a bit of a scholarly academic effort to argue what may be this amendment should be applied to Donald Trump. And soon it started to take wing in the courts. And there were various challenges brought to Donald Trump in various states. Several dozen states here in the United States, most of which have been rejected various either procedural or factual reasons. However, in the last few weeks, two states, Colorado and, Maine have decided that, yes, Donald Trump has to be removed from the ballot and now Donald Trump's team is in the process of appealing both of those. The Colorado decision is already up to the doorstep of the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court to formally take the case last night. They can decide that in any moment. The main case still has to make its way through the Maine state courts. But Trump's argument is here essentially is, A, I didn't engage in insurrection but B, this is procedurally flawed.

And I think that this prisoner swap is definitely one that was extremely important, not just for the Russians but especially also for the Ukrainians as well. We saw some pretty emotional scenes as some of those prisoners came back here to Ukrainian soil. And one of the reasons for that is that a lot of the prisoners that were now brought back to the Ukrainian side are among those who were at the longest held Ukrainian prisoners in Russian custody. Some of them were defenders of the Chernobyl power plant in the very early stages of Russia's full-on invasion of Ukraine. The ratpass (ph) Chernobyl was one of the main routes that the Russians took in their initial attack. A lot of those people have been locked up in a nuclear bunker under that power plant for about a month and were then taken into Russia.
