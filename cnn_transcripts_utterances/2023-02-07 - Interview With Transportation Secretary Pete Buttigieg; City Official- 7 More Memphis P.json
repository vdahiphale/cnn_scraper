You and other administration officials have said this administration has delivered historic results.But the polling, as I'm sure you've seen, on the economy tells a different story. Just six in 10 American adults say that President Biden hasn't accomplished anything. What's behind that, do you think? Is it just a communications issue or could it be that the policies are not reaching people where they need it the most?",

Now, it's true that there are still headwinds and issues affecting our economy. It's also true that there's frankly an enormous well- resourced noise machine that doesn't always make it easy to tell our story through some of the online negativity and partisanship that's there. That's why the State of the Union is a great opportunity to lay out in very direct, factual terms what has been achieved and what is going to continue. Remember, some of the most important achievements of this president and this administration are quite new. I'll point to the $35 insulin cap for any senior, anyone on Medicare. And, of course, the president continues to push for that to happen for every single American. That's something that's only been a reality for a matter of weeks. Same is true for other economic wins. We recognize it's going to take a while to flow through. But the point is we need to keep up this economic vision that's based on building the economy, as the president often says, from the bottom up and middle out. Instead of lurching back towards the policies that are more about things like tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that many House Republicans appear to be pushing. The American people already agree with the president on each of these major steps, whether it's letting Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices, whether it's having fair taxation that asks the wealthiest pay their fair share. Which, by the way, is a big part of the way we're paying the deficits, something else that many Republicans and Democrats agree on, if not around the country, if not always on Capitol Hill.

With the city attorney of Memphis telling me that, in addition to the six officers who have already been terminated in their role in the Tyre Nichols' stop, we should expect an additional seven officers to receive some sort of discipline.These officers have not been identified nor have any details been given as to their involvement in the Tyre Nichols' stop. The city attorney her, Jennifer Sink, telling me this is separate from the TBI's criminal investigation. So these are not criminal charges or any criminal sort of action, but that administrative discipline. The city council meeting, which got under way earlier this morning, has been tense at times. It has been emotional with the chairwoman of the city council saying that the year is barely under way and it's already been a deeply emotional time for the city of Memphis and beyond. They're proposing about 12 reforms for public safety here. And it was a well-attended event by the public here. And organizers and activists, they're very clear about the three things they want. Saying they want to pass data transparency, an ordinance that they say will give better clarity about why people are pulled over and what happens to them after pulled over. They also want the end of the use of unmarked cars and plain-clothed officers during traffic stops, as well as the end to pretextual stops. This city council meeting is still going on as I'm giving this report. And we expect members of the public to be given an opportunity to make comments later this afternoon -- Abby?",

That most recent hike suggests that the Fed likes the progress in the fight against inflation. But -- and this is a big but -- there's a stunning number, the blockbuster jobs report that saw 517,000 jobs created in January. And that could potentially create a real headache for the Fed. Here's what Powell just said moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's sort all of this out with Justin Wilford. He's a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. So, Justin, when the head of Federal Reserve speaks, markets listen. Did they hear what they were looking for today? JUSTIN WILFORD, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS &amp; PUBLIC POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: So, in some sense, it's important that your viewers understand what's good for them is something that causes Jerome Powell a headache. The good news is the economy is doing well. Unemployment is at a 50- year low. And the reasons that worries Jerome Powell is -- with lots of people with jobs and lots of spending power, you might worry that would cause inflation down the track. But right now, the reality is inflation is falling. And the most recent numbers have been all good news. So Chairman Powell is a little confused because economists aren't used to hearing good news coupled with good news.",

If you look at the most recent numbers, they suggest inflation is 2-point-something percent or 3-point-something percent.So that real sense of urgency, that sense of crisis over the best part of the past year, that's really disappearing. Now, it still makes the Fed's job a little difficult because the Fed is trying to get inflation down to 2%. That's 2.0, not 2-point- something. And it may be a little bit down from 2-point-something to 3-point-something to sweep that last little bit of inflation out.

We've seen data, sometimes, you think you have it and realize it turned out to be statistical noise. At the moment, Chairman Powell is sort of the grumpiest guy around. So, he's not yet convinced. And really this, are the markets right and inflation is on the way down or is the Fed right? We're going to learn more about that in the next couple of months.",
