Remember, that issue of a debt limit was a complex, complicated issue that typically Congress tends weeks, if not months, to try to negotiate. No one wants to vote really to raise the borrowing limit in the United States.And Donald Trump does not want this to be part of his first year agenda. So, he wants to take it off the table now. He's saying deal with it now. And so he doesn't have to worry about when he's president. But there's a problem. There are Republicans in the ranks who say that they will never vote for a debt limit increase, especially if it does not have spending cuts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

That will occur at midnight to Saturday morning, and how long that could last remains a major question.

      "sentences": "Well, we're still waiting to hear exactly if we will hear from President Biden himself, but the White House and agencies across the federal government are bracing for this potential shutdown, readying their plans for how workers should proceed if Congress does not reach a deal in the next 17 hours. Now, senior officials here at the White House have been in close coordination with Democrats up on Capitol Hill on messaging and next steps. They believe that the onus is really on Republicans to sort out this situation and that they should stick to the initial bipartisan agreements they had reached with Democrats earlier this week.For President Biden's part, we have yet to hear publicly from him. He really has not been a player in this shutdown standoff, perhaps a reflection of the limited influence he has in the waning days of his presidency as the incoming president, Donald Trump, has injected himself into this debate. Now, if Congress does not reach an agreement by midnight tonight, there would be a wide impact across the federal government. All federal agencies would be impacted. An estimated 875,000 workers would be furloughed. Thousands more would be deemed essential and still report for work but not be paid until this shutdown is over. The White House started to notify their staff just yesterday on some of the guidance and instructions for how they should proceed if there is a shutdown. They wrote, quote, if a shutdown occurs, employees should consider themselves furloughed unless told otherwise by their authorized supervisor or component leadership. Now, past shutdowns have shown us a little bit of what could be impacted. National parks and museums would shut down. There could also be issues at the IRS just as tax filing season is about to begin. Then there's a lot of questions about holiday travel. TSA agents and air traffic controllers are deemed essential, would have to continue to work. But in past shutdowns, some had called out sick, which caused delays to flights, really complicating travel at one of the busiest seasons of the year. Now, some things that would not be impacted, Social Security checks would continue to go out, Medicare and Medicaid benefits would also continue to proceed. But if an agreement is not reached, it could also jeopardize relief for farmers and also critical disaster recovery aid that many southeastern states still need in the wake of those hurricanes earlier this year. Now, if the government shuts down tonight, this will be the first shutdown since 2018 when President Trump was in office. That one lasted for 35 days. That is something that this White House does not want to see proceed. But at this time, it's unclear what exactly the resolution will be up on Capitol Hill as Republicans are still snarled in this fight.",

He did not have to enter a plea, just the complaint was unsealed, and we learned a lot more about what the feds say they have against him. As they say, the FBI was also collecting evidence as the NYPD was doing their case as well. And a lot of new stuff we're learning is from that notebook that you referenced that police say was on him when he was arrested. Let me read you some of these excerpts because it really gets into the whole stalking and movements of Brian Thompson that police say Luigi Mangione did prior to this killing. An August 15th entry says, quote, the details are finally coming together, end quote. I'm glad in a way that I've procrastinated and allowed time to learn more about UnitedHealthcare. And, remember, this is a couple months prior to the actual killing. On October 22nd in this federal complaint, it says, quote, the writer called the conference, quote, a true windfall, and there was this detailed plan, as you already stated, to whack an insurance company CEO, all according, again, to this federal complaint. So, a lot more evidence coming out in that complaint, a lot more evidence against him, but it's going to be interesting to see how this moves forward with these two different courts, sort of not battling it out, but basically, you know, dealing with the charges that are at hand here.",
