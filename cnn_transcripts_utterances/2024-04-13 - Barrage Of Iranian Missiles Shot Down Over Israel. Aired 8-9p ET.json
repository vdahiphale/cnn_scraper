We're following major breaking news over the skies of Israel.A wide-scale aerial assault is going on right now with waves and waves of drones and missile streaming in from Iran, directly from Iran. Our team on the ground in Jerusalem has been hearing explosions with sirens have been going off over these past several moments as U.S. and Israeli forces have reported intercepting multiple Iranian attacks. But we still do not know what the ultimate impact of this latest Iranian barrage will be, not the immediate damage inside Israel nor the response that it might bring next from the Israeli military. Our reporters and analysts are covering all of this. And we have reporters everywhere watching all of this unfold. I want to go right to our chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward. She's joining us from Tel Aviv. Clarissa, we heard the sirens going off. We saw the rockets a being intercepted by the Iron Dome over Jerusalem. What are you seeing over Tel Aviv, the largest city in Israel?",

It is quieter now, people are bracing themselves for ongoing waves of drones and missiles and intercepts potentially going throughout the night a lot of concern as to what this portends people really, I think just taking in these extraordinary images that we're seeing particularly over Jerusalem of those intercepts over the Al-Aqsa Mosque itself, one of the holiest sites in Islam and trying to grapple with what this portends for the region more broadly.We are expecting to hear from the IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, any moment now, Israel has closed its airspace. It has advised residents throughout the country, but particularly in several key areas. And here another jet now in the distance to remain close to a shelter, to be vigilant to stake close to their phones, to make sure that they're following updates. Schools have been closed, universities have been closed. And everyone really just bracing themselves for what comes next, because as we have discussed previously, Iran is now declaring this a fait accompli. They have achieved what they set out to do and it's now over, but really until we see the scale and scope of the damage or destruction that may or may not come as a result of this unprecedented aerial assault. It is far too soon to say that this is over and done with, not by any stretch of the imagination. So certainly tensions here, very high and across the region as people wait to see what these future waves could bring, Wolf.",

We also saw a lot of people in our hotel gathering in the lobby carrying their pillows asking where the shelter was. A lot of nervousness, as I said, hotel staff telling them that wasn't necessary at this stage.And again, just to underscore, Wolf, we haven't heard of direct impacts yet. We don't have a sense of any significant casualties yet though there is a report of one 10-year-old girl in the Negev area who was seriously injured. And so at this stage, the intercepts do appear to be remarkably effective, but that does nothing to detract. I would argue, Wolf, from the seriousness of the moment in terms of how this could quickly now escalate into that regional conflagration that everyone had been fearing and had been helping to try to avert.",

There were -- there were perhaps we saw 30 to 40 intercepts. You could hear the detonations. You can hear detonations coming from other parts of the city. You could see at times what appeared to be missiles flying low andsteady through the air and then being intercepted. It appeared that fighter jets were doing much of intercepts there were ongoing, but they sound like the detonations of Iron Dome type intercepts going on in the background. I'm hearing jets above, but there were some very loud detonations and of course the sound of sirens and you could hear on the streets as well, the sound of people panicking when all of this was happening. Now, there had been no indications we've had so far that despite all those intercepts above this densely populated city that has both Jewish populations, Arab here as well. There were no casualties that we're aware of so far. Of course, the IDF spokesman will be bringing an update on that, but I think one thing that I'm reflecting on now, Wolf, of course, we've all been here. Were spoken over the many months now since Hamas's horrendous and horrific October the 7th attacks and how shocked Israelis are, and how traumatized many of them still are, that their security could be so impacted and the security dynamic that they felt, the security pact with the government that they felt they had, that people in Israel would be safe from attack, from outside. Hamas blew that apart on October 7. But Iran is doing that again tonight. It is another level of attack, taking perhaps that precariousness, that concern that Israelis have about an outside power being able to bring death and destruction to them that is going to reach another level tonight, it seems, again, were taught about the crossing of a Rubicon. We've talked about the dynamic of Iran now targeting directly into Israel. But when you think about that in human terms, about the way people living here are going to feel about this new level of threat and how they already were impacted by Hamas, an October 7th, I have to reflect that this is, of course, now are going to be part of what weighs on the mind of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he considers his next move and how to respond to Iran -- Wolf.",

He said, we're working with our allies, ballistic missiles as well, he mentioned there, as well as the drones as well as the cruise missiles. So a full range of miss house has been fired.It does feel as if were in something of a lull from that first wave at the moment but he makes it very clear that this is an ongoing situation that they're still working he did not give details about how precisely Israel is working in with its allies and partners. We know that the United States has been involved in shooting down some of those missiles coming inbound to Israel. But earlier in this evening, we were told about dozens of drones. Then it was over 100 drones. And now we know its, it's 200 or more, multiple different types of missiles. Let's break it down for a second here. The drones are the slowest. They can take, perhaps as long as nine hours to get here from Iran. Then you have the cruise missiles that are faster fly, fly low, but could take as long as two hours to get here from Iran. And then the estimated time that it takes for a ballistic this missile to get here from Iran is 12 minutes and we've been seeing a lot of video popping up on social media. And of course, we were verifying it and checking it. But it does appear to me that it is the ballistic missiles seem to be the ones that are connecting with a ground and having the large explosions. Of course, Iran will have planned precisely how it was going to try and overwhelm Israel's air defense system. Now, Daniel Hagari, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the IDF spokesperson, did not say that the system was overwhelmed. He said that its been working at maximum capacity with the allies, but he did not give us that I heard yet a battle damage assessment of what has been hit. And of course, this will be closely guarded and controlled information because it is -- it is not in Israel's interests to tell Iran what has been hit, but we do know that some of those, some of those missiles were not intercepted from the videos we've seen, Wolf.",

They had.This is one of Iran's key capabilities effectively and asymmetric capability, you can use these fairly inexpensive drones launched them, control them over long distances and if they can hit their target, they can have deadly, devastating effects. And the U.S. has been watching the development of these drones very closely and the launch on this evening of those drones. Israel as well knows how effective these drones can be. We've seen them play out firsthand the Houthis use very similar types of drones acquiring the technology very often going from Iran. And we've seen the devastating effect those drones have had.

Israel by the drones, killer drones, they explode, that makes them killer drones are and the cruise missiles. Cruise missiles, of course, are much greater threat. Israeli and the United States have developed a very sophisticated anti-drone and anti-cruise missile system known as David's Sling and has been proven in combat in certain cases, but not in this massive scale. The question is whether the degree of these missiles, the amount of them coming at Israel from different directions will overwhelm that David's Sling system and there'll be significant damage and death in the state of Israel, which case Israel will have to respond. Then there's the broader question. You know, we for many years have been playing by Iran's rules. Iran has these proxy shooting us, whether it's Hamas or Hezbollah or Palestine Islamic Jihad, the pro- Iranian militias in Iraq and we shoot back at the proxies and you know, is you back the proxies, proxies hide behind civilian populations and we get branded as war criminals. In each round of fighting, Israel -- Israel gets condemned, but Iran gets away scot-free. So Israel, as long tried to change the rules of those games and have holds Iran responsible for what its proxies are doing. I'm sure the attack attributed to Israel last week against the consular section in Damascus was part of that effort to change the rules goals of the game because Hezbollah now is out firing Hamas in terms of rockets aimed at the north. There are 60,000 to 80,000 Israelis who can't go back to their homes the entire northern part of the country is uninhabitable. You got to change the rules of the game. So, yes, we don't know what this wave of rockets and drones is going to do to set a visual degree to which we and our allies can defend against it. But at the end of the day, we're still left with the Iranian game, which is to use proxies to destroy us. And frankly also attack American interests and international interests in the Middle East. I think those rules have to be changed.",

And I think the American people still expect that.The question is, would America go on to the offensive? And that I kind of, I would rather doubt. I think America will help defend Israel skies and we have agreements to that effect. United States, you know, I've mentioned this, David's Sling system. America has other anti- missile systems, THAAD system, Aegis system, the Patriot system. These are very effective and they can help guard Israel cities.

The amount of rockets that Iran has fired in Israel is unprecedented. The fact that it fired directly from Iran to Israel on such large amounts, and distributed areas, and also different weapon systems. Nothing like this has ever happened before. This is Iran crossing all lines of things that are conceivable as we've seen before. Now, so far it seems that Israel's defense systems are capable of intercepting those rockets. And, of course, with the enormous aid by CentCom U.S. forces that are doing a lot intercept them even before they reach Israeli airspace. I think it's important for the audience to understand just what would have happened if Israel did not have such different systems. All of those rockets that have been intercepted over the skies of Jerusalem, of Tel Aviv, of the Negev, of Haifa, of those would have hit civilian neighborhoods causing enormous amount of damage at least. So far, it seems that our weapons since the defense weapons systems are able to intercept them, and that's, of course, very important, but we should remember what could have happened if we didn't have all those systems, of course how.",

What Iran did is unacceptable. It's beyond any conceivable responses or attacks. And of course, Israel must respond. In what way, in what manner, these are things that I'm sure will be very carefully deliberated, before decision is made. But, Wolf, I think it's important also to note that military response is not the only thing that needs to happen here. You know, I sit in Washington as a fellow in the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, we talked a lot about what is necessary to do with Iran and the scope of international pressure. We need to recall that the sanctions on ballistic missiles have been lifted just a year ago, during 2023. Those are the same ballistic missiles that were fired and other missiles, of course, those sanctions were also against drones and cruise missiles. All of those are the answer on arsenal of the Iranians. I think it's important not only to ask, what should Israel do at the moment in response, but what should the international community do when you run is allowing itself to do something, this unimaginable and to use so many missiles against civilian targets in Israel, maybe to restore those sanctions.

This situation that we have seen unfold tonight is precisely the situation that U.S. officials had very much hoped to avoid and is something that actually U.S. officials had hoped to avoid even going back to the initial Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7. The possibility of a wider regional conflict erupting had always been on the minds of us officials and they had been watching this space very carefully. Now, what we see the president, sort of trying to juggle now, of course, is his repeated at statement of support for Israel's defense and security.

And he has seen his support erode among some key constituencies as he has declined to call four a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, something many of his supporters would like to see him do. So again, all of that sort of feeds to this overarching sort of goal and mission and hope that we were talking about before this administration, many U.S. officials certainly the president himself wanting to make sure that they can do what they can to try to keep this situation contained.",

Thank you very, very much.Right now, I want to bring in Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. He's a key member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, thank you very much for joining us. I know you're a strong supporter of Israel. What's your reaction to what Iran has now decided to do to launch these killer drones as the Israeli military calls them, these cruise missiles, these other rockets directly from inside Iran towards Israel? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Thanks. Well, thanks, Wolf. Thanks for having me. I'm literally at a bar mitzvah at the moment, which is what I ran is trying to destroy. Make no mistake about it: this is an unprecedented attack from Iran direct into Israel proper. It is beyond -- beyond proportional based on their response, hundreds of missiles into Israel. And by the way, not -- not on a government or targeted site like Israel did, but on civilians and on holy sites. The images of Israel's defense systems, protecting the Temple Mount, just to show the irresponsibility of the Iranian regime. And so, you know, obviously, we have to see how this all unfolds still, because it's still in real time. Hopefully, you know, there are no lives lost in Israel, it's clear that the allies, along with the Israel systems are doing their job. But this is what we all feared, Wolf, after October 7, that I ran would try to take advantage of the situation. We know the Houthis and Hezbollah, their proxies have been doing that for months now, hundreds of missiles and rockets from the Houthis and from Hezbollah destabilizing the region. And we're going to need everyone, everyone at the table rallying around Israel, and figuring out now what to do with Iran.",

I think we have to wait to see what damage Israel sustains. But this is, this is not a proportional, not even the realm of proportional. This is a clear provocation. This is Iran trying to draw Israel into a war. But Israel need to do everything it can defend itself. It'll gather the intelligence, working with the Americans, working with its allies across the region. I think you're seeing a number of nations come together in real time as this attack is unfolding to help Israel in its time of need. And the United States, obviously being its number one ally. And so the President Biden is doing a great job. He's been doing a job. His message has been clear that he will stand with Israel ironclad, period, no daylight.

We didn't think Iran would fire directly onto Israeli territory, at least that was the common wisdom because it didn't want to trigger some sort of global response. We didn't think that Iran would launch over Jerusalem, where it risked one of those missiles getting knocked out of the sky and hitting the Al-Aqsa mosque, which is one of the holiest sites of Islam.And it means that it calls into question everything else we thought about Iran and its potential actions possibly to arm itself with nuclear weapons, which it hasn't taken a separate -- hasn't taken yet. At this point, we've got a few hours more to watch what is coming in because ballistic missiles arrived right away, the cruise missiles that got fired, take five to six hours. And then the drones swarms that they launched in waves that could be arriving up to midnight hour time. So we've got a few more hours to see where those things might kit. And that will determine the strength of Israel's response. But, of course, Israel's already promising to respond.",

Do you think when they aim towards as Israel, they didn't necessarily realize that they were going to be going over Jerusalem, a holy city not just to Christians and Jews, but to Muslims as well? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, I think they knew that, you know, in general where they would be going. Jerusalem is such an important area for you through them, not only for the Muslim religion, as you mentioned, but for all the monotheistic religions. But the key thing is the precision of their aiming capability and, Wolf, if you look at how they do this, there are some weapons systems that they have. They can be pretty precise, including the fairly primitive drones with their fairly primitive engines that are basically like lawnmower engines. But they are able to do certain things with them. They can guide them in a certain way in real time. And that does make a difference. There missile systems are, have improved quite a bit in terms of their ability to hit a specific targets. So they knew generally what they were doing. I think what their main problem, Wolf, is that they didn't sequence things in the way that we would have expected them. To kind of Kim's point, there are so many aspects to mounting a campaign of this type that you would really need to sequence these things based on the timing of the weapon system, that capability of the weapon system the rapidity with which the weapon system can actually hit a target, and the distance that it can cover in a certain amount of time.",

So, it's a big deal. But the conversation that's been taking place so far between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Jake Sullivan and his counterpart, his national security adviser, Secretary Austin and others have all been a battle out to the Israelis. Look, you started this with an attack in Damascus that killed a number of IRGC members. You knew they were going to respond. Let's let the response sit. And yet the pressure on the Israelis to escalate again is going to be pretty high. So yet again, we're going to be in one of these tests between President Biden's influence on the Israelis and whether the Israelis will take some American advice and wind it down.",
