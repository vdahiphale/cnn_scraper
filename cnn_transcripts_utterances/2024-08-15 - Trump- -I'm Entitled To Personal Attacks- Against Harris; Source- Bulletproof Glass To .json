We have some new reporting coming in, on how the Secret Service plans to protect Donald Trump, when he returns to outdoor rallies, including surrounding him with bulletproof glass. And five arrests, in connection with the death of \"Friends\" star, Matthew Perry, including a woman known as the Ketamine Queen. One of the prosecutors, who announced these charges, today, is here with us. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Well Donald Trump, making it crystal clear, tonight, that he is not letting up on his personal attacks against Vice President Harris. In fact, he's leaning in, despite red flags being waved by some of his closest allies, who have been urging him to stick to policy, stay on message, focus, so that he can halt Harris' momentum. He kind of sort of did so today, for a little bit, at his Bedminster -- Bedminster golf club, in New Jersey. He walked out with this binder of prepared remarks, and did sound off on many policy matters. But then, in typical Trump fashion, the floodgates opened. When CNN's Alayna Treene asked Trump about the feedback he's been getting to lay off those personal attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm very angry at her that she'd weaponized the justice system against me and other people. Very angry at her. I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. And I think she'll be a terrible president. Whether the personal attacks are good, bad. I mean, she certainly attacks me personally. She actually called me, weird, he's weird. It was just a sound bite. And she called J.D. and I, weird. She's weird in her policy. Some people say, oh, why don't you be nice? But they're not nice to me. They want to put me in prison. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well he's creating a contrast, but not that one. I think he is looking sort of wildly, sloppily, undisciplined. And Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are looking pre- organized, energetic, enthusiastic and disciplined. I'm not surprised, he feels entitled to personal attacks. He feels entitled to grab women by the genitalia. He feels entitled to fraud the State of New York. He feels entitled to lie about his own election. He feels entitled to take money from his own donors. That's not the surprising part. But it's not working. It would be one thing if it were working to his advantage. Because we know he'll do anything. But it's not working. And in North Carolina, just last year, Biden -- Trump was up on Biden by as much as 11 points. Now that margin has shrunk to two, now that Kamala Harris is in it, that's a state that is now winnable for Democrats. He has to know this isn't working. This is only helping her.

To your point, he was shot at, and actually hit by a bullet. All of those things are not as important, as the past few weeks, where somebody is getting more attention than him.

REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL): Yes, well, thank you so much for the question. Obviously, with respects to my colleague, this shows the obvious hypocrisy going on, in the Republican Party, right now. Just look at Trump's plan on taxes, to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, raise taxes on the middle-class. The CBO has come out and said that this would add to the deficit, significantly. My colleague said, oh, well, that doesn't account for the cuts. My next question is, what cuts do you plan to make, to make up for that amount of addition to the deficit? And the answer is simple. They want to cut things like food stamps, SNAP benefits. We're talking about $6 a day for working families, and people who need the relief. We're talking about things like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. There are Republicans, like my senator, Rick Scott, who have said we need to be looking at sunsetting these programs every five years. And so, it's complete hypocrisy.

I think it is not going to be anytime soon that he is going to forget about those people. Nancy Pelosi is definitely the person that is at the top of that list. We saw her, publicly, sort of suggesting that she believed that this was a bad idea, for him to stay in the race. We know from our reporting that privately, she was letting him know too, you can't win this thing, and you might take down the house with you. So, I think those feelings are really raw. Something we reported was that there's sort of this -- both this feeling of feeling embittered by what happened, but also relieved.

He didn't want to be a distraction. And ultimately, yes, all of the Democrats that were calling out to say that he needed to go, not wanting to lose the Senate, and the House, and lose control of Congress, in addition to the White House. But, I think, ultimately, what it came down to was that he didn't want it to be a distraction that he was staying in the race. But I don't think, again, we have gotten any signs that he, at the end of the day, was convinced that he was going to lose to Donald Trump. And, I think, a really important thing to remember is that whenever you talk to folks, close to the President, people in the campaign, they very much believed that there was going to be a turning point, at some point in the race. When more people started to tune in, more people started to believe that this was going to be a race between Biden and Donald Trump, and sort of have that fear factor of, oh my gosh, it is going to be Donald Trump, and I better do something about it.
