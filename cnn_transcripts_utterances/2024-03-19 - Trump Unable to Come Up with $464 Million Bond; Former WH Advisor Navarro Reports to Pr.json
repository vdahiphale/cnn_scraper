It -- it works with republic -- with the Republican base. It works with the MAGA base. I do not believe this is an effective general election argument, and I think that this creates two problems for him.

And it's -- it's not abstract. You know, this is history-making. This is -- Peter Navarro was a Harvard-trained economist who was a professor in California, got involved in the Trump movement, in a way, and ended up, at the end of this long process, waiting for Donald Trump to come out and corroborate his claim so that he might be able to avoid prison.
