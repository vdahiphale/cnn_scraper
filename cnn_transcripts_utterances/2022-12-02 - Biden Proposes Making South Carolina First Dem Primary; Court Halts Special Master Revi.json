And this is what the White House send out in a letter and he had a private conversation with the leaders of the Rules and Bylaws Committee, it's called. It's in the weeds, but it's very important, of course. So, yes, most certainly he will get his way.There is some grumbling, though, of course, from Iowa, of course, from New Hampshire. And, you know, we're likely to see some fights. New Hampshire believes it's their God given right really to have the first in the nation of primary and they may go forward with it. We've seen that before they can be stripped of delegates. But look, this is actually what this is, is the Biden Protection Act. If someone else tries to challenge him in 2024, if he runs, this really squelches the opportunity for that in a more progressive place like New Hampshire, or Iowa, or in Nevada. So this really helps his own, the question is, is he actually going to run? We don't know the answer to that yet. But there's no question Iowa and New Hampshire are not diverse. We should also remember history. Barack Obama believes that he would not have become the nominee, if he wouldn't have started in Iowa. Iowa, that win as Margaret remembers, we covered the Obama campaign closely together, Iowa propelled him to finally win in South Carolina. So we'll see how that works if South Carolina goes first, but the history is important to this, but the Biden team wants to blow this all up.",

She said that they made the case to the White House as a delegation, urging them not to move forward, she indicated that no matter what New Hampshire was still going to try to move up its primary, they believe -- it's -- they say in state law for them to be first in the nation.

It's a huge problem necessarily, because Nikki Haley, say if she was running, some other Republicans may skip South Carolina because they think it's her home trip. But I think a bigger thing about this, just aside from South Carolina is Georgia and Michigan, very, very important, really changing demographics in Georgia, in particular.But Michigan, I was talking to some people this morning at the meeting, Michigan does not have party registration, they don't register by Democrat or Republican. So is there a chance for mischief or wherever Republicans to come over into the Democratic primary if there are number four or five in the calendar?

Trump now has seven days to appeal. But the court was unanimous in rejecting Trump's argument and in rebuking the lower court judge who granted the request for a third party to review those documents recovered when the FBI served its search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago.Let's discuss. Joining me now CNN's Paula Reid, CNN's Sara Murray, and a former federal prosecutor, Renato Mariotti. Paula Reid to you first, the Justice Department had said this as an overreach, it was unnecessary, it doesn't need a special master now that the special master will go away assuming Trump either doesn't appeal or loses that appeal, which most people think is likely. What is this due to the pace of the investigation?",

But this was the first big public victory for the newly appointed special counsel. And this removes an obstacle to his investigation because the special master was this independently appointed third party going through all these documents trying to decipher what could be privileged what should investigators not have, and that slows down the entire investigation.And we knew this wasn't going to go well. I was down in Atlanta for these arguments, three GOP appointed judges, two appointed by Trump. And it was clear that they had concerns they said, look, if defendants even former presidents can interfere in investigations like this, that would be a problem. Now to the question of appeal that you mentioned, they're mulling it over right now. But we know one of the one of the tactics the former President always uses right is delay. It's not expected that he would succeed. But even if he appeals and loses, that could delay. It is just a little bit longer.",

It was a tough call. But here's where we see it. These three judges saw no tough call, they write the law is clear. We cannot write a rule that allows any subject of a search warrant to block government investigations after the execution of the warrant. Nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so. Either approach would be a radical reordering of our case law limiting the federal courts involvement in criminal investigations. And both would violate bedrock separation-of-powers limitations.If you read this decision, Paula notes you could get some delay out of appealing. It doesn't sound to me, this is your wheelhouse, that there's any legal grounds.",

I'd be initiating lawsuits trying to get special masters, the federal courts will be swamped with claims from people who had their home search, their car search, they don't want that.

At least three different videos emerging from three different cities of ordinary Chinese people breaking down the barriers that authorities erect around their communities, when there are fears of a COVID outbreak, trying to cut them off from the rest of society.And we're seeing a kind of piecemeal response from different cities. One city saying OK, we're going to reduce lockdowns, lift them in some neighborhoods, another city saying you don't have to get a COVID test every 72 hours to ride public transport, these types of measures, but we are also seeing kind of the lengths that police will go to try to prevent organized shows of dissent, calling a protest who participated in a protest in Beijing Sunday night. We've heard a recording of this with a police officer saying we know you were at the protest because we detected your phone there. Come down to the police station. We're going to interrogate you. That shows you the almost the paranoia that the security forces have about organized protest. But meanwhile, the costs continue to add up for society.

Silence is complicity. That sentiment from the President is undeniable. The reason unrepented anti-Semitism spewed by the rapper Ye, formally Kanye West. And the very conspicuous silence from most Republicans. Ye just yesterday, gracing the airways of Alex Jones, a conspiracy megaphone and expressing his love, yes, his love for Hitler and the Nazis.Twenty-six million Americans hoping for up to $20,000 in student debt relief now will have to wait on the Supreme Court.
