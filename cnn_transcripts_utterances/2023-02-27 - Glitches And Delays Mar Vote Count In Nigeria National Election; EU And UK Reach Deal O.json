Janet Yellen warns of severe consequences of China flout sanctions. Live from London, it is Monday, February 27. I am Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest, and I too mean business. Good evening, everyone. Tonight, Nigeria's former President says its election process has been corrupted. In an open letter, Olusegun Obasanjo warns of dangerous disaster if issues are not rectified. The polls closed two days ago and election officials are under fire for how the vote was conducted and the long wait for the results. Many voters say they faced intimidation on Saturday. The military had to step in at one polling station after it was attacked. There is still no clear leader among the three main candidates you're seeing there on your screen. Bola Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar, and Peter Obi. Obi supporters appear to have pulled off an upset though in Lagos State. Results show the third party candidate winning there. Lagos is a traditional stronghold for Tinubu. Larry Madowo is in Lagos for us this hour. And Larry, let's start off with what we heard from the former President Obasanjo, some strong words from him saying that the election process has been corrupted.",

That's an extraordinary statement coming from former President Olusegun Obasanjo, essentiallysaying that the Electoral Commission here in Nigeria needs to repeat the elections in any parts of the country that were disrupted by violence, where officials failed to show up or where in some cases thugs just appeared and destroyed ballot materials. This election is increasingly coming in for criticism from various quarters, from voters who feel disenfranchised, from former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and even from the European Union. The observer group here says that this election suffered from a lack of transparency and operational failures, and we saw some of those operational failures and people here in Lagos, a cosmopolitan part of the country where it is easy to get to, where officials just did not show up, and people were outraged. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (PEOPLE protesting.) MADOWO (voice over): Fighting for the right to vote in what could be Nigeria's tightest presidential election ever. (on camera): People are getting pretty agitated here. It's day two since the election, they should have voted, but they didn't get to vote. It's become so hectic that the military has been called in to try and keep the peace.

And that's why so many young people came out to vote, excited by the prospect of changing the country in an election where for the first time, there is no former military leader running and there is no incumbent running. It was a fresh start for the country, and yet, you see the situation where so many voters feel disenfranchised, and they're accusing the Electoral Commission of colluding with the government to deny them, to suppress their vote, and essentially vote for a lot of people who they didn't choose to rule them and that's a recipe for disaster because we've seen this once before, during the AMSA's movement is when Nigerian young people go out onto the streets and said, \"Enough is enough.\"",

So we see a huge failure of institutions in Nigeria, and it is always at the last minute there will be huge operational failures, and then you'll just be having excuses. And of course, there was voter suppression. Now, we know that you know, one of the major surprises in this operation or in this election was the performance of the third force, which is the Labour Party, Peter Obi, and we saw the upsets they recorded in Lagos, you know, but we also know that a lot of voter suppression went down in Lagos, in Port Harcourt and River State and reports also we have it in Imo State.

So you got a sense that there was substantial support within the Conservative Party, but he also thought right at the end of his laying out the details of this new framework that one piece of legislation that the Conservative Party was pushing through Parliament that would have said it would have abrogated the terms and broken the terms of the international agreement, the protocol, the Brexit agreement, he said that was now going to be pushed to one side and dropped, and that did bring not boos, but you could hear a sort of an audible pushback from some members of his party.
