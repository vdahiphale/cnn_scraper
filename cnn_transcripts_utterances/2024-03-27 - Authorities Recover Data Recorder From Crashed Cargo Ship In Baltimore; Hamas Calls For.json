Tonight, the authoritiesare beginning to comb-over the evidence, recovering the ship's black box from the Dali, which crashed into the Baltimore Bridge. Hamas is now calling on overseas donors to stop parachuting food aid into Gaza, as some of those drops cause chaos and led to death. And a new CNN investigation is examining videos that appear to show rebel soldiers being tortured and killed by Myanmar's military. We'll have that story and much more. We begin in Baltimore tonight where authorities have now boarded the Dali container ship and say they have the data recorder, which is essentially the ship's black box. It all happens as the rescue operation has now become one of recovery. It means the six construction workers who went missing after the bridge collapsed are now presumed dead. The victims are believed to be from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, those doing the searching for their remains are facing major challenges. The waters are cold, dark and it is difficult. The Baltimore City Fire chief spoke about the situation earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A U.N. report this month found sexual violence against hostages likely occurred and could be ongoing. Deadly violence is escalating across the Israeli-Lebanese border, and that of course has raised fresh fears of a possible regional escalation.

It's also the number one port when it comes to sugar imports, also for -- number two for exporting coal, for machinery, for agriculture, and construction machinery. It's a huge player for all of those items and it's all been ground to a halt because of what's happened here. But, Richard, here's the real question. We know it's going to take months, probably potentially years, right, to rebuild the bridge. But the real question is, how fast can they reopen the port? How fast can they clear the waterway enough so that at least the port can be opened somewhat? Because that's the real key. The faster they can get it reopened, the less damage to the local economy and the less damage to the supply chain.",

Officials there say population centers are currently not at risk, so there's no need for people to leave homes. Climate change is affecting the rotation of the very Earth itself, according to a study from the University of California. It says that melting water is slowing the Earth's rotation as it moves from the poles towards the equator. Now, what's the effect? I hear you say. It could mean we have to take a second off a leap year in the coming years. Leap years are occasionally needed when divergence between atomic and the rotation of the Earth around one second. Now, these seconds have the potential to wreak havoc on susceptible computer systems. The author of the study, Duncan Agnew, explains the consequences. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
