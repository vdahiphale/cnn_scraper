But you hear his voice in some of these calls, too, where, in a very nice way, he might say, or not too subtle ways, talking about the ultimate goal here, right? Which was to get a different result.I wonder, from a legal perspective, how far does one have to go to substantiate the charge that this was not just a procedural effort but that the intent was to overturn the rightful results of the election? What do they have to prove? What do prosecutors have to prove?",

You can't have it both ways. Then with respect to Francis Watson, he was the chief investigator that he reached out to. I mean, there are texts showing he's like, look -- and I'm paraphrasing -- but can the Trump campaign just throw some money at this to hurry this along? If you're only acting in your capacity as a chief of staff, you're not offering up funds or the money of the Trump campaign to get to a certain result, and you're certainly not trying to put your thumb on the scale.",

Ultimately, at the end of the day, what he was doing really was political in nature. It was electioneering at a minimum. And that's in violation of the Hatch Act, which says that you, as an employee of the federal government, can't do that. There's no way he can legitimately say what he was doing was in furtherance of legitimate goals or, you know, responsibilities associated with the office.",

He was a flight paramedic on that helicopter. Incredibly, four people were hurt in this incident, two on the ground, two crew members of the helicopter, but we're hearing from the Pompano Beach city spokesperson none of those people were injured were injured critically. In fact, there's some video surfacing online showing first responders helping crew members of the helicopter off of the roof of that apartment building. Pretty incredible when you consider just the dramatic, disturbing video of this helicopter. It's an EC-135, pretty commonly used as a MEDEVAC helicopter around the world. There's some 2,000 of them flying. And you can see in that video what appears to be a fire on the left side of the cabin of that helicopter. Then the helicopter starts to spin out control. The boom that goes to the tail rotor essentially fails. Incredibly difficult, if not impossible to control a helicopter without the tail rotor. You can see if spinning there counterclockwise until it contacts with the ground. A pretty big crater in the roof of that apartment building. We're still waiting to hear a little bit more on the response here. And also investigators have their work cut out for them. What precipitated the fire? That's the big question. Was it something on board? Was it a failure of a system that was part of the airplane? Or was it something that was part of the life-saving equipment that's typically carried on board some of these aircraft? Really big questions here, Brianna. No doubt the FAA is investigating and the NTSB now leading the investigation as well.",

The U.S. military says 23 Marines were on board of an Osprey tilt- loader aircraft when it went down on a remote island during a training exercise. Five other Martines were injured. Rescue crews transported them to a hospital on the mainland. It's the latest deadly crash involving an Osprey, which has a checkered safety history. No word yet on what caused this latest accident. Also, new data shows that requests to ban books at public schools and libraries hit a 21-year high last year. The American Library Association says there were more than 1,000 questions to censor books in 2022, a 70, 7-0, percent increase over the previous year. Many of the titles singled out had LGBTQ themes or were written by people of color. Texas saw the most attempts to restrict access to books, while Florida had the average number of titles challenged in each ban attempt. Other states that saw a high number of book ban requests were Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Finally, a SpaceX capsule, carrying four astronauts from four different countries, has now docked at the International Space Station. They join seven astronauts already on board the orbiting laboratory and expect to spend about six months conducting experiments there. Brianna, I still haven't gotten my invitation. (LAUGHTER)",
