The IDF says Israeli troops have reached the enclaves' Mediterranean coast. And the advance has separated northern and southern Gaza from one another. You can see there on the map. Troops are also advancing on Gaza City, which is further north. An IDF spokesperson described it as a fortress of Hamas' terrorist activity. Nic Robertson is in Sderot. Nic, we can see from the map where, you know, Sderot is, so we've got a good idea where you are. Now, the -- this idea of splitting Gaza in two, whilst at the same time encircling Gaza City, is part of the strategy to do what next?",

Right now, you are showing at the top of the program there some live images of flares dropping down in northern Gaza. Well, we were watching those flares immediately behind me, over my shoulder here. So if you see flares dropping there, then that will probably be what you are looking at, that area inside Gaza that you are looking at before. Now, we've just heard heavy detonations coming from that area as well, which gives us an idea of the place you are showing at the top of the program with the flares above it is having some heavy bombardment around about this time. But to get to your point, and that is towards the coastal area, but to your point, splitting the Gaza Strip in two, a north and a south, is perhaps one step that the IDF is taking to try to make the problem of going after all the Hamas leadership a slightly more manageable one by breaking it into two pieces. We know the IDF controls a humanitarian corridor down the main highway from the link from the north to the south. They've left it open in a couple hours over the past few days. It gives them a chance to filter, if you will, and control, if you will, the population -- the civilian population that flees south. But the picture that really emerges from a military assessment is the next move for the IDF going in on foot if they do, or in armored vehicles into Gaza City, is a monumentally difficult and dangerous task because this is Hamas' home territory. This is where they will likely set up what the military call kill zones, where they can draw the IDF in, create a distraction, block a road, make a detonation, and try to put fire on the IDF troops as they go in. And this is something the IDF is wise, too. They say today that they have captured 50 of the rockets that Hamas fires out towards Israel, captured firing positions as well. But that doesn't diminish the difficulty and the dangerous nature of trying to actually go after the Hamas leadership themselves which, for many analysts at the moment, seems to be a stretch that's perhaps a stretch beyond the IDF's reach at the moment -- Richard.",

So far, he's attacked the judge, the New York attorney general, and he's slammed the proceedings. It's the first time the former president has publicly testified in any of the cases against him. Prosecutors in New York accused him of inflating the value of his properties for financial gain. And leaving the courtroom during the lunch break, he didn't speak, only gave -- well, you'll see.

Indeed, he's already lost one of the claims in this case. The judge has already ruled against Donald Trump on a claim for repetitive fraud. And so, it looks to me like Donald Trump is in the mode of saying I've already lost, I'm going to turn this into a political spectacle.

It looks like the other three are likely not to be tried until after the election. But if you're talking about what we call a final conviction, meaning, we have the whole trial, a jury comes back with the guilty verdict, then usually you need at least three months until sentencing. And then as you said, Richard, there's two layers of potential appeal. You get automatically one appeal, and then Donald Trump, if he loses, can try to get it up to the supreme court. That is, as a scientific matter of fact, not going to be accomplished by one year from now. All of that is not going to be accomplished by one year from now when we're voting on our next president.

With inflation and all of the other problems that this country has, I think it's a disgrace. And when you look at the numbers, the poll numbers that came out today from The New York Times and CBS, I'm sure The Times was not too happy, but people are sick and tired of what's happening. This is a sad -- I think it's a very sad day for America. But, anyway, this is a case that should have never been brought and it's a case that should be immediately dismissed. Thank you.

He wants this to be a race between him and Joe Biden, not a race between him and five or six or seven other Republicans. In his mind and in my mind, to be honest with you, he's taking the right track, at least to win the Republican primary. When we get to the general election, it may be a different ballgame. But it's these poll numbers that Donald Trump just spoke about and we just showed you, show at this particular point. He's the favorite against Joe Biden. So, something's going to have to change.
