At the summit, you confirmed your strong objections against unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion by China and agreed on reinforcing response capabilities. Under current circumstances, as Japan and the United States bolster defense capabilities, China may become more preoccupied in military expansion and intensify its coercive behavior. That is, the risk of dilemma, in order to avoid divide and expand -- avoid the divide, how should the Japan and the U.S. respond?",

At this summit, we confirmed that the United States and Japan will resolutely defend and bolster a free and open international order based on the rule of law. And that Japan and the United States, as global partners, shall work together for that purpose. On challenges concerning China, including the point you raised on objecting to unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion, we concurred that Japan and the United States, as global partners, shall work in close coordination.And also, as I said previously, we will continue our dialogue with China and we will cooperate with China in tackling common challenges. And that the president and I confirmed that the importance of such dialogue as well. Based on the solid trust with our ally, the United States, we will continue to call on Chinas to fulfill its responsibilities as a major power. Japan's policy, which I have consistently embraced, is to comprehensively promote the mutual strategic relationship we have with China and establish a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship through efforts by both sides. That has been my consistent position that I have upheld. We will continue to seek close communication with China at all levels. That's it for me.",

But for Japan to have a direct cooperation with AUKUS, nothing has been decided at this moment. Going forward with U.S., U.K., or with Australia, with such countries in bilateral or multilateral frameworks, we will continue our cooperation. So that will continue to be considered.

Regarding my summit meeting with the President Biden about North Korea, including the missile and nuclear issues, we have discussed, and regarding the increasingly worrying situation, we have agreed to continue close coordination.And on top of that, it will be concurred that the window of a discussion with North Korea is open. And we discussed that Japan-U.S., Japan, U.S. and ROK will continue to work closely together. I also asked for the continued understanding and cooperation for the immediate resolution of the adduction issue. And the President Biden, once again, gave myself a very strong assurance. Regarding the recent announcement by North Korea, I will refrain from commenting on each and every announcement by North Korea. But as I have been mentioning repeatedly, based on the perspective that the establishment of a meaningful relation between Japan and North Korea is in the interest of both Japan and North Korea. And that it would be hugely beneficial to the peace and stability of the region. My policy is to aim, before a summit meeting with North Korea, to resolve various issues and with advanced high-level consultation directly under my instruction. And that remains changed.

Prime Minister Kishida was asked whether there is a clear path for Japan to join that alliance. And he said that that is what they're going to be discussing through this new consultation. Of course, you mentioned the fact that China is not present here, President Xi is not here at this visit. But he was the center of the discussion. He was sort of the raison d'etre for this summit even taking place. And while the leaders went to great lengths to say that this is about readiness, this is not about conflict, it's about peace and stability in the South China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait, that they condemned the idea of unilateral force being used to reclaim Taiwan by China. But they still took -- took the opportunity to mention their alliance and mention the efforts that they we're going to try to protect that peace and stability while ensuring that the lines of communication are open. And stressing cooperation with China as the key to essentially defuse tensions and avoid misunderstanding or a miscommunication. Certainly, that is also going to be the theme tomorrow when the president of the Philippines joins the conversation. The three leaders are going to be discussing an infrastructure investment, we're told, where the U.S. and Japan will be funding a new rail and shipping corridor connecting to critical Filipino military bases. While the Philippines accuses China of harassment in some of its critical economic zones. So China will figure prominently in those continued discussions, even if they are saying that the goal is to defuse these tensions -- Brianna, Boris?",

Obviously, Japan is the linchpin of this effort in the United States to exert influence in the Pacific. But there was mention of Australia, of South Korea, the Philippines, obviously.
