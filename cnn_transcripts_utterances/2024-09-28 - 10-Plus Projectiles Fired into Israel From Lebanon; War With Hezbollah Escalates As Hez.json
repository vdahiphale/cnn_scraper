And I was talking a little while ago with somebody up along the northern border and he told me, and I was speaking, I was up there with him two weeks ago talking to him and he felt, you could tell. I met him earlier in the year as well, he was really down because they really felt they were being let down by the military, they're feeling it, he was living there alone, couldn't bring his family back, businesses, all of that. Today, he says, no, our trust has been restored in the military, in the IDF, but what we need them to do is to get in and go along the border and deconstruct the, the sort of safe places, the houses that Hezbollah has been using along the border. So, that remains and I think there will be broad political support for that. The caveat here and you'll know this instinctively, that the military has already fought a hard campaign a year-long in Gaza. So, they're not going to say that they're not going to do the job and they're ready to do the job.

I was struck by what the earlier reporter said about the sweep of history.I think the administration could have read the room better. When there's been an enormous attack from Gaza, the overwhelming sentiment that I noticed in Israel, especially on visits, was that they felt like they needed to reestablish their deterrence, because clearly Iran's proxies had no pause about coming in and trying to attack them. And I believe that over time Netanyahu made the calculation that I can't live, the state of Israel can't live with another genocidal terrorist organization on another border, in this case the northern border. So, I mean, it's great that the administration has tried so hard. Ceasefire and diplomacy is ultimately the way to go.

They needed to try to substantially degrade these terrorist organizations instead of just trying to strategically blow up some missile sites from time to time.

Instead, they had a high interception rate.And I know that is what is something that the Iranians are dealing with with a certain amount of consternation this morning. They know they need to hit back. They're not sure they won't have a repeat of what they tried last April and be seen as losing. So, it's definitely something that is enormous and something that the Israelis with along with the United States have a real advantage over a run over.

We should note there has been no official word from Hezbollah. Israel claims responsibility for what it called a targeted attack as well on missile storage sites in Beirut, saying that in addition to those strikes as well as the strike targeting the command center it has killed not just Nasrallah but other top Hezbollah commanders. The IDF says it is now conducting more airstrikes on Beirut's southern suburbs today. Hezbollah has launched rockets into Southern Israel. No reports of injuries from these attacks by Hezbollah.Iran's supreme leader is backing Hezbollah saying, \"All regional resistance forces are now standing with them.\" We're joined now by CNN international correspondent. Jeremy Diamond in Haifa. Jeremy, as you heard, Iran says it is now weighing its next moves, which, of course, adding to concerns of a wider war here.

      "sentences": "Well, that concern has gone up and down depending on the news. I think we are once again at a moment where that tension is very present, and that threat is very real. But I also think we have to acknowledge that there are a couple of different scenarios, and at this point, nobody really knows which direction this is going to go in. I mean, Hezbollah is one of Iran's most powerful proxy groups in the region.Hassan Nasrallah himself built Hezbollah over the course of the last three decades into one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. And Iran will certainly be reeling from what appears to be the death of Hassan Nasrallah, a very charismatic figure who, you know, managed Hezbollah's military operations very, very closely and directly. The question now is, will Iran take control of Hezbollah more directly? Who -- will they try and put somebody in Nasrallah's place? And then, will they direct Hezbollah to carry out a significant wave of attacks against Israel, perhaps even launching an all-out war or responding with an all-out war? Or will it choose another path, which is to tell Hezbollah to stand down for the moment, to regroup, and to reset itself effectively and determine what the next course of action actually is? And I think if we're being honest, we don't know which path Iran and Hezbollah's, you know, remaining or subsequent leadership will actually choose. We have expected that in the event of an all-out retaliation, that Hezbollah would carry out massive waves of attacks against Israel, and that just hasn't happened. And it speaks to the body blow after body blow that the Israeli military has delivered to Hezbollah's organizational structure, but also many of its weapons capacities, its rocket launchers over the course of thousands of airstrikes that it has conducted over the course of the last week and a half. And so it's very clear that Hezbollah is not only in disarray at the moment, but also that its capabilities have been reduced, at least for the time being. But it's also important to remember that Hezbollah is more than just Hassan Nasrallah. It's more than just its senior leadership. They have tens of thousands of fighters, and they also have a rocket and missile arsenal in the hundreds of thousands. It's not clear exactly how much of that arsenal has actually been destroyed by the Israeli military over the course of the last week but I think it's, it's probably safe to assume that much of that arsenal is certainly still are very much intact and, and is certainly still capable of being fired once has baller regroups and gets its act together should it choose to do so.",

Good to have you, particularly given your background is intelligence.

And part of the reason, as I -- as I remember it that he did not use such musicians and intent -- instead, ordered a higher risk SEAL operation was the concern about civilian casualties. Did Israel have another option here than to level several buildings with presumed civilian casualties, particularly when you look at the landscape following the attack? Did it have other realistic options to take out Nasrallah that would have minimized civilian casualties?",

President Obama did have that option of using bombs, you know, putting aircraft over the target, and dropping bombs, either manned aircraft or drones.And drones were also being considered by the Obama administration in the bin Laden raid. The Israelis could have done something like that. However, one of the key differences is that bin Laden was in an above ground compound. Nasrallah was in a -- an underground compound -- a very extensive underground compound that was below apartment buildings that were inhabited by basically normal people, and that was a huge challenge for the Israelis. They could potentially have used a special operations team to go in there at very, very high risk. The risk for them would have been much greater than it was for SEAL Team Six when they went in and did the bin Laden raid. I thought that was still a very risky -- highly risky operation that the U.S. conducted back in 2011. In this particular case, the Israelis would have had to deal with a whole warren of roads and alleys, and you know, things that you know would have possibly resulted in a major compromise of the operation. And so, they figured it was easy. They did a cost benefit analysis, basically, and they figured it was easier and more effective for them to use aircraft. In this particular case, they used F-15s from Hudson Air Base to go in and conduct this operation. And they did, so probably using 2,000- pound bombs. (CROSSTALK)",

It's also worth noting that there is a feeling that Iran has, in a sense, left Hezbollah out to dry, despite investing billions of dollars over the year in building up its military capabilities with training and ammunition and supplies and so forth. But by and large, Iran has essentially sat on the sidelines, as Hezbollah, certainly in the last two weeks, has been mauled, and all the Iranians have done until now is issue, declaration after declaration, but nothing palpable on the ground, causing it to a certain extent, a fair amount of unhappiness among those within Hezbollah who, before had put their faith in Tehran, as sort of the big brother who would come to their rescue.

It is incredible to see this, what has been left behind. Now, at its highest point, the river crested to 27 feet. That shattered a record.
