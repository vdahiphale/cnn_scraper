But unless they actually have a humanitarian component, we mitigate civilian casualties and we engage in diplomacy, you'll never fully wipe out Hamas. I believe that very, very ardently.And listen, every time you do a bombing mission or precision strike and civilians get killed, you create more terrorists. Right? The anger and the animosity that comes out of those strikes oftentimes multiplies your problem. So you can't just go after one Hamas commander and, if you end up killing civilians in the process, you're actually creating more problem than you're solving. So we have to choose a different path. There's a way of doing that with a surgical sustained counterterror operation. But it's a little bit different path than what we're seeing right now.",

I have fought wars in crowded cities when civilians were present. It changed our plans. Terrorists often use humans as shields but that does not change your obligations to protect civilians, period.\" So does Israel need to do a better job of listening to these warnings? And how do you actually avoid civilian deaths when Hamas uses these civilians as human shields and their tunnels or ambulances?",

      "sentences": "Well, one thing I want to make clear right now is the significant difference between Hamas and Israel.Hamas is a terrorist organization that specifically targets civilians. They're preventing civilians from leaving Gaza. They're using them as human shields. They're building their command centers under hospitals. They are specifically targeting and using civilians. Contrast that with Israel, that tries to avoid civilian casualties. But these are hard situations. These are hard militarily. You can always do better. And I've been pushing to do better. So there are situations where I think, given my experience, sometimes you make a decision not to strike a target. Even if there's a legitimate military objective or commander on site, if there are civilians present, you avoid and you find a different way of doing it because it is so important to protect innocent lives in combat. In pursuit of your larger long-term goal of safety and stability and humanitarian rights that you sometimes defer shorter-term objectives in the process.",

He's courting voters at a counter-rally in the predominantly Latino city of Hialeah.Hialeah's like 95 percent Hispanic. It's notably my hometown. A CNN poll shows that Trump currently carries 46 percent of the Latino vote among registered voters. That's a big jump from 2020 when that number was only 32 percent. CNN national correspondent, Kristen Holmes, is in Hialeah for us. And, Kristen, President Biden's poll numbers, he's still in the lead, but in the single digits. And he won among Latino voters in the last election by some 30 points. So this is significant ground for Trump.",

Well, even then he had made a significant amount of traction among Hispanic voters than what we saw back in 2016 and far more turnout. Now, Biden's still got the majority, but Trump's team really believes that they can make inroads with Hispanic voters. And I did speak to a number of people here. Obviously, no surprise that everyone here is an avid rampant supporter of Donald Trump. Many of the voters I spoke to were even wearing his mugshot on a shirt, wearing shirts that say, \"never surrender.\" Obviously indicating that Trump's legal woes are not having any impact on their support. But this is really part of a larger strategy that Trump's team is taking to try and find different voting blocs outside of Trump's traditional base that they think are going to be critical. Not only in 2024 in a general election should Trump be the nominee but also in the primary here in Florida. That is something they are watching carefully. We know they're actually going to launch ads on Hispanic media, television and radio, all targeting Hispanic voters that they believe are going to eventually help them. And one other thing I'll note is that, yesterday, Trump actually also taped an interview with Univision that's going to air tomorrow. So another thing to keep an eye on. This, again, part of a larger strategy as they eye the general election, trying to figure out what blocs of voters outside of Trump's traditional base they might be able to siphon away votes from.",

So I think one of the big questions today, of course, is, how are these pandas able to make it through such a long flight? Like, what typically happens to prepare them for a trip like this? What accommodations are they going to have on this flight? We all want to know. JEFF CORWIN, WILDLIFE &amp; CONSERVATION EXPERT: Well, good afternoon, guys. I'm delighted to be with you. But it's sort of a heartbreaking day today. Pandas have always been a part of the American national history landscape. People from around the North America have gone to incredible places like the Atlanta Zoo or to our National Zoo to witness these incredible ambassadors to wild China. And now they are going away. But they will survive this journey. No box has been left unchecked. Every \"I\" has been dotted, every \"T\" has been crossed to ensure that they will arrive back to their ancestral home, safely, well fed. And probably ready to continue their 19-hour-long nap.
