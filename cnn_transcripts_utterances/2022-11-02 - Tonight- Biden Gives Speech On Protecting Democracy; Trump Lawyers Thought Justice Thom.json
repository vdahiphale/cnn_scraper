Six days from the midterms, President Biden has something to say, adding a primetime speech to his calendar taking on the heightened political climate. As the election closes in, candidates are rolling out their closing messages. Plus, the plan to rope Supreme Court Clarence Thomas into the 2020 election. Why a Trump lawyer called Thomas the, quote, only chance to delay the process.

I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Jake Tapper.The countdown is on in our politics lead, just six days left until the votes are counted and the congressional balance of power decided. A brand-new CNN poll suggests Republican candidates have the momentum, 51 percent of likely voters say they'll vote for the Republican candidate for congress. That's higher than just a couple months ago, 47 percent say they'll vote for the Democrat, though the spread here is just outside the margin of error. Our CNN polling also showed Republican voters are far more motivated than Democrats. Thirty-eight percent of registered Republicans say they're extremely enthusiastic to go vote in this midterm election. And just 24 percent of Democrats say the same, just half what it was in the last midterm election. In the meantime, CNN's poll shows just half of Americans say they're somewhat confident in the outcome of the election. Democrats more likely to be confident than Republicans, 61 percent to 41 percent. And President Biden is continuing his final push towards Election Day with his speech tonight on protecting democracy. CNN senior White House correspondent Phil Mattingly is joining us live on that. So, Phil, you just heard how few people say they believe in the integrity of these elections. How will President Biden try to counter that?",

      "sentences": "You know, that is one of the --I'd say -- three driving factors of why the president is speaking tonight. Keep in mind, these remarks felt like they came out of nowhere. They were not on the president's schedule that comes out every night, the night beforehand, they were announced this morning. But I've been told by colleagues that the president has been grappling with this, looking to give a speech like this in primetime.It's something he did three weeks ago in Philadelphia. This, however, will be a political event and is driven by a couple key elements. The first is what you're talking about. White House officials say the president has been alarmed by the sheer number of Republican candidates who have said they -- or will not commit on the record, to accepting whatever the election results are, when next Tuesday comes around. To some degree, the president is going to try to get out in front of that and underscore the process in place here including the fact that in some states they may not know the answer to who won an election night. We're all familiar with that in 2020, the president included with that. But the other is and I think this has been visceral or acute, has been the attack on the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul Pelosi. The president obviously has closed relationship with the speaker, knows Paul Pelosi as well. But it's been the reaction according to White House officials of Republicans in the wake of the attack. Some Republicans have outright condemned it. Some made it clear what a problem it is. Some remain silent. The joking about it, the conspiracy theories tied to it, those have really kind of unsettled the president. We've heard him talk about it in public over the course of the last couple days. He will expand on that tonight. Keep one other thing in mind, though, as the president tries to draw a contrast, extremism according to him, Democrats respond to this argument, this will help outline that for Democrats. That will be something the president will talk about as well, Brianna.",

They thought that could happen. Pennsylvania has a history of split ticket voting. So, that is something floating out there. To that end, Mehmet Oz was in the collar counties outside of Philadelphia. These are suburban counties with swing votes. He was pitching himself to independents and moderate Democrats in the closing days of the race. Now, John Fetterman, his opponent, the Democratic lieutenant governor is also going to be in the area tomorrow in the closing days talking to independent voters as well. Of course, he's been trying to do the opposite thing, again, underscoring how much split ticket voting there can be in the state, there are Republicans for Fetterman. So, we've seen kind of play out on both sides.

The public will rightly question whether Justice Thomas is impartial.Just to make a comparison, if any Supreme Court justice's spouse worked for a company and that company had a chase in front of the Supreme Court, that justice would surely recuse, even if they never discussed the company or the spouse's work. In fact, Justice Thomas did recuse himself off a case in the 1990s where his son was a student at the military institute VMI, the fact that VMI was part of a suit, he recused himself.

And they had told Donald Trump were inaccurate.And there's a line where Eastman email where he points out the potential legal jeopardy of Trump signing on to this, saying, I have no doubt that an aggressive D.A. or U.S. attorney some place would go after both the president and his lawyers once all of that is on it.

And second of all, most importantly, these emails show that they were doing it based on what they were doing to be bogus or fraudulent information.To the extent they weren't even willing to let the president, their client, signed on, and were reluctant to do that.

And they aren't. The economy might be the thing that every single voter says is their number one issue. And they might trust Republicans more than Democrats, but, Abby, to your point, voters can go to the polls with more than one issue on their mind. And if you look at -- my biggest question going into this election cycle was -- is the trend that we saw in the five special-held special elections in especially in New York 19 with Pat Ryan and what happened in Kansas, is that going to hold water still?

And no one is treating as if it was a huge deal. And it is a huge deal. Why? Because that's not a poll. These are votes that are already banked.

She wants to know what policies and procedures were in place by the U.S. Capitol police to protect the Pelosi residence behind me. And were those policies followed.And also, what are they going to do going forward, in order to ensure that they are latched up with local law enforcement, that these buildings are protected not just in Washington, but also when members of Congress are out in their district. The capitol police releasing a statement a short time ago saying they are working on answering some of these question but they say in part of it, the department has begun an internal security review and we'll be gathering input from our congressional stakeholders, we will fast track the work we're doing for members of Congress outside of Washington while also providing new protective options that will address concerns following Friday's targeted attack. You'll recall after the January 6 insurrection, there were numerous recommendations made to the capitol police about things they should change, and things they should do better. What the Capitol Police is saying they will now fast track a lot of those recommendations that pertain not just towards protecting the Capitol building in Washington but buildings like the one behind me where residents live when not in the D.C. area, Brianna.",

Pyongyang never officially recognized that line, until Wednesday, the never fired a missile over it, either. South Korea's President Yoon Suk-Yeol holding to his hawkish stance on North Korea, calling the launch an effective territorial invasion. The missile actually fell just shy of the South's territorial waters. He infuriated North Korea this week, forging ahead with operation Vigilant Storm, South Korea's largest combined military air drills with the U.S., five days of war games, 240 aircraft, thousands of service members from both countries. Pyongyang's foreign ministry promising powerful follow-up measures. For the Korean peninsula, a day of unnerving first. The first time North Korea launched at least 23 missiles in a single day, skyrocketing tensions to levels unseen in half a decade. The first time South Korea and the U.S. responded by firing surface-to-air missiles near the North's territorial waters. CNN counts 29 North Korean missile launch events this year, including a barrage of eight missiles in a single day back in June. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera):  And back then, we thought that was a lot. Now here we are, almost three times that amount, and it just keeps on coming. So why, Brianna, does Kim Jong-un feel like he can do this without consequences? Well, simple. He knows that China and Russia have veto power at the United Nations Security Council and he knows that Xi and Putin are in no mood to work with the U.S. and the West right now on punishing Pyongyang, and he knows that Joe Biden's eyes are focused on Ukraine and the upcoming midterm elections. Which raises questions about what does he have planned next? Maybe that seventh underground nuclear test.",

It's an incredibly opaque target. So, as recently as a couple of weeks ago, U.S. officials were telling us they have seen no evidence that these expected shipments of North Korean artillery had made it to the battlefield in Ukraine, leading some to speculate that North Korea might be backing away from its alleged agreement to provide this military support to Russia. So it gives you a sense of how opaque this space is. Now, thanks to a new piece of intelligence that's recently been declassified, the Biden administration believes the shipments are proceeding. But it's important to note that at this point, it doesn't seem like the United States has actually seen any of these artillery shells on the battlefield in Ukraine, with National Security Council John Kirby saying earlier today that the U.S. is still monitoring to see whether or not Russia has actually received these shipments.",
