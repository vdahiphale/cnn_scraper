I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Right now, fears and frustrations are rising across the Northeastern U.S. after weeks of mysterious drone sightings. This morning, New Jersey officials are demanding answers and blaming the federal government for not being more forthcoming. As witnesses see drones, some the size of cars reportedly hovering around residential neighborhoods, restricted sites, and critical infrastructure. But the White House says there is no cause for concern, claiming they know of no threat or of any dangerous activity. Despite those assurances, there are new reports of drones spotted flying in parts of Pennsylvania now and New York. And Connecticut officials say they are deploying a drone detection system to investigate reported sightings there. CNN's Gloria Pazmino and Julia Benbrook are tracking all the latest developments. Gloria, let's go to you first. Moments ago, we heard from New York Governor Kathy Hochul. What is she saying?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fred, we just heard from the governor in the last few minutes with a new reported activity of these drone sightings here in the state of New York, which according to the governor, resulted in a local airport having to shut down its airspace last night because of these sightings.We have a statement from the governor, which in part reads, quote, \"This bill would reform legal authorities to counter-UAS\", that's unmanned aircraft systems, \"and strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones and would extend counter-UAS activities to select state and local law enforcement agencies. Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,\" she continued. \"Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.\" Now, Fred, let me just explain a little bit of what the governor is talking about here. She is expressing support for a piece of federal legislation that would empower state and local authorities to counter these drone flyovers and these reported sightings. Right now, local governments have said that they are feeling a little bit hamstrung by the fact that the federal government has to come in and essentially deal with this. So there is a lot of frustration, not only because of the lack of information that's coming out from the federal government right now, but also because the local authorities are not empowered to respond. And that's what the governor is referring to here. She said that last night's activity had simply gone too far, and she is calling on the Biden administration to take additional action. Now, these drone sightings have been reported over the skies in the New York City metropolitan area, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Take a listen to Governor Josh Shapiro talking about what his state has reported. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D), PENNSYLVANIA: We're obviously aware of the drones, and we're taking it seriously. Homeland Security at the federal level is determined, and these are their words, not mine, that they do not pose a national security risk. I've directed Colonel Paris and the Pennsylvania State Police to look into this further. I know they'll be flying helos, they'll be flying helicopters to try and determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are. We've been conducting exercises. We'll be doing more this evening as well and try and get to the bottom of it here in Pennsylvania. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

During an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer last night, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was adamant that there was no threat or nefarious activity, that his agency had found no threat or nefarious activity. He went on to say that they deployed state-of-the-art technology as well as experts to New Jersey to investigate. And that technology had not found any evidence of these reported drone sightings, but they had found some evidence that some of those drone sightings that were reported were actually small aircraft.

Also, Sam Altman is someone who has had a contentious relationship with Elon Musk, who has become a very important figure in Donald Trump's orbit.

So since then, there have been calls to basically prosecute the president and his top aides on charges of insurrection and treason. His former defense minister is already behind bars. He tried to commit suicide earlier this week. That did not succeed. President Yoon has come out with his own statement saying, quote, \"I will stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I've walked with the people for the past two years should not stop. I will not give up\". However, he loses the powers of the presidency. Those now go to his prime minister, who serves as acting president. A constitutional court will have 180 days to decide whether or not to uphold this parliamentary impeachment. And that will then pave the way for elections. Eight years ago, South Korea impeached another president on corruption charges. She ultimately ended up being prosecuted and ending up behind bars. That could be in President Yoon's future as well.

And I think, you know, obviously there were many factors, but in my view, the most important factor is what was unleashed by Hamas in Gaza, which just goes to show how the law of unintended consequences plays out in the Middle East. We saw in October, October 7th, 2023, Hamas launched this assault on Israel by -- from all the information we have, from the documents that were found in Hamas's tunnels, they were hoping for an onslaught against Israel from all the proxies of Iran, all their allies, Hezbollah, the Houthis, the Palestinian groups inside of Israel and in the West Bank. And they expected that there would be a massive regional war against Israel. And what happened was that there was a transformation in the region, but the fire that they started ended up burning all their allies. And it just shows how you can see these elements, one after the other, collapsing. And, you know, Iran, the patron of Assad, had spent decades putting together this axis of resistance, this network of proxies encircling Israel. And with Hamas's move, basically that entire structure just unraveled, especially when -- when Hezbollah, which is an -- an Iranian proxy in Lebanon, started attacking Israel from Lebanon in -- in support of Hamas.

That's when Crystal Mangum, a then exotic dancer, accused three Duke men's lacrosse players of rape. Now, 18 years later, Mangum says it was all a lie. In an interview for the web show \"Let's Talk with Kat,\" hosted by Katerena DePasquale, Mangum said she testified falsely.The interview took place at the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women, where the 46-year-old woman is serving time for a 2013 second degree murder conviction for stabbing her boyfriend two years before. This is the part of the interview where she asked forgiveness for lying about what truly happened. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So here are the alerts across the Midwest, the core of the ice storm warning for parts of east and southeast Iowa, from Waterloo down to Ottumwa, Davenport, the Quad cities where we've had ice accumulation more than a quarter inch. Again, it's a quarter inch of just ice on trees, on roads, on power lines. That gets heavy. It weighs things down, causes some problem, especially if there's some wind involved as well. So Ottumwa, over a third of an inch there of some of that ice.So you can see the rain and there's all that pink where you have some of that warmer air upstairs in the atmosphere that's able to melt some of that what would be snow into some of that ice and get you that freezing rain deals with borderline temperatures. When you're kind of borderline around freezing, it's 29 degrees in Davenport, 33 in Ottumwa. And again, that's where you kind of get the borderline conditions of some of the freezing rain and this fleet. We'll continue with some more minor ice accumulations as we go through the rest of the day. And then it shifts to the east. This whole storm system moves east and takes additional rain and icy conditions into the Appalachian Mountains. As we go into the rest of the weekend, you can see some of that snow across parts of Pennsylvania and then some of that icy rain. You already have some winter alerts there from Roanoke up towards Pittsburgh where we could have some additional snow and again, maybe some icy conditions.",
