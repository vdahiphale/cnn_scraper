New Age Ukraine hangs in the balance. And this is what House Speaker Mike Johnson said about it just a few minutes ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Before we even talk about Ukraine, I'm going to tell the president what I'm telling all of you and we've told the American people, border, border, border. We have to take care of our own house. We have to secure our own border before we talk about doing anything else. And that's the message I've had since day one. It's a message we'll continue to have. And I think that's the message that the American people want us to deliver. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Just this morning, the Biden administration is making new moves against Houthi rebels. Now, labeling the Houthis as a specially designated global terrorist organ -- entity. In the announcement from the Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, he said. This designation seeks to promote accountability for the group's terrorist activities. If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the United States, will reevaluate this designation.This is something that obviously the officials say is a bid to deter the Iran-backed rebels from continuing their missile attacks in the Red Sea. But this is the latest action taken by the Biden administration to try and stop or at least deter them from the barrage of attacks that they have leveled since the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel. Now, joining us right now for more on this is Pentagon Press Secretary Major General Patrick Ryder. Thank you so much for coming in. This designation from State, the specially designated as global terrorists, this is not the more forceful I guess I'll describe it as a designation of a foreign terrorist organization. What does this do from the Pentagon's perspective, Major General? MAJ. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Yes. First of all, thanks for having me, Kate. And really what you're seeing here is a whole of government effort in terms of addressing the challenge that these Houthi attacks have continued to demonstrate. You know, what we've seen since mid-November is nearly 30 attacks by the Houthis against international shipping and mariners that are transiting the Red Sea. And so, we know that this is an international problem that requires an international response, as well as a whole of government response. So, in addition to diplomatic and economic tools, of course, here in the Department of Defense, we're focused on the military aspects of using force. And we'll continue to work closely not only with the interagency of the U.S. government but also our international allies and partners to address this real problem.",

In other words, we hit largely the targets that we intended to hit. We are not at war with the Houthis. We don't seek a broader conflict, obviously, but what we can't allow to stand are these reckless, illegal, and dangerous attacks.And so, again, we're going to call on the Houthis to stop. We're going to continue to work with our international partners to address this problem.

The attacks have not led up since you said that at the briefing, and they do not show signs of letting up. I mean, do you agree that they are not being deterred despite these strikes?",

And within just a matter about 10 seconds or less, releasing the flashbangs, banging on the door, ramming through, and then you see her interaction with them. This mother, Courtney Price says that her son -- there he is there, Waylon, was harmed during this incident, had to be hospitalized, and he was diagnosed with chemical pneumonitis, a form of lung irritation. And this is because she said of his inhaling the chemicals released by the flashbang. Now, she has put together a GoFundMe page, has already raised more than $30,000, and she has said that her son had to be in an ICU at one point. I just spoke with a hospital who told me that he is in stable condition. So, no more information on his condition there. But this is of course being looked at by the mayor's office, by the -- by the sheriff's department to find out you know why was this level of force needed in this incident. Now, I can tell you that this is part of an investigation into multiple gun theft. So, multiple stolen guns. There had been a raid that carried out on a -- on a nearby residence were two juveniles were arrested and three guns were found. They believe that the other stolen guns had been taken to this home. But in the end, only the mother and this young son were in the residence. And the aunt who owns that home told a local affiliate that the team that they were looking for -- the police were looking for hadn't lived there for more than a year. So, a lot of questions surrounding this. You've got that GoFundMe page. The child is still hospitalized. And the aunt told the affiliate that they're planning to take legal action here, John.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. This is adding to evidence that we've been seeing over the past few years and something that really is kind of a mystery in medicine right now. Why are we seeing these rates increase among younger people, particularly for cancers like colorectal cancer? The incidence of that has been rising since the 90s for younger people. And now, it's the leading cause of cancer death for men under the age of 50, the second leading cause for women.Now, that's up from the fourth leading cause in the late 1990s for both sexes. They see these kinds of trends they're also seeing in pancreatic and gastric cancers as well. And so, there's really a need to figure the is out. They say it's unexplained but likely reflects changes in lifestyle exposures that began with generations born starting around 1950. Now, overall, guys, the American Cancer Society here, giving projections for the number of diagnoses we should see with cancer in the United States this year of about two million. They're expecting about 611,000 deaths. However, they do say over the past three decades, the mortality rate from cancer has come down by 33 percent. Mostly because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and much better treatment in terms of targeted therapies for some cancers and immunotherapies as well. So, really seeing a lot there. But a lot more understanding needs to be done in terms of what's driving these younger diagnoses, guys.",
