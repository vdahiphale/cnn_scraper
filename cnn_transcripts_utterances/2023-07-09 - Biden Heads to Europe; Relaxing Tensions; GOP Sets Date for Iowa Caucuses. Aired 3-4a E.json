A big item on the agenda, when and how Ukraine could join NATO. Tensions between the U.S. and China may finally be easing as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wraps up her trip to Beijing. We'll have a live report for you from Taipei. And mark your political calendars. We now know the date for the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses, the important traditional, first in the nation nominating contest for president of the United States. NATO leaders meeting this week in Lithuania will try to cover a lot of ground in just a few days with Ukraine topping their agenda. U.S. President Joe Biden is set to leave in the coming hours, stopping first in London before going on to Vilnius. At the summit he'll press allies to continue their support for Ukraine and discuss Kyiv's longstanding request to join the military alliance. The summit will take place against the backdrop of the U.S. finally agreeing to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs in defiance of international convention. It's a controversial move but one the president is defending as necessary. For more on the president's upcoming trip, here's CNN's Priscilla Alvarez.",

      "sentences": "The stakes couldn't be higher for the future of the NATO alliance at a critical time, with the ongoing war in Ukraine and the failed coup attempt in Russia just last month.So, President Biden is going to embark on this three-country trip. He's going to start at the United Kingdom where he's going to meet with King Charles as well as the British prime minister, then move on to Lithuania for the NATO summit, and conclude his trip in Finland. But that summit is going to be key. And it is one in which there will likely be discussions about whether or not Ukraine will join NATO. Now, on Friday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that it's unlikely that coming out of the summit, Ukraine will be joining NATO, but they could be discussing steps forward. And that is something President Biden himself has acknowledged would be premature for Ukraine to join now but they could be discussing what that looks like moving forward. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that, then, you know, we -- and I mean what I say -- we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It's a commitment that we've all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we're all in the war. You know, we're in war with Russia, if that were the case. So, I think we have to lay out a path, a rational path, for Russia -- excuse me, for Ukraine to be able to qualify to get into NATO. NATO is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications, and from democratization to a whole range of other issues. So, in the meantime, though, I've spoken with Zelenskyy at length about this, and one of the things I indicated is the United States would be ready to provide, while the process was going on, and it's going to take awhile, while that process is going on, to provide security, ala the security we provide for Israel, providing the weaponry, the needs, the capacity to defend themselves if there is an agreement, if there is a ceasefire, if there is a peace agreement.

Basically the two sides stopped talking, not just militarily, but economically and all other areas of cooperation, even climate. But those lines of communication are now being reopened, and both sides seem to be aware of the urgency to do so. Because the problems that were happening, especially these military flashpoints, when you're talking about the Taiwan Strait, when you're talking about the South China Sea, there was growing concern expressed by U.S. officials that it would just take one tiny misstep and these things could have really escalated into something that would have been very difficult to control. But by having communication back open, by talking about the important issues, not just military but economy, by the U.S. being able to sit in a room and raise its concerns with China and China to do the same, to raise their concerns about what they believe is the U.S. decoupling, trying to decouple its economy, with the U.S. then responding, saying decoupling is impossible but they're going to protect the delicate pieces of technology and other things that they feel China has been targeting covertly and illegally for many years. And so it's not that the long list of problems and disagreements have gone away, but at least there's now somewhat of a framework in place to start to address them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: We know the decoupling of the world's two largest economies would be disastrous for both countries and destabilizing for the world and it would be virtually impossible to undertake. We want a dynamic and healthy global economy that is open, free and fair, not one that is fragmented or forces countries to take sides. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The government says it did carry out an operation in the city but insists it targeted rebel fighters and combat vehicles. Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have found another way to restrict women's lives. They've now ordered the closure of all beauty salons. As Katie Polglase reports, the move adds to the Taliban's draconian crackdown on women's involvement in society and cuts off a vital source of women's income. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice over): Driving through the streets of Kabul among the brightly colored shops is one last symbol of women being visible in the public life. Squeezing them out of sight, Taliban authorities ordered beauty parlors to be shut within the month, sending shockwaves for women already gripped in a chokehold. A salon owner who did not want to be identified for safety reasons told CNN the Taliban's order means her poverty-stricken family cannot afford the bare essentials. I don't understand why beauty salons should be banned, she says. My husband is jobless and this beauty salon is the only means to feed my family. I have four kids. They need food and clothes. The Taliban seized back power in the summer of 2021 with thousands of terrified families flocking to Kabul airport, desperate to escape the group's barbaric rule. While the Taliban vowed reform, promising to be more progressive than their previous rule, women were quickly erased from public life, banning teenage girls from secondary and higher education and ordering non-profit organizations to stop their female employees from coming to work. The salon owner we spoke to says she doesn't know what more can be taken from them before there's nothing left at all. No woman is showing off her face with makeup outside, and we're already wearing hijab in public, she said. This will further deprive women of their rights and freedoms. As the Taliban showily chips away at their rights, hope is slowly dwindling for some women. But others still haven't been deterred from raising their voices, even if it means risking their lives.
