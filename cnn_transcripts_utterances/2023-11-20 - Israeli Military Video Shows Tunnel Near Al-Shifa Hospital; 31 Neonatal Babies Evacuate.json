It begins here outside before camera is lowered into the tunnel, revealing a set of spiral stairs. Later, the tunnel walls were reinforced with concrete. Israel says Hamas has used Al-Shifa to cover up an extensive terror infrastructure underground, something Hamas and hospital officials also denied. Now, the IDF has also released videos and stills that it claims show Hamas bringing hostages into Al-Shifa Hospital on October the 7th, the day of the attacks. CNN cannot confirm the identities of individuals in the video or their affiliations and can't independently verify the content of the videos. Meanwhile, 31 neonatal babies evacuated from Al-Shifa are now being cared for in southern Gaza. They're expected to be transferred to Egypt. All are said to be fighting serious infections. One of the fathers who was reunited with his newborn son after two weeks says he wasn't sure earlier if his child was even safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL SBEITI, FATHER OF NEONATAL BABY FROM AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL (through translator):  We didn't know whether he was dead or alive, especially when communications were disconnected with doctors. They called us in the beginning to tell us that the child feels better and that we can come to take him, but the Israelis had already cut Salah al Din Street. We were in Nuzarat (ph). We can only pray for his safety, and he is here safe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that number has changed. So, tragically, some of them have died because it was very clear that every minute counted. In terms of what we are seeing in Al-Shifa right now, there are some patients that are trapped there, waiting to see if they can evacuate, the WHO, and some doctors inside describing lack of food and water. Some of the children are starving because they don't have access to water as well, milk, for the most vulnerable and wounded patients are still inside. But importantly, the babies are now in south of Gaza. And the next few hours, from what I hear, they should be coming through to the Egyptian side where they will be receiving the care that they need. In terms of the people that are accompanying these babies, the WHO says some of the babies to have family members. A lot of them do not. We don't know what happened to their family. We know there's been a lot of airstrikes, reporting the death toll. So, there's a lot of information that we still need, Max. But the point is to get them into Egypt right now.",

Escorted by tank, we switch into an armored personnel carrier for the final stretch. Even through a night vision screen, you can see the magnitude of destruction on the streets of Gaza City. We off-load at the Al-Shifa Hospital, pick our way along the street, or what's left of it. We have to keep our lights off most of the time or risk exposing our position.

You can see what looks like a letter accessing to it. As I step over here, it is very difficult to see how far down it goes, but it looks like there's almost a central shaft for staircase, and then the shaft disappears down into the darkness. We move around the opening for a better look at the shaft itself. What's clear from here is this is meant to go deep underground. Which direction does the tunnel go?",

Certainly over the last 24 hours.But, look, they haven't opened that door, that blast-proof door in the tunnel. We heard from spokesperson talking to Oren just now saying they assume that it leads to the hospital. This implies what Hamas is doing, that kind of language. So, they don't know for sure yet. They haven't completed this operation. It's a very delicate, very painstaking operation that's happening at the Al-Shifa Hospital. Separately, Max, they also put out CCTV video on Sunday which they claim shows two hostages being brought into Al-Shifa Hospital by Hamas on October 7th, which would imply that this is not new. This isn't something that Hamas just started doing, that they have been doing this since the start of the war and perhaps even before that. But the hospital has been used specifically for Hamas purposes. And one case, you can see this video that you're about to see a stretcher being brought in, which Israel says carries one of the injured hostages. Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says this doesn't prove anything. It just shows that whoever needed medical treatment got it. But, obviously, this is existential as Oren pointed out for this international credibility at this ongoing operation. If Israel can't prove that the hospital was being used by Hamas specifically to harm Israel, then it wouldn't lose its protected status under international law, and you can expect the calls for a cease-fire, calls for Israel to do more, accurate stations of war crimes in that case, are going to mount.",

We are told by sources that he wants to expand his hard-line immigration policies of his first term, including with massive deportation. They have a plan to round up undocumented migrants, put them into detention camps that would have to be built to host them until they can be deported.
