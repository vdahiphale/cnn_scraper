The campaign threw strategy on how they plan to win Georgia. The secret weapon may be, according to them, disenfranchise Georgia Republicans. The memo saying in part, Trump has waged a full on war with Georgia's top Republicans, including Governor Brian Kemp and the secretary of state Brad Raffensperger. The Harris campaign is also launched a new $50 million ad campaign in battleground states today.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has new reporting on all of this. She's joining us now. What do we expect?

Remember, this was a state that President Biden narrowly won in 2020. And when he did, it marked the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate had won in nearly 30 years. And that is the reason that it is being so closely watched now.Now, ahead of the visit, the campaign releasing a new ad that essentially gives us a glimpse of the argument that the vice president will continue to make over the next couple of months, and that is that she's going to prosecute the case against former President Donald Trump. All of this, of course, is part of that $50 million paid media campaign. But Democratic strategists that I have spoken with also say that it's not just about prosecuting the case, but also articulating how her vision is going to impact people's lives, especially in Georgia. This is a state that President Biden also visited this year, and it was at a time where voters are disillusioned. They were quite apathetic over the two unpopular candidates, former President Donald Trump and President Biden. But now some strategists say they are observing that enthusiasm on the ground, and they're hoping that the vice president and the campaign can start to capitalize on that, especially with this rally. But of course, Kate, its not an easy safe for Democrats, and the campaign is well aware of just how competitive it's going to be. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He has said, we have a history, really, I should say, of making similar comments. The team dug into some of what he had said publicly and found that he has referred to people without children as being mentally unstable, as being sociopathic.I want you to take a listen to what he said in this podcast from 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE, (R-OH) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There are just these basic cadences of life that I think are really powerful and really valuable when you have kids in your life. And the fact that so many people, especially in America's leadership class, just don't have that in their lives, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable. And of course, you talk about going on Twitter. Final point I'll make is you go on Twitter and almost always the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don't have kids at home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So in May of 2019, Vance had told the crowd that, quote, \"babies are good because were not sociopaths.\" In November 2020, he said, quote, that the \"most deranged\" and most psychotic people do not have kids. In 2021, there was an email that his team had circulated that said \"radical childless leaders in this country\" are those, referring to people without children. And then in September 2021, he tweeted, quote, \"cat ladies must be stopped.\" And I want to put some of this into context for you, Sara, because I've been talking to both Vance's team as well as Trump's team about some of these comments. First of all, as much as they are pushing back on this, we saw J.D. Vance kind of tried to clean up his comments at the end of last week. Privately, they acknowledge of course they do not like that this attention is on these comments. It's not a good look for him, particularly on the week, his first week really getting out there on the trail as Donald Trump's running mate. But they also are arguing and that, look, Donald Trump is still happy with Vance. They think that they can move beyond this. I think its difficult as we're continuing to dig up old emails and interviews that he has done saying similar things. And so it's going to be interesting to see how they try to move away from this just given he has said this so many times and repeatedly. And it does seem like it's something he believes, that people who do not have children don't really understand policies and make poor decisions. That's what he has said in the past.",

It makes very clear that what they are saying publicly is not necessarily what they believe privately.But here is a statement from Vance's spokesperson William Martin. He said, quote -- sorry. OK. He said, quote, \"Poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed, and dangerously liberal agenda. Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election, like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\" Now Sara, this does drive, of course, with what I'm hearing as well in my conversations with senior Trump advisers. I think it's clear that they were essentially measuring the drapes after that CNN debate in late June. [08:10:5] And now with Harris in the race, it's entirely changed this election cycle and their entire playbook on how to attack their opponent. They are, of course, concerned about Harris and have had to change gears on how to try to find out how to define her, workshopping lines. It's very -- they recognize that this race is going to be harder in the fall.

First of all, how is Iran trying to do this, trying to get into the minds of Americans? CHRIS KREBS, CHIEF PUBLIC POLICY OFFICER, SENTINELONE: Well, they've effectively copied the Russian playbook from the 2016 election. They're using covert personas, fake personas on social media. They're using their contractors' proxies and their own intelligence services to get out there and share messages that undermine the former president, that is. I do think though they are still much like other countries and other groups are still trying to figure out what the change at the top of the ticket on the Democratic side means.

What they do is they use our unique assets in the intelligence community that signals intelligence, that's human intelligence.

Their objective here is chaos. It's undermining democracy, it's causing us to lose faith in our political leadership and the processes is by which we elect our leaders.

I'm wearing this mask because the air is just still so thick with the smoke, even though the fire tore through this particular area on Thursday. And just to put that larger number that you mentioned into perspective, more than 373,000 acres burned, just 14 percent contained, John, that is more than 12 times the size of San Francisco. Now, we are in a small town near the Chico area called Cohasset. The population here just under 900. Most of the people were evacuated from this area when the flames tore through here on Thursday, devouring structures. You can see very little left behind. We could make out a white vehicle, a pickup truck in the background, but a lot of these structures -- it's really hard to figure out even what they were, whether they were homes, or some sort of storage garage areas. That's sort of unclear just because of how comprehensive this damage has been. And these -- or this is just one of at least 165 structures so far destroyed by the Park Fire. Thousands of people under evacuation in this whole area. Meanwhile, the man accused of starting what were now describing as the sixth largest fire in California history appeared in court on Monday. Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been charged with arson. And according to court documents, witnesses saw him pushing a burning car down the 60- foot embankment. It then caused the dry grass near there to catch fire and explode. He was seen, according to court documents, blending in calmly with a crowd afterwards. He did not enter a plea on Monday, but Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said that Stout had a previous criminal record. He was denied bail. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
