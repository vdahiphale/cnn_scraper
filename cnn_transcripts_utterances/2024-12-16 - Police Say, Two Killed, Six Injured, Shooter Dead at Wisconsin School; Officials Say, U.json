And so that's why they went ahead to the family and they started talking to the family. But investigators are still sort of digging through some of the evidence that they've been able to gather. The other thing, Wolf, here is they believe that the shooting was contained to a small area somewhere near a classroom and possibly out into a hallway. So, everything happened in one area. They were able to recover a handgun, but it is certainly very interesting for law enforcement right now that the shooter was a female and they are trying to still figure out a motive here, Wolf.",

But when I found out that it was a Christian school, of course, my mind went back to last year's shooting in Nashville of a private Christian -- I think it's Covenant School, by not a student at the time because it was an elementary school, but by a woman in her 20s who had attended there as a child.Now, that itself doesn't really give us a whole bunch of leeway, but for the very few female shooters that we have had, especially in schools, very often depression and suicide are the most the motivators. But, again, suicide, when you can take as many people out as possible, is something convenient. I do think that the Christian school thing made me think of a female first because of the very strident rules. It's not like a public school where people who may have an alternative gender identity, and the two school shooters that I can think of, Nashville and then the Colorado STEM schools from 2019. Both of those female shooters identified as gender neutral or as men. So, it occurs to me that perhaps the student had some identity issues that were at odds teachings. We don't know. We'll wait to find out more. But when I found out it was a Christian school, I thought that perhaps it could be a female shooter based on the Nashville shooting last year.",

I think now we're trying to learn why this happened.It's very interesting listening to the other panelists that this was a female considering so many of these incidents happen are cause by male. But it's interesting that the issues and the underlying issues that cause people to act out in a violent way, to shoot in schools and conduct this mass carnage, it's not limited to males, but now the same issues affect females and they will act out in a very violent way, as we've seen today. I think they're going to be looking through social media, through journals and diaries, if they exist, talking to friends, classmates, family members, to find out the mindset of this person, what they like, what was her interest, what type of activities she participated in. Were there any feuds or any conflicts that she was involved in that may have aggravated her and wanted her to act out, and if there are any behavioral health issues that exist right now, going back to early childhood.

But most mass shootings are perpetrated with handguns. So, when I heard it was a nine millimeter, I was not surprised.Most school shooters, especially when they're minors, as is the case in this situation, they get their guns from home. And what are people buying? Most people buy guns for self-defense. And when they do that, they buy handguns. Handguns are concealable, they're smaller, they're easier to wield. AR-15s are very rarely used in self-defense situations about five times a year. So, it didn't surprise me at all that when there's a gun for a child to take most likely it will be a handgun because that's what Americans are buying for self-defense.",

But it's not just the people who were shot or were killed. It's many of the young kids who heard the gunshots who were running for their lives, and the parents who were trying to find out if their kids were hurt in any way.And one of the hardest things for investigators here, especially with some of the younger kids, is interviewing them and trying to get information out of them. And a lot of times, what happens is the FBI, especially, they bring in, they have specially trained agents and social workers who come in and join these interviews. They bring dogs in, the therapy dogs in, to try and help some of these kids. I mean, it's going to be a really difficult and horrific time. So much attention right now on this community and these people who live here, you have all the media now, you have other people coming in.

JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ):  Well, first of all, Wolf, I think it's critically important that they're finally taking this step, I've been calling for this, to get technology in there, to work with local partners, local law enforcement. You know, who are getting the brunt of the phone calls. We've been receiving a lot of phone calls. You know, first, you can't tell people they're not seeing things that they're seeing with their own eyes, right? And I think the federal government, DHS, and FBI have made a mistake by doing that. You've got to give people more information. And I think we're starting to see that. Obviously, Secretary Mayorkas said clearly people are seeing these drones, which is a reversal of where they were, and I think that's important. Don't tell people they're not seeing things, but you actually have to give them information. And I've called on this today, like do a proper briefing, get the FBI out there and DHS and FAA and tell people what's going on, right? And I think that information is critically important. And then my legislation, bipartisan, says let's give local law enforcement the tools they need to actually monitor these drones, to monitor the activity, and if necessary, to work with federal partners to get these drones out of the sky if they're going to places they shouldn't be, over reservoirs, over military bases, over airports. Let's make sure we're safe and that people feel safe.",

However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't tell people what they are, where all this drone activity is coming from. Are they being used for any reconnaissance or any information collecting, right? Are they authorized, commercial? Are they there for -- are they licensed or not?I'm not talking about little drones that people fly up at the beach or at their house. I'm talking about these large drones that people are telling us they're seeing and obviously sending in photos of. I set up a site today where people can send in information to us to help collect this information that I can share with the intelligence community and the FBI, so that we have some evidence gathered and then let's let the government tell people what exactly they know. And I think, Wolf, that's the key. Be transparent, don't insult people and tell them they're not seeing anything. Come clean with folks, give them the information. And then everybody I think will feel better once they have more information of what's out there.",

The environment with their morning look like, some things about their day. So some of this is part of the investigation. So I think there's limited things that I can say at this time. Once the investigation is complete, obviously there will be more that will be shared.We certainly don't want to say anything that would impede MPD. That would be critical.

I know that this is an emotional event, obviously, for students, but those teachers really take it to heart when they are sitting there protecting those little ones at the school.Can you talk a little bit about what they did right in this situation?
