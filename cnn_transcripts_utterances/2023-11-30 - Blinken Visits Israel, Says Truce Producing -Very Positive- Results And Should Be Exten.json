She is launching her first TV ad blitz, but stopping just short of saying drop Donald Trump. Plus, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen joins me live with what he thinks about Democratic proposals to place conditions on aid to Israel. And former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has died at age 100. A look at the life of one of the most influential diplomats of the 20th century. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Thursday, November 30, just 46 days until the Iowa caucuses, 340 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Good day. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says a truce between Israel and Hamas is producing very positive results, and should be extended once again. He took that message to Israel, meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just hours before the seventh exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners got underway. It began a short time ago, the IDF announcing that two Israeli hostages were transferred to the Red Cross in Gaza and are now in the hands of Israeli forces. Let's get more now from Oren Liebermann live for us in Tel Aviv. Oren, what's the latest?",

They're being taken to the Hatzerim Airbase in southern Israel, where they will then be either taken by ambulance or by helicopter to a hospital where they'll undergo a much deeper and more thorough medical evaluation. First, of course, their physical health, but also their mental health as well. The forum for the hostages and the families identified them as 21-year-old Mia Schem and 40-year-old Amit Soussana. The IDF says they are expecting the release of more hostages later on. Israeli officials say one of the reasons we're not seeing this happen all at once is because the hostages are being held in different places in Gaza, and that was one of the major questions throughout the course of these releases and the negotiations. Hamas demanding essentially no Israeli overflight of drones for certain periods during the truce, such that they could get all the hostages they need to as part of the release of Israeli women and children. With this release now starting and we'll see how long it takes, we expect Palestinian women and children to be released from Israeli prisons a little later on this evening. What's also worth noting is that this went forward. The critical part of the truce went forward on the final day as of right now. But, it also comes after an attack claimed by Hamas in Jerusalem in which three Israeli citizens were killed and the two Palestinian attackers were killed. And yet, that was earlier this morning, shortly before eight o'clock. It would obviously have been the biggest violation of the truce, except it didn't happen in Gaza, and didn't rock what was already a fragile, essentially agreement that has been on thin ice over the course of the past seven days. It held together. The major question now, Kasie, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken here meeting both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, can this truce continue anymore? One of the questions, how many more women and children are being held in Gaza? And can this distrustful relationship between Israel and Hamas hold long enough for 24, 48 more hours? And then the bigger question of, can they expand it beyond just women and children to elderly men, and then soldiers, men and women?",

I think on the one side, I'm looking for more diplomatic progress. On the other, I'm looking for military preparations. I'm looking to see, is the IDF moving forward? Are there -- is there political rhetoric that leads one to believe that all of a sudden we are coming into a point where there is this point of no return that's in concert with Prime Minister Netanyahu's rhetoric? So, that's the kind of thing of he continues to ramp up the rhetoric, and then it's matched by troop movements, that would be one danger sign that the truce may not hold. Also the movements of Hamas, the development in Jerusalem where the three Israelis were killed, that is not positive. And so, if there is an increase in those kinds of activities, that could also spell trouble for the peace agreement, or any effort like that.",

The administration would like to see the Israelis recalibrate their tactical approach in Gaza so that there are less Palestinian civil casualties. A pause, even if it's temporary, even if it's a couple of days, is a reset of sorts. It's short term, but it is a reset of sorts, and it's buying that time, gives people an ability to rethink, to talk all of the above. The one area that I'm concerned about in watching is what's happening in the West Bank, because until now, this has been a Gaza-based situation with repercussions for refugees, anyone who manages to get out, where are they going to go, who is going to take care of them. But, so far, the West Bank has largely been insulated. The shoe everyone else is worried about dropping is if this conflict spreads on any level towards Ramallah. And we're seeing some unrest tied to jubilation about the release of some of these female prisoners. Like, it's complicated. But, I think whether there is a -- as long as the pause lasts, there is a parallel track to watch in terms of what is going on in the West Bank.",

Additionally, obviously, he is trying to get a seat back at the table for negotiations, when so much right now is transpiring between Hamas and the international party. So, what I think will be fascinating to watch for, after we get through this next extension is, are we starting to talk about what an international force coming into Gaza looks like? And what in fact are the parameters for Hamas staying there? Because Benjamin Netanyahu has painted himself into a corner, saying Hamas has to be eradicated from Gaza.
