I'm Becky Anderson coming to you live from London 4 pm here.This hour, the United States standing by to see whether Former President Donald Trump will turn himself in to face charges in his fourth indictment he and his 18 co-defendants have nine more days to surrender. Ukraine accuses Russia of targeting food supplies following a drone attack on the Odessa region. Meantime, the Ukrainian army says it has retaken territory in Donetsk. The Governor of Hawaii tells CNN that he believes some of Maui's warning sirens were not working but they are not normally used for wildfires anyway. The death tolls from the fires are now 106 with only 30 percent of the search for victims completed. Right Former U.S. President Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants are facing an August the 25th deadline to surrender in the U.S. State of Georgia. They are all facing various criminal charges accused of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. Now the Georgia jail where Trump and accused co-conspirators are expected to surrender is ready for the bookings. In fact, the sheriff has made clear it is open 24/7 meaning any defendant at any time could turn themselves in. Well, Trump has not indicated exactly when he will show up and there's also no date certain for the other 18 charge. Well, the Former President and his co-defendants are accused of breaking a variety of criminal laws but one charge ties all their alleged misconduct together. It's called the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act otherwise known as RICO. What is that? CNN's Brian Todd explains.

And in this situation, this is quite a substantial case. There are 160 some overt acts that the prosecutors say the people in this alleged criminal enterprise. So that is what RICO attacks criminal enterprises or prosecutes criminal enterprises. 160 some overt steps that they would have taken that become part of what you can try in court. Now, each of those acts might not be a criminal violation in itself, some of the things are just public messaging tweets, even. But when you take it all together, the RICO statute, it allows prosecutors to look at an operation and also target not just the people who are carrying out the things that are alleged crimes inside the operation, but also the people that are running it. And so this is a RICO statute. It's a RICO charge that is charged against Donald Trump and 18 others. And he was the president at the time. He was the candidate for office. And he also would be the very top person in this case that they are looking at that they're trying to get a conviction of their other charges as well. Several other people in this case and Trump him, they're charged with things like making false statements, other conspiracy charges that also would very likely be tried here. But the case the RICO case, that is count one in this very significant indictment of many different counts against Trump and others 41 counts and that RICO charge it is by far the most significant criminal allegation that the prosecutors in Georgia are making right now.",

So now he's charged in Fulton County, Georgia criminally and he says he wants to fight that case that costs money to fight cases. But even before he gets to the point of fighting that case, he hasn't even turned himself over yet or entered his initial pleading there. He also has several lawsuits that are progressing, they are not at their ends yet, so he hasn't won or lost those lawsuits. What right now he's just trying to keep his head above water in those lawsuits. There's a hearing going on right now about whether he has additional time or whether he has to turn over documents. And the documents that he has, they're kept by an archiving company that costs thousands of dollars, tens of thousands, even just to keep those records every month, and so he has massive bills for that some of those bills have been paid by Donald Trump's Super PAC so far save America PAC. But the amount of money that, that Rudy Giuliani is going to need just to keep fending off the intermediate steps of these lawsuits, these defamation suits about what he was saying about people after the 2020 election. It's a lot of money. And then on top of that he's already been sanctioned $89,000 by one court, another court has said he needs to pay $57,000 for unpaid phone bills related to his company in 2020.

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, it sounds really glib. But this is a huge country. And we forget, sometimes that whatwe obsess about in Washington, 24 hours a day is not necessarily what people outside in the rest of the country are worried about the events of January the sixth 2021. The attack on the Capitol, that feels even more distant when you're out in some of those Heartland States, the States that are starting to look towards the next presidential election. I was in Iowa recently, for example, and I was asking voters about what they thought, were they going to go for Trump? Did they feel that all these legal cases against him were disqualifying and a potential president? And one woman, for example, said to me that she was most concerned about the cost of childcare for her grandchildren. Farmers in Wisconsin, for example, a state where Joe Biden won by only 20,000 votes, one of the closest and most vital states in the country. They're being really hit by high interest rates, because their industry relies on short term borrowing. So that's a really big issue for them that clouds out a lot of these questions about democracy about Trump's trials, and everything else. I'm not saying that when we get to a point where Trump is on trial, he's showing up in court every day and people are voting that won't be a huge issue. I think it will be a real question for Republicans in the general election if Trump is their nominee. But add in all these other factors, and also the point that many Republicans don't believe that the biggest threat is Donald Trump, to democracy, but the fact that they see an elite East Coast establishment legal system, ganging up on Trump, that is how they come at these issues. And it's a lot different than perhaps it seems from Washington.",

But they're not really touching the allegations that Donald Trump tried to overturn democracy. That's because they need some of Donald Trump's voters and Republicans that still a sympathetic towards him to win the Republican nomination. They can't afford to alienate them politically, even though that's a position that could hurt them in a general election. As far as the Democrats concerned President Joe Biden has been trying to address that grievance, especially in Midwest industrialized states with a lot of his legislation which is designed at reviving American manufacturing. The problem with that is, even if it works, it's a long term strategy. And it's one that you can't necessarily show quick, short term benefits to voters in time for the next election. If Trump is the nominee, he would definitely go on this idea that Trump tried to stage a coup now he's trying to get the White House back, and you'll basically be voting for an authoritarian if Trump isn't the nominee, and you have a new candidate that changes the entire complexion of the election altogether. And that's what a lot of Democrats are worried about, after all, Joe Biden will be nearly 82 years old, by the time of the next election next November, and introducing a younger Republican candidate to go up against him that creates the kind of comparison that could be, I think, very threatening to the Democrats in this election. So they are definitely planning for Trump. They hope and believe that Trump's troubles in the suburban areas, swing states, which were evident in the midterm elections last year, and in 2020 will be the same this time. But if there's a different nominee, then we have a different election.",

You have watched that movie; it was about this budding football star that was taken in by this a southern family in the United States and really kind of raised and then eventually went on to a very successful NFL career. Well, in that movie, he sits around the table with the family. And he believed he was signing paperwork that would lead to the adoption by that family. Well, it turns out, apparently, Michael Oher just found out this past February, that he didn't sign paperwork toward his adoption. He actually signed paperwork, which was a conservative ship, and he didn't know that according to this paperwork, so he's pretty heated about it. Now there's still a ton of questions, Becky, to be quite frank about. Why did he just realize this now, he signed those papers at 18. He's now 37-years- old, that has not yet been answered by his attorneys. Well, he came forward with these, you know, this, this court filing essentially saying he wants money back that he earned from this movie proceeds and he wants to know where all this money went. And basically the terms of -- he wants out of his conservative shape. Well, the Tuohy family then now just came forward and essentially said that sure, he can get out of his conservatorship. They have no problem with that. But they painted this picture that Michael Oher has been shaking them down for money for several years and that this latest court filing is an attempt to basically get more money out of them. So yes, that story is so heartwarming, made us all feel good. It does seem like it's not totally factually true and it's really upset a lot of people just because it's turning quite ugly.
