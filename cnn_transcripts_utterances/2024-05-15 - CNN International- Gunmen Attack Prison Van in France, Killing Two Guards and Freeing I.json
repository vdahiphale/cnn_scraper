So, a very scary situation and obviously, thoughts with the prison officers there, there are big demonstrations today about the safety that they're afforded in these situations. Amra was on his way to court, by the way, on a burglary charge.AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello, everyone, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Amara Walker. This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, the U.S. is pledging an extra $2 billion in military financing to Ukraine. That from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a visit to Ukraine today. But, can that help tip the balance on the battlefield? Also, sources tell CNN the U.S. is beginning work on a new $1 billion arms deal for Israel. We are live in Jerusalem. Plus, CNN is on the ground, inside Haiti, as people struggle to access daily necessities like food and medicine. Why do guns and drugs keep flowing into the country? Ukraine's military says Russia's bombardment of the Kharkiv region has not let up. That has prompted officials there to evacuate some 8,000 people from the area. Overnight, Russian bombs on Kharkiv have injured at least 21 people, including children. Ukraine's defense could get a much needed boost soon. While in Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the U.S. and Ukraine are just weeks away from a bilateral security agreement. In a news conference with Ukraine's foreign minister there, he added that an additional $2 billion in military aid is on its way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKED, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Ukraine is facing this renewed brutal Russian onslaught and we see, again, senseless strikes at civilians, residential buildings. I emphasize to the president, my conversations with the foreign minister, the substance of the work that we're doing to get the aid to Ukraine. We're rushing ammunition, armored vehicles, missiles, air defenses, rushing them to get to the frontlines to protect soldiers, to protect civilians. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They've been seeing success and moving forwards in the east quite dramatically over the past weeks.What they did on Friday is launch a significant new invasion, frankly, from their territory into parts of Ukraine that they'd been kicked out two years ago. And it's, frankly, depressing to be back here. This was a frontline two years ago that we worked around to see now, this potentially under threat again. Now, the Russians have come at this with force, resources. They've not found the Ukrainians ready. We've not driven past significant fortification on the way to here, two places where they are being urgently built, we did see. And key to all of this as a town called Vovchansk. Now, that is on the border. We were there when they were kicked out two years ago, but now, the Russians are back it seems. A local police chief talking about hearing gunfire in and around the city, so it seems that most (inaudible) the Russians are certainly on the outskirts and Ukraine's military talks talking about how they'd move to take more favorable positions over the last 24 hours. That is sort of a euphemism for a form of retreat. So clearly, Russia on the forefoot there. They have other key settlements in their sights too, one of which Lyptsi might potentially enable them to shell Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city. Remember, place of millions that have felt for a while calm, the ability to get back to normal life, and is now facing the possibility of continued shelling. They've had airstrikes over the past days or so. And so, all of this a reflection of how Russia appears to have got its resources together, to have turned its economy into a war-time one, and regained its focus and its manpower, while Ukraine has been left with its morale crated (ph) because this six months, it has had to wait for that $61 billion. Back in December, people were talking about how they didn't get it, they were finished. They have had to wait five or six months. That starved them of ammunition on the frontlines to stop Russian advances, that has left them questioning where they have to essentially devote what little they have left. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It comes at a cost of material and it's not clear that Ukraine is going to want to commit them at the moment.I think it seems unlikely that Ukraine is really going to turn the momentum around. It needed these artillery shells months and months and months ago. It needed the tanks months and months and months before they were sent. They needed the fighter aircraft, which (inaudible) come into play later this year, it needed those a long time ago. It needed the additional air defenses a long time ago. Secretary Blinken, that part of that $2 billion package will be additional air defenses coming in. It all comes in too late to turn the initiative around, right now. This is going to be a grinding war where Russia is making those gains. So, I think it is going to some time. It's just not going to happen quickly. It is not an easy thing to do.",

Hi there, Brynn. So, the defense says that they have at least one more day of questions for Michael Cohen. How has he been doing so far? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, listen, Michael Cohen has been pretty measured on the stand that the defense has really been coming at him and he doesn't seem to take any of that bait. So, we'll see if that continues into tomorrow. The defense still has really gotten into the questions at the crux of this case. They've really just been attacking his credibility, which we knew was going to be a major part of their defense, (inaudible) Michael Cohen's own words to kind of show jurors that they believe Michael Cohen is only about wanting to profit off of Donald Trump's name and he's only out for revenge. They've been drawing on excerpts from his books, from clips from his podcast, where they got Michael Cohen to admit that he has talked about Trump in every single podcast that he has aired. And there was a few times where the defense even, again, used Michael Cohen's own words describing Trump as \"a boorish cartoon misogynist or cheetos- dusted cartoon villain\" to which Michael Cohen has that basically said, yeah, that sounds like something I would say. On the flip side of that, they've also brought up times where Michael Cohen was complimentary to Donald Trump in the past and trying to show that he has two sides to him. And Michael Cohen says, well, that was when he was knee deep in the cult of Donald Trump. So, we'll see what they get to tomorrow. Like you said, they have said they're going to spend a full day of cross-examination with Michael Cohen. Now, before that, Amara, it's important to point out that the prosecution did really wrap up its narrative of where they got to these charges with Michael Cohen. They had him on the stand, they brought up his criminal history because they know that's something that the defense will go after him about. They brought up the fact that he has lied in front of Congress, that his home was raided in 2018. They brought the fact of when he flipped on Donald Trump, the last moments that he actually talked to him. So, all of this came out in the prosecution and they sort of tied up their case in a nice little bow. Our understanding is a prosecution will likely rest as soon as Michael Cohen is off the stand. The question is, when is that going to happen? We expect it to be he tomorrow, but not exactly clear just yet. But we are getting closer to this case and trial really being done.",

I mean, we've definitely -- there's been curved balls before and in that civil trial, last year, Donald Trump definitely said he was going to take the stand and then he last-minute said, no, I'm not going to do it.So we might even get a tease from the former president, who knows.

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, finally we got some good news on the inflation front. This breaks its streak of three straight months of worse than expected numbers on prices. As you mentioned, month over month, prices were up by 0.3 percent between March and April. That is slightly cooler than expected. The big number is the annual number. We saw that prices were up by 3.4 percent. That's exactly as expected and it does mark a slight improvement from 3.5 percent the prior month.So, why did inflation improve? Well, one of the keys here is that Americans, they got the break at the grocery store. We saw that food at home prices ticked lower between March and April. There were also some improvements in terms of pricing for new cars, for used cars, and for furniture, all of them fell month over month. Now, when you look at the trend, we can see that consumer prices, they're no longer sky- rocketing like they were two years ago. I mean, this metric was above 9 percent in June of 2022. We are miles away from that. But some of the improvement, of course, has stalled in recent months. So, it is encouraging to see this improvement restart here and this is going well -- going over well on Wall Street where we've seen U.S. stock futures tick higher. Now, Amara, as you can see on the screen, there has been some talk over corporate greed. In particular, price markups and some new research from the San Francisco Fed found that there were large price markups for cars, gasoline, car repair, laundry in 2021 and 2022. This gets to that debate over greedflation. But, the same San Francisco Fed report also said that \"rising markups have not been a main driver of the recent surge and subsequent decline in inflation during the current recovery.\" So this sort of gets at this debate over how much corporate greed played in terms of this spike in inflation that we saw in 2021 and 2022. And the findings from the Fed are that, yes, there was some price gouging, right. Some companies probably did take advantage of the situation. But no, this was not the main driver, right. The main driver really goes back to traditional supply and demand swings. So, some new research there from the Fed and new numbers from the government showing that inflation did improve a bit last month.",

At the same time, we saw changes in supply, right, there were limits for supply. There was supply chain issues or port congestion. There was computer chip shortages.And so, all of those things, of course, drove up prices. There was also some debate over whether or not worker wages helped to fuel inflation. But we know that paychecks actually did not keep up with prices back in 2021 and 2022. Real wages actually were getting smaller. So the researchers found that when you look at price markups, they said that, yes, there's some evidence that companies were taking some advantage, but that's not the leading cause of inflation. But listen, this debate is going to continue. We're going to continue to hear from the White House and progressives over how companies need to do more to lower their prices, especially at a time when they have record profits and CEOs are sitting on fat bonuses.

He said, \"This is the most typical form of bullying in the world today!\"We're hearing similar remarks from other government officials saying that China will take all measures necessary to defend its legitimate rights and interests. Another government official calling this a case of wrongdoing. But here is the reality, Amara, the Chinese economy right now, it's not as hot as it once was. And the one thing it really wants is more investment from abroad, international investment, and that includes the United States. They view that money and investment in business operations from the U.S. will be a big part of its future economic success. So, the idea of creating some kind of trade war or additional tariffs against U.S. products may not necessarily be in China's best interests.
