Tonight on 360, how federal judge, Aileen Cannon just got the documents case moving and why one veteran prosecutor now argues against casting judgment on her ability to be impartial toward the man who appointed her. Also tonight, another federal judge in another case against the former president makes it official. E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit goes to court just as primary season begins. Plus, a CNN exclusive, you will meet Ukraine's drone warriors as they 3D print machinery to send Russian shells back where they came from with a bang. We begin with what came as a surprise to some, Judge Aileen Cannon's first order in her new position overseeing the documents case, a surprise because during her first encounter with it shortly after the search at Mar-a-Lago, she issued a ruling so untethered in case law and so favorable to the former president, a federal appeals panel overturned her in a decision that's been read more like a legal scolding. Two of the judges on that panel, by the way, were like her, Trump appointees. That was the backdrop to today's ruling. CNN's Paula Reid joins us now with more on what is in this issue from the judge. Paula, what can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is the first time we've heard from Judge Aileen Cannon since Trump's arraignment earlier this week. And look, this is just a mundane scheduling order. She is telling the lawyers, hey, guys, start talking to DOJ about getting your security clearances set, but even these little orders, this schedule, she wants them to update her in five days. That's significant, John, because it's these little decisions, these little scheduling orders that over the course of this case, could potentially determine if this case is heard before or after the election.And we know that Judge Cannon is under such scrutiny, mostly for that decision that you just mentioned, and the fact that she is a Trump appointee overseeing his case, and she is a young, relatively inexperienced judge. So everything she does is under the microscope. So what's interesting about today's scheduling order, is it comes just two days after the arraignment, and she is setting a pretty tight timeline for the next update. It suggests that she might want to keep things moving. We know the special counsel has said he wants a speedy trial. But the former president's attorneys, they have every reason to want to delay this until after the election. Now, the one glitch here is that even though the Justice Department can expedite these security clearances, the former president hasn't finalized his legal team. So that's something that could delay this a little bit longer. But this is really one of the big tensions in this case, is just how long will it take to get this case in front of a jury?",

Todd Blanche and Chris Kise, the former Florida solicitor general, they were the ones who signed in appearances and told the court that they intended to be at least a permanent part of the team. Now we do expect that they'll bring on additional attorneys, but John, historically, it has been hard for the former president to retain counsel for a lot of reasons. One, he is a notoriously difficult client, right? In the indictment, the Justice Department is alleging that not only was he trying to hide documents from the government, but he was also allegedly trying to hide them from his own lawyer. There's also concerns about him paying his bills, and some firms that have been asked about potentially representing him have told us that they are a little concerned about reputational damage or possibly alienating their clients. But in talking to several sources, I have down in the Florida defense bar, we do expect that he will be able to find lawyers, especially if he is willing to pay up front. This is of course, the case of a lifetime, but it might take a little while before he finalize his team, then they'll need those security clearances because there is such sensitive material in this case. And again, that all adds up in terms of the time it takes and when this case is eventually heard.",

      "sentences": "Well, because there's really no basis to do it. In fact, sure, she blew it with respect to the special master, in appointing a special master, but it wasn't the most outrageous decision. I mean, don't forget Michael Cohen, one of Trump's lawyers had a special master appointed after his search warrant. Rudy Giuliani, also who had a search warrant had a special master appointed.Now, of course, there's a big difference there. Both of these individuals were lawyers, with lots of potentially attorney-client privileged information. But again, I think Judge Cannon was looking at this from the standpoint of trying to be more transparent with the public, trying to get information out there, basically giving a different spin on this because Trump was a former president. This 11th Circuit said, no, no, no, you've got to treat him just like any other criminal defendant in the system, and she has got her marching orders now. She has to treat Trump just like anybody else in the system. And there is no reason to think that she did anything here to try and sabotage this. If she hadn't wanted, they had also asked that the search warrant be suppressed, that the evidence be suppressed or she could have done all kinds of things if she was really looking out to help Trump. And at the end of the day, it really didn't make any difference. If you look at that 40-page indictment, there is nothing in there that made any difference as to the fact that they couldn't use the classified documents for a brief period of their investigation. Most of what was done was putting people before a grand jury, getting the testimony, getting Corcoran to testify, turnover his notes, litigate that issue. All of that was done, Judge Cannon aside, it had nothing to do with what she did and people are making too big of a thing out of it. And what concerns me is that we've got two institutions in our system that relate to the criminal justice. One is the Department of Justice. And the other is the judiciary and both of them are charged with essentially making sure that neither the government or a criminal defendant is treated any differently. And right now, we've got the Trump people that are all screaming about the Department of Justice trying to say this is Biden's doing, when in fact there is an independent counsel, who is very much in the mold of Archibald Cox, and we've got a judge who seems unsurfaced to have complete competency here, although maybe not totally experienced.",

And if we take a look, right, I mean, this is going to clash with primary season, no question. But if we look at all of the legal cases that the former president is facing, you know, he's going to trial, his company is going to trial in October over the New York attorney general's civil lawsuit involving the company's financial statements.He is set for a deposition in that case, so that deposition will be played, it will become public. This is going to be something he'll have to contend with. And then just in January, a few months later, he will go on trial again, in this E. Jean Carroll civil lawsuit. Now, he did not attend the last trial, and he did not testify. It remains to be seen if he will change his mind either way, in this case, but it will go right about when this primary season is kicking off, and it's a crowded field already. So he's certainly going to be, you know, not backing down. He's going to be out on the campaign trail. Then in March, just two months later, is when his trial is set for the criminal case in New York in that hush money case, and in that case, he is required to attend, so that is going to take up -- no one has really set the days yet, but it could be two or three weeks that he will be required to be off the campaign trail during the week, Monday through Friday when this trial sits. And it remains to be seen when the classified documents trial date will be set. And judges have been cognizant that he does have a First Amendment right. He is campaigning. He does need to be out in the field. But there is also you know, due process, it's a speedy trial, as the special counsel's team has said, they're willing to move quickly, that date has yet to be set. But it's starting to get a little crowded and it remains to be seen if there are going to be any further charges against the former president because the Fulton County district attorney is still conducting her investigation, has kind of signaled that there could be a decision in August, and it remains to be seen what the special counsel will do as they look at January 6th.

He's got the Manhattan district attorney's criminal charges, he's got the special counsel's criminal charges in Florida. If there are additional charges that are criminal filed in Georgia this summer, that would add a third criminal case. And then of course, the special counsel may have additional criminal charges, including for the January 6th investigation.So at some point, it's just going to be a matter of other days left on the calendar to say nothing of the legal challenges involved for his lawyers and thinking about how to coordinate the defenses in all of these cases and the implications of statements that he may make or filings they may make in certain cases for their strategy in other cases.",

So you think about over time, you're trying to prepare to run for president on a daily basis, you're trying to do those events. You've got to meet with your lawyers to prepare your defense in these cases. You've got to do debate prep. You've got to do deposition prep.

And this was a large tornado that did quite a bit of damage to very fragile structures, a lot of mobile homes, a lot of aluminum frame houses and things like that.This is the video that we're seeing. This is the stove pipe tornado that was caught on camera. A couple of storm chasers were out there, very brave. They stopped their cars. They helped people right away. They saw how much damage was actually out there and how many people needed help. First responders coming in from all over the northern part of the Texas Panhandle. Now, this isn't over. This is the area we're talking about. And even though we're getting into nightfall, we still have the energy in the atmosphere. It's hot out there. It's still in the 80s and the 90s out here. That's the energy that these storms will use to make more tornadoes likely tonight. And if you hear a warning, if you hear a siren, if your alarm goes off, if your phone goes off, make sure you know what to do. Make sure you know what to do before it even goes off. We have two real areas of concern at this point in time, maybe three. I'll get to the third one that's just developing. That's the same storm that hit Perryton. It is now into parts of Oklahoma, including Cheyenne, moving to the east from there. Then here down along I-35 Oklahoma City that way. Dallas, Texas that way. Gainesville, you're under the tornado warning right now. That's Gainesville, Texas with a tornado warning. Wind, hail. Hail the size possibly of baseballs, and I've heard a few of them said today the size of CD discs, like the CD player that you put in your car, little slot there, that's how large some of these hailstones were, 5 inches in diameter. And you get wind of 80 miles per hour. Some hail coming down. There's a lot of potential, a lot more damage, is still possible tonight even though the sun is setting. And because the sun is setting and you may be going to sleep, you need to really pay attention. And this line goes all the way even into Alabama and North Florida.
