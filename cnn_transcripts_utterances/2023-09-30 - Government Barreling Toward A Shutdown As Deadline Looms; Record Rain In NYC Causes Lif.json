      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Right now, lawmakers are on Capitol Hill with just hours left until the government shutdown. And today, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's plan is to pass bills to minimize the impacts of a shutdown, not stop one from actually happening. GOP hardliners blocked his last attempt at passing a short-term funding bill. And if McCarthy turns to Democrats for help today, he could lose his job. Over on the Senate side, lawmakers are moving ahead with their own funding bill, but it would not pass in time to keep the government open. The stakes could not be higher. When the clock strikes midnight millions of federal workers will be off the job. Employees considered essential like active-duty military and border agents will be forced to work without pay. And you could even see airport delays, museum and national park closures and food assistance programs put on hold. Now that a shutdown seems all but inevitable, the questions on everyone's minds are how long will it last potentially, and how would it end? CNN's Lauren Fox joining us now from Capitol Hill with more on all of this. Lauren, so what is the latest?",

That is because I'm told there was a growing consensus as the meeting went on that they needed to do something to avert the shutdown. One of the big question marks right now is whether or not Democrats will join hands with Republicans to support this legislation given the fact that it does not include Ukraine funding.

The president, he's been gone. He's been in California. He's been every place else. The one place he hasn't been at the border. He's gone to more dinners with Hunter Biden's business associates than he has to the border in 50 years. But what we're going to do now because the Senate cannot act in time, the government would shut down, the House is going to act so government will not shutdown. We will put a clean funding stop gap on the floor to keep government open for 45 days for the House and Senate to get their work done. We will also, knowing what had transpired through the summer -- the disasters in Florida, the horrendous fire in Hawaii and also the disasters in California and Vermont, we will put the supplemental portion that the president asks for in disaster there, too.

Tell me what to argue if we're putting a stop gap measure with no politics in it that says we will continue funding government exactly how it is right now for 45 days while we finish our job. The only thing that we'll do differently, those who have suffered through a flood, through a fire and others where the disaster money is not there, we'll make sure that disaster money is there so they don't get punished. We'll look at our troops in the eye to say, yes, you don't have to worry about how you're going to make your rent. We're going to finish our job, we're going to secure our borders. We're going to look at the border agents that come back bloody securing our country and say we don't want you in doing your job, worrying about whether you're going to be able to make your car payment. We're going to do our job, we're going to be adults in the room and we're going to keep government open while we solve this problem.

The FSOP bill is the first time a Republican majority has passed that appropriation bill in more than 16 years. We're achieving things. I do not want to stop that momentum of getting our job. That is the way we'll be able to secure our border. If we shut the government down, the border agents don't get paid. The border is even further wide open. The president wants to ignore this problem, we're not going to allow him. He wants to ignore governing. He's the president of the United States. What has he done about keeping government open?

So that is a key distinction here. He's basically daring Democrats to vote against this proposal. And then, of course, if they did, blame them for shutting down the government. So you now have a House plan and a Senate plan. These two things are not the exact same. Is it possible they could work out their differences? Is it possible Democrats in the House might vote for that? This is an unanswered question that we're going to obviously be checking in with sources to get more information.

They were talking about putting one off bills on the floor to try to blunt the impact of a shutdown rather than putting anything on the floor that would actually avoid a shutdown.

But as we heard from New York City -- rather New York Governor Kathy Hochul report earlier this morning, that that system is back up and running again less than 24 hours after this area was hit hard. So officials certainly defending those actions leading up to the storm including also the Department of Education. There were some questions that came up yesterday about why require students to go into school yesterday knowing that the system was coming in? The Chancellor of the Department of Education saying remote learning is only considered as a last resort. They felt confident that the children could be kept safe yesterday. So I think what we heard this morning as officials were basically wrapping up that response and now previewing more of the recovery is a sense of relief and also pride that only a few dozen rescues were required, and fortunately no injuries or worse. But also some serious questions about what can be done to prevent this from happening in the future. We've heard that issue of the infrastructure coming up flood after flood the last couple of years here in New York City.

You've still got several flood advisories and flood warnings in effect for today. Most of that however is not necessarily for the additional rain that's expected today but rather all of the rain that fell yesterday because it takes a long time for that much water to recede.

Valley Stream, New York picking up over 9, and several other locations across New York, Connecticut and New Jersey picking up at least 6 inches.

I mean take a look at current policy. If we don't make changes to tax or spending policy under reasonable assumptions, we've got very high deficits and debt forever, and that's just not sustainable.So investors, you know, if they're not going to be shaken by this, they'll be shaken at some point in the not-too-distant future because, you know, we're not moving in the right direction, and shutting the government down just shows that, you know, we're very dysfunctional. The government is very dysfunctional, and how are we going to tackle these big fiscal problems if we can't even keep the government open? So I don't know if this is the thing that's going to shake investor confidence, but, you know, a few more of these kinds of things down the road certainly will.",

That was included in the Senate bill, but it is not going to be included in this piece of legislation. So right now, House Democrats are huddling to try to decide if they can move forward with something that doesn't include that Ukraine aid. They're also frustrated that they feel like they're not going to have a lot of time to read over this bill. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, told our colleague Morgan Rimmer just moments ago that Democrats are trying to get more time to go through this, trying to delay this vote, which is supposed to be scheduled for around 11:45 this morning.

So he's putting this on the floor hoping the Democrats will get to yes and basically trying to dare Democrats to vote against it.
