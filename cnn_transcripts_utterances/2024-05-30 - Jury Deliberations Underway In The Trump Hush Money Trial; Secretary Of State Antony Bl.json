That was David Pecker, who was one of the publishers or the publisher, the CEO of the company that publishes the \"National Enquirer\". And what they're asking about appears to zero in on what he had discussed with both Michael Cohen and Donald Trump in person and with Trump on the phone about Trump's campaign. How he could help with a catch-and-kill scheme, the sort of scheme that Cohen ended up paying Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet. Now, with the \"National Enquirer\", the testimony that they heard this morning, that the jurors asked for the judge to read back and then went into the courtroom and for several minutes listened to again, was a portion where David Pecker said at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower. He and these two men, Donald Trump included, had a conversation about how he would notify Michael Cohen if women were coming out of the woodwork to share negative stories with the press about Donald Trump, potentially things like affairs that could really hurt Trump. And at that part of the testimony, the prosecutors asked David Pecker if the purpose of this was to benefit Donald Trump in his campaign as a presidential candidate in 2016. David Pecker responded, that is right. That's what the jury reheard this morning, in addition to a lot of other things, jury instructions, how to determine beyond a reasonable doubt if someone is guilty or innocent. So, all of that are things that the jury now has taken back to the room just before 11:30 is when they went back into their confidential space to discuss among themselves what they want to do with this case. [12:05: 03] And tea leaves, sure. I mean, if we had any sort of telepathy, maybe we could understand what a jury was thinking. But it is extremely hard to predict and also hard to predict not just what they will do, but the timing in which they will do it. Thirty four counts here. They've got to talk through.",

The judge instructed thejury because he's a sort of co-conspirator -- co-conspirator testimony needs to be corroborated. So, David Pecker is the corroborating testimony. So, I think what we're possibly seeing here is whether or not they have the sufficient corroborative evidence of Cohen's testimony to get them to a guilty verdict. So, you know, it's very hard to know, but I would be encouraged if I will -- if you will, as a prosecutor to say, look, they're looking for corroborative testimony that supports the Cohen narrative. And if they believe Pecker and they believe any portion of Cohen, then they get to guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. So, I could be completely wrong. You never know what's going on in there. But that's how I see it. They're seeking corroboration of Cohen. And Pecker is, I thought throughout this case, almost the most important witness because he doesn't have an axe to grind. He has no motive. And he's telling us that from the outset, this was a conspiracy to catch and kill these stories to pay the people off in order to impact the election. That's the heart of the case. That's what he's testified to. And I think that's what they're asking to be heard again. So, maybe good news for the prosecutor. But I have been wrong before.",

And there was a jury expert, a consultant that was on CNN in the last hour who said what was notable to her was that they're not looking for reasonable doubt evidence in this at least specific question that they asked. The jury asked the judge, would you agree with that, that if you're deciphering what they looked for, that it didn't appear that they were looking for anything related to reasonable doubt evidence?",

It seems like they're following that narrative, which is the prosecutor's closing argument narrative.

But it was a vague statement about changes in how the U.S. has approached the war and changes in how the U.S. may approach it in the future. And it is in that space of ambiguity that we see the possibility that the U.S. may shift its position, allowing U.S. weapons to be used by Ukraine over the border into Russia, which is something they have not allowed for the course of the past two and a half years. There is both some domestic pressure. We have seen several lawmakers call on the administration to allow Ukraine to use the weapons as it needs. And we have certainly seen international partners and key Western allies, such as France, the U.K. and Germany, say it's time to remove the restrictions and allow Ukraine to use the weapons as it needs. Even NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it's time to review these restrictions. Earlier today, he said, I believe the time has come to consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves. And certainly, in light of what we're seeing in Russia's new push near Kharkiv, it would be an important decision. And that's because the Russian border is very close to the front line there, and that allows Russia to leave their forces in Russian territory in close range of Ukrainian forces, believing -- the Kremlin that is -- believing their forces are safe in their territory with the short supply line that allows them to keep pressing. So, it is a significant decision, one where you are clearly seeing international pressure on the U.S. to shift its position and allow Ukraine to use U.S. weaponry to hit Russian forces over the border.",

There's an estimated 80 percent of it is now gang-controlled territory. So, even moving around the city is incredibly dangerous, you know, under normal, relatively normal circumstances. In this case, what U.S. officials were concerned about and also the families was protecting the bodies of Davie and Natalie even after their tragic deaths. There was concern that their bodies might be desecrated or that they might even be taken by a gang, one of the attacking gangs or even another one, and held hostage for ransom. So, this week-long effort was designed to make sure that the bodies were in safe custody and also to make sure that they could leave Haiti without any further attack. What we know is that the U.S. assisted in organizing an ambulance to go pick up the bodies at the scene of the crime, even removing them before Haitian officials were able to inspect the situation. But the reason that they did that, one source told me, is, you know, this was not a normal way to do things. Normally they wouldn't pull bodies out of a crime scene, but the concern for protecting those two was so great after the fact that they managed to do it anyways. And one of the ways that they did that was by bringing together gang members in Haiti -- gang leaders, on a conference call and asking them to, you know, through intermediaries, to help free these bodies. When an ambulance went to get them, apparently some gang members who were armed with rifles blocked them, and so another gang leader had to ask their boss to relinquish them to the ambulance and let them out. Once they did that, you know, it was a series of other negotiations to make sure that Davie and Natalie could safely leave Haiti, you know, with Haitian authorities and all that. And today, we finally got confirmation that they were wheels up in the company of the U.S. ambassador and security agents from U.S. embassy this morning.",

Another gang showed up. That second gang took fire. One of the gang members was killed, according to Mr. Lloyd. It's unclear how that happened.

He's also the author of the book \"Arab Voices: What They Are Saying to Us and Why It Matters\". James, welcome to the program. It's good to have you on. I mean, it's pretty stark numbers here for President Biden, specifically when you consider that his popularity and support among the Arab American vote now is the same as it was last year in October at 20 percent versus where it was in 2020 at 60 percent. What more is the takeaway from the study?",

And frankly, it has taken a huge chunk out of the President's support. The good news in the poll is that he can win it back if he were to take a dramatic stand and suspend arms shipments or to demand an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian aid. But it seems unlikely he's going to take those kind of dramatic stands. And so, the numbers look bleak.",

Seventy-nine percent of ArabAmericans voters have an unfavorable view of President Biden compared with 56 for Donald Trump. I mean, explain that, because when you think about Trump's rhetoric when it comes to the Israeli-Gaza war, I mean, he's talked just a few days ago. He talked to wealthy donors about the fact that if he were in charge, he would crush pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. So, on the face of it, that this these sorts of numbers don't really make much sense. Explain it to us.",

And certainly the Biden campaign is going to do its best to remind people of what was. But when I talk to people, look, I'm a Democrat. Let me just be honest about that. And this pains me a great deal. But I want to be honest about where we are. Where we are is people are saying, yeah, I remember how bad he was. But you know what? This is really horrible. And I don't know what it will take to win me back. They just are watching this genocide unfolding every single day. It's causing tremendous pain. And Joe Biden, they view as responsible for not putting a stop to it, for not taking a decisive stand, for creating red lines that become invisible or keep moving in the wrong direction. I mean, the person who's causing you pain now is going to be viewed more unfavorably than the person who caused you pain years ago and may cause you pain in the future. That's the only thing I take away from this. But look, the big another big number here is the almost one half of voters who say they're undecided or the significant number, more than a half, who say they're just not enthusiastic about voting at all in this election. That's a big number at this point for people to just say, I'm not even I don't even think I'm going to vote. I've told I've told people when they tell me, you know, when it comes to a binary choice, Biden versus Trump, they'll all come down for Biden. They'll remember. I say the binary choice is going to be, do they vote or not vote at all? And I think a lot of folks just won't vote. And that's true, not just for Arab Americans, but it's true for young people, for progressives in particular, for blacks and for Asians. We're finding that in our broader polling that that's the case. A lot of folks are just going to stay home.",

It was something that was painful. I think what's happened is that people are going in the opposite direction. It's solidified. That sense of frustration solidified. So, yeah, I think that Gaza has been an issue almost from the beginning of this conflict. Certainly not on day one. There was a sense day one after what happened on October 7th, there was horror at what Hamas had done and what had been unleashed. But as the days went on, the Israeli response became so not just disproportionate, but genocidal that people, you know, look, we were seeing hospitals bombed, schools bombed, neighborhoods destroyed.

Even if it's a relatively early stage, if you look at thesenumbers of how the ANC already is well under the 50 percent mark, that is truly significant. ANC has dominated South African politics since the dawn of democracy. They have always gotten well over 50 percent, meaning they could govern without some kind of coalition. If you look at the numbers that we're showing you now, with about 20 percent of voting districts counted, the ANC is below 45 percent. You see the official opposition holding its relative spot. Something very important to show is that MK party at the bottom, that's uMkhonto weSisizwe party, which is its figurehead is Jacob Zuma, the former president of South Africa, who has faced multiple allegations of corruption over the past few years. He was the President of the country, had to resign several years ago. He is now the thorn in the side of the ANC. They are making huge strides against the ANC, in particular in the KwaZulu-Natal province, the coastal province. And what this means is if these numbers hold, and it's still too early to say, Zain, that if they hold, you could see the ANC having to join up with a large opposition party to form the government. We're in uncharted territory here in South Africa. There's never been a coalition government at the national level in this country. And there will be a lot of horse trading, I'm sure, going on right now behind the scenes, even as these votes come in and are counted.",
