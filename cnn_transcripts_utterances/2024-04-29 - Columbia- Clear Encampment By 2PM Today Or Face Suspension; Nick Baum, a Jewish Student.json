But obviously, the expectation is that won't necessarily be the case.And I think over the last few days, the campus has obviously been a lot more tense. But surprisingly, a bit more quiet, too. And I think all of that owes to a plethora of students who have left campus altogether because of the switch to virtual classes, to virtual final exams. Me, living in Jewish dorms at the Jewish Theological Seminary, I, for one, can attest to that as I've seen friend after friends simply leave for back home because of concerns for their safety. It's simply a ghost town where I am right next to the campus. And so, as for the encampment, I hope things go as smoothly as possible. But obviously, we're really much expecting something else to play out.",

To me, it makes me worry that something physical is going to break out, that some horrible things are going to start to be said.And as a Jew and as a Zionist, I believe that that could ultimately spell out a lot of hatred towards my end, as me being under those categories. And I think, ultimately, the encampment leaders, not the actual inhabitants of the encampment, but those who are engaged in the negotiations, they've shown their true colors a little bit. Because we've seen in these negotiations, Columbia offered to offer investment, to offer charity towards Gazan health, towards Gazan education, towards scholarships for displaced students in Gaza and so forth. And so seeing the leaders of encampment, negotiations would go against that, refused to do that because Columbia would still be investing in Israeli companies, it shows that they ultimately care more what about hurting Israel civilians than helping Gazan civilians.",

And I don't deny that there are many Jews living in the encampment, but when you actively throw the most vile rhetoric towards 80 percent of Jews, then that's going to ultimately reflect, oftentimes, simple hatred of Jews.",

Brianna and Alex.I mean, one of the things is, when you realize you are totally surrendering control is the moment you drive, even in an armored vehicle, into gang territory. It's land that we've been told, you know, in the past several months that we've been covering Haiti, stay away from, do not go there. But after weeks of negotiations with this notorious gang leader, somebody who considers himself to be more of a community activist, we were finally able to get this interview in place. He guaranteed security from his perspective. And yet still you realize anything can happen. So I'll let you see a little bit of our interaction and tour of his territory. And then I'll give you a bit more for context on the backend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CULVER (voice-over): Security experts suggest Tabarre has more than 1,000 armed gang members, including recently escaped inmates. (on camera): As you can see, a lot of his armed soldiers and followers are around us and he suggested that we follow and drive with them. (voice-over): He brings us to the edge of his territory. We notice his guards, normally curious and watching us, are instead looking outward cautiously, toward another gang's territory, a reminder that the coalition of gangs might be more fragile than portrayed. In the midst of our tour, a disturbing video starts circulating on WhatsApp. It reportedly shows the devastating and deadly aftermath of an allied gang attack on a community a few miles from where we are. (voice-over): The destruction, the violence, the deaths that have played out. Do you take any responsibility for that? VITEL'HOMME INNOCENT, GANG LEADER: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CULVER (voice-over): He only says he made mistakes and is not perfect. He blames politicians. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's got this $2,000,000 bounty.And yet he looks at it more as having been burned by politicians in the past. And there's truth to some of that. There's a lot of corruption. He is a product of a country that's not only had political crisis, but also natural disasters. And so this is a country right now that's in need of healing.

I mean, you can see it there in this gold-rimmed furniture room with stuffed animals. And yet, at the same time, there are moments where he doesn't seem to have ego. It almost comes across very Zen and intentional. He says it's about dialogue and about crafting that dialogue with other Haitians. He stresses that because he says outside forces have caused a lot of damaged over the years within Haiti. But again, we're talking about somebody who is responsible, and even though he pushes back on this, but his gang has been tied to a lot of atrocities, things that we've witnessed firsthand that are just horrific.",
