Now the U.N. warns that Israel's military operations in north, south, and central Gaza are making it impossible to deliver aid to desperate civilians. One senior official says the situation in the enclave is worse than, quote, \"hell on earth.\" UNRWA says its distribution center and the World Food Program warehouse in Rafah are low on supplies, and in fact inaccessible, forcing the agency to suspend food distribution in the southern city. Meantime, the U.N. says the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel is technically open. But moving aid into Gaza is extremely difficult because of hostilities and of course, those logistical challenges. The U.S. meantime says 569 metric tons of humanitarian aid have now reached Gaza across its floating pier, but one U.N. official says security issues and convoy raids have kept the aid from being distributed to the people who need it in Gaza. The Pentagon, in fact, acknowledges this issue. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN.

The Saudi's price, the American price for normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia is just something that the Israelis are unwilling to pay right now. And that is, in the words of the American administration, a credible time limited path towards a Palestinian state. It's something that two-thirds of Israelis reject at the moment. It also sounds a lot like the Oslo Accords going back to the 1990s which failed. So it seems to me that the United States should be -- approach this in a different way, and more straightforward way, and look for a bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia and the United States over security.

The bar's owner says Barillari was taken to hospital, but police say they're looking for surveillance video from the area. Barillari has published several books of his images, which include popes, presidents, and stars like Sylvester Stallone and Liz Taylor. Even claims he's traded punches with Frank Sinatra and says he's been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects. A Japanese city at the base of Mount Fuji has put up a large barrier to block tourists from a popular selfie spot. A tourism boom in the country is creating traffic and other problems, and locals have had enough. CNN's Hanako Montgomery explains how Japan is trying to solve this problem. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This view, once the perfect snapshot of Japan's old and new, now has a black curtain drawn. Overwhelmed by tourists blocking roads, littering, even trespassing onto private property to take selfies, the town of Fuji-Kawaguchiko has now erected a black curtain to block the view and deter tourists, much to the locals' relief. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There have been many accidents involving foreign tourists recently. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): And, to the dismay of visitors.",

But post pandemic, numbers have swelled to record levels well beyond control, local authorities say, causing human traffic jams and garbage to litter the sacred peak. The local prefecture now says it needs to charge $13 per climber and impose a daily hiker cap of 4,000 in a bid to address overtourism, starting this season. MONTGOMERY: But as you can tell by the crowds of people around me here, one of Tokyo's biggest tourist hotspots, Mount Fuji isn't the only victim of overtourism. It's a nationwide problem. Over 3 million people visited Japan in the month of April. And though that's good news for the economy post- pandemic, it's put a strain on resources and local communities. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Earlier this year, the historic city of Kyoto had to close off some alleys to combat geisha paparazzi, a name given to visitors snapping photos of geisha without permission. While Kamakura, a seaside town just outside of Tokyo, is urging tourists to walk around instead of taking the train to ease congestion. Struggling to accommodate an unprecedented surge of in-bound visitors, many encouraged by a weak yen, local tourist spots have resorted to taking matters into their own hands, even if it means curtains for an Instagram hotspot.
