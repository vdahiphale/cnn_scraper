Russian officials saying they have detained an Uzbek citizen who has confessed to planting the bomb that killed a top Russian general in Moscow. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who headed Russia's radiological, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb outside an apartment building near the Kremlin.Russia's investigative committee says the suspect was allegedly recruited by Ukraine's special services and he allegedly placed the bomb on an electric scooter which he parked outside the building where Kirillov lived and put a surveillance camera on a rented car to monitor it. They say the explosive was allegedly remotely detonated from Dnipro in Ukraine. CNN's Matthew Chance has the details of the attack. A warning, the video you're about to see is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This was an audacious attack in the center of Moscow. Now, dramatic new video shows one of Russia's most senior military officers leaving his apartment building with his assistant before an explosion kills them both. Investigators say the attack was targeted, the device planted on a scooter outside, probably detonated by remote control. This is the controversial figure who was taken out. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, here pinning medals on soldiers headed Russia's radiological, biological and chemical defense forces. Just yesterday, he was accused by Ukraine of war crimes, overseeing the use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops. He was also a prominent and enthusiastic advocate of Kremlin-backed conspiracy theories, repeatedly accusing Ukraine of developing a nuclear dirty bomb and of hosting U.S. biolabs to develop biological weapons. Kirillov also accused Pentagon contractors and Western pharmaceutical companies of testing toxic drugs on socially vulnerable Ukrainians, all allegations widely dismissed in the West as absurd. Still, a Ukrainian security source tells CNN Kirillov was a legitimate target and was killed by them, with Russian officials now vowing revenge, including against the top Ukrainian leadership. DMITRY MEDVEDEV, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, RUSSIAN SECURITY COUNCIL (through translator): Law enforcement agencies must find the killers in Russia and everything must be done to destroy the perpetrators who are in Kyiv. These perpetrators are also known, the military and political leadership of Ukraine. CHANCE (voice-over): It's unclear how Russia, already battling hard in Ukraine, can respond to yet another high-profile assassination when there have been several in recent months, all well away from the front lines. But the deadly explosion on the streets of Moscow is a stark reminder how Russia's often distant Ukraine war can still come home. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But there is one other attachment to 490.05 of the New York state law, which is the terrorism law.New York State, aside from the federal government, has one of the broadest and most comprehensive anti-terrorism laws on the state level. And because of the type of murder this was, a planned hit, staking out the CEO of a healthcare company where the individual Luigi Mangione charged with it, was arrested allegedly carrying a three-page document, a so-called claim of responsibility, or a manifesto as it's been referred to, attacking the healthcare industry and saying these parasites had it coming, these mafiosi had to be taught a lesson, that that indicates that he was doing that within that first degree murder statute and the terrorism enhancement to coerce or influence members of the public on a policy matter. So that is highly unusual. But below that we see the other charges. Murder in the second degree as an act of terrorism. Murder in the second degree with intent. Possession of a weapon to wit the ghost gun. Possession of a weapon, the silencer. Possession of an assault weapon, meaning the ghost gun had a magazine that could carry more than 10 rounds in violation of New York state law. So you see that they lined up a series of charges that will eventually give a jury a set of choices in terms of how many charges they put on and how many are closely related. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump has officially clinched the U.S. presidency after winning the electoral college. Electors in Texas gave Mr. Trump the victory when they awarded the state's 40 electoral votes on Tuesday. In Austin, the nationwide tally is a constitutionally required formalization of the November the 5th vote where Donald Trump won 312 electoral college votes and Kamala Harris took 226. It takes 270 of the 538 electoral votes to win the White House. The electoral tally is now sent to Congress where lawmakers will meet in a joint session on January the 6th to officially declare Donald Trump the president. Mr. Trump is taking a new shot meanwhile at what he perceives as left- wing media bias against him. He's suing pollster Ann Selzer and her firm along with the \"Des Moines Register\" newspaper and its parent company Gannett. Selzer's poll published days ahead of the November election showed Kamala Harris with a surprising lead over Trump in Iowa. That lead never materialized and Trump ultimately won the state by 13 points. He says news coverage of the poll was intended to artificially help Democrats and that Selzer committed election interference. Several of Donald Trump's controversial cabinet picks have been lobbying senators on Capitol Hill trying to pick up support ahead of next month's confirmation hearings.

The population is very shocked and saddened by what has happened. The main focus of efforts at the moment is on that search and rescue in the downtown area of the capital of Vanuatu, Port Vila. A number of buildings collapsed and people have been trapped in those buildings with the search and rescue efforts being absolutely phenomenal. A lot of effort is going into that but there's also been major infrastructure damage to the wharf from a landslide to the main hospital that has no active operating theater at the moment. So there's an outdoor triage area that has been set up to assist people. There's still quite a bit of confusion but certainly the efforts for search and rescue are the primary focus of what's going on at the moment as well as assessing damage outside of the capital in community areas to understand what the situation is there.

Both these assassination attempts were foiled, the Pope said by the U.K. intelligence services and by the Iraqi police. Now of course Mosul, Iraq's second largest city was under the control of Islamic State from 2014 to 2017. In his autobiography the Pope says he was advised strongly against visiting Iraq due to the security risk and the COVID-19 pandemic but the Pope said he was determined to make the trip to a country that is rich in biblical history and of course is home to one of the world's oldest Christian communities that has faced extensive persecution in recent years. Whilst in Iraq the Pope was also able to have an historic meeting with the Grand Ayatollah Al-Sistani the leading Shia authority in Islam. The news of the assassination attempts against the Pope came as Francis marked his 88th birthday making one of the oldest popes in the church's history. However the Pope shows no sign of slowing down and he's a busy schedule ahead of services during the Christmas period. Christopher Lamb, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
