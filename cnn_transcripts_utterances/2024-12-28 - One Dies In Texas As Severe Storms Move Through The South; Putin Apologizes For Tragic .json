I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we are following breaking news.At least one person is dead in Texas, just outside of Houston as severe storms tear through the Southern United States. Multiple tornadoes are leaving a path of destruction across that region, including this one in Katy, Texas earlier. It ripped through a neighborhood, damaging homes there, and the threat is far from over. A rare, \"particularly dangerous\" tornado watch is now in effect from Texas to Alabama, with multiple strong tornadoes expected tonight as that system moves east. Rafael Romo is tracking the damage and new images and videos coming in. We want to check in first, though, with meteorologist, Tyler Mauldin, who is tracking the actual storm. Tyler, what's the latest on that?",

As you mentioned, this is a particularly dangerous situation. Tornado watch only issued five percent of the time and you can see why, as this strong line of thunderstorm activity is moving through the area and out ahead of it, some very strong supercell type tornadoes here. We have multiple tornado warnings, active warnings on radar right now from Mississippi all the way down into Southwest Louisiana. We have power outages as well. North of 50,000 in Texas, and getting to about 20,000 in Louisiana at last check. We are surely going to see more in the way of power outages as we go through time. Here is the reason why: That system is moving eastbound. We have a level four out of five threat for severe weather today, too, which is also rare. The reason why we have an EF-4, a level four tornado threat is because we could see large, strong, destructive and long lived tornadoes. Here we are talking EF-2 tornadoes or stronger in this area. That threat shifts to the East as we continue on into tonight, but as the system pushes to the East, it is going to lose a little bit of its punch once we get into the wee hours of tomorrow, which means from the Carolinas on into Georgia, we are looking at more of a damaging wind threat here. But nonetheless, over the next 12 hours or so, 12 to 18 hours, we do have to get through this tornado threat here across Mississippi and Alabama. Unfortunately, this is going to occur during the overnight hours, which is extremely dangerous because many of you will be asleep and you also just -- you have trouble seeing the tornadoes at night, so make sure you are weather aware. Typically, these type of tornadoes occur during the spring tornado season. However, we do occasionally get tornadoes during the month of December, during a secondary peak of the season. This, thus far, Jessica, the year 2024 has been above average in terms of tornadic activity. So, it is fitting, Jessica, that this last weekend of 2024 is occurring with a tornado outbreak, unfortunately.",

It is located about 45 miles south of Houston along the Gulf Coast. A spokesperson with the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office confirmed the fatality, adding that four other people were injured. But their injuries are non-critical. The spokesperson said that deputies are conducting secondary searches and going through and ensuring that all the residents are accounted for, adding that at this point, they don't expect there to be additional fatalities. There are also plenty of devastation in Montgomery County, Texas, located just north of Houston, where a local official is reporting that the storms have knocked down trees and power lines around the area, as well as causing great damage to mobile homes and warehouses. Many people have lost power in this part of Texas, as well, a man who was looking at a property with his family described how quickly the weather in that part of Texas turned for the worse.

      "sentences": "Well, just as you said, Jessica, no clear admission of responsibility just yet from Moscow, but it is interesting that we are hearing from the Russian President Vladimir Putin, acknowledging that Russia's Air Defense Systems were active in this area at the time preceding the crash.And, of course, that apology that the crash took place after the Azerbaijan Airlines plane left and entered Russian airspace. Now, of course, there had been questions around nearby drone activity. It is understood that parts of Southern Russia, including Grozny, where the plane was intended to land, had been facing Ukrainian drone attacks, and therefore it is expected that those air defense systems would have been in place and active. But there have been concerns around why the plane was even able to travel in this airspace, given the clear risk nearby. And of course, that has led many officials. We've been hearing from sources who have spoken to Reuters, unnamed sources who are familiar with the investigation, who believe that this may have been a case of mistaken identity, that the Azerbaijan Airlines plane may have been targeted by these air defense systems, mistaking it for perhaps a Ukrainian drone. Now, of course, there are still questions and no clear conclusions just yet. That investigation is still ongoing, and they will be looking at a number of bits of evidence from the two black box recorders, which were recovered, which would hopefully provide some insight into the flight data, as well as cockpit recordings, but also looking at the damage to the fuselage. Now, in these videos and images emerging showing the wreckage, there appears to be holes in the wreckage, which according to some aviation experts, would be consistent with debris impact and damage as a result of an explosion. That is also what we've also heard from some US officials as well. So that will be a key line of inquiry for investigators. But of course, they will also be speaking to eyewitnesses. Important to remember that 29 people out of 67 on board survived this crash, some of whom were actually filming the last few moments before the plane crashed, recording all that was happening inside the plane, as well as some shots of sort of the wing and the exterior of the plane as well, so that will be important for investigators to look at. We've heard from one survivor who described hearing and feeling a loud bang before the plane began to descend, and oxygen masks were dropped and the feeling of chaos and panic inside the plane amongst those passengers. So again, investigators will be looking at that. And we know the Kazakh government has set up a commission especially designated to focus on this investigation. They will be supported by international bodies, as well as the plane manufacturers. But again, it could be a matter of days, if not weeks before we have any final conclusions. At this stage, authorities say it will take them around two weeks to fully assess the black box data, but as that continues, the allegations against Russia are certainly mounting -- Jessica.",

The other thing the black boxes will tell us is after that missile hit, why did the aircraft have such trouble controlling it? I suspect it was from a hydraulic failure caused by those pieces of shrapnel that entered the aircraft, and that would have caused those problems.

The bird flu isn't very good at infecting people in our nose and throats, but with these mutations, possibly it could get better at that.Now, the good news is that the patient doesn't appear to have spread the virus to any other humans, and it doesn't look like the patient picked up these mutations from wherever the patient caught this virus in the wild. So it is thought that the patient was infected after having contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock, and these mutations weren't seen in the birds. And so it really seems like these mutations are confined to this one patient. We have seen similar mutations to these before. Also, in a severe case of H5N1, this one in a teenager in British Columbia, Canada. Again, in that scenario, it appears that these mutations happened in the patient and weren't spread to anybody else. So really the threat level would rise if we see human-to-human transmission of bird flu, and we have not seen that as of this point. Of course, health experts are worried when they see these mutations. It shows they are potentially possible. So they are watching this very closely. There have been a couple of instances where we don't know the source of exposure, and then this one patient in Louisiana is the only one associated with backyard flocks. So this is something that the CDC is following very closely, but they say right now, the risk of the public is low, especially because we haven't seen that human-to-human transmission.",

He said: \"I've always liked the visas. I have always been in favor of the visas. That's why we have them.\" He went on to say, \"I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H-1B. I've used it many times. It is a great program.\" Now, one thing, just to take a step back and explain why he is saying all of this. So this week, we really saw this issue kind of create a rift among Donald Trump's most loyal supporters. On one hand, you kind of have the MAGA faithful, the people who have long been faithful to Donald Trump, and many of them have also been drawn to Donald Trump because of his hard line immigration policies. On the other hand, you have some of these, you know, tech bros, the Silicon Valley latecomers to the MAGA movement who support Donald Trump in this last election cycle, but also rely on these high-skilled foreign workers for their businesses. Now, all of this kind of came to the forefront when we saw Elon Musk earlier this week post about this repeatedly on X, defending H-1B visas and wanting to really have more high skilled foreign workers coming to the United States. It is something that drew the ire of conservative pundits like Laura Loomer and Ann Coulter and Mike Cernovich. We also saw Vivek Ramaswamy, the person who with Elon Musk is going to be running Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, both of them really weighing in to back up the H-1B visa program. Now, we also heard from Musk weigh in on this again yesterday night. I want to read for you what he said. He said: \"The reason I am in America, along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B. I will go to war on this issue, the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.\" Now, to be clear, Donald Trump has kind of been ambiguous on this issue in the past. During his first administration, we actually saw H- 1B visas decline. The people who were able to get them, the number of visas that were awarded to people declined during his first term. And at one point they even were suspended altogether. But recently, on the campaign trail earlier this year, Donald Trump told a podcast that he actually believes that immigrants who come to this country and graduate from a US university should be able to have a green card and to stay in this country, all to say, his position on this has changed. But right now he is saying he backs the program and also defends it, putting him in line with both Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy -- Jessica.",

And the humanitarian situation in this area is very, very bad. And I think that the IDF is trying to get all Palestinian civilians out of Northern Gaza.When you ask Israeli officials whether they will ever be able to come back, you hear different versions. Some say yes. Some say no. Some say we don't know. And I think this raises a lot of questions about the real intentions of what the IDF is doing in Northern Gaza, exactly where the Kamal Adwan Hospital was.",

The Qatari prime minister met earlier today with a Hamas delegation with the head of their negotiation team. And according to the Qatari statement after that meeting, he, you know, stressed that there needs to be a movement towards a deal that will end the war in Gaza.But other than that, when I speak to the Qataris, when I speak to Egyptians, when I speak to people in the Biden administration, and obviously the Israeli negotiators, all of them admit that there's no movement. And that the chances of getting a deal before January 20th, before Donald Trump assumes office, are not big. And every day that passes doesn't make those chances bigger. It makes them even less likely.",

He said that because he and his people know that when he assumes office, there are going to be 10,000 other issues on his table.And this is why they wanted to close this open issue by then, because they know that if it happens afterwards, or if it doesn't happen by January 20th, it's going to take a long time until they will be able to seriously tackle this issue, because they will come into office, they'll have so many things on their plate, and not necessarily this will be the number one, two or three that they will want to handle.",
