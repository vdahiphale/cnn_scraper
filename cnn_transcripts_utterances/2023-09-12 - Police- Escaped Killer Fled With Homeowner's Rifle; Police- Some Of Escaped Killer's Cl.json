      "sentences": "Yes. Well the first thing I want to mention is directly to your point. We have seen this most recent push and action. We're at the edge of this most recent perimeter on State Route 23 and State Route 100. That intersection right here, and we've seen horses and trailers going in.We've seen armored vans, multiple armored vans with law enforcement officers dressed in fatigues, off road vehicles. Of course, helicopters have a constant presence in the sky. So we can feel those extra officers as Lieutenant Colonel George Bevins said. 500 officers now in this area behind me searching for Cavalcante. But, Kate, to your second question about what stood out to me in this press conference, it's almost hard to begin. Remember, we've been giving that first or that primary citing the 10:10 p.m. one where he was able to steal that gun, a lot of attention, but let's not forget, there were two sightings last night, Kate. There was one at 8:00 p.m. we learned in this press conference, a woman said she saw someone running along the street on Fairfield road. And just to give viewers a little bit of perspective, there have been a tremendous amount of media, of law enforcement in that exact vicinity along Fairfield road. That's it's by where the van was ditched by Cavalcante over the weekend. That was where a woman spotted him. Police then came to that scene around 8:00 p.m. They found his prison shoes on the ground discarded that's after they found footprints, and they also had a report of work boots being stolen off a woman's porch that Cavalcante presumably now has. They sent dogs after him. They sent other teams searching for him at that point, still nothing and then we got that 10:10 p.m. sighting where Cavalcante, according to state police, entered a homeowner's garage in that area, took a rifle right from out of the garage, that rifle a 22 caliber with a scope, with a flashlight, with ammo. The owner was in the garage fired back at a handgun with Cavalcante. Law enforcement says they got there within minutes of that incident. But Cavalcante was gone. He was in the wind. One of the things that I really want to touch on here in terms of something that stood out to me in this press conference. Lieutenant Colonel George Bevins was asked, if Cavalcante knows where he is in this moment, and the General Colonel said that he believes Cavalcante does know where he is in this vicinity, he believes he has been in this area before. That's a surprise and something that we have not heard yet from law enforcement. You know, we knew that he had acquaintances in Phoenixville, that's where he went back on Saturday night to try and get help. That's where we saw the ring video of him clean shaven changing the appearance. But this seems until this moment to be frankly a random area west of where those Phoenixville sightings was, now it seems this is not a random area. Cavalcante knew where he was going. He potentially knew where he wanted to ditch that van. And he's been in this area before. The one other thing that I'll note is, this is a large area that law enforcement is trying to sweep right now. Lieutenant Colonel's saying it's about 8 to 10 square miles describing the terrain is wooded as hilly. And even though they have a show of force, like we've been saying all morning in there right now, it is still they say difficult to actually sweep and clear that area. Lieutenant Colonel saying it will take a while to clear this entire area. Again, day 13, we're still being surprised by this manhunt. And it does not seem at this point that they have eyes on him, despite having two sightings last night.",

That's wooded, that's trees. It's what the Lieutenant Colonel Bevins explained. That has been what has been successful for him. That has been where he has managed to elude them for most of these days. And that is his comfort zone. Unfortunately, you know, he is the hunted.
