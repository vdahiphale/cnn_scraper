I've seen videos of Jews being assaulted. It's a terrible atmosphere.But, you know, this goes beyond just Jewish students. I'm sure the Palestinian students and other students are also horrified by what's happening. When you have no rule of law, when anarchy reigns, than everybody loses except the anarchists. And what happened there was, due to political decisions, it was basically decided not to send police up there when this was beginning, and it just got worse and worse. It was a snowball.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have been set up there in this encampment for about a week now. Arrests have been made. We're seeing this in live pictures now this morning after protesters were warned early - early this morning by the school to leave or face arrest.This is the same encampment where a violent clash with a group of counter protesters happened yesterday. Joining us right now is Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Of course, she is also a Biden-Harris campaign national advisory board member and also spent a large part of her career as a college professor on these college campuses. Senator, thank you for coming in. I mean, some of the various schools you have taught at and been affiliated with during your academic career, Harvard, UT-Austin among them, and there are many schools in Massachusetts are seeing these very same pro-Palestinian protests. What do you think of these campus protests? And the police being called in by school administrations just to make them disperse? SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): It is foundational to our democracy that people have an opportunity to raise their voices, to protest, to be heard by their elected officials, and to be heard by everyone else in the country. That's guaranteed in the Constitution. It is also foundational that it has to be peaceful and that it's not about bullying or attacking other people or interfering with other people's ability to go to class, to do the things they need to do. My concern is to keep the focus on what's happening in the Middle East. There are things that our government needs to be pushing for right now. We need a ceasefire. No more dropping bombs in Gaza. We also need return of those hostages. Remember that we are now nearly seven months into people who have been held in captivity. They need to be released and released to their families. We need a massive humanitarian relief flooding in to save little babies, people who are on the brink of starvation. And then most of all our government is in a position right now where we -- we should be giving a huge push to both sides to come to the negotiating table and to work out a peaceful two-state solution where two peoples can live side-by-side with self-determination, with dignity and with an assurance of a long-term peaceful solution. I -- that's where I want to keep the focus right now.",

Among the protests we're seeing on these campuses, we're hearing protesters accusing Israel of genocide, and I noticed -- I had seen that at an event last month, you had -- you had said that you thought the actions in Gaza legally could constitute genocide in the eyes of the International Court of Justice.And you'd said that if you want to do it, if you want to do it as an application of law, I believe that they'll find that it is genocide and they have ample evidence to do so. According to \"Politico\", your office clarified after that, you were commenting on the ongoing legal process at the ICJ, not sharing your views on whether genocide is occurring in Gaza. Senator, do you view Israel's actions in Gaza as committing genocide?",

And it really seems a direct response to what Donald Trump was saying in that \"Time Magazine\" interview and has just been saying even more about abortion. Yesterday in Wisconsin, he spoke to the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\", and he said, basically, the states decide on abortion and people are absolutely thrilled with the way that's going on. Every state is different, that he said at a campaign event. He's refused to say he would commit to vetoing a federal abortion ban. He deflected on that question. He says Congress won't pass it, so it's not his problem. Do you agree that a federal abortion ban would not make it through Congress?",

That is now the majority opinion in the House of Representatives.And what that means is not only zero access to abortion nationwide. It also means, for example, no access to IVF. So, let's take a look at where that Congress is right now, but also keep in mind that groups like the Heritage Foundation that support Donald Trump are trying to map out ways that they believe that if Donald Trump is in the White House, whether he has Congress with him or not, that he can put a nationwide abortion ban in place. For example, they're promoting the idea that they could use the Comstock Act, an old act that's already a part of federal law that he could use that now, in order to ban abortion nationwide. You know, there is no sharper contrast between the two people who are running for president than there is on abortion. Donald Trump has said over and over that, well, he wants to try to keep a lot of votes, but he goes out and brags to his people about how he's the one responsible for overturning Roe versus Wade. All of this can be laid at his feet. He is the one who is responsible for young rape victims who cannot get access to abortion, women who are in the middle of a miscarriage who are told that they have to wait until they're in sepsis to get access to abortion. By contrast, Joe Biden is using every tool available to him in the tool box right now to protect access to abortion, it's very limited post-Roe versus Wade, but he's doing that and he has promised, give him the chance and we can make Roe versus Wade law of the land again.",

And what's going to happen between now and the election in November is we're going to hear one more story and one more story and one more story about women who have been denied access to the care they need. People who are rape victims who can't get help that they need, women who are caught in the middle of a medical condition, or they have a fetus that cannot survive. People who are going through heartbreaking circumstances. And we are going to be reminded over and over that decisions that should be between a patient and that patient's doctor and nobody else that Donald Trump and extremist Republicans want the politicians to decide. And remember, there's another piece of what's come out recently. Donald Trump has said that he's actually okay with monitoring pregnant women to make sure that they don't engage in any activities that might end up in an abortion or seek abortion help in any way. You know, this is -- talk about fundamental freedoms here, things that people for a long time thought were protected for women have been wiped out and it all can be laid at the feet of exactly one person and that is Donald Trump. When he got that extremist Supreme Court in place and they overturned Roe versus Wade, we're just watching wave, on wave, on wave on the water of what that means for people all across this country. It is an extremist position that Donald Trump has taken. Joe Biden has said, give me the chance, and I'm going to put Roe versus Wade back in as law of the land.

And then last night, in an interview with \"The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,\" was asked if he would accept the election results in 2024. And he said, \"if everything's honest, I'll gladly accept the results. I don't change on that.\" But then he also said, \"if it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\" You have to fight, he says, if he doesn't think the election results are honest. And we know that his bar for honesty doesn't comport with reality since he didn't think the 2020 results were honest.So, how seriously should voters take statements like this, Chris? CHRIS KOFINIS, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR SEN. JOE MANCHIN AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I mean, you know, it's this - not just Trump rhetoric. And the one thing, if - even if you look at what's happening across the college campuses and Trump's rhetoric yesterday, it is kind of ironic and rich that he's talking about a forceful response to those college campus protests, but completely ignores, you know, his role and responsibility of the January 6th protests. Here's - if you step back and put this - the politics aside for a second, you know, voters are sick and tired - and I've seen this in all the research we've done over the last year, are sick and tired of this division, dysfunction, chaos, unrest across the board. And so I'm not surprised, nor should anyone be, that, you know, Trump's going to essentially talk out of both sides of his mouth. He's going to talk about a forceful response and then ignore it in other circumstances. The other part, I think, for Democrats, and I think this is the part that's key, you know, the president has kind of missed, I think, a key opportunity here, right, to go out there and talk about, you know, these college campus protests, to talk about them and I think in a fair, reasonable way, to paint a contrast between what a Donald Trump presidency would do and what he is doing. The idea that you're not going out there at this moment talking about this, I'm talking about the president right now, makes no strategic, political sense at all.

Those middle undecided voters have a lot of questions and concerns about both candidates, right? They abhor, you know, if you will, kind of chaos. This creates, right or wrong, the image of chaos. And in those circumstances the president, President Biden, right, has to go out there and make it clear what his position is and what he believes is right and wrong in these circumstances.
