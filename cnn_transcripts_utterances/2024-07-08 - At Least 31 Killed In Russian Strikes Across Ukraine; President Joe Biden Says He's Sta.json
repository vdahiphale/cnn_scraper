First, to our breaking news, a shocking daytime barrage of missile strikes that has killed more than 30 across Ukraine. Among the sites hit, a children's hospital in the capital, Kyiv, thousands of young patients rely on that facility, which performs around 7,000 surgeries a year, as well as providing treatment for cancer. These are live pictures coming to us at 5:00 p.m. Kyiv time. The president there, vowing retaliation.

As well, in addition, he said that there isessentially no way here that after all this time, Russia doesn't know what it's targeting and what it's actually hitting. And in this case, a children's hospital. It's hard to imagine a target or a facility that's hit that is intended to send -- appears to have be intended to send a very chilling message across Ukraine. And I think it also has to be said, intended, potentially as a message for those NATO leaders gathering in Washington later this week that there is nothing that it appears is off limits to Russia's missiles. We know from Ukrainian officials that these strikes, multiple strikes, happened today in Ukraine, that they said rush hour, sort of about 10:00 a.m. in the morning, 38 different missiles, the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles and the Kalibr cruise missiles, amongst others, were fired at Ukraine. There were deaths in Lviv. There were significant number of deaths in Kryvyi Rih. There were deaths closer to the front in Donetsk and Pokrovsk, three people killed there. But this attack on the children's hospital clearly catches everyone's attention, and we've already heard condemnation coming from the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, condemning it. We've heard it from coming from the French foreign ministry as well. Both countries, of course, our viewers will know have been wrapped up in their own elections and their own issues, but very quickly coming out to speak about this horrific attack in Ukraine. And I think it's -- it is hard to underscore, perhaps, the message that this is intended to send, because this round of missiles has been a spike comparative to recent weeks, particularly civilian targets, if you will, rather than the energy infrastructure that Russia's targeted on more occasions. And interestingly, no drones involved in this particular attack, very specifically targeted missile systems that conceal, of course, hypersonic, hyper fast.",

Outgoing Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, being replaced by the former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Obviously, that actual event happens a little later in the year, but the symbolism of it is going to be in Washington. President Zelenskyy expected to be there. Other officials from around the world expected to be there, but those 32 NATO nations leaders and one of those leaders, Victor Orban, has just been sort of on a -- on his own, what he calls a peace tour. He went to Kyiv, he went to Moscow, he went to Beijing, and has been pushing the narrative that there should be peace. I think, you know, if he tries to speak about that more broadly at NATO, I think a lot of the other leaders are going to round on him and say, this is what your putative friend in Moscow, the person you would rather not support Ukraine, defend themselves and be an outlier in NATO. This is what they're doing inside of Ukraine. So, there's obviously debate will circulate on the bigger issues at NATO, in sort of constructing this -- expected $40 billion monetary package for Ukraine for the coming year, but understanding that the ambition was bigger than that, but it's not been achieved, because there is dissent, like from Viktor Orban of Hungary. So, it comes at a very strategically important moment where voices are trying to ramp up for some kind of peace that's Putin's peace, and not the peace that Ukraine and the rest of the world talks about. And of course, as you say, while President Biden is there trying to hold all this together, while at the same time trying to hold down critics within his own party, saying he really does not have what it takes to win the election and that he should step down as a -- as the Democrats presidential nominee.

So, everyone is in uncharted waters, and I think it's going to take some time to sort out. I think the horse trading and the negotiations are not really even started in earnest. There is been some back channeling, but for now, the left is trying to sort of position itself as the natural biggest party and have a stake a claim on the premiership. But they only have 180 seats, and that's almost 100 seats off of what you would need of an outright majority. So, it would be a minority government that would be incredibly fragile. They seem to want to try it anyway, but who knows if they will be able to do that. And the President Macron's centrist block in the middle sort of wants to play a pivot role as well. It's just amazing, because the three blocks that voters have returned, essentially, the far right, the center and then this leftist coalition are actually quite similar sizes, so, nobody is close to being able to govern.",

To the question Macron basically put to the country, sort of daring, the country, do you want the R.N. or not? They did answer no. So, to an extent, that's a victory for both the left and the center.

He has been called a reformist.In his campaign, he called for a reset, and I'm -- a degree of social change and for a re-engagement with the west. And although voter turnout was lower than in previous presidential ballots, some have called the latest election a referendum on Iranian policy of the past three years, a period scarred by violent protests and an unpopular, hardline president. Well, the election triggered, of course, by the death of President Ebrahim Raisi, came as the world works through an election super cycle. By the end of this year, national elections will have been held in at least 64 countries, which together account for almost half of the global population. They come amid a rise in extreme politics almost everywhere. Some experts say democracy itself has been weakened over the past decade, as authoritarian leaders, fascist ideology and parties of the extreme left and right have advanced. However, three elections in just the past few days in the U.K., in France, and Iran, might just tell a different story. Well, joining us now is Middle East scholar and professor at John Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Dr. Valli Nasr. It's good to have you. The Raisi government was famously eastward looking. So, let's start with our new reformist, loosely termed, I think, in as you and I might agree in Iranian politics.

And so, they are not only inclined to engage the West. I think they actually campaigned on the idea that Iran's economy cannot improve without engagement of the West and finding a way to negotiate some of the sanctions away. And Pezeshkian also is of the view, like Rouhani was, that Iran should maintain a balance between East and the West, and that relying too much on China and Russia is not to Iran's advantage.

As well as donors, President Biden in that interview railing against the donor class saying that he is in the race for the average voter not because he wants to carry the water for millionaires and billionaires. But in that interview, Becky, was a full throated reiteration for the president's commitment to stay in the race. And he expressed quite a bit of frustration with his own party too for the leaks that have been coming in recent days about the hand wringing and the soul searching that the party is undergoing as they figure out the path forward for President Biden and for their own party come November. To that end, President Biden releasing a letter earlier this morning addressed to all House Democrats in the wake of a senior level phone call that was held yesterday in which several top ranking Democrats expressed a desire for President Biden to step aside. But in this letter today, President Biden says the voters have already spoken, they've already participated in the nominating process and delivered him 14 million votes and more than 3900 delegates enough to make him the presumptive nominee of the party by a wide margin in saying that voters participation should matter and that he's not going to deny them that. But at the close of the letter, Becky, President Biden writes this, the question of how to move forward has been well aired for over a week now and it's time for it to end. We have one job, and that is to beat Donald Trump. He mentions the 42 days before the party's convention, the 119 days before the election, and he says it is time to come together, move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump. Now, this message is being delivered to members of Congress right before all House Democrats are set to gather tomorrow to address some of these concerns within the party and Democrats on the Senate side are expected to discuss them as well that President Biden is trying to tamp down on those questions, saying he is not going anywhere, saying that he is more than just the presumptive nominee. He is going to be the Democratic nominee for president and he's going to run his race till the end, Becky.",

It is the left-wing new Popular Front alliance which has come out on top and if you were looking closely at this video of celebrations at the famous Place de la Republique, you may have seen some Palestinian flags intermingled with the French, a whole load of Palestinian flags, in fact. The ongoing war in Gaza has been a point of contention during this election and the new Popular Front has pledged to immediately recognize a Palestinian state. It also says it will push Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza. Now, France has previously somewhat distanced itself from recognizing Palestinian statehood, even as some other nations were making that move to increase the pressure for a Gaza ceasefire. CNN's Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson back with us for some analysis. Nic, Palestine was also an issue for labor in the U.K. elections who lost at least three seats to independents who pretty much ran on a pro- Palestinian ticket. How is the war in Gaza reshaping the politics of Europe? Very specifically, the politics of Europe's center to far left?",

In constituencies were in the last census, morethan 40 percent of the population identified as Muslim. Absolutely. The Labour not only lost seats to candidates that essentially said that Labour didn't go far enough in supporting the people of Gaza. They lost them to candidates who had formerly been Labour candidates. If you take Blackburn in the north of the country, 132 votes was the majority by the former Labour candidate there who was pushing stronger advocacy for doing more for the Palestinians. Birmingham Perry Barr 507. Again, the same scenario. Look at Leicester South, another constituency where the former Labour candidate ran against the Labour candidate on this issue. 979 votes separating them there. The list actually goes on. It's a little -- it's a few more than three. And you could say plenty of others were influenced as well. And yes, absolutely catching Macron really wrong footed on this, he's sort of sounded a bit behind all year. In February, he was talking about the possibility -- the first time he was talking about the possibility of a two state solution in May when you had Norway, Ireland, Spain, as you said, who independently recognize a Palestinian state. He said no, we should do this together at a different moment. But there are populations within these countries and others in Europe who really feel that the center ground is not listening to them, is not listening to their concerns. And they have a voice and this is something new, and it's certainly something that, you know, they may have to address in the future. It's not an issue, I think and the idea of -- the idea of this voice is going to go away.",
