And Kevin McCarthy is not at where he needs to be, the 218 votes to be elected speaker.But behind the scenes he has been negotiating. He and his allies along with some of those holdouts to try to assuage their concerns, try to bring them over to his side. He has proposed a number of measures to give them more power, give the rank-and-file members, especially members of the far right freedom caucus. Some of those members denying him the ascension to the speakership, giving them more power, more to say over the legislative process. The ability to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker. Now under the rule proposed by McCarthy, one member could do that. That is down from conference rules that about half the Republican Congress, 111 members, initially would be able to do that. McCarthy has gone down to have one member which raises concerns about keeping the speakership stable, the stability of the speakership assuming he gets the job. Now McCarthy in speaking to him late after -- soon after the final failed vote on Thursday, was confident he would ultimately get there, he just didn't know when.",

And now you have the most extreme elements of the caucus using that narrow majority to demand more power and visibility to impose on the party the exact same politics that the voters rejected in the first place.

But questions still remain about why no one called 911 until almost 8 hours later. The affidavit says security video around the time of the murders picked up distorted audio of what sounded like voices or a whimper followed by a loud thud. A dog can also be heard barking. The document also details multiple sightings of a suspect vehicle from surveillance footage showing a white Hyundai Elantra like this one that helped lead to Kohberger's arrest.

That destruction comes about after intense fights for every inch of ground. So, imagine the Russians sitting in their trenches having a cigarette or going to church as their Patriarch has suggested they should do. Then the Ukrainians will take advantage on the ground. It's hard to imagine a unilateral cease-fire in a situation like that doesn't work. Will there be a diminution? Maybe a little bit. Will it hold for long? Not really. This is not something that's agreed Let's not forget Putin is asking for a cease-fire in a war that he's agreed. Let's not forget Putin is asking for a cease-fire in a war that he's created.
