I mean, I -- it may be easy to lose sight of the world liar, has been used so much in our politics and the last frankly since the Trump presidency. It didn't used to be something that people throw around terribly cavalierly, but both Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley used that about each other basically throughout the night.What were -- what were your top takeaways from the back and forth on stage? And do you think they did any favors to themselves and actually trying to take on the guy who's leading the race? MIKE LEON, HOST, \"CAN WE PLEASE TALK\":  Well, let me say, desantislies.com without plugging it a little bit more, right? And somebody who's built websites and product and technology, including the ones that people are watching this on this platform, it's pretty good that they had that up, and ready for her. And you're right, Kasie, like the back and forth I thought in a two person sitting with Jake and Dana moderating, it would be a lot easier, and you would get more policy vision as opposed to talking over each other and her promoting the website, we're not going to give anymore attention that it deserves. But my overall takeaways, I watch it different. You know, I was on in August talking about Nikki Haley in the first debate with eight people, and how she used the H-word, and humanize when Martha from Fox asked about abortion and women's reproductive rights and how Republicans have been getting hammered in different state ballot initiatives and she answered it great. And I was with Republican and Democratic strategists at the time filming our show, and both of them, were both females, are more like that's the way you answered until now what I see today, or last night excuse me, which was really a lot of attacks the way, you know, Jake asked her the question at the end, what do you like about Ron DeSantis? I like that he's governor of Florida. I mean, you can tell that she's taking this very personally. And I think both of them, back to Geoff's point, I think both of them are missing the key things that they should be talking about with the former president. I get why they're not doing it, they're trying to appeal to folks that are trying to caucus for Donald Trump, to swing for her or him, but there was a lot of personal attacks lobbied last night. And it just didn't feel like we lost some of the policy visions and strategy from both of them with the personal attacks.",

You know, if America pulls out, how does your keep supporting Ukraine, and actually there is a trend in this part of the world that they shouldn't keep funding Ukraine. That is certainly a big argument on the right for these parties really dressing up as we look ahead to elections this year.I remember talking to Donald Trump when he was running to be president, obviously the first time, and this was right at the beginning of the Ukraine crisis where Russia invaded Crimea, and I remember asking him what would you do about Crimea? And him saying to me, well, that's Europe's problem. Why doesn't Germany intervene and get involved in that? Why is America getting involved in that? The document, or the conversation you just reported, on speaks to a similar theme in what he is saying. You know, there are problems in the world which aren't necessarily America's problems, and certainly, Europe has enough money if you take it as a whole to be able to sort out some of these problems on its own.

Other countries weren't paying their fair share. What has actually happened since Donald Trump said that as we sort of contemplate this possibility that he could be returning to power?",

You know, other countries weren't putting in what America did, and many of them weren't paying much at all.So I think there is an acceptance that, you know, he had a correct argument there in terms of funding of NATO. It's not clear exactly what he means about NATO, does he not believe in the principle itself? In which case just pulling out of NATO out of principle, or will he stay in NATO if other countries continue paying their way, or increase the amount that they pay. Often, they don't live up to their promises at all, and America does have to pay a lot of NATO all the time. But I think are a better place to explain exactly what he means.",

Today, we have an enhanced risk from the Storm Prediction Center, heads-up Little Rock to Shreveport. That's a level three of five. You have a greater chance of EF2 tornadoes, that is winds over 110 miles per hour within that shaded area. Then the threat shifts eastward for the day on Friday, a large swath of population density across the Southeast, including Atlanta, all the way to the areas that were hit hardest by tornadoes earlier this week.
