You know, this is an Israeli professor who claims to have incriminating information about Hunter Biden. The committee has not investigated, corroborated that information, as you pointed out. And again, the hitch here is, this is someone who by his own account on his own Twitter page was accused by the U.S. of arms dealing. According to international press reports, he was apparently arrested in Cypress and then he either went missing or skipped out on his bail. Again, this is according to international press reports. We have not been able to independently confirm that.And when I reached out to the attorney for Gal Luft, he did not want to speak to me. So, it's really unclear what exactly the committee is hoping to learn from this gentleman, if they will ever be able to learn anything from this gentleman. But I think their hope is that they would be able to press him for more information related to their broader investigation that they're doing into the Biden family's business dealings, Poppy.",

We've seen these press conferences coming from the chair of the House Oversight, Comer, that you just heard from there.What actually is the latest on these investigations and where they stand and whether or not they actually have any evidence tying it to the president directly as they've kind of implied? MURRAY: Yes, I mean, we heard from Comer about this last week. He had a press conference. He knew they subpoenaed all of these bank records and so they have been getting information and they alleged that there were millions of dollars in payments from foreign entities that were going to some members of the Biden family, including Hunter Biden. But they were not able to show any payments that were going directly to Joe Biden, either when he was vice president, when he left office, or, you know, really at any point. So, they haven't been able to corroborate this sort of central allegation that Comer has trotted out there, that somehow Joe Biden could be compromised by his family's business dealings. We also heard a lot of frustration from Republicans that DOJ should be doing more on this front. Listen to what Nancy Mace had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): DOJ needs to get off its ass and investigate. We have done the work for them so they can't screw it up now. If these allegations, any of these allegations are proven true, then someone with the last name Biden needs to be charged, prosecuted and maybe spend a little time in prison to take to account and responsible for the actions they've taken today.

The Justice Department did look at payments from foreign entities to Hunter Biden as part of that probe, looking for potential money laundering, looking for violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.We, of course, know that now that probe has narrowed.
