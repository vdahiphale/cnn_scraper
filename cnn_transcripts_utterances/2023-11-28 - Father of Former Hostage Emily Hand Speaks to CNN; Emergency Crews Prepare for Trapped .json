And the lists have been exchanged and now families of 10 hostages captured by Hamas and 30 Palestinians held by Israel are awaiting release in the first day of a two day truce extension in Gaza. A similar exchange is set to happen on Wednesday. The question is what happens beyond then? And that's not yet clear. Qatar's Foreign Ministry has been mediating the ceasefire along with Egypt. It says extending the truce beyond tomorrow is contingent on Israel's condition that Hamas released 10 additional hostages each day. Now 11 hostages and 33 prisoners were exchanged on Monday. And for every hostage freed, Israel is releasing three Palestinians held in custody. Clare Sebastian is monitoring developments for us from London. Clare once again, we expect this to play out in a similar manner today and tomorrow that we've seen over the last four days. But I think the first thing that we should discuss is what the Israeli Defense Forces have now confirmed is the death of one of those hostages in captivity Ravid Katz, a father of three, I believe, what more do we know?",

It's been under for now the four days coming up to this. We get this news from the IDF confirming the death of Ravid Katz. He was believed to be among the hostages captured on October 7th. They say that his body is being held by Hamas in Gaza, but it is not clear if he was -- if he actually died in Gaza or if he was killed on October 7th and taken to Gaza. Now this is the third hostage who we know of who has been killed. Since October 7th there was the IDF soldier Noa Marciano and another hostage Yehudit Weiss both found in the vicinity of Shifa -- of Al- Shifa Hospital in Gaza. So this is the third one. And obviously, this underscores just how delicate the situation is, as we wait for the next round of hostage releases. As you say 10 expected on the Israeli side, they -- we understand, according to a government spokesperson have the list. So we're waiting to see how that unfolds and then the one to three ratio expected to continue on the Palestinian side.",

And if they continue to release hostages at a rate of 10 per day, then Israel will continue to extend the truce by 24 hours for each of those 10. I think there are potential limitations on that right now. The deal that is in place involves just women and children and of the 173 hostages that Israel estimates are still in Gaza. Just 45 are women and six are children. Add to that the complication that certainly according to a diplomatic source, briefed on the talks telling CNN that they believe at least 40 of those hostages are not currently in the physical custody of Hamas. They may be being held by other militant groups in the Gaza Strip. So that would complicate Hamas's efforts to get them out. But the diplomatic efforts are stepping up. You know, source telling CNN that the CIA Director who has been influential in this so far, Bill Burns is back in Doha right now trying to instigate a broader deal which could go beyond women and children, Julia.",

ELBAGIR (voice-over): The Israeli Prison Service responded to these allegations saying national security prisoners who were released from the Israeli prison during the past two days was serving time for serious crimes such as attempted murder, assault and throwing explosives. All prisoners in IPS custody are held according to the law. That's not true. CNN broke down the numbers in a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners identified by Israel as eligible for release. 80 percent are listed as just detained which means they have not been formally sentenced. Israel operates two systems of law in the occupied territories, Palestinians under the military, Israelis under civil law creating a low bar for the arrest of increasing numbers of Palestinians. And as Israeli hardliners like Ben Gvir and others in this far right government seek to characterize every Palestinian as a terrorist that number is rising every day. Nima Elbagir CNN, Jerusalem.

Now preparations have been started to evacuate the workers safely\". Now this is just coming about three minutes back Julia which means this is indeed the last slap. But we're hoping to see those men 41 of them trapped inside that Himalayan tunnel for the past 17 days emerge slowly. What we do know is that there is about a three feet wide pipe that has been drilled into this passageway through the debris through the rocks through the mangled metals to get to them and they will be brought out on stretchers. You got to have rescuers pulling them out on trolleys through ropes. Now that process is going to be slow and steady is what we're being told. They want to make sure that these 41 laborers who've gone through trauma over the last two weeks and more are pulled out gently and then they will be whisked away in ambulances that are on standby.

But this has been a long process with a lot of hurdles that have come in the way for these rescue teams to this day 17. But the good news is for families, for friends and for all the rescue teams on the ground that at least four of those migrant laborers who were trapped inside that Himalayan tunnel, which only had one exit that collapse partially are now out of that tunnel. It's been a long process. There were a lot of heavy drilling machines that were used, that repeatedly broke down over the last two weeks. Finally in the last stretch, officials have said that there was manual digging that was done to bring these people out. Manual digging, manual drilling that was used as a pipe which is more than about 50 centimeters long that we've been told. As well as 50 meters rather long and about three feet wide that has been used to extract these laborers from inside the tunnel. They're about 60 meters in. There's a trolley that is being used a stretcher mounted on that trolley that has been pulled with ropes by these rescue teams. And that process is still on. The entire tunnel where we're being told has been lit up with LED lights to make sure that there's enough of light around the area for them to maneuver. Remember, this isn't much space Julia that we're talking about. This is very restricted and limited space through which these men are being pulled out. They haven't seen daylight in 17 days. These rescue teams have to be gentle with them, and make sure that they're delicately slowly, gently extracted from this pipeline that they have pushed in through the last two weeks. They tried many options Julia. They tried to drill vertically, which had its own dangers and risks. But finally it was this horizontal way in pushing this pipe through that has finally helped successfully extract at least four of these laborers out. You're using lots of ambulances there. I can see it on our screen here, many on standby. You're seeing those rescue teams in yellow jackets as well and caps. These are the men who've been working non-stop tirelessly on the ground to make sure that this mission finally is a big success 17 days after these men were trapped. And now hopefully we're going to see dozens more being pulled out. They're going to be whisked away in these ambulances. They're going to be spot medical checks scattered out. They're going to be taken to a hospital from here. There's also makeshift hospital inside the tunnel that has been created over the last couple of days. But we're seeing dozens of ambulances on standby there. We're just hoping to see more and more faces move out.

A hive of activities you can see around the entrance of that tunnel around 30 rescue workers with hard hats that we can see milling around that ambulance waiting to take the next rescued worker out of that. And as you were describing Vedika and perhaps you can expand a little bit more on this. A pulley system to bring these trapped workers out through the tunnel that they've managed to bore through the debris that collapsed of course, that trap them in there. It suggests that they're only going to be able to bring them out one at a time. So we're just going to have to wait and see hopefully we will see when the next trap worker comes out. I'm assuming they'll be on a stretcher and then brought to that ambulance. And then we'll see them drive away and that will then be replaced by a fresh ambulance waiting to take the next one.
