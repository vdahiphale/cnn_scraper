In the filings, Combs is accused of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and false imprisonment. And among the accusers, a woman who says she was 13-years-old at the time of the alleged sexual assault.Now, he is currently being held without bond as he awaits trial on federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, all of which he denies. Let's get to CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister. She's got much more on these new details that are coming out. What are you learning, Elizabeth?",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kate.These are just horrifying allegations across these seven new lawsuits which come from all anonymous accuser, both male and female. Now, two of these accusers allege that they were minors at the time. As you said, one says that she was a 13-year-old girl. Another said that he was a 17-year-old boy. Now, as you mentioned, this is the first time the other celebrities are directly accused of wrongdoing in these lawsuits. Now, these celebrities are not named, so we do not know who they are. We do not know what these accuser's definition of a celebrity is. No indication as to who these people are. But one of the accusers, the 13-year-old girl, alleges that in the year 2000 that she was drugged and raped by Combs and assaulted by two other celebrities. She said that she was brought to this MTV VMA after party by a limo driver who alleged that he worked for Combs. He allegedly told this young girl that Combs liked younger girls. When she arrived, she alleges that she was forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement and she was given one drink, which soon made her very woozy and disoriented. Now, Kate, I want to read you part of this lawsuit. And again, these allegations are very disturbing. It says, quote, \"after drinking just one drink, plaintiff began to feel woozy and lightheaded, making her need to lie down. Soon after Combs, along with a male and female celebrity entered the room.\" Now, she goes on to allege in her lawsuit that one of these unnamed celebrities, who is called \"Celebrity A\" in the lawsuit, a male celebrity, then undressed her and raped her while Combs and the other celebrity, who is named \"Celebrity B\" and allegedly is a female celebrity, watched. Then the allegations get even worse. She says that then Combs allegedly raped her while the other two watched. Kate.",

      "sentences": "As you said, Daniel Penny was riding the subway. He sees Jordan Neely get onto the subway car. And Jordan Neely begins to talk and rant about being hungry, about being thirsty. He says that he's not scared to go to jail. And Penny interprets this as the fact that this is a dangerous situation that may be Neely is going to hurt someone. So, he takes him down in a chokehold.And this whole interaction is captured on bystander video. He brings him down to the floor. He ties his legs around him. He holds him there for six minutes. And we see that Neely stops moving and loses consciousness. Now, Neely dies at the hospital later that evening. And now Daniel Penny is accused of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Now, the prosecution's case will largely hinge on this video. And they're going to say that he simply went too far. Now the defense will argue that there were people on that train who were afraid. In fact, we know from grand jury testimony that some people did say, yes, I was a little bit uncomfortable. I was a little bit worried. While other people said, it was just another day riding in the New York City subway. Now, one very important element of this case, Sara, is that it's going to illustrate two important issues about New York City and how people feel about them. One, that the subway sometimes, especially after the pandemic, crime rates went up, there had been incidents of people being pushed onto the tracks, while others say that it exposes a key failure by the city of New York to do what is needed for the most vulnerable, people who are homeless, experiencing mental health challenges. So, that is going to expose those two really challenging parts of living in the city. And we'll see what this jury is eventually made up of.",

And this comes as we learned overnight that she really broke records with a huge fundraising haul, $346 million cash on hand at this point. You can see ahead of what Donald Trump, has raised more than $1 billion in just a three-month period. That hadn't been done ever.With us now, senior spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, Ian Sams. Ian, nice to see you this morning. There was a headline in \"The New York Times\" that grabbed my attention. It said, \"starring in Kamala Harris' closing argument: Donald Trump.\" It went on to say that Harris has made a notable shift in strategy. Why? IAN SAMS, SENIOR NATIONAL SPOKESMAN, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN: Well, thanks for having me. I think that we're here on the home stretch of this campaign. Two weeks to go till Election Day. And right now, fundamentally, the choice is coming into crystal clear focus for the American people. Vice President Harris is out there, like you said, today in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. And what's she doing? She's campaigning with former conservative Congresswoman Liz Cheney. She's expanding her appeal. She's drawing more people in. There was an Emerson poll this weekend that said if you've made up your mind in the last few weeks, by 20 points, more than 20 points, you're breaking for Vice President Harris. And what is Donald Trump doing at the same time? Donald Trump is talking a bunch of mess. He's talking about a dead golfer's anatomy on stage. He's attacking his fellow Americans as the enemy within. Just this morning, just about 30, 40 minutes ago, J.D. Vance was on Fox News Channel, and he defended calling fellow Americans the enemy within. So, this is the choice that people are going to see. Are we going to have somebody who's trying to reach out and be a president for all Americans, bringing conservatives and Republicans into the fold of a new vision for the country that actually focuses on people's needs, or are we going to go back to the chaos and the crazy of Donald Trump? And I think that people are trying to make that choice right now. And so it's very, very important that we, as a campaign, and that the vice president presents that choice to the American people.",

And it's understandable.There's - you know, people are living their lives. People are busy. People are taking care of their kids. They're going to work. They may not be paying as close attention to politics as you and I are, John, but when they do pay attention, it's in the final few weeks before the election. And so, when they're trying to decide, you know, I'm trying to figure out who's looking out for me. How's my life going to get better in the next four years?

Again, you're going to hear her today out across the country with Congresswoman Liz Cheney talking about her vision for the country of bringing people together, being united, but also being united behind a vision. You know, she got a lot of attention recently for her media blitz, including where she went on \"The View,\" and she talked about her plan for the sandwich generation, parents who are trying to take care of kids and also an aging parent at the same time, and how she has real ideas for childcare, how she has real ideas to make sure that seniors have their in-home care covered by Medicare. And millions and millions of people saw that.And so, I think that when you think about where - whether it's breaking through, that her message is breaking through, we're starting to see some of the results. There's a major AP national poll out this morning asking, who do you trust on issues? She's leading on lowering housing costs. She's leading by 12 points on cutting middle-class taxes. She's leading by 24 points on protecting people's reproductive freedoms. So, these are the real, concrete ideas that she's offering to the country. And you're starting to see real results that it's breaking through and people are listening.",
