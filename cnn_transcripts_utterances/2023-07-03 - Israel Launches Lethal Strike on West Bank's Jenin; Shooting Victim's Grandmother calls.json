Middle East morning, at least eight Palestinians have died and dozens injured after Israeli raids in the West Bank town of Jenin. The second major military operation they're in weeks with Israel now calling the city a terrorism hub. We're live from Tel Aviv with the latest. Plus, Paris Peace and an uneasy calm across France after days of violent protests, fewer than 200 people arrested overnight that unfortunately is a relative improvement. President Macron meeting with parliamentary leaders for talks on the crisis today, he'll meet with more than 200 Mayors tomorrow too and Musk marathon, no rest for the world's, richest man, this weekend. We got strong second quarter sales numbers for Tesla that's helping the stock pre market. And new Twitter turmoil, Elon announcing a temporary limit on accessible tweet, citing the need to battle data scraping on the site, or limiting social media scrolling might be a positive for our mental health and of course our eyeballs too. But fewer eyes not necessarily good news for advertisers and the business model long term. We'll discuss Musk's motives later in the show. In the meantime, I'm keeping at least one eyeball on Wall Street back in business a number jungle as we begin trade on July the third ahead of the July 4 holiday. Why bother of course just half a day's trade before markets are closed before the Independence Day festivities on Tuesday, cautious trade in the meantime, as you can see both in the United States and in Europe. But we did see solid gains across the Asia session with the HANG SENG up some 2 percent after Chinese factory data surprised to the upside. And some crude realities for you to oil prices volatile today as Saudi Arabia extends production cuts of 1 million barrels a day into August. And Russia also cutting exports by a half a million barrels per day their combined demand concerns follows the fourth consecutive quarterly drop in prices. A busy show ahead, as always, we begin today's show though in the West Bank where deadly violence is flaring once again. Israel says its military operation in the City of Jenin was a counter terrorism operation. The Palestinians call it a \"war crime against defenseless people\". Hadas Gold joins us now. Hadas, the Israelis were saying they were targeting or striking terrorism infrastructure? Do we know specifically what they were targeting and whose lives were lost in the process?",

What more do we know about that? And have we heard from the Ukrainian side on that? WEDEMAN Well, this is not uncommon that, basically, collaborators Ukrainians who have in some way joined the Russian occupation, that they sometimes suffer untimely deaths. The Ukrainians rarely, if ever, actually claimed responsibility. But it's well known that behind enemy lines, the Ukrainians have a network of peaceful activists. In fact, we've reported on them, and also essentially partisans who are attacking Russian infrastructure, and particularly those Ukrainians who are working with the Russian. So no word yet, from the Ukrainians don't actually expect them to acknowledge that they were behind it.

This Southern suburb of Paris over the weekend was witness to one of the acts of violence that have caught people's attention in the country. The Mayor was in his office, the protesters couldn't get in. They went a half a mile, a mile away and attacked his house where his wife and two young children were and his wife was injured badly broken leg as she tried to run away. So there's you know, a grounds well of support that's come out and said, OK, well we need to come out and say we want peace. We want an end to this violence we want to support our Mayors.

And in the past, what President Macron has done is meet with different groups around the country groups with vested interests. And it's not clear right now who he'll choose to meet with, but listening to analysts here. They feel that there is yes, a deep rooted systemic racist problem bias within the police. And that's something that the government needs to address. And they would question, the government's not unaware of this, why haven't they dealt with it before. But when President Macron says he's going to try to gain a deeper understanding. People interpret that as he wants to try to get to the underlying reasons why you have this perceived and documented problem in the police service here and how you can address that? But look, let's be very clear here. The government has treated this 100 percent so far as a law and order problem, very large numbers of police on the streets. That's why we've seen the drop off in the number of arrests and the amount of violence. But in terms of the government now addressing the underlying issues, potentially, that's what is about to begin, but as you rightly question, precisely, how will President Macron do that? Will he have these sorts of group meetings and go listen to people as he has in the past? Maybe we'll see.",

One of the sorts of side lines to this made me think is does this force people who do see a utility function and I'm one of them? Twitter is very useful to me. Does it force some of those people to say, OK, if we're going to be severely limited if we aren't verified to actually pay the subscription and verify, is there a sort of backhanded benefit perhaps of this?",

The problem Julia is that to create a new social network, the barrier to entry is a lot lower right now, because technology is so much better. But that also means it's a lot harder to break through than it was over a decade ago when Twitter and Meta and some of these are Facebook's big social platforms launched. So what Twitter has and it's sort of side is that it's the legacy platform. It's still the number one place where people go to have political discourse, discourse around live breaking news, et cetera. And even though there are a lot of competitors trying to move in, it really does still, even to this day, even under the chaos of Elon Musk have the scale to continue to be the dominant player. And I don't see anyone moving into its space right now in part Julia, because the competitive space is just so crowded there's just too many people trying to get in.",

A major ecommerce player in the U.S. and Canada headed for an overhaul in terms of its name at least.Overstock.com is already known for selling products like rugs and decor right through to furniture items. Well, now it's set to change its name to an even more well-known brand, perhaps Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. They just spent $21 million to acquire the name and domain of the bankrupt home wares chain but not Bed Bath &amp; Beyond physical stores, which had been closing across the United States. Investors certainly liked the idea. Its stock jumped more than 15 percent in trading last Thursday, following that announcement. And here to discuss, Jonathan Johnson is the CEO of Overstock.

It comes two weeks after the successful visit to China by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to reestablish dialogue. Janet Yellen is expected to meet with her Chinese counterpart and other high ranking officials for what we are hearing will be constructive and frank conversations. But like with Blinken's trip, officials say they are not expecting any significant breakthroughs. She is not expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yellen has long signaled the Biden Administration's desire to improve communications with the Chinese and lower the temperature between the world's two largest economies, which are deeply entwined. Back in April while giving testimony before Congress, she stressed the importance of maintaining ties with China, and said that decoupling would be a big mistake. And last month at the Paris Finance Summit on stage with Chinese Premier Li Jiang, she said, as the world's two largest economies, we also have a responsibility to work together on global issues. It is something the world expects of us. Yellen's trip comes at a time of heightened uncertainty for the global economy. China is struggling to reboot its economy post COVID following a slew of poor economic data, while the U.S. is trying to contain inflation and avoid recession. Global challenges and mutual areas of concern will no doubt be on the agenda but the airing of grievances is also a priority. The U.S. has imposed sweeping restrictions on China's access to advanced technology, specifically semiconductor technology, citing national security threats to the U.S. While the U.S. is concerned about the scope of China's new counter espionage law, and the challenges it could present for foreign companies. We know that Yellen will be meeting with American companies operating in China. There certainly will be a lot to discuss during her three day visit. But at the end of the day, there's $700 billion in trade between the U.S. and China each year. And both countries need each other. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong,",

And as you can see from that oil price, actually, they're not really being rewarded for their persistence in cutting oil. Oil price there at $75 a barrel and actually, for Saudi Arabia according to the IMF, it needs oil to come in, I believe, around $80 a barrel $81 a barrel to balance their budgets, so not really reaping the rewards. In terms of Russia, I find this movie even more interesting. They introduced a very similar cost of 500,000 barrels a day in March for every month for the foreseeable future. And actually, they really overshot it both in March also in April, they finally met their target, I think, in May. But to promise another output cut, I'm not sure how convinced markets will be. Also you have to remember that in terms of the incentive for Russia, to try and prop up oil prices, it's perhaps not as pronounced as it is for Saudi Arabia, given there is a G7 oil cap that puts oil prices for Russia at $60 a barrel. Currently, it's actually trading at even more of a discount than that at $57 a barrel. So same decision from two different players but I think one is perhaps more believable than the other.",
