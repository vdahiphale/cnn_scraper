I'm Max Foster, live in London with our breaking news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.Qatar's foreign ministry says it will announce in the next few hours when the truce between Israel and Hamas will begin. A diplomatic source says it's likely to start Friday now, midnight local time at the earliest. The news comes after Israel said on Wednesday that the expected release of hostages and the pause in fighting with Hamas were delayed. Both U.S. and Israeli officials pointed to logistical details for that delay. Ahead of the expected truce, Israeli forces continued around -- continued ground and air operations, striking parts of northeastern and central Gaza. The Palestinians say areas further south were also hit. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed confidence the deal would go into effect. Here's what a top White House official told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATOR: Well, we're not going into this with hubris or arrogance or ultra confidence. We're grateful that we were able to get the deal secured. But as I said, it all now comes down to execution. And so, we're -- nobody -- nobody is doing any touchdown dancing here. There's still work to be done, and a long way to go. We're hoping -- hoping that implementation will start sometime in the next 24 hours or so, and then continue for the next few days. Both the days of a pause where there will be no fighting, so humanitarian assistance can go in at an accelerated rate, and of course, getting all those 50-plus hostages out. And they'll come out in increments. They won't all come out altogether. And that's why this is a multi-day process. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think this has been one of the big issues since October 7th, is trying to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. And we are -- from what we've been hearing, I will give you the numbers, this is from the Egyptian press center, that over 2,000 tons of medical aid has been delivered through Rafah, 6,000 tons of food, 4,500 tons of water. That might sound like a lot, but this is just a trickle and the aid agencies have been really ringing the alarm bells in terms of the humanitarian needs on the ground.What we are seeing right now I want to show you the images of those aid trucks lining up in Al Arish, heading towards the Rafah Border in anticipation for this four-day truce to try to get as much aid as possible into the Gaza Strip. We've seen this activity playing out for the last 24 hours. And, clearly, aid agencies are waiting to get that water, the food, the medical supply which by the way they are in dire need right now, across the health care sector. We've also heard the harrowing stories from doctors that had to embark on surgeries without anesthesia. Also, amputations without anesthesia. One only wonders what it means for the patients, and also for the doctors themselves. Listen to the U.N.'s Martin Griffin yesterday, he said they negotiated with the Egyptians in terms of getting aid into the Gaza Strip. The number of trucks, the amounts of fuel, the amounts of water, but the opening of the new crossing whether it happens or not, and basically creating those humanitarian lines, they say it all comes out with negotiations with Israel. So, Israel definitely has the final say. The Norwegian Red Cross also categorically say that this four-day truce to get more aid into Gaza is not enough, they are calling for a full out cease-fire because we've been seeing the images of the displaced Palestinians, 1.7 million people are in dire need of food and water. You know, Max, you know, being in a hotel here in Cairo, we've bumped into some of the foreign nationals and dual passport holders and they've been evacuated from Gaza. We met a family that had American passports and they were saying they couldn't find food and water for many days. We're talking about them having three little children, being stuck at the Rafah Border until they got their name on the list to eventually evacuate. Importantly, and we have to say this, the two criteria to get out of Gaza right now, you either need to have two passports. You need to be a dual passport holder or foreign nationals or you need to be critically injured to be able to get out into Egypt. That is a scenario that's playing out. For everyone else that is in Gaza right now, and the agencies have said this, they are running out of food, they are running out of water, and this will be a welcomed relief. We've seen those trucks, Max, hopefully, they get in as soon as possible.",

This was, of course, a really breakthrough moment because it was a sticking point, Israelis, of course, have been saying that any fuel that enters the Gaza Strip could end up in the hands of Hamas, but then we saw the breakthrough deal because the hospitals, to keep the generators going, to keep operations going need fuel.Of course, also part of the blackouts is because the telco companies in Gaza didn't have any fuel for the generators, so won't be seeing fuel entering the Gaza strip. It's going to be tightly monitored, as it always is, go straight into the humanitarian agencies hands. They will decide how that will be distributed across the board.

So, there's no indication that these quantities will be increased. And again, there's no restoration of electricity, water or comms. So, it's not just the generators or comms, it's also that there has been full comms blackouts not because of the fuel crisis but because of telecom lines have been turned off.

So, we are not actually relying completely on our staff responds. We're hoping that teams of humanitarian workers mobilize and they will be allowed in. This is also unclear as to whether, you know, extra medical teams, extra humanitarian workers will be allowed in. You have to understand that these people have been under relentless bombing for 48 days. How can they, you know, really meaningfully deliver humanitarian aid when they are trying to protect their own children and fend themselves to find food and any type of water for their children? It's an unprecedented situation as humanitarian workers are responding. This is -- we've never seen a scale -- the scale of destruction in such a short amount of time and a response that has been completely obstructed and halted by Israeli authorities by closing the borders and using and limiting the humanitarian aids in.",

There might be more hostage releases, more prisoner releases. It's not clear how far you can push this, right, because Prime Minister Netanyahu is still saying the fight continues, the war will continue. They still want to, as well as getting the hostages out, they want to finish the job of completely dismantling Hamas.

And this is why we are very much focused on northern Gaza Strip. And specifically, I think it's important to know that yesterday we revealed the extent of Hamas's activities under Shifa Hospital, in the hospital itself. And I know it's just a developing issue. Every single day, we are seeing more and more of Hamas's tunnel, their capabilities, command and control capabilities, and revealing it to the world.
