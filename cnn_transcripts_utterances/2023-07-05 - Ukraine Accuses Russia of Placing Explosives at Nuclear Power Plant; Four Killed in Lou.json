But let me tell you about what we did see in court today. So, again, Kimbrady Carriker, 40 years old, he had his preliminary arraignment earlier this morning. It was only about 15 minutes' long. But the laundry list of charges that were read did make it feel like a longer time. Those charges include murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and also a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, just violations of laws relating to having firearms when you should not be allowed to have them. And the magistrate judge, the judge made the comment when it came to holding him without bail that public safety is clearly an issue in this case. And the judge added, \"That no set of conditions that exist in which you would not be a flight risk,\" speaking to the defendant there. And, Jim, I will say that, throughout this entire proceeding, the defendant sat in a white jumpsuit with his arms crossed, fairly motionless, only really answering one-word answers to questions from both the judge and his federally appointed defense attorney. And, at this point, the defense is not commenting on this case. But that's the latest here. His next court appearance, I should say, is going to be on July 24 -- Jim.",

The first of these incidents occurred at about 1:00 in the morning, local time, in the Gulf of Oman, when the U.S. Navy says that an Iranian Navy ship approached a commercial oil tanker. The U.S. Navy was watching this happen and deployed not only one of its own destroyers, but also an MQ-9 Reaper drone and a maritime patrol aircraft. And, at that point, according to the Navy, the Iranian navy vessel turned course, changed course and left the scene there. But it didn't end there. And if we can pull it video of the second incident, only three hours later, that's when the U.S. Navy says another Iranian vessel approached a different commercial oil tanker. That's the Iranian vessel right there. In a moment, this will zoom -- zoom out. You can see the oil tanker there in the top right of the screen. According to the U.S. Navy, personnel on board the Iranian vessel opened fire with small-arms fire, as well as crew-served weapons. And although it's quite difficult to see in the video, they are highlighted here in a moment. You can see what the Navy says are the ricochets of those shots off of the hull of the oil tanker there. Nobody was injured there, according to the U.S. Navy. But those shots that were fired at the tanker did impact and hit and cause damage very close to the crew living quarters on board the oil tanker. It was the same U.S. Navy destroyer that responded. And at that point, again, the Navy says the Iranian navy vessel turned and left the scene, happening just hours apart. Again, I'd mentioned this isn't the first time we have seen this. In April and May, Iranian navy vessels seized two oil tankers within a matter of days. It was after that, that the U.S. deployed more ships to the region and more aircraft to the region specifically to monitor this sort of activity in an absolutely critical waterway, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, certainly escalatory for coming from Iran, Jim.
