I'm Jim Acosta in for Dana Bash. We're going to break out of that hearing in Fulton County for just a short while because any moment now President Biden will speak on the reported death of one of Vladimir Putin's top critics Alexey Navalny. Vice President Kamala Harris, already making the case, making it clear she says that Russia is responsible. CNN's Arlette Saenz is with us from the White House. CNN's Matthew Chance is in London.

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, look, we haven't had official confirmation yet, at least from the family that they've been informed that Alexey Navalny is dead. I mean, that's come from the prison authorities in the Far North of Russia. Apparently, this leading prominent opposition figure in Russia hadn't complained to the court that it appeared in earlier about any health problems affecting him.But the prison authorities say that he went for a walk, his daily exercise sort of outside in the prison yard, and then complained to feeling ill and collapsed and lost consciousness. They called ambulance crews to the prison. But those ambulances have told Russian state television, that they tried for an hour and a half to revive Alexey Navalny, but to no avail, that he didn't respond. And so we're waiting now for that for the family to get a lawyer and get their representatives to that that prison colony in Russia's Far North, a very remote place with a very hard regime enforced there, to try and sort of get some sort of facts that they can digest and that they can accept about the fate of this prominent opposition leader. There's been not much response yet from the Kremlin. The Russian authorities have said that there are investigations underway, involving, obviously medical research and doctors to try and establish the cause of death. And until then, they essentially say, look, it's wrong to jump to conclusions and blame anyone for this death. But I think the truth is, Jim, that many people inside Russia and around the world are already laying blame for this at the sort of the door of the Kremlin, because, of course, Alexey Navalny was in Russian custody when he died. And of course, it wouldn't be the first time that - that, you know, he's - he's, you know, been severely affected or injured, you know, by his - by his opponents. And so look, I mean, this is, you know, something that is shocking, but it's not altogether surprising, given how many other opposition figures have met sticky ends in Russia.",

Arlette, obviously, the President is going to be speaking in just a few moments so we may have to break in as you're speaking.But tell us a little bit about how the administration has responded so far.

And you'll remember that she gave some remarks, the - the wife of Alexey Navalny gave some remarks at the Munich Security Conference, where she said that if this is true, that Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be punished.Now back in 2021, President Biden face to face warned Putin about what would happen if Navalny was to die while he was in prison. The president told reporters in Geneva shortly after his meeting that he told Putin that there would be devastating consequences were Navalny to die while he was in Russian prison. The big question now is how exactly the U.S. and its allies would respond. We've seen the U.S. impose these sanctions alongside allies throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So question is, could there be additional sanctions. Almost certainly anything that would be built as a response likely would be done alongside allies. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan earlier today said that they would be consulting with various countries and then just determining the steps forward. But the White House today is watching these reports with a lot of concern. And pretty soon, we'll hear from President Biden about his thoughts whether they've received any official confirmation, but also if he could outline any action, response that the U.S. might take in this matter.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, as you know, among Trump's many legal issues, this case here in New York, this is a civil fraud trial, this is the most personal. This is something that strikes at the heart of his family business and his identity as a successful businessman. Now, last fall, Judge Arthur Engoron found Trump liable for fraud, finding that he had lied about the value of some of his assets to get more favorable terms from banks and insurance companies.Then what followed was a month long trial. And you may remember, Trump attended much of that trial. He even testified along with three of his adult children, Ivanka, Eric and Don Jr. Trump was also very combative during these proceedings. He attacked the judge, he attacked the judge's clerk, he frequently attacked the Attorney General Letitia James, who brought this case. He even violated a gag order that just restricted him from attacking members of the court staff. That trial focused on some other charges and possible penalties. And here the New York Attorney General is seeking a penalty of $370 million and wants to bar Trump from doing business in the state of New York. The so-called corporate death penalty is rarely enacted here in the state of New York, especially when there's not a clear victim. That was one of the lines of Trump's defense that no one really lost money here and they continued doing business. But this is why Trump is watching this so closely, Jim. I mean this is a case, you think about it hundreds of millions of dollars, in addition to the tens of millions of dollars the jury just awarded E. Jean Carroll. This is a case that potentially, depending on what the judge decides today, could drain his coffers and again possibly prevent him from doing business in the state.",

She was asked a great deal about cash. Nathan Wade was asked about cash. I mean, cash apparently rules everything around us. OK?

The evidence was powerful, substantial damages of disgorgement. Perhaps the corporate death penalty, take away the business certificates. And Jim, it's very powerfully connected to that Alvin Bragg case, because one is a civil fraud case. But Alvin Bragg has said, he's prosecuting Donald Trump for fraud in making these hush money payments that corrupted an election, that it's an election interference case. Because if Donald Trump had not made those payments, another sex scandal after Access Hollywood could have changed the outcome of that election. So New York has not been kind to Donald Trump.
