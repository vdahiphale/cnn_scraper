That testimony would have been about what happened after the 2020 election leading up to January 6th, all of those conversations he directly would have had with Donald Trump, the president at the time, at a time when Donald Trump was pressuring him to overturn the vote. Pence refused to do so.Pence has also spoken about those conversations publicly. He's written about them in his book that he has been on a tour about now. He's talking about them regularly. But never before has an investigation, has a grand jury and have prosecutors gotten Pence under oath to reveal exactly what he thought, what he felt, and what was said between him and Donald Trump on those crucial days, part of this investigation. So this is a really significant moment in the January 6th criminal investigation being led by Special Counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department. It is also quite a momentous moment in history. There has never before been a vice president called to testify under subpoena about the president they served alongside. That didn't happen in Watergate with Richard Nixon. It didn't happen in Whitewater with Bill Clinton, which both had very active grand juries. So this is different. It also is a very crucial moment, putting Mike Pence here, because the Justice Department had to fight for this testimony. They went to court over this. Donald Trump tried to block the testimony. He tried to limit what Pence could say about the direct conversations. He lost those court battles. Mike Pence also went to court to fight on this and did not want to testify under subpoena, but he did get a little bit of leeway from the court, being able to protect what he was doing when he was the presiding officer on January 6th. But today, that federal grand jury did hear from Mike Pence for more than five hours, one-on-one. The grand jurors would have been able to ask him questions. They would have been able to piece him into the investigation, a very active investigation that they have heard from many, many witnesses on. And now, the prosecutors will take that testimony and see how it fits, try and fit it into potential charges as they look toward the future. It will become, at least, part of the record of what will not be known about January 6th to the Justice Department and potentially to the public later on. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.In Jerusalem, tens of thousands of right-wing protesters have rallied in front of Israel's Parliament, the Knesset, in favor of the government's widely-criticized plans for an overhaul of the judicial system. After 16 weeks of nationwide protests against the controversial overhaul, this was the first mass turnout of public support in favor of the reforms, which aim to weaken the independence of the Supreme Court and empower lawmakers to overturn certain court rulings. Here's CNN's Hadas Gold, reporting in from Jerusalem. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "For months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets of Israel to protest against the judicial overhaul plan the Israeli government has put forward. That would give unprecedented power in the hands of the Israeli Parliament over the Supreme Court.But this protest is something different. These protesters, they are in favor of the judicial reform. They say their voices have not been heard as much in the Israeli streets, and so that's why they're coming out here in front of the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli Parliament, because they want their voices heard by the Parliamentarians. They want these reforms to pass. They want these reforms to go through. They say that this is what they voted for in those November elections. They say the right-wing parties won the majority, and this is what they want heard. For the people out here, they say this, for them, is democracy. They want more power in the hands of the people. Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had suspended the legislative process on these reforms after the most massive general strike in Israeli history. But the Israeli Parliament is coming back into session next week. Some of the right-wing ministers set, no matter what, these reforms will come back on to the table, no matter what the negotiations might be happening behind the scenes. And for these protesters here, they say that is what they want to happen. They say, no matter what, it is their votes that won the majority in November, and they want these reforms done now.

Your passion and patriotism moves me deeply.\" To be fair, this was one at the, if not the biggest right-wing protest since, what, the Gaza disengagements back in 2005, even though Israel now has the most right-wing conservative government in the history. it seems many on the right are still not happy with that. So walk us through how this all plays out, what they want and where this is now heading.",

It's not just people who are opposed, right? We've had 16 weeks, where you've had about two and a half percent of the Israeli population that weekly have been coming out to protest against the judicial reform. And now, you have a few hundred thousand, whether it's 200 or 300, it does not really make a difference at the end of the day. This was a show of force and the largest, as you said, and maybe 20 years almost at the right coming out to protest and to show its support of something that the government is doing. So this is what they're doing, and the question really comes down to, OK, what are they going to do with this force now? How is it going to translate into what the Knesset does when it comes back into session? Does this mean the judicial reforms are back on the table, or are the compromise talks being hosted by the president continuing?",

This is what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YARIV LEVIN, ISRAELI JUSTICE MINISTER (through translator): More than 2 million Israelis went out six months ago and voted in elections. They voted for judicial reform. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: OK. So \"The Times of Israel\" reported just after the election, \"the non-Bibi block grew its vote by 5 percent, to 2.33 million. The Netanyahu bloc grew by 11 percent to 2.36 million.\" So in other words, the Netanyahu coalition won the popular vote -- and this is all very dodgy, I know -- by 30,000 votes. It doesn't seem much of a mandate, given the incredible opposition to these reforms since the election, even lesser now. So is this -- is this turnout right now, is this big enough to try and claim that mandate, to try and reclaim the momentum for this coalition government to say that they do, in fact, have popular support?",

You know, once the talks, once the legislation, sorry, was suspended a few weeks ago, and the compromise and negotiations begin at the president's residence, you could have thought, John, that this would be an opportunity for protesters to say, OK, we're going to take a break. But they haven't taken a break.Every week, you're still getting hundreds of dozens of Israelis on Saturday nights who are taking to the streets of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Be'er Sheva, Netanya, across the country. It's not just isolated even to one city. They're continuing because, A, they feared that the legislation will come back. B, they're concerned with other issues about this government, right? We can't forget the fact that this is a very religious, right-wing radical government that is pushing other legislative agendas that are also something that the protesters who come from the center or the left have issues with. So those protests haven't gone away. And I think that that's the big storms right now, is how can Netanyahu walk this fine line, keep his coalition in check, not lose his government, but at the same time, not instigate greater protests and greater international pressure on him to stop what's happening?",
