Just ahead, Donald Trump makes his first key appointment as President-Elect, announcing the mastermind behind his campaign as his new chief of staff.And Russia's Vladimir Putin, says he's ready for dialog with Trump as fighting in Ukraine intensifies. And the Israeli Foreign Minister is traveling to Amsterdam after Israeli football fans were ambushed and beaten in what Dutch officials say was an antisemitic attack. Donald Trump is moving quickly to get his team in place for his new administration. Step one is naming a chief of staff who will run the White House. And he did that on Thursday, tapping Susie Wiles, a political operative who has been close to him for years and who was co-chair of his 2024 campaign. Trump praised Wiles earlier in the week when declaring victory in the presidential race.

      "sentences": "Well, look, she is a very loyal person, and has been very loyal to Donald Trump. She has been with him now for several years. She stuck by him, really, when he left the White House in disgrace, and then has maintained a very high-level position of power over the last several years. Of course, being at the top of that hierarchy throughout his campaign. And that's one of the key reasons Donald Trump had selected her. He knows that she has his back, that she is going to be loyal to him. And another thing as well is not only is she disciplined, but she also doesn't like the limelight.You just played that clip of Donald Trump on election night, and she -- he called her up to give remarks. She said, no, she wanted to hang in the back. That is something that Donald Trump also appreciates. Now, another key thing I would, you know, I think it's important to keep in mind with her, is that she has had this position of power for a long time within Donald Trump's orbit. And she's done so while also earning and keeping the respect of the people beneath her, not only in Trump world, but also people outside of, you know, MAGA politics, and that is something that is very hard to do. I cannot overstate enough how, if you look back in 2016 in his past campaigns, but also his time in the White House. It was very hard to keep your position of power for that long when you are in Trump world, but she has been able to do so. Now I think the part you read some of that quote about the clown car not wanting that to come to the White House. I think that's going to be a crucial thing when we look ahead to how she's actually going to operate once in the role and once he is sworn into office. One thing that Susie Wiles has done incredibly well is while she recognizes you can't control Donald Trump, you can control the people around him. She has very much tried to cut off access to some of the more controversial figures that have tried to line themselves to Donald Trump and get access to him. And we know that was a big problem for him his first time around, when he was in office, back following 2016. That's going to be a big goal for her as well. And so, I think, if you keep that in mind and how she's operated on the campaign, and her role really, in trying to insulate Donald Trump from some of the, you know, harsh rhetoric and the people who might be sowing seeds of doubt in his ear about certain things. That's going to be a key thing that she tries to do again, as we look to head to her in the White House.",

But for President Biden's part, so far, he really hasn't publicly engaged in any of this blame game or questioning that's been going on. When he spoke yesterday, he acknowledged the results of this election, saying that the election was secure and also stressing that he would engage in a peaceful transfer of power, something that was not afforded to him by Trump back in 2020. But the President also had this message for Democrats to continue to stay engaged moving forward. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But one thing Biden said in his speech was that it could take time for a lot of this to still go into effect.And in these final weeks that he is in office, part of the administration's goal will be trying to move forward on safeguarding some of those initiatives. He has said he wants to get additional aid to Ukraine before leaving office. He also is looking to implement a lot of the legislation that was passed relating to the CHIPS bill, infrastructure and other initiatives. So, for the Biden Administration, there will be a big focus in the coming weeks on trying to shore up that legacy, trying to safeguard some of these initiatives, especially at a time when President-Elect Trump has indicated he would try to undo many of the policies of the Biden Administration. Of course, another item to watch in the coming weeks is when exactly President Biden will be meeting here at the White House with President-Elect Trump, who yesterday said that he plans to have lunch with him shortly. The details for that date still being finalized, but it comes as the administration. The White House, is trying to stress that they will engage in this transition process and be helpful where they can.",

Of course, there was no debate about Ukraine joining NATO prior to Russia's full-on invasion of Ukraine. However, he is also now talking about what he calls a New World Order. What he's been talking about is sort of a multi polar world. He claims that there has been a world in the last more than 20 years that's been dominated by the United States, dominated by the West. And now he's claiming that he's sort of the centerpiece of a New World Order where there's other polls in the world that are also beginning to get strong. And of course, we've talked a lot about Russia's relations with China. We've spoken about Russia's relations with other countries as well. But one of the things that he keeps showcasing as sort of an alternative for what he believes is that Western domination is the BRICS group of countries, sort of up-and-coming economies at least many of them up and coming economies that are debating incident amongst themselves. And that group is, of course, getting larger. And he kind of seems to see himself as the galleons figure of that alternative world that is shaping up right now, that New World Order, as he puts it, which he believes will see Western countries, at least to a certain extent, sidelined at other countries coming up. He kept talking about in his speech that he gave about Russia now being a truly sovereign country. Of course, one of the things that we also have to take into account into all of that is that the Ukrainians at the same time saying that he needs North Korean soldiers to beef up his forces on the ground that there have indeed, now already been clashes between Ukrainian forces and North Korean troops in the Kursk region.",

And that's ultimately what the Fed Chair is trying to do, and he sort of reiterated that this time around. The irony also is that the one of the big factors that could change that, or at least make that complicated, is the President-Elect's own policies, with perhaps limits to immigration, with the tariffs that we've talked about now endlessly. And for that, we just have to wait and see. And by the way, the Fed is an independent body. The law is a little gray on this, but it would be Congress that gets to remove him, not the White House.

Again, he left the door open to what happens next year. Even one journalist asked him whether there's a risk as a result of policy from the next government that they could even hike interest rates. He wouldn't be drawn on that, as you can imagine. But one of the most interesting things for me, Fred, ties to those exit polls that we got after the election with. Around 75 percent of Americans saying, look, they feel the same or worse off than they did at the beginning of the Biden Administration.

Yet, a lot of work still to be done here, containment is at 5 percent. Officials saying that overnight they were going to fly those helicopters. And the good news is that the weather conditions are improving. We no longer have red flag warnings everywhere. We now only have them in the mountains. So, you are seeing winds of 25 to 35 miles an hour, possibly 50 mile an hour wind gusts, but that, surprisingly, is still an improvement from 60 mile an hour wind gusts and red flag warnings in the high and in the low area. So, you have that wind, those Santa Ana winds, in addition to the very dry conditions here, and that's what fueled this fire so quickly, giving a lot of the people here essentially no time to leave their homes. I want you to take a listen to a conversation that my colleague Nick Watt had with one of the residents here, and this is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Some people chose to stay despite the evacuation orders. Officials saying they went to about 250 homes where they just refused to leave. They helped about another 400 homes get out quickly, and they said by the time they got there, about 800 of these homes had already evacuated. So again, they're telling people that it's just not safe to be here. It's not safe to return. There is some hope for the weekend. Conditions are expected to be a lot better starting at 11:00 a.m. when that Red Flag Warning expires, 11:00 a.m. local time. And then over the weekend, more humidity in the forecast.

Let's put it back up on the screen, if we could. This was sent to us by Telaya Jones (ph), a black woman in New Jersey. And you can see the texts have the person's name at the top of them, and then the one sent to her and several others, references picking cotton. It references slave catchers and plantations, and some of these messages are then signed at the end from a quote, Trump supporter, or from quote, Former President Trump. Now to be clear, the Trump Administration or the Trump campaign, I should say, has told several media outlets, Fred, that they have nothing to do with it. But it speaks to how many people are really on edge right now in these days since the election. Here is what a Colorado mother said after her 16-year-old son caught one of those texts. It seems we may not have that sought that sound there, but I can tell you, the NAACP President Derrick Johnson, also put out a statement saying, these messages represent an alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country, who now feel emboldened to spread hate and stoke the flames of fear that many of us are feeling after Tuesday's election results. And look, Fred, as I mentioned, investigations underway all across the country. It does appear that whoever is doing this may be using a service called text. Now it allows people to create phone numbers. That service text now has put out a statement saying that they are working with authorities trying to stop whoever is behind this. And the FBI also has put out a statement at this point saying they're aware of these messages. They're in contact with the Justice Department and other federal authorities. So, Fred, a lot of people are working on this right now, but they are still trying to get it under control and stop whoever is sending these really aggressive, harassing messages.",

It means that the investigators are advancing and they brought their results in front of a judge.

This means also that we don't know at this point if any of these three people are currently under detention, but we know that the investigation, Fredricka, is advancing.
