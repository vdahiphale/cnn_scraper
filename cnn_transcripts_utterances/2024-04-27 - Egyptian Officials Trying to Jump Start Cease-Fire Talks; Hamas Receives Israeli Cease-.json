For context, that's out of 13,000 people UNRWA employs in Gaza. Now on Friday, the U.N. said it closed one case because Israel provided no evidence. It's suspended three others because it says Israel didn't provide enough evidence. It's still investigating the eight remaining cases. The U.N. says seven other cases were brought to its attention in March and April. It has suspended one of those, pending additional evidence and is investigating the six others. U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken says, it's possible to roll out a two-state solution proposal for Israel and the Palestinians before a ceasefire in Gaza, along with a framework to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Here's what he told CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He defended some of the pro-Palestinian protests that have swept across college campuses in the U.S.He said, while there have been some instances of clear anti-Semitism, quote, \"protests in and of themselves are not anti-Semitic.\" And those pro-Palestinian protests that have gripped college campuses here in the U.S. have spread to schools in Europe. In the U.K. on Friday, students gathered outside University College London to protest the school's ties to Israeli academic institutions and other groups staged a pro-Palestinian protest in Warwick, in central England. In Paris, dozens of students remained at the prestigious Sciences Po University well into the evening. There was a strong police presence but the scene was peaceful. In the U.S., widespread protests on Friday that were mostly peaceful but now the University of Illinois is warning of consequences if demonstrators don't leave an encampment there. Columbia University's Senate has voted to create a task force to investigate allegations that the administration violated the privacy and rights of students and faculty when it called police to intervene. About 40 people were arrested in Denver after they tried to set up an encampment at the joint campus of three universities. Some Jewish students have joined the protests against the war in Gaza but others say they no longer feel safe or welcome on their campuses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm thinking specifically of a president facing protests from young people over an unpopular war in an election year. NAFTALI: I want to talk about one of the differences and then we can explore some of the similarities. One of the differences is that unlike the anti-apartheid divestment demonstrations of the 1980s, the expression of free ideas, that free expression did not create a sense of unease among other students. There were very few, very few, who opposed the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s. And those students didn't feel threatened by the language. And in the 1960s, the situation on campuses was actually more tense and, in some cases, much more violent. In fact, indeed, there was violence. And the student movements at some universities in the 1960s sought to stop what was going on at the school. They had to shut down the school to make it difficult for students to attend classes. We have not seen that now. What we have seen, though, is these crosscurrents in a very difficult period for many students. This is a post-pandemic student body, a student body that is particularly -- has been led to be very sensitive about secure spaces, where universities have been talking about micro- and macroaggressions. At the same time, some of the language that students are using to express their moral outrage of what they're seeing in the Middle East is understandably troubling and concerning for their fellow students in a way that was not the case in the student demonstrations of the 1960s and the 1980s. So university administrators are facing this very troubling and complicated situation where, on the one hand, universities must stand for freedom of expression. On the other hand, universities are intensely sensitive and have been more sensitive, I would argue, in the last 10 years or so about creating safe spaces for students. And this is, I think -- there's a combination of concerns that makes these demonstrations a bigger challenge for university administrators than certainly the demonstrations of the 1980s.",

Polls are sometimes tricky to assess in this country. But the trend is important and the trend is that the ANC is losing support. There has also been a splintering of the party, with its former youth league leader, in Julius Malema, a left-wing party, gaining ground as well as former president Jacob Zuma, likely to also contest the election and potentially bleed votes away from at least one key province. So if the ANC loses its simple majority or over 50 percent it could be forced to form a coalition and many feel there could be tense or at least interesting times ahead for South African democracy.
