The attack, the counterattack on Gaza, looking for Hamas, looking to annihilate Hamas, has gradually and now in an accelerated fashion, really started to worry everybody who's watching from outside. Because there is a notion of proportionality, most people who are looking in from the outside, including in the United States, including in the administration, are very concerned that it is rapidly becoming disproportional. You know, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza is run by Hamas, but they have always put out the death figures. And they're in the 9000 range right now, just above. And this is more than any other of these conflicts combined, and some 3000 at least of those are children. And I've been talking to the U.N. head. He was in there for the first time yesterday. Philippe Lazzarini of UNRWA, you know, talked about UNRWA schools being targeted, scores of dead, his own workers there, U.N. workers, more than 70 have been killed. And you see these children and you see how it's inflaming the world. I mean, there are demonstrations all over the place. So yes, I think the United States is concerned that the moral high ground could rapidly be lost. And you can see even in the U.S., in the President's own party, senators have come out now some to call for a ceasefire. You know, Secretary -- Biden in Israel with President Herzog, with Netanyahu, then again in Jordan with the King and the foreign minister is trying to call for a humanitarian pause.",

You remember all of that, all of that blowback.Additionally, people are very, very concerned. People like Samer Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister. People like the U.S. administration. People like European and other nations. What is the plan? Let's say you can get rid of, destroy Hamas. What is the plan next? What is the actual battle plan and what happens next? And many, many of Israel's allies, the important ones who give a lot of support, want to know that now, because this also is crucial for the future and how this all plays out. And remember, even President Biden and American officials have been saying, remember, do not make the mistakes that we did after 9-11 going into Iraq. The blowback was severe. The war was relatively easy, and I hate to use that word, but it was a three-week war. Saddam Hussein was you know, dispatched, but it was afterwards when they cast away very carefully drafted post-war plans, and it created ISIS, and it created just the most terrible blowback that we're still suffering from right now. And that region will continue to suffer if the world doesn't help put it back together again and rebuild Gaza, rebuild the West Bank or whatever, and make sure there's a political track going forward that ends this once and for all, because it will continue.",
