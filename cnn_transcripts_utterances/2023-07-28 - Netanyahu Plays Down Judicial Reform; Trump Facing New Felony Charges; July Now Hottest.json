Earlier this year, the court ruled that it was extremely unreasonable for Aryeh Deri to serve as a minister within Netanyahu's coalition government.

For example, on the court -- on the decision that we passed unreasonableness, understand what that is. It's like the court can nullify a decision, any decision by the government, by the executive, by saying it's unreasonable. Not because it's illegal, not because they're using other checks that they have, plenty of things they could do. They can nullify an appointment, like the Supreme Court would be able to nullify an appointment by President Biden. Not by saying that there is a conflict of interest, that exists today in Israel. That it's under process, that existed in Israel. That it's not proportional, that exists in Israel. But just by saying that we don't think this appointment is reasonable.

Once for bribery, another time more recently for tax evasion.This will allow him to be reappointed to the cabinet. But I think it's bigger, right? The prime minister tries to talk about this like he did with Wolf Blitzer as a minor correction to democracy. He referred in a different interview to the protesters, as you mentioned, as being silly. But Israelis know because of how this was rolled out in January as just one piece of a much larger package that this law might not be the end of democracy.

But those who basically decide his fate within that coalition government, those very far right-wing and, you know, religious part of the coalition, they want the rest of this package to go forward and this is just the beginning. So, when the prime minister comes out and says, oh, it's just a minor tweak, you know, that seems to be incredibly disingenuous at best.Katz:  Yes. Well, you're a hundred percent right, John, in your analysis here that the prime minister doesn't want this, right? He might have wanted it in the beginning, maybe it would have been to help his corruption trial. Let's remember that he himself is standing trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. So, it could be that some of the corrections originally, or changes that they wanted to do with, for example, how we appoint our Supreme Court justices, which is in the meantime been shelved, that might have potentially helped his trial. But after the big eruption of these protests just a few months ago, five or six months ago, he realized let's put this to bed. This is not in my interest. But his partners in the coalition, those very extreme far-right partners, they want this for ideological reasons. They want this because they really want to see the balance in Israel. The balance between the judiciary and the legislature and the executive branch. They want to see that change. And Netanyahu is something of a hostage to them because Israel's government is the system, you are a coalition system. And if you do not give your partners what they want, they always have the potential to bring down your government. And because of his trial, once again, he wants to stay prime minister. So, he needs to keep this government in place so he could stay prime minister, continue to fight his trial from the seat of prime minister but that means, he also has to keep on giving these partners what they want.",

I mean, there's no question that much of the Republican electorate has bought his argument that they are going after me because I am defending you and that this is all a politicized, and it was pulling out this week from this project of Bright Line Watch which is a collaboration or a consortium of political scientists. You know, only a quarter of Republicans think he violated the law in the classified documents case, and its half of that who think he violated the law either on January 6th or on his part to overturn the election. But we do know from other polling, consistently in the spring and particularly several polls that have been done by NPR, PBS, Marist that a majority -- a significant majority of everyone who is not a Republican believes he should not be president again if he is convicted of a crime.

Well, ovua to those days. First quarter, the Eurozone had negative economic growth, while the U.S. had revised upwards two percent. June unemployment 6.5 percent for the Eurozone, compared to three percent for the United States. And June inflation, 5.5 percent versus three percent for the United States.So, there's a lot of other indicators in the Eurozone which show economic activity is slowing. And the language from the ECB seems to be less aggressive on rate hikes. So, what is happening in Europe? Why are those rate hikes being less affected in bringing down inflation while also, at the same time, being a much bigger break on the economy?",

You know, if you think about the things -- you know, there are many reasons inflation has been rising globally but a couple of them are energy hikes and food prices.

It was obviously much more impacted by the war in Ukraine that way. Same again with food shortages and we've seen, you know, more ripples in that arena recently, you know, with some of the loss of the Ukrainian grain. One of the things that I've been watching closely, you've seen more evidence of corporate price gouging in Europe, actually, in recent months, than you have in the U.S. And frankly, I'm not sure what that's about. But I know policymakers have been watching it closely. So, Europe is just, kind of, in a perfect storm. It doesn't have the consumer demand of the U.S. but it has some of the inflationary factors.

There are new fires in different countries that keep cropping up.In Greece, the focus has really shifted to fires on the mainland. Small fires in central Greece and near Athens. And the concern is the strong winds that are fanning the flames. So, authorities there are continuing to monitor these and trying to put out these fires. On the Greek Island of Rhodes, that's been one of the hardest hit by these ferocious fires, they are still battling the flames. But the situation appears to have really improved, but the damage, death and destruction left by these fires is just heartbreaking. One of Greece's top experts is telling us today that this is the most destruction from forest fires in the month of July Greece has seen since 2010. In Rhodes, they estimate that 10 percent of land there has been destroyed. Absolutely devastating. And the worry, of course, that this is far from over. There are still weeks to go, weeks ahead of what is on track to be the hottest summer ever recorded. And we've heard the warnings that these prolonged and extreme and intense heat waves that create the conditions for these wildfires to spread -- this is the new normal. Following the release today of this report by the E.U.'s Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization announcing that July is set to be the hottest month ever recorded. And almost certainly, they say, the warmest in human history. We heard from the U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, these really strong words and stark warnings, saying that the era of global boiling has arrived. Climate change is here. It is terrifying, and this is just the beginning, he says. But he says, it is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees and to avoid the very worst of climate change but that can only happen with dramatic, immediate climate actions.
