Another concern from officials and what's going to be worked on for the next several hours until landfall is all the debris that was left behind from Helene. Just to get to where we are now, neighborhood about four minutes away from us, we're seeing piles of debris still in front of homes and apartment complexes. And a big concern with that is when we do see those winds pick up and come in from Milton, a lot of that debris could fly in the sky and become a dangerous projectile. If not, it could just impede the roads for first responders and also other electric crews. So there's still an ongoing effort to try and pick up a majority, at least, of that debris.

The bombardment has really intensified in Southern Lebanon, as well as here in the southern suburbs of Beirut and in the east of the country. The IDF also announcing today that they are sending in one more division, the 146th division, to also take part in these ground incursions, these operations that we have been seeing over the past week. And Hezbollah today launching a massive barrage of rockets targeting Israel, Haifa, and the Upper Galilee. Much of that was intercepted, but there were two direct hits.

But President Trump has been offered the October 23 date by CNN in terms of appearing and having another presidential debate. Kamala Harris has agreed to it. Trump has said no. CNN is giving a deadline of this Thursday for Donald Trump to give his final answer. What more can you tell us?",

Now, those were done away with. So then it became this sort of free for all where any network could pitch themselves to try to host a debate. And so CNN has issued another offer for a debate. CNN, of course, hosted the debate in June between President Biden and former President Trump. And they hadn't heard yet from President Trump. President Trump has sort of said, you know, unofficially, like, he's not going to do it, he's not going to do another debate. But CNN is now trying to get an official formal answer from former President Trump about whether he will participate in this debate. Vice President Harris has accepted. And if you remember, after that ABC debate, the first matchup between Harris and Trump, her team said, that was fun, let's do it again. And so now CNN is saying to essentially President Trump's campaign, since Harris has already accepted, that they have a deadline this Thursday by noon to say whether he will participate, whether both campaigns will participate. Because also keep in mind, it does take time to put these things together. They can't say they're going to do it one day before. There needs to be sets built. Vendors need to be prepared. Spin rooms and the like need to be set up for this to happen. Now the question is whether President Trump will be able to resist. Because keep in mind, we've seen a lot of Kamala Harris over the last 24 hours or so. She's been dominating the airwaves. This is an interesting time to try to pitch President Trump. Maybe you want to appear before what will likely be the largest audience you'll see before the election.",
