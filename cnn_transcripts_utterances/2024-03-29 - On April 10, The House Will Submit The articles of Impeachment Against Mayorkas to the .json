And it's very unclear, given the fact that there's now going to be a one vote margin in the House. How they would actually convince all of their Republican members to be united in this effort. I think that this question of whether or not Biden is going to come before Congress, I mean, just think about what a spectacle that would be, Sara. You already heard the White House arguing that this is really a last-ditch effort. Really a sham as House Republicans continue to struggle to find momentum in their impeachment inquiry. Sara.",

Good to see both of you. So Bakari, you first. I mean, a Biden testimony is probably not top of mind this morning for the president. Instead, you know, that huge fundraising haul of $26 million last night here in New York. So, what kind of momentum does this give his reelection campaign? Was there something said some, you know, inspiration inside or perhaps even the demonstrators outside, you know, concerned about Palestinians, which will shape Biden's messaging this point forward? BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Yes, there's no way to put a damper on what the president was able to accomplish yesterday. What you saw was a party unified. I mean, you had Bill Clinton, you had Joe Biden and you have Barack Obama, all together raising money for a unified effort to defeat Donald Trump. I don't think you can pay George W. Bush in any amount of money to stand next to Donald Trump. You have a fractured party. You have Nikki Haley who garnered a third to 40 percent of the Republican voters as she was running her failed bid in the primary election. And so, you have a unified party versus a fractured party. And even more importantly, one of the things that you pointed to was $26 million is, I guess, the older folks say, it's nothing to shake a stick at, right?",

The new numbers out show that PCE, this is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, up by two and a half percent year over year. That is a touch hotter than it was the month before, but we knew that was going to happen.This is right in line with expectations, and it reflects higher gas prices. Month over month, 0.3 percent, that's actually slightly cooler than we expected. Why do we care about this number? One, because the Fed watches it very, very carefully, but also because it impacts all of our wallets, right? The higher inflation it is, the more financial pain that we feel. Let's look at the line chart to see the trend here, because that's really important. As we know, inflation spiked after 2020. This metric got above seven percent at one point, above seven percent. Look at this improvement all the way down to two point a half percent. Now the Fed wants two percent, two and a half is not two percent. But this is among the coolest inflation readings that we've seen in the last three years.

How they are going to be protected from potential attacks from Hamas and from other terrorist groups who are operating in Gaza. That is something that U.S. Senators have been pressing the White House and the Pentagon on for weeks now.

And of course, there are risks involved in that. But there are still a lot of questions here. about who is going to be distributing the aid once it actually gets to the shore. The U.S. has said repeatedly that the U.S. military is not going to have any boots on the ground in Gaza, but still, there are questions about how they're going to distribute it, including whether local Palestinians are going to be doing it, for example, with oversight from a U.N. body. And importantly, how close the Israel Defense Forces are going to be to that entire process, making themselves, as well, of course, as the U.S. military, a potential target, hard target there for terror groups who want to attack the U.S. and its allies, Fred.
