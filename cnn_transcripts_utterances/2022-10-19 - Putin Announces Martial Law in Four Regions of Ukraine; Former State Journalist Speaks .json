The Russian president making that declaration today at a Security Council meeting in Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  In this regard, let me remind you that in the Donetsk Peoples Republic, the Luhansk People's Republic, as well as in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions, martial law was in effect before joining Russia. Now we need to formalize this regime within the framework of Russian legislation. Therefore, I signed a decree on the introduction of martial law in these four subjects of the Russian Federation.

It's a sign of just how desperate President Putin is yet again, because this simply doesn't add up to what the reality, which is that Russia simply does not have full control of these four regions. In fact, you mentioned Kherson. It's one of these four regions. There are Russian forces are being pushed back by Ukrainian counteroffensives. They're being forced to evacuate people living in the Russian occupied regions, tens of thousands of them, because this counteroffensive is coming so quickly, pushing up on Russian forces. The only thing it could potentially change on the ground in those Russian occupied areas is, as you heard, from President Putin there, this decree will give local officials more power. What concerns Ukrainian officials about that is that could mean cracking down on local populations, trying to impose the reality of Russian rule. Potentially, one Ukrainian official brought this up, potentially trying to draft people in those regions back into the fight. But it shows how few conventional options there really are on the ground left for President Putin now. When you look at these massive, staggering losses, none of the steps that President Putin has taken in the last few weeks have actually reversed that reality -- Becky.",

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  They mostly come and recover but most of times they are recognizable by some signs. They come in, ask about patients, if they want to use force. We have to answer them. Most of the time we use fake names or (INAUDIBLE) to help them so that they will not be recognized by (INAUDIBLE) forces. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Security services are cracking down on identifying people by their horrific injuries they're inflicting on protesters. And it's not just at hospitals. Protesters say ambulances are being used to detain people. In this video, people attack an ambulance with security forces inside. The narrator says protesters are saving the girl.

Even if she did resign, there is no clarity as to how the next PM would be put into place without again going to the membership and having a very unedifying leadership contest once more. So it seems that apathy, fatigue and also a lack of options is what's preserving her in place. She seems to have bought herself enough time to get to that Halloween, next financial statement and event. Still, the MPs I speak to don't really believe she will be around for Christmas. All of this is just adding to the instability that Britain finds itself in, because all other issues about the economy and questions about Britain's place in the world are subsumed by the big question. Who will the prime minister be in just a few months?",

Of course, invading a island is a very difficult undertaking. Some analysts say it's even harder than what Russia has been trying and failing to do in Ukraine. One thing you do need is a world-class navy. If you look at the numbers, Becky, just the pure numbers, this is from the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence in 2020. China was on track to have 63 more battle force ships than the U.S. Clearly, they have got the numbers. But the question is, do they have the know-how? Do they have the determination? And are they really willing to put so much at risk to try to fulfill Xi Jinping's vow to reunify with Taiwan, through force, if necessary?",
