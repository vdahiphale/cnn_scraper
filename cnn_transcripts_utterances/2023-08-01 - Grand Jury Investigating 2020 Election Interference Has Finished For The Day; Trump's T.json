      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. Back in the anchor chair.We begin today in our law and justice lead. As the federal grand jury investigating efforts by former President Trump and his top allies to try to overturn the 2020 election, that grand jury has finished meeting for the day. The big question, will we learn in the next few minutes or hours if the grand jury here in Washington, D.C. has, in fact, indicted Donald Trump or anyone else involved in the plot to overturn the election. This would mark the third criminal indictment against the twice arrested, twice impeached former president of the United States and current front-runner by far for the Republican presidential nomination. There is quite a bit here that we just don't know about any potential charge, and it is unclear when or if the federal grand jury here in D.C. has even voted. But based upon what we have reported over the last three years, potential charges in special counsel Jack Smith's probe may relate to Trump and his allies efforts to pressure state election officials, their disinformation about the election, creating fake slates of state electors and potentially inciting the deadly January 6 Capitol insurrection, among other potential charges. Just yesterday, the former president posted on his social media website that he expects criminal charges to come any day now. Let's get right to CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez who is following all of the latest developments. Evan, how do we expect to get word if and when this indictment is handed up to the judge from the grand jury? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jake, we have a team inside of the courthouse. They're watching the magistrate proceedings. Typically the way this works is the grand jury votes on an indictment, the foreperson and the prosecutor hand up the indictment to the judge, often what they do is you don't know the name of the person, but they have the initials of that person who is being indicted is read in open court. Today could be a lot different. We certainly have seen in for example in the Mar-a-Lago case in Miami, where they did it behind the scenes, away from reporters who were watching every single court proceeding. So that could happen in this case as well. We do know, as you pointed out, the grand jury has left, but the foreperson stayed behind. We have not seen that person leave the courthouse. So, that's one indication possibly that there is still more action to be taken by the foreperson on behalf of the grand jury and prosecutors in Jack Smith's office, Jake.",

They've been waiting tor this since they got the target letter and it's something that they have been putting together, their response. We're told that there are paper statements and videos and they plan to roll out surrogates all over conservative media to really make the case for the former president. And as you remember, last Thursday, they expected, they believe that there was a potential indictment coming down.And then they were surprised by that Mar-a-Lago superseding indictment. That is not the case today. They do feel like they are prepared now, they do expect this to happen. And we do know that Donald Trump has been having conversations with his closest allies on Capitol Hill since he received that target letter talking to them about how they're going to defend him, to come to his defense when it comes to January 6. And it's interesting, talking to many of this advisers, they really believe that they have a playbook down on how to respond to these indictments. They believe that it starts with these fundraising emails and then it turns into videos, and in which Trump is directly addressing voters. And they do think that it will lead to a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. But as we have reported, multiple times, even if these advisers believe the short-term gain is there for a primary, there are still larger concerns about what these legal implications will mean for a general if Donald Trump is to be the nominee, and as you mentioned he is still leading in the polls, on whether or not he could actually go through a general election with all of these looming over him. So, a lot of questions. But again, they do feel in this one particularly prepared. They have statements ready, ready to hit the airwaves to go to Donald Trump's defense.",

So, Trump could face charges related to any number of a variety of actions having to do with the 2020 election, just to name a few. There is the pressure campaign that he and his allies launched on state election officials. The fake state elector plots, as well as potential charges for inciting that riot on the Capitol on January 6.

Or is it bigger than that? Is it more expensive than that?Because they have looked at a lot of different aspects here, from fundraising, to the fake electors, to Trump's mindset in and of itself. So, there is a big potential for a lot to come out of this. Obviously, conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding, that Reconstruction Era civil rights thing that looked at, also reference in the target letter. That's what they're looking for. But I think the question is also how much bigger can be it? Because from the target letter in the documents case to the charges, it was much bigger than we believe.",

He talked about the wall, and expelling Muslims and all this stuff, I didn't agree with, but those were at least issues. Now it is simply a cult of personality. And he has solidified an iron grip on one of the two great parties in America. It does mean Biden's work is cut out for him. It means any Democrat is going to cede 43 to 45 percent of the vote to the Republicans. The fact that Republicans have rallied around this cult of personality is really quite amazing.
