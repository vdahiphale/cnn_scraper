A warning, these distressing pictures taken a few hours ago show the aftermath of a strike on Rafah. There were children among the casualties. We will have more details in a moment. And these are live pictures from the Israeli border with Gaza where there is intense fighting in the City of Khan Yunis. The IDF says it has surrounded the house of Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar. Also at this hour, Donald Trump is expected to head to court in New York as his defense team, call that final witness to the stand in what is the Former President's civil trial for fraud. Well, fierce fighting reported in Gaza as second largest City of Khan Yunis exactly two months after the massacre in Israel that sparked the country's war with Hamas. Israel's Prime Minister says troops in Khan Yunis have encircled the home of Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar, pegged as one of the masterminds of the October the 7th terror attack. Well, the IDF suggests he is hiding in underground tunnels. Here's more from Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Other than that it's purely symbolic. I mean, there's no one who believes that Yahya Sinwar is actually at home. And you heard the Prime Minister there saying that he could easily escape. But they are confident that it is just a matter of time. Now, the IDF has said that Sinwar is believed to be underground. They of course aren't saying where? And he is the number one target on their list. But this really does speak to the expansion of Israel's military operations from the north into the south, forcing so many more civilians to go even farther south. But Becky, I think at this two month mark, it is worth noting that aside from Sinwar, you also have the top military leaders in the AL Kassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif, and Marwan Issa, who are also still out there. They have not been found and killed by Israel's forces. Israel says that they have killed several 1000 Hamas militants and taken out a good number of the midlevel commanders, if you will. But of course, this is not just about the number of kills that Israel has. They're also trying to dismantle Hamas infrastructure and their goal of eradicating Hamas. But what exactly that means still remains unclear, Becky and that's what we've heard from U.S. officials is that while Israel is saying that this could be a long conflict as they look to eradicate Hamas what exactly that means? Israel has not said specifically, Becky.",

In fact, so many people were wounded they had to drive them up to the only functioning Hospital in -- Bella further North of Rafah. And that is just one strike among many, many. The Palestinian Health Ministry has not put out any recent numbers on those who have died have been killed, simply because they can't -- they're not in a position to collect that information. In some parts of the Gaza Strip, there's no communication available. But above and beyond that, is the problem of lack of shelter because 85 percent of the population has been displaced, many of them are essentially sleeping in the open in tents that are just thin plastic sheeting, made of thin plastic sheeting in areas where there's no water, no electricity, no medical care. And also we heard from the World Food Programme that in Northern Gaza, more than 90 percent of the population is starting to cut down on the amount of food they eat, because they cannot replenish what they have. In the southern part of Gaza 80 percent more than 80 percent are in a similar situation, more than 40 percent of those in northern Gaza have gone a day and a night without eating. In some cases, that percent is more than 30 percent in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. And because of the small number of trucks that are being allowed into Gaza, from Egypt, and of course, they all need approval from Israel. No aid is being distributed in the central part of the Gaza Strip, or the northern part of this Gaza Strip. And this is why all of these aid agencies UN, \"Doctors Without Borders\" and Oxfam are saying that the situation is catastrophic, that Israel needs to stop military operations now because as bad as it is, at the moment, it's only going to get much, much worse Becky.",

So today we'll be -- there'll be hearing from a professor of accounting from New York University, and that's part of Trump's defense in this case. He is accused of inflating the value of his properties to get better rates on loans and insurance. And part of their defense is that there was no intent to defraud anyone. And this accounting professor is expected to testify that the way that they came up with the values for some of these properties was in line with U.S. accounting rules, and we expect this professor to be on the stand today. Now Trump has not been -- he's been at this trial nine times. But he hasn't been here in a month. The last time he was here was when he was testifying when he was called by the New York Attorney General's team. But this testimony, as I said, is key to the defense. And this is the business that Trump has built. This is the business and his reputation as a successful businessman that he campaigned on to get to the White House the first time. So this is central to his identity in a sense of just you know, this importance of this business. And this allegations that it is a fraudulent business. So he is here the last time he will see the judge before he comes to testify again on Monday. This time, he will be testifying in his own defense as their final witness to make their last impression on the judge. Now, this is a trial before a judge so it's not with a jury, which makes it a little unusual.

The Iowa Caucuses, which you set out,it's a series of groups of small meetings across the state where Republicans gather and express their preference on who they would like to support. And the reason it's important this year is because it's really going to send a signal if Donald Trump is going to sort of be on a march to the nomination or if someone may slow his rise. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has spent millions and spent so much time they're trying to focus basically all of his efforts on Iowa. In years past history will show for example, on the Democratic side, Barack Obama likely would have never become the nominee and gone on to be President without the Iowa Caucuses, why? He delivered a surprising defeat of Hillary Clinton way back then in 2008. So it can humble front runners it can -- it can sort of elevate challengers. So that's why Iowa is important and because it's first on the calendar on the night of January 15th.",

And here we're seeing the players and the fans with the upset the despair sadly, Becky that very quickly turned to anger which was then taken from inside the stadium outside onto the streets of Sao Paulo. Cars and buses were put set on fire riot police were brought into the mix.
