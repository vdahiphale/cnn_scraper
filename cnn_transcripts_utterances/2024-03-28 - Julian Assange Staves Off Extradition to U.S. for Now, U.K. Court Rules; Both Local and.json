      "sentences": "Now the high court in London on Tuesday ruled that the WikiLeaks founder cannot be immediately extradited to the UnitedStates. Instead, American authorities must first offer assurances about his treatment including over his First Amendment rights and protection from the death penalty. Now, they`ve been given three weeks to do so. If the U.S. fails to give these assurances, Assange would be allowed to appeal his extradition at a further hearing in May. If however, the U.S. does provide the requested assurances, there will be a further hearing to decide if those assurances are satisfactory and to make a final decision on leave to appeal. Now, in the event that the appeal is denied, Assange`s legal team has also vowed to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights which could also halt his removal to the U.S. This is a battle which Assange has fought for the last five years from London`s Belmarsh prison. And of course, for seven years before that, while being holed up as a political refugee at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He is of course, being pursued by the U.S. authorities for what they say is the endangerment of lives by publishing confidential military records supplied by former army intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning in 2010 and 2011. Speaking outside the high court, Assange`s wife, Stella described her husband as a political prisoner and also called on the Biden administration to drop the case entirely. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Getting there involves driving through either gang-controlled or gang-contested territories. It`s dangerous and it`s unpredictable. In armored vehicles, we saw that firsthand, and yet this is the only way out for some. The airport is shut down and many feel trapped. In recent days, the U.S. embassy began evacuating citizens who could make it to the embassy. Managing the safety of those evacuations is regional security officer, Steve Strickland. How does Haiti, how does Port-au-Prince today compare to your past 19 years? STEVE STRICKLAND, U.S. DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE, SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: There is nothing like Port-au-Prince. The security situations here are nothing like anything I have experienced before. I`ve spent time in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, in Africa, and the unique circumstances here, I`ve not seen a parallel to those in any other security environment that I`ve served.",

      "sentences": "Pop quiz, hot shot. How long did it originally take to build the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris?Around 10 years, around 50 years, nearly 100, nearly 200 years. If you said nearly 200 years, you are correct. Construction on the famous Parisian landmark began during the reign of King Louis VII in the year 1163 and was mostly completed by 1345. Back in 2019, a raging fire torched the historic Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Many were in shock to see the Parisian landmark engulfed in flames and feared that it would take decades to restore. Especially since this effort would be both intricate and expensive with estimates to rebuild the cathedral costing more than $760 million. But with generous donations from around the world and nearly 500 craftspeople working rigorously the past five years, the renovation is said to be 90% complete. Our Richard Quest gives us a peek inside as it`s expected to reopen to the public this December. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
