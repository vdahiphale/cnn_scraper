      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.A House Speaker scorned by his own party, Mike Johnson warning of the chaos if he is ousted, as he is heading for the mothership, Mar-a- Lago, to meet with the man, who just told his Conference, to defy him. And for the third time, this week, speaking of Donald Trump, it is not the charm for the former President, who was just denied another attempt to delay his first criminal trial. Plus, after Trump said abortion should be left up to the states, he's criticizing a state's abortion ruling. The Democrat, who is hoping to be Arizona's next senator, is our source tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. House Republicans erupted into complete chaos, again today, right in front of our very eyes, on the House floor. What is normally a pretty routine procedural move, ended up morphing into a disastrous defeat, for House Speaker, Mike Johnson. Johnson was handed that loss, in part by Donald Trump, who woke up this morning, and ordered his party, to kill legislation that would have extended an expiring warrantless surveillance law. Though there were already a few Republicans, who were against it, the former President all but in short, its defeat. The timing here really couldn't be worse, for Speaker Johnson, because like a large dark cloud, Marjorie Taylor Greene is threatening to oust him, as Speaker. Of course, we know it only takes one vote to start that process. No one knows it better than Kevin McCarthy. But Johnson is offering a warning of his own, to Marjorie Taylor Greene about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): She's colleague. I've always considered her friend. It doesn't serve our interest, I didn't think, to not fund the government and shut it down. That wouldn't be helpful and nor does a motion to vacate help us in that regard either. It would be chaos in the House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

If you put staying in the job, as your highest priority over principle, you will ultimately be a failure. So, I think he needs to get this FISA reform to the floor.

You need to talk about what you've done, to create the credentialing, to create the permission structure, to say what you're going to do. And I agree with Bakari. The Biden campaign needs this shift, and is shifting, to a forward-looking message about what he's going to do. Because these voters that you're talking about, are sitting there, looking at their gas bills, looking at their grocery bills, and saying, hey, this is hard, who's going to help me here? And they're going to make decisions in the presidential race, based on who they think is on their side. And so, every presidential reelection campaign is always trying to balance how much do you talk about what you've done, and how much do you talk about the future. And it is the hardest thing.

They're among more than 200 guests, who are at the White House, right now, taking in the live music of Paul Simon, at the glitzy White House State Dinner.The Bidens' official guest of honor tonight is the Japanese Prime Minister and his wife. They spared no expense, planning every detail meticulously as they do at these meals, transforming the state floor into a vibrant field of flowers to mimic a koi pond, also crafting a menu that blends American and Japanese flavors. The California roll-inspired starter, dry aged ribeye steak with a Shishito Pepper butter for the main, and a salted caramel pistachio cake covered in matcha ganache for the desert. My next guest knows exactly what it's like to plan these meticulous dinners. I got hungry, just reading that. He planned six of them. Our inside source is Jeremy Bernard, who is the White House Social Secretary under President Obama. And he joins me now. And it's great to have you here, Jeremy. I mean, just walk us through this. Because I think a lot of people have never obviously seen a State Dinner. I have, because I was lucky enough to cover the White House. But can you kind of just walk us through what's actually happening, when the moment is now finally here?",

And we'd go through step by step, every moment, from the arrival that morning, to their departure. Secret Service, the State Department, every, any department that has a role in the State Dinner, which is quite a few, would be at these meetings. And we would start weeks in advance. And as it got closer, we would actually do walkthrough. Someone would stand as where the President is. Someone would stand where the visitor is.

So, it was a process, even to OK each guest. And then, we would put them at different tables, or chairs -- with the first lady. State Department would look at it.
