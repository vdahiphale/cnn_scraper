      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. I'm standing on a rooftop looking out over Tel Aviv. It is just after 11And we're covering three major stories right now: the war here, the end to the chaotic speakership saga back in Washington, D.C., and former president Donald Trump in a stunning appearance on the stand today in his New York civil fraud trial. We're going to start with breaking news from Israel. It has been 18 days since the attacks by Hamas caught this country and most of the world by surprise. Just over an hour ago, from this rooftop, we heard explosions presumably from Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepting several rocks fired on Tel Aviv from Gaza and minutes ago they confirmed that four people were injured with something possibly shrapnel hitting this town of Rishon LeZion, a reminder that Hamas continues to try to kill as many Israeli civilians as they can with their rockets. They are just not able to do so because of the Iron Dome defense system. Meanwhile, this evening, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed this grieving nation, still mourning after Hamas's horrific October 7th terrorist attack where 1,400 Israelis were brutally murdered. Speaking in Hebrew, Netanyahu alluded to the massive intelligence and military readiness failures of his administration that day, saying, quote: Everyone will have to give answers including myself but that will only happen after the war, unquote. And meanwhile, there are roughly still 600 American citizens stuck in Gaza, amidst a full blown humanitarian crisis there for the 2.3 million Palestinians. The United Nations organization in Gaza said it will be forced to stop operations today due to a lack of fuel. Blocked from entering Gaza as Israel remains certain that Hamas will steal any fuel shipment news Gaza and use that fuel to launch its rockets into Israel. And kill innocent Israeli citizens. Humanitarian concerns have been echoed by Western allies who have called for a humanitarian pause in Israel's strike on Gaza. That suggested pause essentially just a rebranded term for a cease-fire which Israel is wholly opposed to given the 1,400 murders and more than 200 people still being held hostage by Hamas in their web of underground tunnels. All of this as another chapter unfolds, of course, as we mentioned earlier, in the complete and utter dysfunction in Washington, D.C. among House Republicans. This afternoon, after four candidates and 22 days of self-inflicted pain and paralysis, upon the entire chamber of the U.S. Congress and the legislative branch of Congress, and of course on the U.S. government and the U.S. people, Republicans finally named conservative Congressman Mike Johnson of Louisiana as speaker of House. And we're going to tell you more about Speaker-elect Johnson, or Speaker Johnson, rather, in a minute. But first, let's get to the big breaking news of the hour. Former President Trump fined $10,000 for violating a gag order again. The judge in Trump's New York civil fraud trial warning the former president today to, quote, don't do it again or it will be worse. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live outside the courthouse in New York City. And, Brynn, the judge issued the fine after Trump took the stand? What happened?",

Trump actually would have had the option here to take the Fifth and refuse to testify. But in this scenario, the judge could have used that against Donald Trump. And the second risk is precisely what happened. Donald Trump took the stand and the judge said, I find you non-credible. I don't believe you.

In fact, the judge went out of his way last time to warn Donald Trump, if you do it again, I could fine you more and I can at least theoretically imprison you.Now, I don't think that is likely and I think as you note, Jake, the financial amounts are not enough to deter Donald Trump. So the judge is going to have to engage in some sort of escalating deterrence here. And the judge said, my concern here is someone's going to get killed. So, I think the judge needs to be responding accordingly. I don't know that a $5,000 fine and a $10,000 fine are going to do it. TAPPER: Let's turn to the Georgia election subversion case where Donald Trump and 18 codefendants were charged with trying to over turn the state's 2020 election results and just into CNN, new exclusive reporting, Georgia prosecutors are considering plea deals with six additional codefendants, Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell, Ken Chesebro and Scott Hall have already pleaded guilty.

However, we do have to ask what is in the plea deals, because here is the reality now. We've seen four people plead guilty so far. All four of them were charged with being part of this massive racketeering enterprise, the goal was to steal the 2020 election, looking at a five-year minimum in prison.What they've been allowed to plead guilty to, none have had to plead guilty to racketeering, instead they've all pled to either very low level felonies or misdemeanors and not a single one them is going to do a day behind bars as a result of pleas. Now, are they going to cooperate in a way that's effective, that's useful to the D.A.? That remains to be seen. I mean, look at Sidney Powell. She admitted to this very conduct in Coffee County, but yet she's still out there spewing election fraud lies. So I don't know how viable a witness she's ultimately going to be. So, it matters, Jake, what's in the details of these plea deals an it is fair to question whether they're getting too lenient of a deal here.",

Officially, they're, of course, saying the same thing, this is a democratic judge who is trying to take away Donald Trump's First Amendment rights.But privately, there is a lot of questions about how exactly this is going to work and a lot of skepticism as to whether or not Donald Trump could actually abide by this gag order. You have to remember, that for years, Donald Trump's advisers and even more recently campaign advisers had been trying to manage his messaging. They know that is not possible. And remember, that is when Donald Trump believes that the people trying to manage his messaging have his best interest at heart which he does not believe in the case of this judge. Part of Donald Trump's strategy when it comes to his legal -- mounting legal peril is to play this out in the court of public opinion. That means taking every opportunity he can to talk to the media. That is why he's always going over to the cameras. That is why he's posting on Truth Social. He wants to create his own narrative around this and then again play this out in the court of public opinion, not in the courtroom. This severely limits his capabilities to do that. So whether or not he could actually abide by a gag order, that is a real question, even among his closest aides and advisers who have tried and tried to keep him on message often to only be left with their mouths dropped open when he said something that they cannot believe came out of his mouth.",

      "sentences": "So, there has been so much back and forth about this, Jake. The Israelis have been saying that Hamas actually holds hundreds of thousands of liters of fuel, but when we talk to humanitarian organizations, hospitals, the U.N. on the ground, they say this has actually now reached a crisis point. The World Health Organization saying that 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals are now essentially out of commission, eight of those because they have simply run out of fuel.The U.N. Relief and Works Agency that operates inside of Gaza has said previously that they would be forced to stop their operations tonight, earlier this afternoon speaking to CNN, they appeared to sort of calibrate that message slightly and said that if they one out of fuel, tonight or tomorrow, they will be forced to drastically reduce their operations. We've been in touch with a number of doctors and hospitals on the ground who say that they really are now on their last drops of fuel. And what is important to remember here, Jake, of course, is that because the electricity has been cut off, it's fuel that powers the generators. It's generators that then allow incubators, ventilator machines and crucially desalination plants because clean water is no longer accessible, people are drinking brackish water according to doctors on the ground. And that is leading to spiking of rates in disease, but also preeclampsia in pregnant women. And so, all of this really spiraling, making it clear that fuel is very much at center of efforts to try to get that aid in. But also appears to be deeply involved in a broader deal that may be surrounding the hostage issue or some kind of a possible humanitarian pause. Making it all that more complex and all that more dangerous for people on the ground who so desperately need to get it, Jake.",

They told us that they have never experienced that. In terms of Israel's allegation about half a million liters of fuel that Hamas holds, that is simply impossible for us to verify.
