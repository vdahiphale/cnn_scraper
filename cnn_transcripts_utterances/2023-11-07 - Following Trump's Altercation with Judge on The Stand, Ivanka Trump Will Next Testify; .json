Now, she is the third Trump child who will be testifying. Donald Trump Jr. said he didn't prepare the financial statements.

He -- his hubris really wouldn't allow him to take the path that his sons had taken, which is I really wasn't involved at all. He did. You're right. He admitted to weighing in on these valuations. In fact, he said that they were undervalued in some respects. My favorite was, you know, with respect to the square footage of his apartment, he said, well, maybe that was including the roof.So, he really, really you know, tried to defend these valuations while at the same time admitting that he had something to do with them. I think it was a wash in terms of his testimony. I don't think there were any like slam dunks yesterday with Tish James' case.

Usually, you know, you would see him try to sort of clean up some of that questionable testimony. You know, it could just be the fact that there was nothing more to give. The judge, after sort of that first, you know, back and forth in the morning, the judge did let him go on these soap bops, soliloquys, long rants.

      "sentences": "Well, good morning, John. The Second Amendment back before the high court this morning, a little over a year after the conservative majority issued a gun rights decision that really threatened restrictions on gun ownership nationwide.At the center of this case is a Texas man who was accused of domestic violence after an altercation with his girlfriend. He was then subject to a restraining order. And under federal law, people who are subject to restraining orders are prohibited from owning firearms. Now, this man then engaged in a series of subsequent shootings. Law enforcement searched his home and found multiple firearms. And now, he is challenging his conviction under federal law. And the Fifth Circuit, in the wake of that Supreme Court decision expanding gun rights overturned his conviction. Now, look, John, gun rights advocates will concede that this individual is not exactly who they want to make their case. This man is a drug dealer. He's been accused of domestic violence. And he engaged in series of very bizarre shootings, including just shooting into the air at a Whataburger after his friend's credit card was declined. But instead of focusing on his personal characteristics, they emphasize that this should require a conviction, not just a restraining order, but a domestic violence conviction to restrict anyone's gun rights. But it's also important to note that restraining orders are an important tool for law enforcement when it comes to combating domestic violence, which is a massive problem in this country. 70 women every month are shot and killed by an intimate partner, and women are five times more likely to die from domestic violence if their abuser has access to a gun.
