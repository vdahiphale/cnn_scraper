Look, Republicans across the spectrum do give Donald Trump credit for nominating three Supreme Court justices that helped to overturn Roe v. Wade. He gets credit for that. But the fact now that he is backpedaling on this important issue and softening his position to more of a general election issue -- that is, like, a key area of target for any of these candidates to go after him. Because evangelicals and the pro-life community in Iowa, and New Hampshire, and South Carolina do not look at abortion as a 'let's make a deal' issue.
