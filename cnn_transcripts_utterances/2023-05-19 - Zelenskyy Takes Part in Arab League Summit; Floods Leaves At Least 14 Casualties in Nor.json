The Ukrainian and Syrian Presidents are both attending the Arab League Summit in Saudi Arabia. Bashar al-Assad was warmly welcomed by regional heads of state after more than a decade of isolation following his ruthless crackdown on protesters that triggered his nation's civil war. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meantime, is urging those same leaders who have remained largely neutral over Russian aggression against his country not to look the other way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, there is there has been no love lost between successive U.S. administrations and President Biden in his more than 20-year rule there -- rule here in Turkey and his relationship with Joe Biden is no exception. It's important to point out that back in 2020, in the summer of 2020, then- presidential candidate Joe Biden described President Erdogan as an autocrat. He criticized President Biden's policy towards the Kurds and he said that he would throw his support behind the Turkish opposition who were trying to unseat him. Well, fast forward three years to 2023 and the campaign trail here. And to what is an increasingly nationalistic Turkish population, anti-Americanism goes down very well here in Turkey. And President Erdogan knows that. So, as he approaches this historic runoff election, this is the first time that President Erdogan has had opposition in an election. He has been using that Biden line about him being an autocrat. He's been using that against the U.S. who he has accused of trying to topple him. And that is how we started our conversation.

Here's a look at some of that video again just kind of showing how much smoke is really in this region that's reducing the visibility, obviously making it very difficult to breathe especially for folks who have asthma or allergies, and are more inclined to have breathing issues when that smoke gets involved. Also, when you look at the drought, some of the areas that are dealing with the most extreme circumstances of drought are those areas of northwestern Africa, but also along the Iberian Peninsula. So, you take that drought, those drier conditions, especially here again, looking back to April, look at how very warm it was, but also very dry along those exact same regions and that combination of those very dry conditions, as well as the intense heat, leading to a very prolonged term where we're dealing with very dry ground. And when you have that dry ground, if a fire does start for whatever reason, it can explode. It can spread so easily and so quickly because that ground is so dry already. Now, one bit of thing, we do have some rain, very, very small, but some rain in the forecast along portions of the Iberian Peninsula. Obviously, the heaviest rain is going to be over towards Italy where they don't really need it anymore, but some, some rain is in the forecast in the short term. At least from this circling system here you can see along the Mediterranean, we would like to see more rain, but at least it's something. Another bit of good news is the winds.

This is the first time we've looked at just the sheer weight of the city ofNew York and how it's contributing to a sinking, subsiding movement at the same time that would have been in the age of sea level rise. And these scientists did the math. And as you say, 1.7 trillion pounds at 770 billion metric tons. But just as important is the trillion tons of carbon and other heat treatment gases that are in the sea and sky, warming the poles, melting that ice, rising sea levels here. And so, the predictions right now are anywhere between 200 and 600 millimeters of sea level rise. That's seven inches to two feet by 2050, depending on how fast humanity can get off of fossil fuels. Now, what that means for so many coastal cities, not just New York, it's happening in New Orleans, it's happening all over, is infrastructure concerns. And so, I hope we can hold our signal. We've been losing our live signal a little bit, but as we swing around on the Brooklyn side of the East River, this is just one revetment project here. We got a barge full of boulders that they're stacking up to shore up this area, which was completely inundated by super storm Sandy nine years ago. That one storm who wrote the floodplain maps in New York City. They've put another about 700 or 60, sorry, excuse me, 70,000 extra homes in that floodplain. Folks who had no idea that was a risk for them and most of those have not been rebuilt up to standards now. At the same time, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is putting together a number, sort of a suite of options, building sea walls all along the most vulnerable areas, protecting lower Manhattan, Wall Street, protecting the shipping lanes on the New Jersey side, as well. This is happening sooner or later.

But Africa's Catholic bishops hope they talk about debt. They're asking the leaders to cancel what they call unpayable debts from the continent. The bishops say multiple crises in recent years have hit the continent hard. For the past two decades, China has, of course, played a crucial financial role in Africa's economic growth. Much of that investment has been in the form of loans. Since the year 2000, loan commitments across the continent have totaled $153 billion, at least, according to Johns Hopkins and Boston University researchers. However, loans, of course, need to be repaid. And in recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and inflation have all made it much harder for African nations to service their debt. Zambia is trying to restructure its debt after defaulting two years ago and according to the Wall Street Journal, about a third of Zambia's external debt is owed to Chinese lenders. China says it takes Zambia's debt issues seriously and wants to work together for a better solution. But the debt crisis weighs heavily on average Zambian citizens. Nearly two-thirds of Zambians live on less than $2.15 a day, that's according to the World Bank. And that's not hard enough, \"The Wall Street Journal\" also says the country's currency has lost nearly a third of its value since September. And according to Bloomberg, that pushed inflation up to double digits last month. Meantime, Zambia's President hopes getting the country's financial house in order will serve as a blueprint for other struggling nations. Joining us live now is Zambia's Vice President Mutale Nalumango. Thank you so much for being with us, Vice President. Many African countries have found paying back debt to China takes an increasing share of tax revenue. And that's of course money that could be used to build infrastructure, build schools, provide all sorts of services for the average people, for the average citizen in Zambia, including electricity, et cetera.

One thing that the G7 leaders have done is really implement and beef up very targeted sanctions to very specific areas. Things such as construction, transportation, manufacturing, business services, all of which could contribute to Russian success in the sense of garnering funding. So, that is where the focus has been now and that's what they will certainly be keeping their focus on for the future. We also saw the United Kingdom take action against Russian diamond imports. That's been another way to fuel funding into the Russian war machine. And then again, price caps on oils -- on oil that will also remain in place. As far as what more can be done from an economic standpoint, perhaps we have seen President Zelenskyy travel the world. He is talking to Middle Eastern nations right now, so perhaps he will encourage some kind of stifling of economic support for some countries there.

But there are people who are saying, look, she shouldn't be played by a black actress because this is cultural appropriation and representation is important. I mean, what do we know for sure? Because nobody really knows what Cleopatra actually looked like really, as you point out, it wasn't really documented. People could obviously make intelligent guesses and research, but what do we know for sure about what Cleopatra's background actually was?",

We do not know -- she did not leave us a lot of the archaeological record dating to her period is still missing, possibly because we lost Egypt to the Roman Empire right afterwards. So, perhaps most of this has been completely destroyed and will never answer this question. And I think that, I mean, if we think sensibly with an educated guess, perhaps she was fair or perhaps she was, her mother maybe was darker, so she was a little darker. Or maybe I always like to tease my Greek and Macedonian friends who are redheads and say maybe Cleopatra was actually a redhead. So, I think we really can't help that.",

Most famously, I think, by Elizabeth Taylor in 1963. I mean, obviously Elizabeth Taylor is a white actress. And, you know, other representations of Queen Cleopatra just really haven't sparked this level of outrage and anger. I don't think I've seen anything quite like this. I mean, why is there so much outrage this time, given that, you know, this representation is of her by a black woman?",

They, we still, even if since 1952, the head of the Supreme Council of antiquities has been Egyptian, the production of knowledge about the Egyptian past still remained within Western institutions. So, there is a sort of a fragile knowledge of our past from the general population and with cultural appropriation of Cleopatra and pushing forward an Afrocentric agendas, people who really have a fragile understanding of their past would feel threatened, especially that of course --",

The fact that she's black is whatis really adding fuel to the fire here. You know, when it comes to arts and culture, if we live in a society where we start saying, listen, you can only play people that look like you. You can only play people who are exactly like you. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of acting, of theater, of drama, of the arts? The whole point of acting is that you play people who are different from you, that is how you show range.",
