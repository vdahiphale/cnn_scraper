So we never thought Roe versus Wade would be attacked like it was. So I think in France, it's important for us to put abortion in constitution and that law is a symbol, it is a huge symbol that we are given to women here in France in order to tell them that in France, we won't let abortion be threatened by no one.

So I think it's important that we are protecting our rights. And by putting abortion in constitution, we are protecting the right to every woman to choose. It is not about to being pro or against abortion. It's about the right to choose, to every woman to choose when she wants to be pregnant or not, and when she wants to give birth out to not give birth.",

So I think it's very important.But as you know, I said to President Macron, the U.N. two years -- I think two years ago he said France is back and I was with him and I said though, France is back and so is feminism. And I think you have in the U.S. Gloria Steinem and many huge feminist figures. And I think in France we had Simone Veil that we heard in your topic just previously. And I think that France is a feminist country, a feminist utopia -- I won't say that because you know, we put abortion in constitution, but it is still difficult for women in France to have access to abortion not in the law, not in the right, but in reality. When you want to have an appointment to a doctor, it is very long. If you live in the country, in a little city, it could be very hard, even (INAUDIBLE) to find a doctor who wants to see you and to give abortion.

There was nothing wrong with her before,\" Mila's mother says. \"Then suddenly, everything dropped. She wasn't eating anything. We had no milk, no eggs, nothing. She used to eat eggs every day before the war. But now, we have nothing.\" Across Gaza, too many are feeling the pain of this deepening hunger crisis. Small children emaciated and malnourished.

Israel has denied targeting civilians, and says that there is quote, \"no limit to the amount of humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza\". But, the reality on the ground paints a very different picture. \"There was no food, no water, no flour, cooking oil or anything,\" this woman says. \"Death is better than this.\" According to a senior U.N. official, at least a quarter of Gaza's population is now said to be just one step away from famine with aid agencies facing overwhelming obstacles in getting the bare minimum of supplies into Gaza. And as Israel's ground offensive threatens to push further into the Strip's densely-populated south, time is quickly running out. While international efforts to airdrop humanitarian supplies have provided some respite, it is simply not enough, with stalling negotiations leaving a little hope for an end to the suffering and hunger of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

For a whole day; other days they'll be shooting constantly. And I tell you, it is loud on the other side of that hill. And it's sort of surreal to hear that sort of noise over there and see this tank unit having to ration their ammo.

We've also showcased three of the best documentary nominations including \"20 Days in Mariupol\", which shocked us with the brutality of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And I asked its director, Mstyslav Chernov why it is still so deliberately painful to watch. MSTYSLAV CHERNOV, \"20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL\": If we don't report everything as it is, if we don't show to people across the world, to our viewers, to our audience the reality of war it becomes acceptable. It's a big danger in not exposing the war all its brutality, for all its absurd. And if its polished, if its sanitized, then it's acceptable and that's -- that shouldn't be the case.

And also with all their horrifying and very important tragedies that are happening when we are bombarded by them every day these important stories are just lost.
