The officers walk after him but then a police cruiser arrives blocking that vantage point. From a different video on social media, another officer joins the other two following after Lowe. As another cruiser arrives the three officers reach for their weapons. (Gunshots) From this angle, the moment is seen when the officers open fire. In a statement, Huntington Park Police said they were responding to a stabbing class last Thursday afternoon where the victim said a man dismounted the wheelchair, ran to the victim without provocation, and stabbed him in the side of the chest with a 12-inch butcher knife before fleeing the scene on the wheelchair. The department said two tasers were ineffective in subduing the man as the suspect ignored their verbal commands and threatened to advance or throw the knife at the officers. ELAM (on camera):  Would it change the way you would approach somebody if they were a double-amputee? CHERYL DORSEY, RETIRED LAPD SERGEANT WHO SPENT 20 YEARS IN PATROL: There are times, certainly, when deadly force is necessary. Given the fact that this guy was a double-amputee and could only move so swiftly, my mindset would have been to try to corral him, but I did not see imminent threat of deadly injury to the officers or anyone else. ELAM (voice-over):  Officials said Lowe was pronounced dead at the scene and the police officers involved are on paid administrative leave while the Huntington Park Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's homicide bureau investigate. The county's district attorney's office told CNN it will investigate once LASD completes its investigation, saying, \"Los Angeles County deserves to know how and why these incidents have occurred.\" Ebonique Simon, the mother of Lowe's 15-year-old son, telling CNN he had been dealing with a lot of depression after losing his legs in an incident that happened about a year ago. EBONIQUE SIMON, MOTHER OF LOWE'S 15-YEAR-OLD SON:  I just want justice and the truth for my son. ELAM (voice-over):  Lowe's mother distraught and in disbelief.

The Republicans want to hold the president and the Democrats hostage to make future spending cuts in order to pay our past debts. And they should be separate and I think that's what President Biden said. This is not about paying our -- raising the debt ceiling is not about future spending. It's about paying our past debts, over 25 percent of which was caused by Donald Trump and his administration. So the Republicans are happy to raise the debt ceiling when there's a Republican president but they're going to try to hold the Democrats hostage.
