It is that essentially the second largest bank failure in American history has just been announced. It is First Republic. It was taken over by the authorities late last night. And they have sold a large proportion of the assets to JPMorgan Chase.So, most assets of First Republic Bank, we're being told, are being purchased by JPMorgan Chase. The deal was announced today. It's just been announced and it was arraigned by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That's the independent government agency that ensures deposits for customers. Now this is the third American bank to fail in two months. And there was a lot of relief that other banks didn't cause a wider failure in the banking system. But as you can see, it hasn't fully recovered. These medium-size banks are still really struggling in the United States. And there's concern that that contagion may spread to other parts of the world. But so far, the authorities seem to be handling each one on a case-by-case basis. As I was saying, JPMorgan will take over these assets. So, all those deposits that were held with the bank, customers' deposits are safe for now. So, no great deal of concern. And obviously the authorities trying to get ahead of things before the markets open later on today. We'll wait to see how the markets interpret all of that. But we'll bring you more details on this as we go through the day. But First Republic has failed but its assets have been assured by JPMorgan and the authorities. Meanwhile in Texas, a community is in mourning and investigators asking the public for help. This man lost his wife and 9-year-old son in a shooting which killed three others. Here's what the county sheriff investigating the case had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF GREG CAPERS, SAN JACINTO COUNTY, TEXAS: My heart is with this 8-year-old little boy. I don't -- I don't care if he was here legally. I don't care if he was here illegally. He was in my county. Five people died in my county, and that is where my heart is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Wilson Garcia says he was at home with a group of friends when he asked, he and two other men walked over to the home -- their neighbor's home, Oropeza, and asked him to shop shooting is weapons so close to their property because their baby was trying to sleep. He says they asked him just to shoot the weapons on the other side of their property. It was a very intense exchange. Garcia said they had already called the authorities and 911 five times prior to that.And then ten minutes later, that's when Wilson Garcia says That Francisco Oropeza came back to their house, didn't say anything else and started shooting people. One of the first to die, he said, was his wife. He says that the men then started going the house shooting people in other rooms. Oropeza says one of women told him to get out of the house as quickly as possible because his wife and son were already dead and that they didn't want to lose him because his two other children shouldn't lose both parents. Horrific details that Wilson Garcia is detailing of that night. In the meantime, investigators continue this man hunt. They have been searching for Francisco Oropeza since Friday night when he was able to flee the scene. But at this point, investigators say they have no idea where he might be.",

They're not exactly sure of the number, but this will be the first and largest we've seen of an American operated ship arriving here in Jeddah. Jeddah here in Saudi Arabia has become the main landing point for people evacuating from Port Sudan. Part of it is because of proximity between the Red Sea across from Port Sudan to Jeddah.But the other one is also that with Khartoum becoming untenable, people are fleeing in troves. They are making the arduous journey across something like 500 miles to more than 830 kilometers to the east to Port Sudan and hoping to get on one of the ships across to Jeddah. So, the biggest evacuation operations so far has been granted by the Saudi government. We took a trip with the Royal Saudi Navy across from Jeddah to Port Sudan and came back. And across those strips they have evacuated about 5,200. But also, the number of ships is just not enough for the number that need to leave especially from, Port Sudan. And so, that is why, for instance, the Americans have this. This is the U.S. Navy Brunswick. It a military transport aircraft that has about 100 Americans as I mentioned, but also several other nationalities. We're seen Norwegians, Australians, Germans, I believe there's several other countries here as well. For instance, we understand there's 28 Brits on the ship. This is a continual operation for the Brits. But for the Americans that arrive in Port Sudan over the weekend, there were two major convoys that were coordinated by the U.S. Embassy which had U.S. private citizens of Sudan, as well as locally employed staff and other nationalities, and this is the first of those two convoys that arrived in Port Sudan. So, there's likely going to be more Americans in Port Sudan looking to come here. We asked the consulate general here in Jeddah if there's going to be more American ships here, he said he cannot speak for sure. But we know suddenly, based on CNN reporting, there are more Americans in Port Sudan that are trying to get across the Red Sea to here in Jeddah.",

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced the purchase deal after taking control of the embattled member on Sunday. The announcement says JPMorgan Chase will assume all of the deposits, and substantially all of the assets of First Republic. All First Republic branches will reopen today as JPMorgan branches. This makes First Republic the second largest bank failure in nation's history.The economic doomsday clock ticking towards the potential U.S. government default. Republicans and Democrats argued some more on Sunday but didn't make any progress towards resolving the debt ceiling crisis. The Republican-controlled House last week passed a bill to enable the U.S. to continue borrowing so it could pay its bills. But it includes deep program cuts. President Biden has made clear he won't approve. And with the president refusing to negotiate it's still unclear how or when there might be a breakthrough.

But he has a much bigger challenge ahead in navigating how to avoid a default. And it doesn't look like this bill has changed the dynamics here in Washington.The White House and Democrats are slamming this bill as an unserious proposal that is dead on arrival in the Senate. They're also digging in on their refusing to negotiate any spending cuts that are tied to the debt ceiling. And that really leaves Congress stuck in a dangerous stalemate over how to move forward. So, the key question now is, what's next? Republicans argue it's time for President Biden to come to the negotiating table and start hashing out a deal. House majority whip, Tom Emmer, reiterated that position on CNN this morning. Here's what he had to say. REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): The White House, since this Congress has begun has had no ideas whatsoever except jacking up taxes and spending even more money. We've got to get this right, Dana. And the Senate -- the Schumer Senate, they have no ideas either. Our recommendation is, we pass it through the House, take it up in the Senate, and pass it.",

Senator Joe Manchin, he's one of a growing number of Democrats pressuring Joe Biden to start negotiations.And really, the bottom line here is that Congress is running out of time. Current estimates put the deadline for when a deal must be reached at some point in July. And the house isn't even in this week, they're on recess. So, it's unlikely we'll see them move the ball forward in the coming days. And with the deadline right around the corner, everyday counts. Alayna Treene, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
