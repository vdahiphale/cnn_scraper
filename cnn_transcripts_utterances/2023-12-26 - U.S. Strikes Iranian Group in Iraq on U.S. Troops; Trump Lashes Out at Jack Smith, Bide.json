The president places no higher priority than the protection of American personnel serving in harm's way. It goes on to say the United States will act at a time and in a matter of our choosing should these attacks continue. Now, U.S. Central Command has since said that early assessments show that they're that they did -- they've likely hit militants and that there were no civilian casualties, and that Secretary Austin also saying that these were, quote, necessary and proportionate.

They need support both militarily, but particularly diplomatically, because of the momentum around the world, this U.N. resolution, which the U.S. succeeded in having the language soften quite a bit before abstaining from the vote.But a lot of countries, when it comes to geopolitics, are really pressuring Israel to have, you know, basically do whatever it takes to have a ceasefire right now in Gaza, which Israel says would be exactly the wrong approach, because it would give Hamas time to regroup and it would give them time to restock and to actually strengthen. And Israel says that would be a very, very dangerous situation, because they point out again to this multi-front war that they say they're fighting most fiercely right now in Gaza, but also on the border with Lebanon, with Hezbollah, in Iraq, in Yemen and in Iran. The Houthi rebels in Yemen, they're not only a problem for Israel, they're also a problem for the global economy. In fact, shipping companies have had to send their ships on different routes, which is delaying supply chains by up to a month, as you both know. So, this conflict spreading out, and the U.S. and Israel are going to have very serious talks at the White House to try to figure out what to do to contain this.",

This official saying that illicit activity continues, smugglers still trying to push migrants to cross illegally, not just here in the Eagle Pass area, but also in very remote areas of Arizona.And so the Biden administration has been dealing with this increasing level of migrants who have been crossing into the U.S. illegally, and they've been surging resources to the border region. And also they've coasted several ports of entry in several states, trying to reassign those personnel to process migrants. And they're also using something called decompression. All that means is areas that are at or over capacity, like Eagle Pass was last week, those migrants are being transported to other areas for processing. Here in Eagle Pass, those migrants have been going to the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo and also to Del Rio. I want to take you to Del Rio because we were there yesterday when a group of migrants celebrated mass under an awning. This is at a respite center there. And the priest tells us that he has been feeding these migrants three times a day. But yesterday, he arrived with an altar and some food for the soul. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FATHER MICHAEL CORONADO, ST. JOSEPH AND OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE CATHOLIC CHURCHES:  We had a few people come to our church to celebrate with us there and we knew that there was a lot more here. So, with that, it would be best for them to have a moment to have mass here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is a result of the insurrectionist ban included in the 14th Amendment.Analysts shared with CNN -- analysis shared with CNN shows an uptick in this heated online language about the four judges in the majority who voted to disqualify Trump. And while there are no direct known threats at this time, there are big concerns about what this could cause.

So, first of all, as we have talked about at length, Donald Trump's lawyer strategy is really just delay, delay, delay.So, when you look at all of the cases he's facing, and I believe we have something here, so I can pull it up just for reference, you talk about the Manhattan Hush Money case, you talk about the classified documents case, the DOJ 2020 election interference case, as well as the Fulton County election interference case, and then, of course, the New York attorney general's civil fraud trial. He is very fixated on that civil fraud trial. And, of course, that has wrapped. We are waiting for a decision in that. When it comes to both of the federal cases, yes, they are worried about the classified documents case as a whole. However, they do believe that it is likely that the dates on that are going to shift until after the election in 2024. Now, when it comes to the election interference case, which has been set for March, as we have seen, the judge put a hold on that. Now, there is speculation that that date is going to shift, too. And if you look at the calendar, that was actually scheduled to start the day before Super Tuesday. But when you look at this calendar and you see the dynamics between the political and the legal, you can see why this is weighing on Donald Trump. He wants to focus on the election, and he wants to run for president, not focus on all this legal stuff.",

But in many ways, as she has become more prominent in the polls or improved in the polls, she seems even more reluctant to cross the line in making a case against him.And Chris Christie's view, I think there are other Republicans who think that, like perhaps Tim Scott before her, she may be running to a point with one eye on not going too far to alienate Trump and his allies, either because she's interested in vice president or secretary of state, or she thinks that's a way to be viable for 2028. Ultimately, Phil, I mean, she, at this point, is doing well at consolidating the portions of the party that are the most alienated from Trump and have been really in many ways from the outset. If she is going to truly threaten him in any way, she's going to have to make a sharper case about why people who are now oriented toward voting for him should not.

      "sentences": "Well, you know, historically, Phil, as you know, it has been difficult for people to run against each other to end up on the same ticket. It has happened, but there are always, often a lot of bruised feelings. Donald Trump has called her a bird brain. Logical politics would say Haley has shown she is strongest where he is weakest, that she has a lot of appeal among center right suburban voters who have never been warm to Trump, especially women, when you look at the polling against Biden. So, there would be a lot of logic in doing it.The fact that they are attacking her so much in the Trump camp, I think, is reflective of a broader truth that you see in the aggressiveness and extreme nature of much of his agenda. They are feeling very confident. Biden's weakness in the polls has them feeling that not only is the primary well within reach but the general election is well within reach. And by normal political metrics, you would say a president at 40 percent approval is in serious trouble. And there is trouble for Biden. But Trump, I think, responding to all of this, is putting forward an agenda that is so polarizing and so extreme, from repealing the ACA to internment camps, to his threats about weaponizing the Justice Department, that he is providing Biden a potential path that even if there is a majority that is not necessarily affirmatively excited about giving Biden four more years, there very well may be a majority, as there were in many places, in most places in 1820 and '22, that do not want to live under the vision of America that Trump is putting forward. So, I look at that quick denunciation at Haley as just one more piece of evidence that they feel that they can run this election out on the vanguard of polarization and even extremism, openly authoritarian and racist rhetoric, and still win. And time will tell if that strategy, if he does become the nominee, simply was a bridge too far.",
