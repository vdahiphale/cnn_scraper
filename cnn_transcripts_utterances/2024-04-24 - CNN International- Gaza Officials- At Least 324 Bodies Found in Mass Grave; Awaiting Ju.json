      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Anna Coren. Here are some of today's top stories.In just a few hours, U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the long awaited foreign aid package. The measure passed the Senate late last night after months of negotiating. The $95 billion package includes funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. A Russian court has rejected Evan Gershkovich's latest appeal. And he will remain jailed until at least the end of June. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter has been held in Russia for more than a year on spying charges. Gershkovich denies these allegations and the U.S. says he's being wrongfully detained. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to arrive in Shanghai, China within the hour. He'll meet with business leaders there before heading to Beijing on Friday for talks with China's foreign minister. Some Israelis are marking the Jewish holiday of Passover with protests. Demanding a deal to free the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Large crowds gathered outside IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv while others packed what's become known as Hostages Square. An estimated 129 people are still believed to be held captive in Gaza. The militant group abducted around 250 people during the October 7th attack. But with ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas at an apparent standstill, fighting across Gaza is intensifying. The IDF is warning people to leave dangerous combat zones across northern Gaza. Residents there and in other parts of the enclave report nearly non-stop bombardment and some of the heaviest shelling in weeks. The Israeli military says it's using extreme force against terrorist infrastructure and subversive elements. And a Hamas spokesperson is calling for continued attacks on Israel in response. Rocket alerts sounded in two Israeli border towns on Tuesday, although no casualties were reported. Meanwhile, the U.S. is urging Israel to get more humanitarian aid to Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID SATTERFIELD, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR MIDDLE EAST HUMANITARIAN ISSUES: The risk of famine throughout Gaza is very high, especially in the north. And the volume of assistance entering into and most importantly distributed within Gaza has increased significantly. But we know much more aid is needed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Certainly, troubling accounts that we are hearing from Palestinian officials on the ground with regards to the discovery of some bodies, some victims with their hands bound together. The United Nations has repeatedly called for independent access to parts of Gaza in order to carry out similar investigations. We heard similar statements following the end of the siege on Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, the discovery of hundreds of bodies, decomposing bodies scattered around the hospital after that 14-day siege.The U.N. has repeatedly called for independent access. And we have, of course, in some U.N. agencies, been able to reach Al Shifa to assess the destruction there. But again, we have heard those calls for an investigation into what has taken place. On the grounds of the Al Nasser Hospital, as you mentioned, more than 300 bodies have so far been recovered from this newly discovered mass grave. Civil defense officials in Gaza say that many of those who were discovered in the mass graves around the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis had been buried in January by family members and medics as a temporary measure due to the heavy bombardment in the region at the time. And when families returned in order to carry out a proper burial following the withdrawal of the Israeli military, they could not find the graves or the bodies of their loved ones and that they had been moved into these mass graves. Now, we have had a response from the Israeli military. They have acknowledged that some bodies were exhumed from these grave sites in order to carry out testing, in order to assess whether or not some of these victims may have been hostages. They say that they were following intelligence and that the deceased were treated with respect and returned to the original places where they were buried. But this stands in contrast to the testimonies that we are hearing from Gaza's civil defense officials, from Palestinian families on the ground still looking for their loved ones who have been moved from their original burial sites. And of course from the distressing and graphic video that has emerged from our colleagues on the ground in Khan Younis.",

Of course, that $95 billion package is set to be signed by U.S. President Joe Biden today. That includes over $26 billion in support for Israel, including $4 billion supporting the Iron Dome missile defense system for Israel. So this is a significant boost for the Israeli military.We've heard response from the Israeli President Isaac Herzog. He said: Thank you to the members of the U.S. Senate on both sides of the aisle for your wide and firm support for the Israel aid package. Together we stand united in the face of those who threaten our shared values. Now, this announcement comes at a time where Israel is facing mounting criticism for its military's actions in Gaza. In fact, it comes in the exact same week that the U.S. State Department has issued its annual human rights report in which it details allegations of inhumane practices towards the Palestinian people by Israeli authorities, in which it details accounts of forced disappearances, amongst many other, of course, criticisms that the Israeli military has faced. So this has raised some concern with regards to the U.S. policy when it comes to its support for Israel and, of course, continued concern over Israel's looming ground offensive in southern Gaza and Rafah, where more than a million civilians are currently displaced and sheltering.",

Florida, over the last two presidential elections, has voted for Republicans, and it's also a state where President Biden still has a wider gap in his polls against his Republican rival, Donald Trump.

But Idaho accuses the Biden administration of using that federal law to, quote, create a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms. Well, the case could set forth a major precedent in whether saving a fetus can be prioritized over helping a pregnant woman suffering a medical emergency.
