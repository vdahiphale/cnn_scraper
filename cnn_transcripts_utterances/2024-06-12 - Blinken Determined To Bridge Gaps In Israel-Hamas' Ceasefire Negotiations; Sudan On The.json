Standing in the way according to Blinken is Hamas' response, neither a rejection nor an acceptance of the deal as it stands right now.

He urged Hamas to negotiate he will try to use whatever leverage the countries have, whatever leverage the U.N. Security Council resolution has to try to push this forward. Blinken clearly believing Israel is on board and now it's a question of where Hamas stands. It took them some 12 days to respond after President Joe Biden publicly backed the agreement.

They had committed war crimes including intentionally directing attacks against civilians, murder, or willful killing, torture, taking hostages including children and more. They also say that they identified quote patterns indicative of sexual violence and concluded that these were not isolated incidents but perpetrated in similar ways in several locations primarily against Israeli women. Now, the report on the Israeli military operations in Gaza focused mostly on events between October and December and they found that Israel had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes accusing Israel of using starvation as a method of warfare. They say that Israel enforced a total siege on Gaza amounting to collective punishment of the population, intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. Here, they say that they found that the immense number of civilian casualties and the widespread destruction is a result of a strategy to cause maximum damage disregarding the rules of war, proportionality, distinction and adequate precautions. Other crimes that they accuse Israel of -- sexual violence, extermination, murder or willful killing, forcible transfer and more. The Commission accused Israel of obstructing its investigation and says that it had prevented access to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. And, you know, Israel for months had made its position clear saying that it was not going to deal with what it described as this anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic body. Now, today in a statement responding to these findings it said that the U.N. Commission of Inquiry showed quote systemic anti-Israeli discrimination, again rejecting accusations against the IDF saying that it adheres to international law and carries out its own investigations. They also say that the report disregarded what Israel says is Hamas using civilians as human shields. And on the accusations of sexual violence, Israel says it's outraged by attempts to draw a quote, \"false equivalence between Israeli soldiers and Hamas\". Jomana Karadsheh, CNN London.",

The ship directly behind me is a rescue ship an icebreaker which does not have much use in the Caribbean. And then behind that is a nuclear-powered sub the Kazan something Cubans say they've never seen before in this country. A nuclear-powered submarine coming in for all to witness in the port of Havana, really something quite unusual. And then, behind is the Gorshkov which is one of the most modern military ships capable of firing cruise missiles that Vladimir Putin possesses, really the highest level of technology that the Russian Navy can boast. So, those are for all to see. They are docked in an area a few years ago. You would have seen American cruise ships but because of U.S. sanctions, they're no longer allowed to come here. And right before we came on air, I could hear the sailors singing the Russian national anthem. So, it certainly felt like a moment from the past, you know. It wasn't that long ago, of course, that the Soviet Union was supplying Cuba with everything they needed here and the economy was doing much, much better, as a result. We have seen some of that come back over the last few years with the war in Ukraine where Vladimir Putin in exchange for Cuban supports in that war has sent more oil here more food. There are a lot more Russian tourists here these days and that is helping Cuba as the economy is really in some of the worst -- the worst stage that it has been in decades. Literally, Russian oil and many instances is keeping the lights on when they are on here because for much of the time, there are nationwide blackouts taking place. So, Cuba has increasingly voiced its support for Vladimir Putin invasion in Ukraine and Vladimir Putin has returned their favor certainly striking to see the ships here behind me armed with nuclear weapons or not so close to the United States.",

And so, the Pope has, like, this vested interest. This is a Pope who was, you know, was educated with a technical education and chemistry. This is a Pope who believes there's good things that can come out of A.I. So, his message here will be to urge these world leaders here at the G7, these democratic nations who are the sort of most powerful economic nations around the world to kind of get their hands around A.I. and make it a force for good and not bad, i.e. faking the Pope and a white puffer jacket. But back to those other issues which are equally serious. Yes, Biden here on a mission to portray the United States and his presidency and the future presidency as one with a commitment to the current international world order specifically pushing back on Putin's aggression against Ukraine, specifically multilaterally working with the G7 President here, the Italian Prime Minister Giorgio Meloni, to work with the E.U., to find a way to button up this agreement that's almost landed whereby you -- they use Russia's frozen assets -- $300 billion worth, take the profits from those and give them to Ukraine -- about $50 billion worth. Give them to Ukraine for the humanitarian rebuilding of the country. So, that's the aim, the technical bit is who kind of underwrites it, how much of its E.U., how much of its the U.S., that's what has to be worked out but there's the bilateral stuff, as well. Biden coming in here flexing his sanctions muscles against Russia, trying to stop them, breaching sanctions, getting around sanctions using third countries to get third-party access to U.S. software, U.S. technologies that Russia's then sort of using to put in weapon systems. So, there's -- there's that. And then, there's this bilateral security arrangement. Go back to NATO last year. Zelenskyy went there -- President Zelenskyy went there hoping to get this sort of big long-term backing from NATO, a security commitment. And what he got was an agreement for that all the individual 32 nations would get bilateral security packages with Ukraine -- 14 of those are done. President Biden's one will be the 15th -- 17 more to go. So, Biden here signaling United States is going to do it. Those other 15 --17 nations, rather, they should get on and do it, as well.",

Hamas' military leader hasn't been seen in public since the start of the war, hiding somewhere in the bombarded enclave. But Sinwar may believe he has the upper hand. \"We have the Israelis right where we want them,\" Sinwar said in recent messages to Hamas officials viewed by \"The Wall Street Journal\". Sinwar's leaked messages, which CNN hasn't seen and cannot independently verify, shed light into his mindset during eight months of brutal war. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the territory. In one message to Hamas leaders in Doha, Sinwar wrote, \"These are necessary sacrifices.\" The Israeli military responded on social media saying, \"Sinwar profits off the deaths of Gazan civilians. Hamas leaders don't care about Gazans. How many times do they have to say it for themselves before the world believes them?\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in the region to push a ceasefire proposal, aimed his message directly at Sinwar.",

The problem is it doesn't appear Sinwar is feeling any of that pressure, and that means the task of getting to that ceasefire remains incredibly difficult. Oren Liebermann, CNN in Tel Aviv.

One of the questions I have for you is really when you look at the death toll, right, roughly around, obviously we don't have exact numbers, but roughly potentially around 36,000 Palestinians and Yahya Sinwar essentially has it in his power to put an end to this war, at least temporarily, but he is not choosing to. A lot of people point to the fact that they believe that Yahya Sinwar essentially hates Israel. He hates Israel much more than he cares about the Palestinian people. That is what many people believe. So, based on that, how much is a continuation of this war -- how much does a continuation of this war work in Yahya Sinwar's political favor?",
