Israel will certainly not want to see an emboldened Iran off the back of this, nor indeed will the U.S. administration. But what they don't see is an inevitability to the way that Israel might respond.This retaliation was inevitable, and indeed, Tehran telegraphed it very widely to this region and beyond.",

But, of course, once they've done that the first time, it then becomes easier to do it a second time, a third time.So, there's certainly a very clear escalation that has happened here. They telegraphed they were going to do it. They have also said that if there is military aggression, as they call it, from Israel, then they will do it again. They have said that the response will be stronger and more resolute. And we've heard from Israel itself saying that they will be responding to this, at least the foreign minister saying that, as Nic was mentioning. So, of course, this is the concern at this point that you have the telegraphing, but then Tehran has carried through with this threat. And it has done what it calls self-defense. It claims that since that consulate attack on the Iranian building in Damascus, in Syria, they say that under the U.N. Charter, they are able to have this self- defense. And they say that they had warned it would happen, and then they did.",

There's more of a diplomatic tightrope that many of these countries are having to walk.But we're hearing from some of the countries, Saudi Arabia, for example, who has relations with the US, who now has relations with Iran, who, if the Biden administration is to be believed, will have relations with Israel, so a very difficult position. But they have said, quote, the Kingdom urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to protect the region of its people from the dangers of war. You have a similar sentiment from Qatar, talking of their deep concern. There's no mention of either country. There's no pointing of fingers of this is who is to blame. There's no condemnation. There's concern that this has escalated and there's a call for a de-escalation on all sides.",

Mr. Biden told Netanyahu that Israel should consider Saturday a win, as Iran attacks were mostly unsuccessful. And he said a U.S. assessment revealed that almost all of the drones and missiles had been knocked out of the sky. But the U.S. president also made it clear that America will not participate in any offensive operations against Iran, according to a U.S. official. And in the coming hours, President Biden is expected to meet with G7 leaders to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran. CNN's Jennifer Hansler joins me now from Washington, D.C. What more do you have, Jennifer?",

As you noted, the president will be convening with his G7 partners in the coming hours to discuss that approach.We have seen Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on the phone with Israeli counterpart five times since that Israeli strike on, or to the Damascus facility, including in recent hours. And we understand that Secretary Austin asked Defense Minister Gallant to give the U.S. a heads-up on any sort of strikes or moves that Israel intends to take. Secretary of State Antony Blinken put out a statement this evening. He said he would be on the phone with regional and world counterparts in the coming hours and days to discuss this situation. So, there is really going to be this concerted push to try to ensure that there's not a further escalation of the conflict there in the region. That was, of course, one of top concerns going into the war six months ago. And it remains a key concern right now. This was perhaps one the highest points of tension that we have seen over the past six months for this situation to just spiral out of control. So, there is going to be a lot of work on that diplomatic front to try to ensure that this is the end of that move. At the same time, the U.S. is making clear that they are going stand with Israel defensively. That was key in the Biden statement, in the Austin statement and the Blinken statement this evening, Becky.",

Important then to note that Israel has in the past hours said that Hamas has rejected the outline of a ceasefire and a hostage release deal and Hamas is repeating its demands that Israeli assets get out of Gaza and that there is a permanent ceasefire.That is important news and the timing of this important as we consider what has happened over the past, what, 12 hours.",

We have seen the CIA director go into the region to be involved in these negotiations with Qatar, with Egypt, who are engaging with Hamas to try to secure this deal.And the fact that Hamas has gone back to its original demands is going to a blow to all of these negotiators. There had been some movement that suggested flexibility by both Hamas and Israel, and now that seems to have disappeared. And you'll note, Becky, that the Biden administration had been really trying to rely on this ceasefire as kind of a key to all of its priorities. They saw that as a way to get all the hostages out, as way get humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip. But at the same time, they have become increasingly more vocal about the need for Israel to do more despite or regardless of the ceasefire. They say more must be done. and we saw a really -- see that come to the fore really, really sharply when there was that deadly strike on a World Central Kitchen convoy a few weeks ago. The president came out very strongly with Prime Minister Netanyahu and said more must be done regardless. So there's a lot at play here, Becky, that we'll be watching for in the coming days.",

      "sentences": "You're 100 percent right, Becky, this is a historic unprecedented direct Iranian attack against the state of Israel. We've all grown around the world accustomed to the attacks by the proxies, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.But this is really the first time that we've seen such an assault against Israel by regime in Iran that has repeatedly over the years called to wipe Israel off the map. And I think that the dilemma right now that the Israeli government led by Netanyahu is facing is how do we respond? On the one hand, they were able to intercept 99 percent, the Israeli military saying, of all of those drones and missiles that were fired at Israel. No one was really hurt. There was one child that was hit of shrapnel. But, overall, that five hour assault was pretty much contained. On the other hand, if you don't respond, what lesson are you teaching Iran? And Iran might think that they can get away with this and they can do this again in the future. And I think, Becky, one more word on this. There is a difference in Israel between the October 6th Israel and the October 7th Israel. To think that you can contain this, that's October 6th thinking. And we saw what happens when after years of missile defense in Gaza, what happened on October 7th with the Hamas massacre, if we don't retaliate now, are we setting ourselves up potentially for another October 7th in the future from Iran?",

On the one hand, Israel could attack, for example, just the base or bases from which those drones or ballistic missiles were launched from Iran and keep its response very limited and contained to the launch pad of the attack last night against Israel.On the other hand, I think there might even be legitimacy for a wider offensive against Iran that takes out more assets of the Iranian military. But we can't ignore the fact that what we saw last night was a regional collective partnership. We saw the involvement of the Jordanians, of the Americans, of the British, and potentially other countries in the region who helped defeat this Iranian attack to now launch a widespread offensive against Iran would potentially undermine that regional partnership, and that's what Israel is a bit cautious with right now.",

Just how much pressure is the Biden administration really bringing to bear on Benjamin Netanyahu at this point?Certainly, there is no ceasefire, not even a temporary ceasefire in Gaza at this point. And despite the fact that the Americans have been hugely supportive, critically supportive overnight in providing air defense. It is still ultimately in the ballpark of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, his war cabinet, and his cabinet that involves a number of very right wing parliamentarians, one of whom is the national security head, Ben-Gvir, who has said today we need a crushing response to Iran.",

Definitely, the retaliatory attacks by Iran yesterday are game changer.We're no longer in the shadow or proxy war between those two. It began, obviously, with the direct attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria. But what happened yesterday really upped the ante even further. So, we really are standing on a very dangerous precipice and much of it depends on how Israel reacts and whether it will carry out a responsive attack, another attack on Iranian territory proper, which effectively means, frankly, dragging the U.S. and almost everyone into an all-out regional conflict. And this is something we've been mourning around about for the last six months.",

Effectively, 99 percent of them were brought down. Most of that was done outside of Israeli territory, outside Israeli airspace.So, I think, frankly, I saw it more, it was a major escalatory move, but it was very much of a light show. And it's a drop in the bucket of what could really have happened, had all the other, I mean, as you saw, most of the drones and the missiles were coming from Iran proper and not from the -- Iran's various partners and proxies in region. They stayed pretty much out of game to a certain extent. So, this is a drop in the buckets of could happen if this was to escalate into an all-out regional war. So, yes, it was a major escalation.",

This government has been led with -- I mean, we've seen the horrors of Gaza. We're talking 33,000 dead. I don't need to recite the numbers of Gaza, 17,000, more than 17,000 kids, orphans, children, orphans, et cetera, et cetera, almost total destruction of the strip.So, I expect no less from someone who's been driving much of this. We're seeing nobody is talking now about what's happening in the West Bank and the pogroms that are going on in the West Bank. So, this is to be expected from Smotricj and also probably from other members of this particular government. Quite honestly, they're unhinged in a certain way. They're driving for a military escalation at the time when only a diplomatic solution can walk us back from the precipice of an all out war across the region. And it's a war that they cannot win. No one can win. Sorry, let me be clear. It's a war that no one can win. It's a war that will wreck havoc and destruction on everyone concerned, including Israelis and Palestinians and Lebanese and everyone else who gets involved, and Iranians. So, what we really need now is for the U.S. to demonstrate its leverage, which now has become even more difficult, and push back against any kind of Iranian escalation by its collateral moves by Israel, per se, to bring the temperature down and start talking about a ceasefire, not only Gaza, but, frankly, it has to be a regional ceasefire. We have a lot of concerns in Lebanon that once they're done with Gaza, they might turn towards Lebanon. Yesterday, by the way, I mean, in the midst of all of this, it wasn't covered in the news, there were attacks on Lebanon happening as the drones were flying into Israel or towards Israel.",
