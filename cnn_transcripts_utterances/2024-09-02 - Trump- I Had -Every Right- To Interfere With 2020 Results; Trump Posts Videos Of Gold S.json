Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's so crazy that my poll numbers go up.

We just saw the superseding indictment from Jack Smith in that January 6th election interference case.And clearly, this is not something that his team wants to have on their plate at this time as we head into these last days of the election, getting closer and closer to November. They want to kind of put all those legal issues in the rear view mirror. Comments like this don't really help with that effort.",

You see Harris trying to show that -- or argue that it shows Trump's sole commitments to serving himself instead of others.

You only have to look at the response that came from the Gold Star families of these 13 service members of how offended they were by that statement, given she has not made any effort, not on that third anniversary or any other time to call them directly to offer her condolences and even apologies for their decisions that led to the loss of their loved ones.(END VIDEO CLIP) EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: For Harris, this is a tricky thing because she wanted to, in 2021, be associated with being very involved with the decision. She said that to you when you asked her about it in the earlier interview with her then. But she wasn't really that deeply involved with it. And now that it's the politics of it, it's how do you show that you were a connected member of the administration, but not so connected that you were -- you're tied to what is obviously a still problematic spot for them. The other thing, though, that I think is worth paying attention to as we get into the political back and forth here is the grief of these families is real and the anger that they have about their sons being killed is real. There's also that the Trump campaign did something where they violated the law. They lied about what happened. They have said that they have footage of this that they have not released. So, there is the big Afghanistan situation and what happened to these Marines. But then there is another time where Donald Trump broke the law, insulted people, lied about it, continues to lie about it, continues to hope that that gets swept into the controversy and the political back and forth.",

More than one assassination attempt.And I have said I'm embarrassed that I didn't know more about this part of history because it is so consequential when it comes to the South in particular and civil rights in the South. And I'm going to read part of why it is so important. \"The Supreme Court's decision in U.S. versus Cruikshank was among the most significant ramifications of Louisiana's 1872 election and the Colfax massacre,\" which is something that murdered 150, more than 150 black men. \"The ruling would play a significant role in shaping American history and impacting millions of lives for nearly a century. The ruling left it entirely to the states to choose how and when civil rights would be enforced. It was up to state governments, legislatures, and courts to regulate race relations. And so they did, relegating black Americans to the back of the bus, underfunded and under equipped public schools and segregated seating in public venues.\" The direct line between this election in 1872 to what we saw, the Jim Crow South, is remarkable, David.",
