It would just be slightly to the north, perhaps of Gaza City itself, an area of a deep concentration of people.Now, the Israeli Defense Forces say that last night there was very heavy shelling in the northern area of Gaza. We were standing here through the night. We could hear it through the night, very heavy missile strikes and artillery strikes. Indeed, the Israel Defense Forces say so far in the past six days they have targeted Gaza and specifically Hamas's infrastructure, its military command post, its military commanders with 6,000 missiles. That, according to the IDF's own figures, is already more than they launched in -- launched on Gaza in the war in 2014 that lasted 50 days. So that gives you a sense of scale of the amount of ordnance that's being dropped. Huge plume of smoke right now. We don't know where that's coming from. But the announcement this morning by the Israeli Defense Force that Palestinians should move south of the Gaza Strip, move out of Gaza City, initially it appeared that they were given a 24-hour deadline. The U.N. had interpreted that way. The U.N. says that is impossible to do, that it will create a humanitarian disaster on the ground. Indeed, one U.N. agency says already more than 400,000 Palestinians already displaced from their homes at the moment. The IDF has clarified and said there is no 24-hour deadline on that, but it is a very clear instruction for Palestinian civilians to move south in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is telling them not to do that because they don't trust the Israelis or their motives behind this. It is for the Palestinians there, who are caught up at the other end of these missiles, a very, very testing and difficult time. One doctor CNN talked to there said we literally live second by second. It is an impossible situation. He said everyone wants it to end immediately.",

And I should add, Paul Murphy was the one who went through them laboriously, but Israeli media have also been talking a lot about this issue.

So that is the most pressing issue on everybody's minds.At the same time, you will often have conversations here with people where they are openly angry about what happened, where they feel there have been real failings on behalf of Israeli intelligence, also on behalf of the Israeli military. But there does seem to be some sort of consensus that that is a topic for broader conversation at a later date, that it merits deep investigation, those investigations are going to take weeks, if not months, and that the focus and the priority right now should be on dealing with these more pressing and immediate concerns.

JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT and INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, New York is kind of unique in that regard, in that we literally live on high alert as normal in the post 911 world. The city went through a terrible mass murder. It went through a trauma; it went through an intelligence failure. We've seen all of that. So, we put more resources in New York City into the counterterrorism and intelligence venue of the police department than any other city probably on the planet. That said, fear is fear. People are nervous, they're watching social media, frankly, to be candid, they're reacting to rumors and speculation. But we also have to remind ourselves fear is the oxygen that makes the claims of terrorism survive. This is what they're counting on. So, it comes down to this personal question for people, which is, do I actually have information that I should be worried about? At a time when everybody's saying there's no specific credible threat, knowing that there's always some risk in the world, and am I going to give into fear? When you inject the specter of children into that, it gets even more complicated emotionally for parents. But what officials are saying is, go about your business.

I don't know New York as well, Buti know they get around pretty quickly. Are they trained in active shooter response or security? Is there a little bit of behavioral or predictive behavioral profiling training sprinkled in there?
