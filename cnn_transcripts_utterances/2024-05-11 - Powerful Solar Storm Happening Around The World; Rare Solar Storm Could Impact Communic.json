I'm Michael Holmes, appreciate your company and welcome to this special edition of CNN Newsroom.We begin this hour with the powerful geomagnetic storm happening right now all around the world. This storm classified as extreme level five out of five, a phenomenon that last happened more than 20 years ago. And it's causing the northern and southern lights to dazzle many places that rarely, if ever see them. Have a look at the scene here in Atlanta in the southern U.S. a short time ago. Parts of the Midwest and even Northern California have seen chances of seeing the Aurora. The skies over the U.K. and Ireland lighting up in vivid colors earlier on Friday night. And there continues to be a high likelihood of Aurora over parts of Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, in the Southern Hemisphere, the Aurora Australis was spotted over New Zealand as well as Argentina. It all started when the sun erupted with a series of solar flares and what's known as coronal mass ejections. And when those particles reach Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, it creates the spectacular light shows that many of us are witnessing. The lights are expected to peak in the coming hours although the storm will likely continue through the weekend. The Biden administration says it is closely tracking the possible impacts of the solar storm, as it could disrupt communications, satellites and power stations. Electrical utilities in the U.S. and Canada are making preparations just in case. CNN's Chad Myers has more now on the historic solar storms and where you might see those Auroras.",

It will be visible across most of North America, maybe not all the way down to the Gulf Coast, but it'll be close. And it's not a one day event. So even if you have cloud cover tonight, you will still be able to see it tomorrow because there's more than one coronal mass ejection on the way. So what is it? Well, it's just a ball of plasma that's being shot at the Earth.These things happen all the time. But rarely do we have them that go straight at the Earth. Think about how big three dimension today. It could go that way, it could go to the back, it could go to the -- it depends on where the sunspot is. Well, we know this is coming toward the Earth because of what we call the halo effect. When you see the cloud mass kind of come out of this, this is the sun right here. This is the sun being blocked by a disk. But when you see the coronal mass ejections come this way. It's like looking at somebody blowing smoke ring at you, you know what's coming. And you know what's on its way, that's the same idea, same kind of smoke ring that we're seeing. So yes, we have more than one still coming. So overnight, a big one, still landing on the Earth's atmosphere and we are still seeing that really bright colorful cloud all the way around the globe. Typically, the only place you're not seeing it is where it's sunny, where the sun has already come up and you can't see it. But it was very, very spectacular. Somewhere around I would say maybe one Z, one Zulu time, Greenwich Mean Time, somewhere around 9 o'clock, not quite 9 o'clock on the east coast of the U.S. But it was still light. We couldn't see it in North America. But another one and then another one and another one, this is still going to be going for quite some time. This is what the solar wind looks like. And I want you to think of it like a, you know the seismograph in -- when you look in California and you see the Earth shake? Well, the sun wasn't shaking at all. The solar wind was doing just fine, being nice and flat. But then all of a sudden, around 2:30 or 2:40 this afternoon, the Earth began to shake literally. And so did the solar wind. And it came in very, very quickly. Get this number around your brain, 1.6 million miles per hour. That's how fast this solar wind is coming. Aurora is seen farther south with a G5, big number. This is five out of five. This is as big as we get. There are still levels of five, but G5, we're already up there. Power outages are likely. And also satellite disruptions are also likely. So yes, it's certainly possible. So rare, the red coronas and then the most common are the green. This is what we see all the time across parts of Canada. But the less common are the purples. And the reds, we are seeing a lot of them tonight.",

And it doesn't have to be a severe solar storm for Canadians to see them, especially in places where you don't have the light pollution. But as he just said, you would normally see it in green. Some of the color colors all over North America have been incredibly spectacular. Not so much here in Canada, though, this time, about 10 miles from us, they had some beautiful purples and pinks in the sky. But unfortunately, we've had some cloud cover here still. So we're going to be a little bit more patient and see if it comes out.The issue here, Michael, is that in 1989, they had a blackout in Quebec, that is a Canadian province, actually just over the river behind me. And that was a lot of chaos. That happened in 1989. But what's fascinating here is that they just didn't have the sensors, the monitors, the satellite, certainly technology that they have now than they had in 1989. So they are better prepared, they're better prepared and all the hydro grids all across Canada and the United States. They do not believe that that would occur this time around for various reasons, in terms of the infrastructure backups they have in place and the new technology. Having said that, as Chad clearly explained, this is a very strong solar storm. So they're thinking a bit out of the box here and wondering, OK, what could go wrong? And they were trying to foresee all the possibilities. So far, so good, midnight, just after midnight, where I am here, Eastern Time. Apparently, there's supposed to be some really strong -- some solar storm activity coming in the next hour or two in this location in Canada. We'll see if the clouds clear up.

Good to see you.All right, let's talk more about this and break it all down with Sean Dahl. He's the senior forecaster at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. Busy night for you. This was ranked of four on a scale of one to five. Now it is a G5, the top number. What makes it a five? And should we be more worried than we were when it was a four? SHAWN DAHL, SERVICE COORD., NOAA SPACE WEATHER PREDICTION CENTER: Michael, thanks for having us. Glad to be here and sharing this information with your viewing audience. Yes, this is -- we were anticipating a G4. But that was still significant at the severe levels. Why? Because we haven't issued G4 storm watch since 2005. So it's been a long time. That's because we had a pretty high level of confidence. These were going to be Earth directed coronal mass ejections as Chad described, that we're going to reach Earth. What we didn't know for sure is the timing. We're trying to forecast something from 93 million miles away. Very difficult to get that down to the hour, so please take those timings with some caution. But we didn't get a CME arrival. We don't know if it was several hitting together because some were moving faster than others. But in either case, we did have a chance for the G5. But we do not issue watches for G5 because there's too much unknowns. And sure as heck, we did meet the G5 at least twice now.",

Some of the things that have been stalled inhibit the induced currents that happened from the storms on the high voltage transmission line, they called inhibitors.And some of those have been spun up and they're being utilized and to deflect and kind of keep the current from building up which is harmful to transformers.",

      "sentences": "The good news is if you're an average cellphone user, this solar activity may not affect your devices very much. The exact reasons for that are really interesting and it gives you a fascinating glimpse into how our everyday technology really works, not to mention the science behind the storm.As you've been hearing all day, the sun has been sending radiation toward Earth that interacts with our magnetic sphere. That's what's causing these roars everywhere. And a byproduct of all that can be fluctuations in the upper atmosphere that scatter or even block radio transmissions in certain specific frequencies. Now, this shouldn't interfere with cellular signals, because those run on different frequencies than the ones we're talking about here, your calls and mobile data should still go through. But what can these storms affect, while the list includes satellites in orbit, as well as any signal trying to reach them through the ionosphere, that's the upper layer of the atmosphere we were just talking about. So that could mean glitchy or less accurate GPS readings on ships or airplanes. But again, cell phone GPS might be less affected because phones usually rely on cell towers in addition to satellites to get a location fix. Now shortwave radios will likely have issues, that's because in order to increase their range, people typically try to bounce them off the underside of the ionosphere. With the storms, that obviously gets a lot harder. Lots of commercial businesses and government agencies use this type of communication and so do amateur ham radio operators, all of these users could be affected. Now there is one way in which the storm could indirectly affect your electronic devices. And that's if the disruptions cause widespread power grid issues. Utility companies say they're monitoring the situation and are prepared, but storm watchers have upgraded this to the most intense level that exists in the U.S. government's classification system. And that could mean overloaded transformers and grid disruption. If that happens, it could cut power to cell towers, data centers and other critical infrastructure. But then it just becomes more of a garden variety power outage problem, not really a direct issue stemming from the solar storm. And all of these providers have backup generators. So any interruptions in cell service should be limited if it happens at all. The bigger problem for most of us in that scenario, it'll probably be how to keep our devices charged.

The best case scenario is that the scientists at the Space Weather Prediction Center swept sea there in Colorado and others around the world, learn on how to protect, you know, humanity for future storms going forward. Even just in the Obama administration.Generation ago, Craig Fugate, who was the head of FEMA took over and said, what do we do if there is a G5 storm that hits the U.S.? And most people said, what is that? Well, they didn't know what space weather was, just 10, 15 years ago. The field has come so far since then. But there are so many different vulnerabilities depending on whether we're in the bad place, a wrong spot at the wrong time. There are the GPS satellites that fly very high, 15,000 miles up, and they have these geo synchronized atomic clocks that are down to the billions of the second that affect everything from airline travel to financial transactions. That can be vulnerable there as well. We talked about what happens on power grids, the alternating current that runs much of the North American grid. If it gets mixture with direct current from the sun, that could gum up the works and create a massive blackout. So far, no sign of that right now. So far, nothing but giddy sort of wonder at this light show in the sky in Key Largo. I mean, normally, you have to, you know, plan for a decade and go to Iceland or Northern Alaska to enjoy the Aurora Borealis. But it's just as happening everywhere because of that intense energy. We worship the sun. We need it.

Prosecutors setting the stage for star witness, former Trump attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, to take the stand. Cohen is expected to begin testifying on Monday and CNN's Kara Scannell has the latest for us.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Prosecutors star witness Michael Cohen is expected to testify on Monday in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial. Cohen, Trump's former attorney and fixer is at the crux of the criminal case against him. Prosecutors say Cohen paid off adult film star Stormy Daniels on Trump's behalf to kill her story of an alleged affair before the 2016 election. Trump denies the affair. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Somebody paid the lawyer and then paid the lawyer so it was a legal expense that somebody happened to be me. I didn't do the bookkeeping. I didn't even know about it. This is what the case is about. SCANNELL (voice-over): Cohen told his Political Beatdown Podcast co- host on Thursday that he looks forward to testify. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: The sooner this thing starts, the sooner this thing finishes. SCANNELL (voice-over): After a defense request, Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors he wants Cohen to keep quiet about the case before he takes the stand. But he can't issue a gag order on a witness, something Trump expressed frustration about as he left court.",

They can say whatever they want, but I'm not allowed to say anything about anybody. It's a disgrace.SCANNELL (voice-over): Prosecutors called witnesses to the stand to help lay the groundwork for Cohen's upcoming testimony. An AT&amp;T analyst introduced Cohen's phone records. And back on the stand Trump's former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout, testified about Trump's reaction to the release of Daniels story in 2018. Westerhout testified Trump was upset by it and her understanding was that it would be hurtful to his family. She later clarified Trump did not specifically speak about his family in that conversation. Trump's lawyer suggested he made the $130,000 hush money pay off to Daniels in order to protect his family. Meanwhile, prosecutors argue he did it to influence the 2016 election which was two weeks away and came on the heels of the Access Hollywood tape damaging his campaign. TRUMP: And when you're a star they let you do it, you can do anything. SCANNELL (voice-over): Trump's lawyer Susan Necheles asked Westerhout about the process of Trump's signing checks. Westinghouse said Trump would sign them while multitasking, doing things like talking on the phone or meeting with people. She described FedExing the sign checks back to the Trump Organization. Prosecutors used Westerhout to show the chain of command of checks like the one sent to Cohen to reimburse him for the hush money. Cohen testified before Congress about the allegations in 2019. ELIJAH CUMMINGS, FORMER U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT: Donald Trump wrote you a check out of his personal account while he was serving as President of the United States of America to reimburse you for hush money payments.",

Many have already fled other parts of Gaza. An Israeli official telling CNN that the security cabinet's decision is a, quote, green light, end quote, for the war cabinet to expand the operation in Rafah. But we're told this does not mean an imminent expansion. The U.N. says what's already happening and Rafah has displaced more than 100,000 Palestinians.
