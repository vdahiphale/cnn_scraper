Also tonight, a sad note on the anniversary of Dr. King's March on Washington. New details including video and the racist shooting that took three Black lives in Jacksonville this weekend. Also a new update on Idalia now expected to become a major hurricane and on track to hit Florida. CNN's Chad Myers in the Weather Center tracking it. Good evening, everyone. John Berman here, in for Anderson. Whoever first said there is a time and place for everything could not have imagined a day like today. The first of many, it appears in the battle over when to try Donald Trump and company and where. Today in Washington, federal district judge, Tanya Chutkan put the former president's election subversion trial on a fast track on a court calendar packed with other Trump trials. And in Atlanta, former White House chief-of-staff, Mark Meadows took the stand trying to get his Fulton County, Georgia trial moved to federal court. We're going to have more on that in just a moment. First Judge Chutkan is setting a trial date of March 4th of next year, rejecting Special Counsel Jack Smith's January 2nd date and Team Trump's proposal for April 2026. Look at that calendar. Yes, that is Super Tuesday you see there on the fifth and 12 primaries. And yes, that's another trial in New York on the 25th. There is also the Fulton County case, possibly this October. The second E. Jean Carroll defamation trial on the day of the Iowa caucuses, and the classified documents trial proposed for May. Today on \"The Lead\" Jake Tapper asked Republican hopeful and former US attorney, Chris Christie about the date Judge Chutkan set. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One, she gave them another six months to get ready for trial in a single defendant case, and two, she made it quite clear to the Trump legal team, that the public relations games that they and their client play are not going to impact the decisions that she makes in the courtroom.

Meadows said he believed the actions detailed on the Fulton County indictment were part of his official duties and were done at Donald Trump's behest. This included he said setting up the former president's call in which he asked state election officials to find him 11,780 votes. Whatever impact Meadows' testimony today has on his former boss, it is not the only factor. Returning to the question of scheduling, there is this, from Trump attorney Alina Habba, completely undercutting her own legal team's argument that they and their client need time to prepare.

It is a preponderance of the evidence more likely than not, but he's the one who has to persuade the judge that he was actually acting pursuant to his official role.And so he had to make that case, he wanted clearly to make that case as persuasively as he could. He clearly thought the best way he could do that was by testifying himself and telling his story about why this was part of his very broad, official duties. So he is trying hard to get the case removed to federal court, because he clearly thinks that is a better forum for him in terms of the jury pool, most likely. He also, I think, is setting up his argument to have the entire action dismissed if he succeeds first on the removal motion and he has actually already filed papers to dismiss the action because he's entitled, he says, to immunity from this state prosecution, because he was a federal official. So this, if he wins on that, that's the whole ballgame for him. He would never be subject to cross examination at trial, because if he prevails on that motion to dismiss, this case goes away.",

And so the key question here is beyond those things, are you doing something to violate the law? Violate federal law? Violate Georgia State law?

Let's remember, this was not an administration that was very careful about watching that divide between government duties and political duties. This is the same administration that held their nominating convention you know on federal property. So there's many other examples of things like that. So, it wouldn't surprise me that Meadows saw it that way, but the law might see it very differently. BERMAN: So Jessica, there are other defendants who may want to get their trials moved through to federal court, including former President Trump, I guess what January -- so sorry, September 6 is the day that he and his 18 other co-defendants are going to be arraigned.

Your jury pool now is going to be -- there are some counties that feed in there that are going to be a lot more Trump friendly. And so that's why the Trump and his co- defendants here are wanting their case removed. So that's going to be the biggest hurdle for prosecutors.Also likely, we will change the prosecution team because now you're dealing with a lot more federal law, federal issues.

They would have been prepping for this. Trump's lawyer though, John Lauro, he shot back and he said that he has just recently taken on this case.

So I think that's one way to look at it.But she also clearly is aware and cognizant and values the public interest in this particular case. And so even if that March date slips a little bit, which is completely possible, I mean, federal court dates are set, sometimes they can go at right that time, but there could be various things that come up between now and then that have it slip a little bit, but it does seem likely that the trial would begin either in the end of March or April, or certainly this spring, before the election, before the nominating convention.",

I mean, that was not credible as an argument before her. And so statements about it being a show trial, really risk alienating her, and also potentially prejudicing the jury pool, and she specifically said at the conclusion of the hearing today that she is going to be very much watching for statements from the former president and his team that run the risk of tainting the jury pool, making it harder to seat a fair and impartial jury.

Because I think that's really the question now, because we know the indictments haven't changed anything at all.And so we asked an interesting poll question a few months ago that essentially, you know, said, should Trump drop out of the race if, in fact, he is convicted? Most Republicans said he should not. 88 percent said he should not. But I will note that there's 11 percent that said, yes, he should drop out if he is in fact convicted. And then there was an additional 1 percent, I guess, margin of error type of stuff who said he should just dropout anyway even though they're already supporting Donald Trump. And I think the question ultimately is how do you look at that? That 88 percent is very large. That would still leave him in the lead in the primary. But if you jump forward to the general election, if all of a sudden 12 percent of your voters abandon you, that in fact, is a fairly large chunk in a race at this particular point is looking to be quite close between former President Donald Trump and the current President Joe Biden. So I think it's sort of which way do you look at this?",

What we see is most voters agree with the judge on this one.The vast majority of Americans north of 60 percent believe, in fact, we should hold the election before Election Day 2024, not 2026 as Donald Trump wants. Most independents agree with that. The vast majority of Democrats agree with that. Republicans do disagree with that, with, you know, far less than 50 percent believing we should hold the trial before the 2024 election. But even there you see a significant portion saying that we should hold it. So I think the judge is on the side of public opinion here and we'll just have to wait and see what happens, because this is a story that's never been told before and one that we'll find out what exactly occurs.",

I'm not sure going back to and from court makes a difference, necessarily. I think ultimately the only thing that may make a difference if he is, in fact, convicted, and that won't happen, most likely until the primaries are already sewn up. And if that in fact occurs, then I think the real question is what happens in a general election? And I do think that there's the possibility, based upon the polling and what we know about history, is that Donald Trump tends to ebb to his lowest levels of support when he's seen as a loser.

But nevertheless, at the end of the group, I said, OK, no matter who Republicans nominate, do you think that they'll beat Joe Biden? And every person in the group said yes. Polling from CBS News showed 61 percent of Republican voters think Donald Trump would be a lock to beat Joe Biden. They don't yet think that he is risky or unelectable.
