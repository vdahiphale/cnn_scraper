      "sentences": "Tonight on 360, what House Republicans are saying now that they've learned their star witness in the Biden impeachment inquiry, who's already been charged with making up allegations, says he got the dirt he was peddling from Russian intelligence. We're keeping them honest.Also tonight, what we're learning about the Russian-American dual national now being held in Russia and how a 50 dollar charitable donation may have factored in charges that could send her to prison there for 20 years. And breaking news in the lawsuit brought by the parents of Gabby Petito against the parents of Brian Laundrie, the fiance who admitted he killed her. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with breaking news. Just a short time ago, the President's brother, James Biden, finished up more than eight hours of testimony before the House Oversight Committee investigating what some Republicans on the committee have alleged is criminal misconduct by the Biden family. And though that meant Committee Chairman James Comer was tied up for much of that time, the chairman has spent the remainder of the day dodging reporters' questions about the news, which broke last night, about their star witness in their case. His name is Alexander Smirnov. He was charged last week with lying to the FBI when he claimed to acknowledge of corruption by President Biden and his son, Hunter, involving Ukraine. Then last night, court documents revealed that he said he got the bogus smear material from Russian intelligence. Now, we should say at the outset that he is only an alleged liar, not a proven liar. And his claims about ties to Russian intelligence are just that, claims. What is clear, though, is that nothing about all of this bolsters this guy's credibility. Yet House Republicans have made what he told the FBI, documented in what's called an FD 1023 form, the centerpiece of their impeachment inquiry. And in the day or so since the Russian aspect of the story came to light, we've taken the time to uncover yet more examples of just how much credence lawmakers have put in a man and an allegation so much in doubt now tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAT FALLON (R-TX): This is direct evidence of naked corruption and bribery. REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): This is the biggest political corruption scandal, not only in my lifetime, but I would say the past 100 years. Ultimately, accountability for what I believe will uncover the biggest political corruption scandal in our nation's history. REP. ANDREW CLYDE (R-GA): This is the most corrupt president. You just have to read the FBI's FD 1023 form of the interview with this - with the president of Burisma to see that Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, were bribing, were requiring from really extorting Burisma to the tune of $10 million, $5 million for each one of them. I mean, come on. REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): There's just too much evidence in it and it's all documented. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And most significantly, in that same House interview, he said he did not determine whether the underlying Biden bribery claims were true.

So, Anderson, multiple sources they're telling our Evan Perez and Hannah Rabinowitz that it was as far back as 2020 where the FBI had reason to believe that some of these allegations were false. Now, before that, Alexander Smirnov really had been prized by the FBI. He worked with this particular handler for more than a decade. They talked daily.And most important, Anderson, Smirnov had very important relationships that could be of use to the FBI. He had relationships with corrupt foreign business officials, corrupt government officials, and crucially, in the eyes of the FBI, connections with foreign intelligence services. So part of his value was that he did offer this potential window into those intelligence services. But even with those credentials, the FBI was suspicious four years ago. Despite that, though, Anderson, there's no indication that he was actually ever polygraphed, which is typically a standard way the FBI does assess sources. So tonight, the questions do remain that if the FBI had concerns as far back as 2020, if they were unable in that time to corroborate Smirnov's false claims that Joe and Hunter Biden were paid $5 million each in bribes, if they took action to benefit Ukrainian energy company Burisma, if they knew that four years ago, then why did it take until this past summer for the FBI to begin unraveling those alleged lies and eventually charge Smirnov last week.

But as Andrew was saying, there's also a source validation process.Once or twice a year, they have to go through the - here's what happens if we catch you lying. This is your deal. This is how it works. But they can also be tested. Polygraph is one way in this particular case, because the informant's story, not only the story he told, but the idea that they would pay a five million dollar bribe in 2017 when Joe Biden was on his way out and would have no power, that they didn't mention that in the meetings until 2020. I mean, they're looking at this reporting and they're saying there's something wrong with it. You don't really need to polygraph it.

We continue to call on Speaker Johnson and House Republicans to pass the bipartisan deal to secure the border.\" Now, what the White House is referring to there, of course, is that Senate compromise that would have included some of the most or the toughest measures on border security in recent memory.

Even made that emotional appeal a couple of days ago to President Putin himself to intervene and demanded that the body be returned to her, so she could have that funeral and bury him in a humane way in her words.But, those appeals have so far fallen on deaf ears. We still don't really know where Navalny's body is and the authorities are saying it could be a couple of weeks now -- from now until they are ready to even look at the possibility of giving the body over for burial.",

(END VIDEO CLIP) BELL (on camera): Anderson, there have been so many Russian citizens that have died in mysterious circumstances these last few years. Maxim Kuzminov is nowhere near the first. There have been a businessman, the directors of Russian energy giants like Gazprom and LUKOIL. There have been politicians, journalists as well, who've died in circumstances ranging from their falling down a flight of stairs to being defenestrated, poisoned as well, and this inside Russia. But also, of course outside, from India to Spain and France in the past. One of the questions is why Maxim Kuzminov was not better protected. Now, we spoke and interviewed a high-profile dissident here in France last year, who was only given police protection, 24-hour police protection because French authorities had foiled an attempt on his life. It's simply too costly, the resources too great for European Intelligence Services to monitor Russian citizens 24/7. I think it's important to note as well, Anderson, that the Kremlin has denied any knowledge of what might have happened to Maxim Kuzminov, denying any knowledge and involvement in this killing, Anderson.",

Kennedy Jr.'s long-shot bid for the presidency launched new billboards across Michigan today in an effort to try to distance his campaign from Tim Mellon, who is a Republican megadonor who has given money to both the Kennedy super PAC and that of Donald Trump. The ad shows their faces as well as that of President Biden and says, let the best man win, Tim. Now, there are response to billboards like this one from the DNC labeling RFK Jr. has \"Powered by MAGA and Trump.\"New FEC filings show Mellon gave $5 million a piece (ph) last month to the super PACs, backing both Kennedy and Trump.

MCKEND (voice-over): From a Queens Food Pantry to a co-working space in Brooklyn, Kennedy is on the campaign trail, making a pitch to one of the most loyal constituencies of the Democratic Party, black voters.

Just outside a Kennedy campaign Black History Month event, a DNC billboard aims to link Kennedy to MAGA Republicans. KENNEDY JR.: There's a lot of black voters in this country who've been voting, who are taken for granted by the Democratic Party. MCKEND: What do you think that you can offer black voters that Joe Biden cannot? KENNEDY JR.: I've spent 40 years working for economic development, for cleaning up the environment, for health care, for black Americans and Hispanic Americans. I have a long on-track record of making them a (ph) priority. MCKEND (voice-over): Aaron Freeman, whose family has owned Brooklyn staple Sugar Hill Supper Club, has consistently supported Democrats. AARON FREEMAN, SUGAR HILL RESTAURANT &amp; SUPPER CLUB: I'm leaning towards supporting Mr. Kennedy because his family has always been into the rights for the underprivileged.

He said his son was frantic and got very excited, repeatedly telling his father Gabby is gone. He said his son asked, can you help me and told him that he might need a lawyer. Roberta Laundrie, Brian's mother, said in her deposition, she spoke with her son that same day and his voice was very upset, adding, I didn't want to push him, so we just said goodbye. When Brian asked for a lawyer, his father said I asked him why, he wouldn't tell me. After that, Christopher Laundrie said he contacted the family's lawyer. What exactly did the Laundries think their son meant by the word gone? Roberta Laundrie says several possibilities ran through her mind, including that the couple had a fight or perhaps her son had hit Petito and she was going to press charges. When asked if she thought maybe her son had murdered Petito, Roberta Laundrie responded it might have gone through my mind. I can't recall what I was thinking at the time. Laundrie's father said he never thought his son killed Petito. I had no idea what to think, he said. The Laundries were also asked repeatedly why they didn't press their son about what had happened to Gabby, not over the phone and not even in person, after their son showed up back in Florida on September 1, 2021. In Petito's van, without her, they both explained that their lawyer had told them not to question their son about Petito. I was told not to ask, and so I just kept Brian close, kept him home and safe, and didn't talk to him about anything, and hoped for the best, Roberta Laundrie said. The distressing phone calls with their son took place three weeks before Petito's remains were found in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest. The Teton County coroner determined she died from strangulation and ruled it a homicide. In all those weeks that passed since the phone call with their son, the Laundries said they never contacted the Petitos and ignored all the Petito's calls and text messages, at the advice of their lawyer, all of this despite knowing Petito's parents were desperate to find her. JOSEPH PETITO, GABBY PETITO'S FATHER: I'm asking for help from the parents of Brian, and I'm asking for help of the family members and friends of the Laundrie family as well. KAYE (voice-over): In her deposition, Brian's mother said, I was just concerned about my son at the time, and that she figured maybe her parents would pick her up or could come get her. More than a month after Brian Laundrie disappeared from his home, his body was found in a nearby swamp. Police say he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Alongside him, a notebook in which she admitted taking Gabby Petito's life, saying she'd fallen and was in extreme pain. He said he thought it was \"merciful.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",
