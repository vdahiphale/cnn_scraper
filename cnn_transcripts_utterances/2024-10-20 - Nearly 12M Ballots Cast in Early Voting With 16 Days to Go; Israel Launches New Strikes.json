There has, of course, been a lot of speculation as to what that attack, that response would look like, when that might take place.Of course, assumptions that the U.S. is in close coordination with the Israeli military on this. We know that there has been mounting pressure from the Biden administration for Israel to be measured in its response. But these documents, which began circulating online after being posted on Telegram on Friday, appear to show that the U.S. has been trying to gain intelligence on how Israel is preparing to respond. This has been described by one U.S. official as deeply concerning. Another source, of course, confirming the authenticity of these documents, which are dated October 15th and 16th. They are, of course, marked top secret and outlined on the document. Of course, CNN is not showing any excerpts of this document, not quoting it directly. But it does appear to show that this was for the attention of the U.S.'s key allies, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. And among the preparations that have been listed in these documents is the movement and reorganization of munitions by the Israeli military. They've also described CNN appearing to prepare for a strike against Iran with air force preparations as well. Again, CNN is not directly quoting from this. It is more of a broad assessment of what is featured in these documents. But this has triggered immense concern within the U.S. government. Of course, investigations are taking place. This has, of course, triggered an FBI investigation as well, though they have not yet commented on this. But that speculation and questions around how Israel will respond to continue to remain, particularly now, as you heard there from Prime Minister Netanyahu, saying that Israel will not be deterred despite the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, clearly the intention there still to focus on Iran, on its proxies in the region and, of course, Hamas in Gaza.",

Well, Sinwar, who's seen as the architect of the October 7th attacks on Israel, was killed by Israeli troops in Gaza on Wednesday after more than a year of devastating Israeli pounding of the territory. The final moments of the Hamas leader captured on a drone camera showed him sitting alone in a wrecked building before lashing out at the drone with a stick. Hamas, which is reeling from the killing, has accused the Israeli military of blatant lies and a failed theatrical performance in its portrayal of Sinwar during that past 12 months. In a statement, the group said the Israeli army was humiliated by the man, the statement calls Commander Sinwar and his brothers. The organization says Sinwar was killed while engaging in the battlefield after having spent the past year moving across various combat fronts in Gaza at the forefront of, quote, \"our brave people's resistance.\" Matthew Chance, CNN Tel Aviv.

But most have involved flights on or near the runways of a major airport. Rarely are these close calls in midair.This incident was on Wednesday but is just now coming to light after new data from flight tracking site Flightradar24. It shows an American Airlines flight lining up to land at Austin Bergstrom International Airport in Texas when a private Cessna 182 started to turn toward the commercial flight putting the planes nose to nose. Flightradar24 says the American flight passed over the Cessna separated by only 400 feet. We're talking a little more than the length of a football field. The air traffic control recording from LiveATC.Net details that the American pilots received an in-cockpit alert of an impending collision called a resolution advisory which requires immediate action by the pilots. Now, this investigation is just beginning but the FAA says the Cessna was operating under visual flight rules. That does not require constant communication with air traffic control. You may remember that Austin was the site of another near collision. In February of last year, a FedEx flight nearly landed on top of a departing Southwest flight that was obscured by dense fog. Investigators said the quick reaction of the FedEx crew saved the day and the lone air traffic controller in the tower simply could not see the problem playing out in front of him.

But to the extent that labor organizes, gets together and makes decisions in terms of whether or not their dealings with the company are fair. Employees have families. Employees are not CEOs and executives where they're making millions of dollars a year.

And so when you have employees that come together and really use their muscle to say we're not working unless we think the benefits are fair and appropriate to our families, it makes a difference. And it made a difference here and it continues to make a difference in companies and in governmental sectors throughout the United States economy with respect to unions getting together, organizing, flexing their muscle, by saying make deals fair, allow us to have terms and conditions of employment where we can certainly live the lives and quality of lives that we want to live.

There was a prior deal that included, I believe, a 30% increase and a six-thousand-dollar bonus that was rejected by the membership.And so this sweetening it, although they wanted 40%, they get 35%. It's now moved to $7,000, which is the bonus. They've sweetened the retirement benefits because remember, people can't work forever. So to the extent that you're not working forever, you need something to retire upon. The pension benefit has been really increased, although one was taken away, you know, years ago that employees were not happy about it.
