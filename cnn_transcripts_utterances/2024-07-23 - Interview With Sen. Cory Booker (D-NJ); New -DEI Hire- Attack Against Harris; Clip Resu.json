In 2021, she was charged with leading diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from Central America to the US. Additionally, as we and others reported at the time, bipartisan border legislation negotiated with one of the Senate's most conservative members failed earlier this year at the former president's behest because he wanted to deny President Biden any election year victory, particularly on immigration. The former president also talked about his vice president pick on Tuesday's call saying, he'd still have chosen Senator JD Vance, had he known he'd be running against Vice President Harris, quoting him now, \"I'd do the same pick. He's doing really well. He has really caught on.\" Speaking of Senator Vance, this clip of him surfaced recently is getting a lot of attention today.

But when people go to identifying folks, they used to be blame us of being the party of identity politics, but it seems like the Republicans are doing a lot of that right now, where they're using race and gender and whether or not you have a child or not as a disqualifying factor.
