Up to 20 inches of rain has fallen in parts of south Florida the past few hours with more in the forecast. Well, that led to a flash water emergency, the highest possible level of flood warning.So, what you're seeing here is the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport, which is partially underwater. Right now, we know the airport will be closed at least until noon today. The train service between Miami and Fort Lauderdale has been put on hold. The sea at Fort Lauderdale plans to issue a local state of emergency or airboats and high water vehicles are set to join rescue efforts. So, for the latest, we go to meteorologist Britley Ritz here in Atlanta, who's keeping an eye on all this. Britley, take us through what you're seeing and what's still in store. BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, Kim, flood warnings are still in effect until 8 o'clock Eastern Time for Broward County, where areas have picked up almost 20 inches, if not more. Now, mind you, those are estimated so they can still change. Preliminary totals, Dania Beach picking up almost 14 inches over the past 24 hours. And you'll see the pinks nearly 20 inches, 22.5 reported again estimated at the airport. If that's the case, we wind up with 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 5,000-year event. And some of these locations like Fort Lauderdale picking up more than their average over a seven-month period. So, here we are, with the rain chances finally tapering back. We still have a few showers. And once that sun comes up, I'm sure we'll see a few more fire up. So, we have additional rainfall expected. But the bulk of that moisture now associated with the low coming into the gulf. So, you'll see that right from the panhandle back into parts of Louisiana. This continues on through the rest of your Thursday and into Friday, very scattered by the time we roll into late Friday. Regardless, we still have more rain. And here it is through Friday, picking up an additional inch to possibly two inches of rain on the east coast of Florida. Again, the bulk of it will be concentrated over toward the Gulf Coast up toward Mobile with an additional two to four inches of rain. Flooding likely a possibility there, too. On top of it, the threat for severe weather with the spin of that area of low pressure, we wind up with isolated tornadoes from the Gulf, right back down into Florida. On the opposite end of things, on the ridge, we get back into the plains right on up into the northeast. We have record-highs and we broke some of them yesterday, 65 possible records this week from the Midwest back on into the Northeast. Look at the numbers here. Temperatures well above where they should be tend almost 15 degrees above where their normal isn't in some cases 20, 85 degrees in Philadelphia on Friday, 70, that's when the front starts to move through, as we roll into the weekend.

And when it makes landfall in the coming hours, Ilsa is expected to be one of the most powerful storms to hit the region in more than a decade. The storm is currently headed toward the coast with the strength of a Category Four hurricane. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology warns it could reach Category Five strength before landfall. Authorities are piling up the sandbags and residents are being urged to get to safer ground. Emergency services have been checking in on remote aboriginal communities, mines and tourist sites to warn them of the potential chaos ahead. An appeals court issued a ruling a short time ago on the fate of a key abortion medication drug in the U.S. It decided to partially grant the Justice Department's request to freeze a judge's ruling that invalidated the FDA approval of mifepristone, but it left in place parts of the order that halted changes to make the abortion pill more easily accessible. Well, that effectively will make the drug harder to obtain as the legal process plays out. And the case could ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Louisville, Kentucky is mourning the lives lost in Monday's bank shooting. Hundreds gathered Wednesday evening for a vigil to honor and remember the victims. Five people were killed by a bank employee who opened fire on his coworkers.

But not just protests, as you said, we will see strikes, as well, and the garbage collectors have just said that they will begin striking in Paris today and they have lined-up bins in front of the Constitutional Council, which is France's equivalent of the Supreme Court.Now, they've done this to block the entrance to the Council. And the reason this is significant is because tomorrow the Constitutional Council will be voting on the law. Now, they will either green light it or they may deem that parts of it or indeed the whole of it is unconstitutional. Now, if they do green light it, the law should go into effect in September, but we'll just have to wait and see what they decide. Now, meanwhile, 11,000 police officers are set to be deployed across France. And according to police intelligence, we think that that radical minority, that violent minority, will be once again taking part in the protests. So, I think we can expect scuffles again today. Now, a lot of people are asking what happens after the Constitutional Council's ruling? Will this mean the end of protests? But a lot of the trade unions have said, even though they'll respect the council's decision, whatever it is, they will continue to protest. We probably won't see the same scale as protests, they will probably be a bit smaller, but they will be happening, nonetheless. Now, even if they do die down eventually, we must talk about Macron and how weakened he has been by, you know, this pension reform. He is still in the first year of his second term. He's got four years left, and he has ambitious reform plans. But a lot of people are saying, how is he going to push those through when he doesn't have a parliamentary majority and he no longer has popular opinion on his side. Kim?",

The videos demonstrate a horrifying new level of depravity. The year-long war already marked by immeasurable human suffering.Now, because they're so graphic CNN has made the editorial decision not to air those videos, but we're about to show several still images from them which are obviously disturbing in their own right. CNN's Ben Wedeman has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In a war not short of images of brutality and horror, two videos purporting to show acts of unimaginable barbarism. Too gruesome to air in this series of still frames, a man wearing military fatigues is seen using a knife to cut off the head of another man in army uniform. The victim is seen wearing a yellow armband typically worn by Ukrainian soldiers. From the voices on the recording, it seems the victim was still alive as the beheading began. The perpetrators' identities also hidden, but he's seen wearing a white tie on his leg, a means of identification often worn by Russian fighters. Ukrainian authorities say they're working to uncover where and when the incident might have taken place, as well as trying to establish the victim's identity and that of the other men in the video. This is something that no one in the world can ignore, says President Zelenskyy, how easily these beasts kill. This video of the execution of a Ukrainian PoW, the world must see it. (03:40:01) Asked about the video during a daily call with journalists, the Kremlin spokesman acknowledged the footage was terrible, but added a caveat. First of all, said Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in the world of fakes that we inhabit, we need to check the veracity of this footage. At about the same time, another video also emerged on social media, this one believed to have been filmed in the last few days purporting to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying next to the destroyed military vehicle. Voices speaking in Russian claimed the soldiers had had their heads cut off. Images on the video appeared to show the soldiers hands and also been cut off. Pro-Russian social media posters said the video was shot nearby Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, scene of the war's fiercest fighting. But CNN is unable to confirm the location. The United Nations said it was appalled by the videos. But 14 months into Russia's full scale invasion, reiterated these were not isolated incidents. MATILDA BOGNER, U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING MISSION IN UKRAINE:  We found that there have been significant and violations on both sides, summary executions, torture and so on. And we call on both parties to the conflict to hold the perpetrators to account. WEDEMAN (on camera):  One Ukrainian intelligence official says he knows the motivation for the release of these videos -- to frighten and intimidate. That at a time when Ukraine readies its forces to launch a major offensive aimed at driving Russia out of the country. Wedeman, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One is blurry, the other has very few sort of location features, which would make it possible to geolocate it. We are hearing multiple calls for accountability, full investigations including from outside Ukraine.A spokesman for the E.U. saying, this should be fully investigated. But if it is proven to be Russia committing these crimes, this is yet another brutal reminder, she said about the inhumane nature of Russian aggression inside Ukraine, stepping up calls to ostracize Russia. Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, saying this shows Russia is worse than ISIS, saying they should be kicked out of Ukraine and the United Nations, something that they have been calling for us. Russia assumes the presidency of the Security Council. Ben Wedeman pointed this out, but interesting to note again that several Ukrainian officials have pointed out that it's not just about the crimes shown in these videos. It's the videos themselves that Russia may be looking to extract propaganda value from the one official with President Zelenskyy's office called as a sigh of -- a psychological operation designed to stoke fear and intimidate, although she did say that that was not going to work. As for the Kremlin, that reaction, saying that, you know, the veracity of the videos needs to be checked. That very much tallies from what we continue to see from Russia when it comes to -- so, for example, the atrocities in Bucha, the Kremlin continuing to claim that the images and videos coming out of Bucha are also fake. So, that is something to watch as the investigations into this continue.",

Another proposal, up to two thirds of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. would be electric by 2032, the end result, cutting car pollution that contributes to climate change in half.The EPA says transportation accounts for almost a third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. but right now, only about 4% of Americans own an electric vehicle. And a recent poll suggested U.S. consumers are still skeptical about them as the U.S. lines behind Europe and China in terms of making the switch. For more, we're joined by Simon Mui, the director of the Clean Vehicles and Fuels Group at the National Resources Defense Council. And he is in Berkeley, Calif. Thanks so much for being here with us. So, this targets two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. would be zero emission or plug in hybrid within a decade. What effect would that have? SIMON MUI, NATIONAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL:  Thanks, Kim. Yes, this is a major, major step by the Biden administration to really cut our climate pollution as he said it would more than half the pollution coming from passenger vehicles by 2032. And the board (ph) would set the U.S. on a course to really tackle the biggest source of climate pollution, which is transportation as well as yield tremendous amount of public health benefits. And by our look at the proposal, it is going to reduce over eight gigatons of emissions. And to put that into the context for your viewers, it's -- that's equivalent to 85 coal-fired plants operating for the next 30 years, the pollution being eliminated from -- at that level. So, it is one of probably the biggest action today that the U.S. has taken on climate emission.",
