And that's according to a senior administration official that source says Mr. Biden is angry over the killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in an Israeli air strike in Gaza earlier this week, and will convey that message to Mr. Netanyahu if President Biden is angry about the deadly strike the Founder of World Central Kitchen is furious. And he's not accepting Israel's misidentification excuse. Jose Andres is accusing Israel of systematically and deliberately targeting the aid workers. CNN's Brian Todd has more.

The U.S. President set to share his frustrations with the Israeli Prime Minister, frustrations that have been boiling for months now as we have been watching publicly as the White House has been growing increasingly vocal, increasingly critical of the Israeli military's handling of the war in Gaza and Prime Minister Netanyahu stewardship of that very war. But what we are not expecting for now are major shifts in U.S. policy towards Israel. Even as we have seen that rhetoric of ratcheting up from the White House including from President Biden, who expressed his outrage earlier this week at the killing of those seven World Central Kitchen workers. We have also watched as the United States has continued to stand by Israel's war in Gaza, continuing to support Israel's fight against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and also continuing to supply the Israeli military with additional weapons shipments over the course of even just the last several weeks. From the Israeli Prime Minister's perspective as well, he has made clear that he will not bow to U.S. pressure, particularly on the prospects of a ground offensive in Rafah. The Israeli Prime Minister characterizing that ground defensive as essential to taking out what he has described as Hamas' last bastion inside of Gaza. Now amid this external pressure, this pressure from the United States, the Israeli Prime Minister is also facing increasing domestic political pressure. We have watched growing protests here in Israel, although still not of the kind of substantial number that we saw before October 7th. And now is a Benny Gantz Netanyahu's chief political rival a member of Israel's war cabinet are calling for early election saying that he would like to see elections by September before the one year anniversary of this war, the Israeli Prime Minister not exceeding to that call so far, but this is another way of ratcheting up the pressure on Netanyahu. But for now, there is no real mechanism, no obvious way in which this current coalition government would actually fall and so despite all of that pressure, for now, Netanyahu very much firm in his position as Prime Minister, Eleni.",

The Israeli Defense Forces says it's going to increase recruitment and is calling up reservists for its air defense, and the IDF is temporarily suspending leave for its combat units. This comes as Iran has vowed to retaliate after it accused Israel of bombing its embassy complex in Syria on Monday. Now the U.N. Security Council has failed to condemn that strike. A statement expressing condemnation was drafted by Russia but diplomat said at a meeting on Tuesday, a U.S. backed by France and Britain told other members of the Security Council many of the facts of what happened in Damascus remain unclear. Our rescue operations are working around the clock in Taiwan after being struck by the strongest earthquake in decades. The 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the east side of the island on Wednesday morning. More than 700 people are still stranded and dozens are still unaccounted for. Many are in hard to reach mountainous areas. At least 10 people have died and the number of injured has now surpassed 1000. Officials are warning that aftershocks as high as seven magnitude may continue until the end of the week. CNN's Ivan Watson is on the scene in Hualien in Taiwan.

That is according to an investigation by 972 Magazine and Local Calls citing Israeli intelligence officials. The online publication, which is run by Palestinians and Israelis, said that according to the officials, the AI based tool is called Lavender. And although it's known to have a 10 percent error rate, human review of the targets it comes up with was cursory at best. Now the IDF did not dispute the tool exists. But it denied AI was being used to identify suspected terrorists. Now CNN cannot independently verify what's in this investigation. We have author of the investigation, Yuval Abraham, who writes the results, as the sources testified is that thousands of Palestinians, most of them women and children or people were not involved in the fighting were wiped out by Israeli airstrikes, especially during the first weeks of the war because of the AI programs decisions. Yuval joins us now live from Jerusalem, Yuval, great to have you with us incredible investigation. And I just want to read a small piece of your report and you say Lavender learns to identify characteristics of known Hamas and PIJ operatives, whose information was fed into the machine as training data, and then to locate these same characteristics, also called features among the general population, the sources explained. Now an individual farms have several different incriminating features will reach a high rating, and that's automatically becomes a potential target for assassination.

One source says that he calls these garbage targets. So when I heard what happened to the seven aid workers, I thought that -- you know I thought Israel just did not know their internationals. But I immediately recalled - - you know the case in the beginning of March with the flower truck when 112 Palestinians around the aid trucks were killed. The Israeli military said that it shot at some of them. I recorded \"The Guardian\" reporting that 14 cases like this of Palestinians being shot around aid trucks happened before. And I was wondering, is the Israeli military saying this and issuing this apology because of what happened or because of the identity of the victims.

In some of them really taught me like, they feel directly responsible for the unnecessary killing of dozens of families inside houses. And they did not think that the targets that they were bombing using this AI lavender system, or at least not all of the targets that they were bombing -- the people that justified -- you know killing so many Palestinians. And one source said something that really stuck with me, like he said. That he said even if all the targets that the machine creates, have some links to Hamas, even when the policy is so permissive, he said he felt it was so permissive that it clearly had an element of revenge in it, meaning that these extremely high collateral damage degrees authorizing you know to attack houses for -- according to the military unimportant targets.
