We'll have Israel's response and the reaction. Then tensions soar in the region, Iran promising revenge as it accuses Israel of attacking its consulate in Syria and killing 13 people. Plus, dozens of people killed in a nightclub fire in Istanbul, we have the very latest on the investigation. But first this evening, governments around the world are demanding answers as well as accountability after Israeli strikes in Gaza killed seven aid workers who were delivering desperately-needed food amid a looming famine. World Central Kitchen says its convoy came under fire in Deir al Balah despite previous coordination with the IDF. Now, at least, two of the three cars were branded with the charity's logo. CNN has been able to geo-locate the videos from the scene, finding the strikes spanned a distance of more than 2 kilometers. World Central Kitchen calls it an unforgivable targeted attack. But Israel's Prime Minister says it was unintentional, and is promising to investigate. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says a record number of humanitarian workers had been killed in this war. And he says, they must be protected. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And now, this is sort of a doublespeak, two different narratives of what's happening inside the Gaza Strip. And remember that we as international media can't get inside to see for ourselves. So, it's been incredibly difficult to make sense of it all. On one hand, what we hear from Israeli authorities about the lengths that they're going to, about the aid that they're managing to get in. And on the other, U.N. aid agencies that have been desperately saying, look, it isn't enough. The difficulties are huge and Israel needs to do more. And on the question of the figure that he just mentioned, it is 196 aid workers since the start of the war in Gaza that have been killed in the occupied  territories. That is Isa, three times higher than any death toll for aid workers in any conflict in a single year ever. And it gives you an idea of just how dangerous this is. And of course, of the great difficulties that these aid organizations are having in coordinating things with Israeli forces. This latest tragedy highlights something that aid agencies have been trying to attract attention to for many months, but have had difficulty cutting through so much of what we've heard and continuing to keep up the pressure in order that Israeli authorities listened to them clearly and act in a way that will finally bring some aid to Gaza. And I think it's important to remember here, Isa, the role that the World Central Kitchen has played. It's been crucial in bringing aid in through the sea because the land crossings have been so tightly controlled, and the trickle of aid coming in through the land has been so little. Who will feel the breach now that they're saying they're not going to operate there is one of the big questions.",

They have a variety of options they can for one, simply requested that their affiliates around the region, whether that be Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, militias in Syria and Iraq to step up their attacks either on Israel or on U.S. forces deployed for instance, in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere.

That is the most senior IRGC leader to be assassinated since the United States in the beginning of 2019 killed Qasem Soleimani; the head of the Quds Force, the foreign operations wing of the IRGC. And therefore, this is sort of -- we've seen certainly since December of last year, a series of Israeli attacks on senior Iranian officials, IRGC officials in Syria in particular. But this is the most senior -- and the fact that this happened in Damascus in what was officially an Iranian diplomatic complex. This is technically in diplomatic terms, this is a strike on Iran itself. It's going to be very difficult for the Iranians who have always stressed strategic patience, sort of striking at the time and the place of their choosing. It's going to be very difficult for them to maintain any semblance of deterrence against Israel and the United States, if you want to mention them as well. In the aftermath of this, if they don't respond in some way or other, they will come out of this looking weak, and certainly, the Iranians don't want to appear weak before its allies in the region.",

The U.S. has repeatedly said, including as recently as today, with Secretary of State Blinken speaking in Paris, that it is making an investment, a long-term investment in Israel's security. And these military sales are a part of that longstanding defense relationship that the U.S. has with Israel. And so, we're not seeing any signs that even though the administration repeatedly has called out Israel on its operations in Gaza and how they need to rein them in, and how they need to do more to protect civilians, there are no signs that they're willing to temper their arms relationship with the Israelis. And no signs that they plan to restrict or condition military aid in any way. There have been some discussions at various levels about how they could do that and what that would look like. But in practice, in reality, it just does not seem like President Biden specifically is willing to do that at this moment. And that is because they feel as though that could undermine the totality of the United States' alliances around the world. Basically that if you undercut the military and arms relationship with the Israelis, then that could lead to some, you know, hesitation, among other U.S. allies that the U.S. is going to continue to support them as well. And so, with this F-15 sale that we are seeing, the U.S. has committed preliminarily to providing them with $18 billion worth of these fighter jets, something that comes at a very delicate moment when these arms sales are under extreme scrutiny.

If you look over here, it wasthe lower floors of this 16-story building that the fire ripped through initially, and then you can see on the side of the building how high it managed to climb up in a very short period of time. We spoke to a neighbor in this building right here who told us that she initially heard screams coming from the building, she thought that it was her own building that was on fire and in a panic, when she couldn't initially open her own door, she ended up climbing down the balcony. What is especially odd and I'll just take you over here and show you kind of the neighborhood. This is a very residential area. This is where people live. There's like one coffee shop on the corner over there, but there's not much else. So, this is an odd place for there to be a nightclub. We also spoke to some neighbors who live across the street, and they said that there were many people who didn't like the fact that there was a nightclub there in the first place. There are plenty of firefighters on scene right now, the Istanbul police chief is actually doing a tour of the area. As you mentioned, eight people had been detained, and that includes the business manager of the nightclub. It also includes the person responsible for the metal work renovations being done inside of the club at the time. We have also spoken to plenty of neighbors in this area, who say that look, they've been in the club, they know what it looks like, it goes down a few floors, there is only one way in and one way out. And so, this is the kind of place that if there was going to be a fire, you would not want to be inside. And obviously, in this case, this has especially tragic circumstances. This building was inspected by the Fire Department according to Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, newly re-elected by the way. In 2018, by the local authorities, the local Besiktas is the name of the district here and the Fire Department. Now, that this has happened, though, of course, there are going to be questions about how this kind of a building, given that there were, you know, only one way in, one way out, could have gotten the sign off from the Fire Department as suitable for this kind of a night-life establishment, considering how many people they likely would have packed in there, Isa.",

And in my conversations with Trump's advisers, they do tell me that they are confident that he has a shot at winning both of these states in a general election. They said, they have been looking at polling that shows him and Biden neck and neck in these states. But of course, it's still very early, and that's why you're seeing such an aggressive push for him. Now, as for the broader themes of what we're going to hear from Donald Trump, both here in Michigan and in Wisconsin, it's really about the issues that helped propel him to his victory in these states in 2016. And that's immigration and crime. The event here has been labeled by the Trump campaign as Biden's, \"Bloodbath\" or \"Bloodbath on the Border\" is how they've been calling it. And it's really, using a term -- a controversial term, I should say, that Donald Trump used several weeks ago that received a lot of backlash from both Democrats and Republicans when he used it to describe the impact on the auto industry and the country overall if Biden were to win in November. He's also going to be highlighting a lot of violent crimes or alleged violent crimes, I should say, committed by undocumented immigrants here in the United States, including -- and that is a family of Ruby Garcia. She was someone who was recently killed here in Michigan by an undocumented immigrant.

That latest gag order was really to protect family members of the judge, of the court, as well as the Manhattan district attorney who is bringing this case against Donald Trump.

But look, this is exactly the playbook we have seen from Donald Trump time and again. He attacks the prosecutors and those bringing these charges against him as being political. He argued this morning on Truth Social that the judge is corrupt, that he should be recused -- and that he should recuse himself, I should say, and that the case should be thrown out. This is what he's using to try and convince his supporters that his legal issues and his legal battles are, in his eyes, bogus, of course.

Now, the same Florida Supreme Court, rather, also approved a ballot amendment which will put the issue before voters and could expand access to reproductive health care here in Florida. Now, the state is about to join several other states across the south that really severely restrict, if not ban abortions. About 84,000 women last year, received reproductive services here in Florida with a number of women coming to Florida from neighboring states that have abortion -- restrictions on abortions. Now, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, HE was here in South Florida this morning for an event on reproductive health care. And he talked about the ruling in the context of IVF care in the state of Alabama, as well as the overall debate that's taking place here in the U.S. when it comes to medication abortion services.

But Isa, as you can imagine, both of these rulings, the decision to allow this six-week ban to take effect in 30 days, as well as the fact that voters will be the ones that decide on this constitutional amendment ballot, you can expect all of those issues to play out politically come November as some Democrats here in Florida said, they expect to campaign on this issue and on the ballot amendment.

As you would have heard, Israel hasn't claimed responsibility for the attack, but it has argued right here on CNN that the target was, \"A military building off Quds force\".

It no longer can sustain its military presence in countries like Syria or Lebanon or Iraq, where it actually is strategically very important for Iran to have a presence. And so, it is very likely that we will see a response. But I think the response is likely to be in line with Iran's traditional way of retaliating, which is indirect and often through his partners and proxy.
