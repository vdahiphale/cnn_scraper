DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): I think things are moving in the right direction. One of the things I hate about Washington, D.C., is how quickly people get themselves whipped into a thick lather in opposition to everything. Nobody really wants to get to yes in this town, and that meant early Democratic reaction to Speaker Johnson's plan was pretty negative. I am grateful that they have, I think, taken a couple deep breaths, understood what we're trying to do, makes a ton of sense, and I do expect a decent number of them will support it when it hits the floor.",

And so I -- what I think is different is an understanding that as we get closer to the end of this journey, of course it's going to require some votes on both sides of the aisle. Maybe I don't love that idea, but the reality is that the Democrats control the Senate, the Republicans control the House. To fund government, we're going to need a bipartisan vote. We're inching closer to that, which means that those hard-liners, I think, will be in less of a position to let perfect be the enemy of the good.",

I think so much of the frustration on the Republican side has been that the administration has not laid out what is the strategic plan. Exactly what are these dollars going for? What's the accountability? How are those dollars tied to a definition of victory? If we have a strategic conversation, and I know that may take a few days, but we should not allow the failures of the administration over the last 18 months to force Congress into making yet another bad spending decision.

And those people say that they will not go back home if, on the other side of the border, the threat from Hezbollah to do exactly what Hamas did on October 7th.

We heard Mike McCaul, after being in Israel, talk this weekend about considerations that the Israeli government is making to at least agree to part of what Hamas is saying it wants for the hostages back. What do we know this morning? RAVID: I think it's still a moving target. Meaning, we are every day we are - we're betting to the point of almost, almost, almost, and then we're not there. And this is -- this has been the case, I think, for something like two weeks. There were several ideas on the table. Several proposals that were discussed.
