And we were like, well, come on, they - they've got to have some ounce of common sense. Let's - let's sit down and talk. Well, that was always a frustration for us.

And certain cold cases in recent years have been - have been solved because of that. So, we just want, you know, this intransigence by Boulder Police. We just don't understand.You know, I've done a lot of wrongful conviction cases over the years, most notably the West Memphis Three case Paradise Lost, which we've talked about in the past. The number one thing that leads to wrongful conviction is police tunnel vision. They get an idea early on and they can't move off of it. That is what happened in this case. But if you look at the autopsy report, if you look at the forensic evidence, which we do a deep dive on, it - to me it's indisputable that this was the work of an intruder and completely absurd to think the family did it.

But, fortunately, I'm there for you, OK.You know, those two justices really personify the ideological and political gulf that this Supreme Court, you know, liberal Kagan, conservative Alito. And they've really been going at it, especially, you know, beginning with the day right after Donald Trump won the White House back, they were really escalating the hypotheticals. The two of them are, you know, really, for their respective sides, you know, as sharp-tongued and piercing as it - as it goes when they're questioning the lawyers standing in the well of the courtroom. And they're both very aware of where the other justices are to try to figure out who's in play and open to persuasion. And the day after the election, there was a real competition on several hypotheticals going back and forth. They were trying to top each other. And at one point Justice Kagan said - normally she doesn't even refer to Justice Alito, who's - she doesn't look at him, who's sitting right next to her. She just goes after his hypotheticals. And she looks out at the spectators at one point and says, you know, sometimes we really enjoy this. And Chief Justice John Roberts says a bit under his breath, \"only sometimes.\" Anyway, I think we're going to see more of that and more of that coming once Donald Trump actually takes the White House. But I should say, John, next week we have a really important case about transgender rights for minors who've been denied any kind of gender affirming care in Tennessee because of a law that was passed there in 2023. The Biden administration is defending that law, John. And if ever there's a real target for Sam Alito, it's the Biden administration's lawyers when they appear. And if there's ever a subject for real sympathy from Justice Kagan, it's when the Biden administration stands up there. So, I think we're going to see a lot of tension when that case is argued next Wednesday over Tennessee's ban on transgender care. And then after that, John, when a new Trump solicitor general comes in to defend Trump positions, they'll reverse roles and it will be Justice Alito being more sympathetic to the government's position and Justice Kagan trying to pin that lawyer against the wall, John.",
