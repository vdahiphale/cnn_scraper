He does seem to be out for revenge in a second term, he is explicitly sort of telling his supporters that they will be redeemed, he will be redeemed because he will seek revenge in a second term.This would make America not a democracy anymore. It would make it an autocracy. The idea that the most powerful person in America would be jailing Alvin Bragg, as you heard Bannon say. It is very concerning.

Is Steve Bannon going to be in the administration, in a potential Trump White House? I don't know. But it's clear he's getting this advice. I think big picture, what's been clear over the last eight years is that this is a country that's governed by a constitution, but also a lot of norms that are unwritten. And there are a lot of norms that just are established and maintained by the goodwill of the people that we elect. And there's no guarantee moving forward that norms stay as they are or-- and again, this is to the Rubio point. Rubio thinks norms are being violated. Right?
