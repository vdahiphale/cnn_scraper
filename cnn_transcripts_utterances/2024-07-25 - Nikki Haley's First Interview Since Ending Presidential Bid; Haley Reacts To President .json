She didn't do it.She was the most progressive senator that we had, next to Bernie Sanders. You can see it playing out, whether it's the fact that she didn't show up at Bibi's speech yesterday, whether it's the fact that she pushed for all this government spending, whether it's the fact that when she was in California, the most liberal state, there was no tax she didn't proposed. There was nothing that she didn't want to see. All of her -- the things she's doing from not wanting fracking to not wanting oil drilling, all of these things are incredibly liberal. And she is much more progressive than Joe Biden ever was. So, the fact that they put in Kamala Harris, kudos for putting in someone younger, the fact that you put in one of the most liberal politicians you probably could have put in, it's going to be an issue.",
