And that appears to be progressing. The next thing is to differentiate between an intentional Russian attack on NATO, which would be one thing, and could trigger Article Five, and the need for a defensive response versus an accident versus something that maybe wasn't even Russia. So, it's important that NATO take this in a measured way.But what they did do was very important, they consulted with each other privately, they held an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Council, they did make clear that this is Russia's fault regardless because they're the ones launching these attacks against Ukraine, and they made sure that it was Secretary General Stoltenberg himself who was giving this response, which is a way of showing the solidarity and unity of all NATO allies in response to this. So, a very good showing from NATO at this point and I think we just need to see the remaining details of what exactly this missile was, where it was launched from, and how did it happen?",

And NATO itself does not want to be in a war with Russia. So, we shouldn't let ourselves get drawn into situations where we just start sliding into a conflict that nobody wants.

We're not going to see a lot of changes from the Biden administration or from Congress about support for Ukraine, about Russian sanctions, and so forth.

Do you see that? ZANDII mean, you got to put it into context, right? I mean, it's a big number 1.3 in the month, eight percent year over year, but a lot of that is that inflation so, you know, if you take out the inflation, the so-called real growth, its growth -- and we need growth, we want to keep moving forward but it's not growth that would send off alarm bells with regard to what it means for inflation down the road.",

That is a lot more -- yes, I think it goes back to the Russian invasion of Ukraine but believe it or not, you know, they jacked up diesel prices and energy prices, and energy, diesel is a big part of food costs, right? Getting these things from the farm to the store shelves requires a lot of -- a lot of diesel.The pandemic has also played a role. I mean, it disrupted labor markets, immigration got nailed, and a lot of farm workers are immigrants. And so, if agriculture food processors can't find workers, you know that causes wage costs to go up and that obviously means higher inflation for us. So, what has to happen is that the fallout -- the economic fallout from the pandemic and the Russian invasion have to continue to fade away. Good news that that is happening. Hopefully, that continues. Obviously, a lot of risk around both those things, as you know, we can see in the kind of the daily news flow, but you know, hopefully, they fade away. And with it, I think next year's turkey dinner will be hopefully less expensive or certainly not see the increases we're seeing this year.",
