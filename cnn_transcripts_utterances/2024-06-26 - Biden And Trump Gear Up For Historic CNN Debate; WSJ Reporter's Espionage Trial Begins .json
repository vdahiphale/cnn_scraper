It's going to be hosted by CNN at our world headquarters in Atlanta. And its going to be a rematch like no other, the first time in history a sitting president it was debating a former president. The last time either candidate participated in a debate was nearly four years ago and was, of course, against the other. Both men preparing for Thursday's primetime event in their own ways. President Biden meeting with a team of his closest aides and advisers at Camp David. On Monday, the fourth day of prep, Biden and his team began holding mock debates of different lengths. The source telling CNN of preparations are focused on both subject and stamina. Donald Trump, taking a less formal approach, conducting numerous interviews over the past several days. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think I've been preparing for it for my whole life, if you want to know the truth. And I'm not sure you can lock yourself into a room for two weeks or one week or two days and really learn what you have to know. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

It's a lot of media interviews and it's a lot of him talking with some of his closest advisers. You know, he's worked with Marco Rubio at the RNC. He's done kind of these little mock stub for this advisers, Chris LaCivita, Susie Wiles. And so, that's kind of really where he's honing in on.

He writes: \"Unlike four years ago, Trump won't be taking the stage while so sick with COVID that he land in the hospital three days later, I had almost forgotten about that reality of this first debate. The polls essentially tied President Biden, weighed down by four years in the White House and low approval ratings. This from a Trump adviser, I would never say this to him, Trump, but this is a good guardrail to stay on track, said one advisor. He's waited for years for this. It's not going to be an SHT show.

And this is part of the expectation that they're setting too, where they're trying to say that just because Biden does do this is not mean that he won the debate or whatever the they expect that he should be able to do this.

So Americas in this very difficult position, if it does want to negotiate some sort of release for him, they're going to have to work with other countries such as Germany to find someone to trade with.
