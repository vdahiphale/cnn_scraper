The IDF says that they found and discovered an underground tunnel that Hamas was using close to that. One of the principal border crossings in and out of is in and out of Gaza. Of course that has been shut since October the 7th. But in that firefight that ensued, the IDF say that they killed a couple of Hamas operatives wounded others. Now Hamas has made counterclaims and said that it has hit in that area, a couple of Israeli tanks and injured -- injured soldiers there. The IDF says that that's not true.What we do know to be accurate is that the IDF does now have troops a couple of miles inside of Gaza. And judging by the images we've been able to look at it does appear as if those troops are close to the sea and their route in from the north, or from the southern end of Israel into the northern part of Gaza would seem to take them on a route that would avoid dense civilian neighborhoods in densely populated neighborhoods. And certainly that's been an important point that President Biden has belabored again, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on a phone call talking about the importance of avoiding civilian casualties. It's been relatively quiet here today in terms of artillery strikes, tank fire, all the sounds of war that we've heard over the past few days much quieter. But I have to say over the past half an hour or so maybe our there's been an uptick in the number of fighter jets flying over the northern end of Gaza here. We've seen a number of red and orange flashes coming up. Not the sound of explosions, not as big as we've witnessed over recent days. But it does feel as if into the night now there's a slight pickup in tempo of some military activity. But again, nothing compared to what we've witnessed over the past few days. Becky.",

But I think the question that's being asked is also a pressure point on Hamas to -- is this a pressure point on Hamas to try to get them to negotiate better, give better terms for the release of hostages? Are they pausing for that? Because the pause, that sort of, of the downscaling of the intensity of the fighting that we've heard today, sort of has been symptomatic of other moments since October 7, when there has been greater levels of, let's say, behind the scenes diplomacy, which has resulted in the release of four hostages up until now.Is that what we're witnessing? Is this a big moment of pressure on Hamas rather than the intent to go pushing ahead with a full scale incursion? It isn't clear, but in military terms, it would seem unlikely that the IDF is going to pause stuck inside Gaza for a long time without -- without either reinforcing or, or pulling back.",

Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Monday at the request of the United Arab Emirates regarding Israel's ground invasion of Gaza. Now the UAE which represents the Arab bloc, that's 15. Nations at the U.N. will seek a binding resolution from UNSC members for an immediate humanitarian pause. We understand from our sources that the draft text calls for an immediate humanitarian truce and further calls for humanitarian pauses.Now it comes after 120 countries voted for a U.N. General Assembly Resolution on Friday. That is largely symbolic, of course, that call for a sustained humanitarian truce. The U.S. was one of 14 countries that voted against the resolution with 45 abstaining. Well, Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone on Sunday their first conversation since Israeli troops began their incursion into northern Gaza. U.S. officials say they are telling the Israeli leadership it is important to protect civilian lives even as Israel tries to root out Hamas terrorists who accuses of using civilian areas and facilities for cover. The U.S. President also spoke to the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Sunday. They discussed efforts to ensure that the conflict in Gaza does not spread to other parts of the region. And that is a really big concern. As I speak to sources around this region, or I mean, Doha and Qatar tonight by speak to people around this region. There is a real concern that this latest round incursion in Gaza could spark a wider regional conflict. One of the reasons, one has to assume why the UAE as the leader of the Arab bloc at the U.N. is pushing for a binding resolution for a humanitarian pause. The U.S. President spending the weekend at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. That is where CNN's Kevin Liptak is tonight. My sources telling me that this was this binding resolution UAE is pushing for in an emergency meeting on Monday would be an opportunity, if the language is sufficient for the U.S. to actually vote for that resolution. Of course, it vetoed a resolution a week and a half ago, which called for an immediate ceasefire. Is there any indication that the U.S. has got to the point at which it might be ready to work with the rest of the world on a humanitarian truce? Or pause at least?",

So what we're seeing right now is combined arms maneuvers. We're seeing elite tank and engineering units clearing the way for what's likely to come and the days and weeks ahead, soldiers and more armor. This is counterinsurgency preparation.

Well, the lead prosecutor at the International Criminal Court tells CNN that Israel will need to justify striking civilian infrastructure in Gaza. Karim Khan said and I quote here, \"There should be no doubt that every decision maker from head of government to military advisors, to lawyers that have targeting making decisions should be unclear notice that they will be required to justify every strike against every civilian object.\" What I can say clearly is the willful killing and hostage taking are great breaches of the Geneva Conventions. He also warn that denying humanitarian assistance to civilians is a crime that from the ICC. But it's still unclear exactly what the endgame is by the Israelis.Our next guest has extensively studied aerial bombardment as a military strategy. In a recent interview, author and professor Robert Pape is doubtful that Israel's tactics so far will separate the civilian population and Hamas. He says, the only way for that to happen is through a political process saying, quote, \"There is no other way to separate over 2 million people from the group, telling Gaza's civilian population to move south for their safety is simply not meaningful. History shows that mass bombing campaigns never break the enemy's will. It does the opposite.\" Robert Pape is the author of -- is bombing to win air power and coercion in war and is a political -- is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and he joins us now. I was really interested to -- to read -- to read your, you know, your -- your, your thoughts today. And just -- just explain a little more the conceit of your argument, if you will. ROBERT PAPE, AUTHOR, \"BOMBING TO WIN: AIR POWER AND CORRECTION IN WAR: Yes, thank you, Becky. I think it's unlikely that Israel is going to achieve its military objectives and is likely already producing more terrorists than its killing. In order to defeat terrorist groups like Hamas, we know that it's important to separate the terrorists from the local population because otherwise, you can kill terrorists. But they will be replaced by others, sometimes many, many others, and they will take their place. Well, what's happening right now in Gaza is not the separation of Hamas in the local population but actually the integration of Hamas and the local population. And in fact, as we already see, a thousand civilians in Gaza have been killed. They will have family members. They will have cousins, who are likely already being recruited by Hamas in large numbers. The order is to ask a million people, the entire population of Northern Gaza to move south are just unlikely to be meaningful. Hundreds of thousands cannot move in a meaningful way. They're too young, too old. They're in hospitals. This is just not possible. And even if they did, Hamas -- many of the Hamas can Simply go with them. [17:35:00] What we have learned is that in order to defeat terrorist groups, you need long campaign, sustained selective pressure over years, not just simply a month or two or three.

But today as well, many people can feel like they know them on some level but what to his family and friends and also he himself wants to communicate about his legacy.",

And he said he wanted to share what he went through because he wanted others to relate to him, to be able to learn from his experience, to see that someone else was going through that as well. But it is really important to point out that our sources are telling us that no foul play is suspected. We are waiting for details on his death.But just moments ago into CNN, the new record with the medical examiner's office, his body is now with the ME's office. But the new record in terms of cause of death shows deferred, which means that there are more investigative steps needed to confirm that cause of death. So we will have to wait for authorities to do these exams. Now, we know that normally to get a complete report to when it comes to the autopsy and toxicology, it normally takes a few weeks. So it may take some time here, which is also part of the reason why now what people are saying is that they are just shocked to hear about the news. They were not expecting his death at just 54 years old. He had shared a lot of his struggles in his memoir that was released in November of 2022 and in those interviews that he did to promote his memoir. He had spoken out and said that he wanted to be remembered as someone who lived well, someone who loved well, who was a seeker. Of course, many of us know him from his acting career he started out with smaller roles and landed more prominent roles and eventually got that role of Chandler in Friends and that really was what made famous. This group, the cast was extremely close both on and off screen, and they famously negotiated their contracts together being -- becoming some of the highest paid TV actors at the time. And so we are waiting to hear from the cast of Friends. We've not heard from them yet. But there are others in Hollywood who are saying just how sad they are and how much joy Matthew Perry brought to them through his work, of course, work that will live on not just with Friends. But the many other movies and TV shows that he was on, Bianca.",

In Rome, marches is carrying the flag of Palestine rallied near the Coliseum. In Berlin and protesters filled the streets demanding a ceasefire in the conflict. London saw its third straight weekend of protests marches there criticizing the Sunak government's stance on the war. It has stopped short of calling for a formal ceasefire. The Prime Minister says he is in favor of specific pauses to allow more aid to get into Gaza.Well, I'm joined now by one of the organizers of Saturday's rally in London. Kamel Hawwash is the Chair of the U.K. based Palestine Solidarity campaign. And I just wonder, can you explain the sort of atmosphere within which this demonstration or -- or rally in support of the Palestinian people was held? KAMEL HAWWASH, CHAIR, PALESTINE SOLIDARITY CAMPAIGN: Yes, I mean, this is -- as you said, this was the third demonstration. The numbers have been getting larger rather than smaller. The call is for a free Palestine. It is an expression of solidarity with the Palestinian people. People have been watching the pictures on -- on Al Jazeera on CNN and other channel coming out of Gaza. And they've been completely horrified by the terror that Israel is heaping on the Palestinian people on the civilians. They call this a -- a war between Israel and Hamas. But it's clearly a war between Israel and the Palestinian people. And that is what is bringing people onto the street to say, first of all, that they stand with the Palestinian people, that they find the position of the British government shameful, and they want the ceasefire now. Unless there's a ceasefire, people will continue to die. And therefore, that is what Rishi Sunak here in the U.K. supporting the death of more people on both sides. Because let's be clear, Israel is bombing Gaza, and there are rockets flying out of Gaza that could injure Israelis. So he is -- in -- in this case, he thinks he's supporting Israel's right to self-defense. But the best way of ending the killing, the pictures we are seeing on our television screens, is to say no, we must insist on a ceasefire and aid must go in, in huge amounts not in five or ten trucks, what they used to get",

General Assembly on Friday, which the U.K. supported. That was for a sustained immediate, durable ceasefire or humanitarian pause, at least. And there is an opportunity on Monday at the U.N. Security Council and Britain, of course, is a permanent member of that security council for a resolution, a text of which I have seen which at least in principle is calling for humanitarian -- humanitarian pause immediately and then for humanitarian pauses going forward. That at least to your mind, would it be a step in the right direction?",

But at the end of the day, the U.K., yes, isn't the Security Council, but Israel used its veto. And I mean, that the Americans are the people who put their hands up to support Israel's veto. That is the place where the whole world should have taken responsibility for what it's happened and for -- for stopping the killing. And it is there and under Chapter 7, that they should have said, no more killings. We must have a ceasefire.We are more than three weeks now, since the really unfortunate events of the seventh of October happen. And the focus should now be on saving lives. It is clear from the numbers we hear, approaching 10,000 Palestinians and we have 1,400 or so Israeli Israeli's killed, that the numbers are likely to keep escalating, because there are still people under the rubble. And the only way that we can, you know, support the Palestinians and the Israelis now and for people who feel -- well, you know, what do we do, because that's the question is to say, yes, there was a lead from the General Assembly. Well, at -- but it doesn't have any -- any powers. And therefore, it is for governments to say, no, we must insist on a ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire because that is the only way we will save the children, we will save women, and we will make sure that people can to pick up the pieces because as -- as I'm sure Becky, you've seen. We have to ask where will people return to when there's a ceasefire. For many there are no homes to return to because Israel has demolished them out of spite and revenge. No other reason.",
