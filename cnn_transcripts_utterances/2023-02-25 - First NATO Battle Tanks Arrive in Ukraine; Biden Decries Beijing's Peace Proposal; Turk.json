Dozens of these advanced weapons are due in Ukraine in the coming weeks as tank crews complete their training.But NATO fighter jets are not on the immediate horizon for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden delivered a hard no on Friday, saying the Pentagon doesn't believe F-16 fighters are a good fit right now. Mr. Biden also gave a thumbs down on Friday to a Chinese proposal to end the conflict. He said it would only benefit Moscow. Meanwhile, sources tell CNN that U.S. intelligence suggests Beijing is leaning toward sending drones and small arms and munitions to Russia, despite warnings from the U.S. to stay out of the conflict. Ukraine's president has been front and center since the war began, repeatedly calling on allies to send more weapons and rallying his country to stay strong. And that was especially true on Friday as he held a somber ceremony in Kyiv to mark the war's anniversary. CNN's Melissa Bell has our report.

Every day, every hour, it is you, Ukrainian soldiers, which will decide it. BELL (voice-over):  A stark contrast to his nightly messages that, for a year now, have kept hope afloat. \"Victory can be achieved this year,\" he said repeatedly on Friday, a message aimed at Ukraine and beyond. The Ukrainian flag unfurled and acts of solidarity around the world, its most famous landmarks lit up in the colors that have become symbols of Ukrainian resilience and freedom, yellow and blue on display from Paris to Sydney and painted outside the Russian embassy in London. For the world's diplomats, the one-year mark offered pause for thought. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  One year and one week ago, on February 17th, 2022, I warned this council that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine. Due to fierce resistance by Ukraine's defenders, President Putin failed in his primary objective to conquer Ukraine.

It outlines essentially China's attempt to position itself as a neutral mediator.It says that Beijing wants to see talks, negotiations, peace talks restarted between the two sides. But then it goes on to criticize this very thinly veiled criticism of the West's support of Ukraine, saying that unilateral -- Beijing's word -- sanctions should be lifted. Of course, a reference to Western sanctions against Russia. And it says a Cold War mentality should be abandoned. This is exactly why the United States and its allies are calling out this policy paper, this so-called proposal and saying simply, behind closed doors, China is doing the exact opposite in that Beijing is actually considering sending materiel support to Russia, sending small ammunition and drones to resupply Moscow's very depleted arsenal. That would be a major step up in China's support, which has so far only provided non-lethal aid through Chinese companies. President Biden almost greeted this so-called proposal, again, peace proposal, with a laugh. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Putin's supporting it.

      "sentences": "To give an overview of how I think about these issues, so very few wars end in total, utter defeat of one side or the other, not the First World War. And this war is not going to end in the defeat of the Russians in Moscow, nor is it going to end in utter defeat of Ukrainian forces in Kyiv.So it must end in some form of negotiated settlement. The question you have to ask yourself, then, is what does war do that makes what was a disagreement turn into agreement? And the answer is very straightforward and simple:  war provides information. You learn things on the battlefield that you cannot learn in any other way. And we're still in the midst of this process of both sides trying to learn how strong the other is and how committed they are to fight for the long run. So Putin is trying to target the civilian population. The strategy has been used in many other wars; always fails. Putin is trying to target the support for the Ukrainians in the West. If that fails, of course, fighting becomes too difficult for the Ukrainians. He's trying to suss out how the support is, more or less, to find out how the war is going to end. There are a couple of problems in this case which all say loud and clear that this war will go on for a long time. One, no deal is credible that the Russians can offer. The irony of this case is that any deal that leaves in Russia of some control of some territory in Ukraine will only be accepted by Ukraine if Ukraine gets guarantees for its future security. And the only group of countries that can do that is NATO, of course. That's the very reason why Putin supposedly went to war, for Ukraine being supported or joining NATO. So that's one reason. Putin cannot credibly promise to stick by any demands or any settlement he makes now. He didn't do it in 2014; he won't do it now. Second, there is the problem and there is a bit of a debate over this, whether Putin can actually domestically survive a loss in the war because, if he can't, then he can anticipate that, if he loses, he will be punished for his poor performance. He will be jailed, exiled or most likely fall from a window in the third story of the Kremlin. He will get killed. I can assume that's most likely. He can anticipate this, as leaders have done through history. He can anticipate that, if he signs an agreement that is not worth the cost that the Russians have suffered, that he will be removed from office and subsequently killed. So he's not going to sign any agreement like that. He's going to fight in what we call a gamble for resurrection. He has nothing to lose. He cannot die more than once. (CROSSTALK)",

But of course, as you can imagine, for those that have been through that earthquake, been through that significant aftershock, there is still a huge amount of concern, fear and apprehension. And there are real worries. The authorities say these are the amount of aftershocks they would expect to see in four months in Turkiye typically. So you can imagine the concern there. But of course, the government in Turkiye is facing mounting pressure to provide long-term solutions to those who have been displaced, the thousands and thousands of people who have lost their homes, who have lost loved ones and have been deeply impacted by this earthquake. While the government has pledged to rebuild the impacted areas within a year, this is going to be a significant challenge. The area impacted is vast, to say the least. And when you take a look at some of the cities impacted, where we have been filming and traveling, it is difficult to explain in words how significant that devastation has been. Currently there are more than 900,000 people living in tents and those are soon going to be transformed into containers, so more permanent structures for families to live in. But for those who have lost their homes, this isn't enough. They do want those long-term solutions, new homes. And the government has pledged to start rebuilding around 30,000 apartments in March.
