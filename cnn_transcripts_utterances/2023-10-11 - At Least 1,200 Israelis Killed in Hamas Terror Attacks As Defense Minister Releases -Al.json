      "sentences": "Good day to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's Wednesday, October 11th, 5Israel now says at least 1,200 people were killed in the terrorist assaults. The IDF says it hit more than 80 targets in the Beit Hanoun area and destroyed Hamas' advanced detection system for spotting aircraft over Gaza. Neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble. Hamas says 950 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. The U.N. says more than 263,000 people there have been displaced. The Hamas controlled government says due to a lack of fuel coming in through the Israeli blockade, electricity will be cut off within hours. And with it, so will basic services. The IDF was also busy last night hitting Hamas naval targets, which it claimed were being used to attack the Israeli coastline. Israel's defense minister told troops Tuesday that he has released all restraints in, quote, on their fight against Hamas. He said, quote, Hamas wanted a change in Gaza, it will change 180 degrees from what he thought. They will regret this moment. Gaza will never return to what it was. President Biden standing squarely behind Israel in the fight on Tuesday, calling the Hamas attack sheer evil. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, it certainly feels like that. When we were driving around yesterday, around towns like Ashdod, like Sderot, near Mefalsim, what we witnessed in these towns all around the Gaza Strip is a massive mobilization effort that is under way here in Israel. More than 300,000 reservists have already been called up. And we are also seeing a massing of tanks, of artillery and armored personnel carriers in key staging locations around the Gaza Strip.This is all a signal that Israel is preparing for a possibly massive operation inside of Gaza, a possible ground invasion. But as of yet, we did not have that political decision, that official order that that been given by the Israeli prime minister. We have heard a lot of fire and brimstone from Bibi Netanyahu as well as the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as you just mentioned. But also, what's important to keep in mind is we don't know how long this staging could potentially last. The IDF knows that if Hamas carefully planned the surprise attack this past Saturday, then they also likely planned for what is coming next. They also likely planned for the possibility of a ground invasion. And that means booby traps, that means tunnels that Hamas built inside of Gaza and that means reinforced positions. So the IDF is being very cautious, being very strategic as they prepare for those next steps. You know, yesterday, Kasie, we spent some time with some of the reservists who are being called up and one thing is clear, they are prepared for whatever comes next. Many of them have been called up in previous conflicts before. But they don't know exactly what is coming next. They don't know as of yet, they are waiting for their orders. But they say that they are ready.",

We have already seen Hamas claimed that several of those Israeli hostages were killed in an Israeli airstrike.And so, the IDF has to keep that in mind. [05:05:01] You know, Israel is familiar with these types of hostage situations, but they have never seen anything on this kind of scale. I mean, you look back when Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier was captured and held by Hamas, he was ultimately exchanged for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. And so, to try negotiate the release of these hostages, something that Israel is not doing yet, that would be a massive undertaking and it would have enormous implications for whatever Hamas would demand and what Israel would be willing to provide. What we do know though is that Israel is looking at other ways of getting the hostages back and they are still looking at going in with a potential ground invasion. We know that there is coordination between Israel defense minister, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, they have been on the phone talking about ways of getting these hostages back. We know that the United States is providing Israel with intelligence support and they are also special operations support to the Israelis. So not clear exactly what will happen, how they will get the hostages back, but it is important to keep in mind the number of dual nationals who are believed to be among these civilian hostages in particular, it changes the equation. We know that there are several American Israelis among the hostages and other dual nationals as well. So there are enormous international implications as well for whatever comes next -- Kasie.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back.Israel's retaliation against Hamas now widely anticipated to take the form of an unprecedented incursion into Gaza. The Israeli military has mobilized 300,000 reservists and launched hundreds of punishing airstrikes on Gaza and this is just the initial phase of the war. Now, questions are growing about a possible ground operation that could be far bloodier and more destructive. And with the hundreds of Israeli soldiers and civilians being held captive by Hamas, a ground operation could also come at a very high price. Let's bring in CNN military analyst, the retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel, thank you very much for being with us this morning. Let's talk about what this could look like both in the immediate turn but also, I know you've spent a lot of time looking at these conflicts. Sometimes, Israel has moved quickly in something like this, fast and done, and other times they have had to fight for many years. How do you think this plays out? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yeah, Kasie, good morning. I think it's going to be one of the -- ones that last a lot longer. It will be something that if a ground incursion occurs and Israelis do move in at this particular point in time, it is going to be a bloody mess. And that's going to be a real problem because they really risk getting bogged down inside the warrens and the alleyways of Gaza. That's going to be a real problem for them because once you get mired into something like this, it is really hard to pull yourself out of this. And I think that is the dilemma take that Israel faces. On the one hand, you want to free the hostages, you want to get them out, and you want to, you know, in essence, exercise retribution for what has happened. On the other, you want to make sure that you can serve your forces so that they can fight in an appropriate way at a time of your choosing. Not at adversary's choosing.",

What you do first usually in a military campaign is you bring in air power and you use that to target certain areas to in essence weaken the adversary in a way that allows you to move more quickly into the territory and once you've moved into the territory, you can then achieve your goals much more quickly.You look at how the United States conducted campaigns in the second Iraq War, for example. That was based first on an air campaign, which softened up the target and then you moved in with ground troops and you were able to occupy -- we were able to occupy the territory very quickly. Of course, what happened after that is a completely different story. But that's the idea. It's to soften up the target area and make it possible for the ground forces to move into the area with less risk and with greater ability to achieve victory.",
