U.S. authorities accuse Sam Bankman-Fried of defrauding investors and customers in his failed crypto exchange FTX. And then an exclusive CNN report. The Biden administration is finalizing plans to send the long-awaited Patriot Missiles Defense System to Ukraine. But the logistics of the operation are immense. We'll be live from the Pentagon for you. And then Argentina takes on Croatia in the first semi-final of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. We'll have the latest scores for you. But first, a house of cards built on a foundation of deception. That's how U.S. securities regulators are describing the collapse in crypto giant, FTX, as its founder now faces multiple criminal charges. FTX's former CEO, Samuel Bankman-Fried has been appearing before a judge in the Bahamas after his arrest on Monday night. He is facing a battery of fraud and conspiracy charges from New York prosecutors and more from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Meantime, the man who has taken over FTX, John Ray, told Congress today that the FTX collapsed because the people running it were grossly incompetent. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That he raised $1.8 billion online. Some money raised online. He's talked about how complex and sprawling this investigation is, and really directed the comments and their attention to those still working within the industry.

Speaking earlier, Biden welcomed the latest figures but conceded there is still a lot of work to be done. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  where inflation is rising at double digits in many major economies around the world, inflation is coming down in America. In fact, this new report is the fifth month in a row where annual inflation has fallen in the United States. Make no mistake: prices are still too high. We have a lot more work to do.

Bags of cash in one location was 150,000 euro. This is a significant amount of money given in cash to significant people, four people detained. The question will be, for the police, who else is tainted by this, which other doors should they be knocking on? That's the police investigation. The concern for the E.U. is how long has this been going on and what political decisions have been taken? Qatar is accused of being the one providing the cash here. They deny that. But it's going to raise the question at the E.U. and in domestic parliaments as well. If this nation that's accused has been handing out cash, what has happened in other capitals around Europe? But to the E.U.'s issue, what has been influenced there? It's significant that Eva Kaili herself, just within the past month, not only visited Qatar just before the World Cup but also spoke very favorably about Qatar and even then, heading down, heading off rumors that they were in fact involved in bribery. This is what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EVA KAILI, FORMER V.P., EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Some Qataris approve actually of house post diplomacy (INAUDIBLE) the country with reforms that inspired we uphold.

Over the last, while when they've had the opportunity to do that, they have not done it. Being a journalist, it's usually a scandal that moves these things along, not always in the normal rub of things. But I think it's interesting listening to the president, Roberta Metsola, saying there will be no stone left unturned. The point is that the E.U. has its own investigators, it has its anti fraud agency and so on. But it's the Belgian police who uncovered this, not the E.U. itself. I think most of the investigation is probably going to be done by the Belgian police. The point your correspondent made about what decisions have been made on the back of this, to what extent has what's been going on influenced the E.U. policy or thinking in relation to Qatar or other issues, I think that really is something that the E.U.

The fact that it's being spoken about so openly, I think people accept that it is Qatar that we are talking about. Today as well, the number of MEPs have talked about how they were cajoled by representatives of the Qatari government, the Qatari administration to visit Qatar, to come to the hotel in Brussels and discuss Qatar and so on. There was a big, big lobbying campaign going on. For a long time, myself as European ombudswoman and other civil society actors, NGOs, have been calling for foreign agents, foreign representatives to declare themselves, to register themselves in what we call the transparency register. That has not happened. So OK, everybody was expressing a lot of shock and horror and all of that yesterday. Again, when they had the opportunity to do things, they did not do it. So hopefully, out of this scandal, whenever it finishes, will emerge good things, that the E.U. Parliament can do its best to restore its reputation. I don't think the E.U.
