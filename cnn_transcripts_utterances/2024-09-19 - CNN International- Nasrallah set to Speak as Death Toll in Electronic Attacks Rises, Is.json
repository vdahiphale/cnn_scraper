And these are the vast majority we've had up till now. We've operated on 900 or we performed 955 operations on patients. And as I said, a large number of them have lost the use, the function in their eyes or in their hands. Now on the second day, these were the walkie-talkies, which are bigger devices, and they caused a much bigger injury. And a lot of those patients ended up either having, you know, extensive surgeries.

So, we have been instigating a disaster plan where, you know, different hospitals can deal with this. And indeed, you know, this was an action two days ago where we had 1100 ambulances transporting almost 2000 patients from in different parts of the country. And at one point we were transferring patients from the south of Lebanon to the north of Lebanon, and almost 90 hospitals were receiving those patients. Now, this was something that helped us really absorb these almost, you know, 2500 patients within a very short period of time. And a lot of those patients are still in the hospital.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he stopped short of declaring victory over inflation, but they're all but doing that. It does also suggest, though, that they are worried about what they're seeing in the jobs market. Powell, he said repeatedly that he's not alarmed with the jobs market. He even said at one point, the labor market is in a strong place. We want to keep it there. But there are some economists who are concerned that the Fed is late. And that they need to play catch up before the cracks in the jobs market turn into something more ominous. So, the Fed has made clear that they've switched the mission. They've gone from fighting inflation to fighting unemployment. Of course, all of this is happening just weeks before this hotly contested election. Now, Powell, he stressed politics played no role here, and that the Fed only does what they believe is right. And I asked Powell about the idea from Former President Trump that the sitting U.S. President should have a say in where interest rates go. And Powell, he made clear he's not a fan of that idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, CHAIR OF U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: We do our work to serve all Americans. We're not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It's just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that's how the other central banks are set up, too. It's a good institutional arrangement which has been good for the public, and I hope -- and strongly believe that it will continue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
