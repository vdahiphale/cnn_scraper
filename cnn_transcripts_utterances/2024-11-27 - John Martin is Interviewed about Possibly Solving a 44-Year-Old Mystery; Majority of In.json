All right, so recently this non- profit called Sunshine State Sonar alerted authorities who ultimately drained a pond along the route that they would have been traveling. And they found human remains inside a 1979 Lincoln Continental. The same model car that the Romers owned. With us now is John Martin, co-founder of the Sunshine State Sonar Team. All right, John, so, look, how did you find the car? JOHN MARTIN, CO-FOUNDER, SUNSHINE STATE SONAR TEAM: Well, we were - actually, there was another sonar team that had gone out to - to this body of water. And sonared the, you know, this body and came up with a vehicle and sent an image to my brother. And my brother looked over the image. They had concluded, after sonaring it, that it was a white pickup truck. After finding out the location of the - this white pickup truck, we were concerned and made a trip down there to do our own search of that body of water.",

We know that more than half of Americans are regularly getting news from social media. And it's a good reminder that although influencers often build these personal feeling relationships, they build brands around their trustworthiness. You really can't trust everything you see on social media.According to this report, 62 percent of influencers do not check the credibility of the information they're sharing before they share it to their followers. And here's how the report found that influencers are trying to gauge credibility. Forty percent of the respondents said they looked at measures of popularity, like the number of likes on a post to decide if it was credible before sharing it, which we know is not a great measure -",

But just 17 percent said they actually looked at documentation and evidence to decide if something was trustworthy.We also know that influencers are often paid to promote content. Fifty-three percent of the respondents said that they had created sponsored content, but 7 percent of them said they presented that content as if it were unsponsored. So, while people may think they're getting this trustworthy information from people they rely on, actually they could be getting something that is biased or just plainly untrue. And, of course, we've seen this happen. We know one of the big prominent examples recently where these viral, false claims that immigrants in Ohio were stealing and eating peoples pets, amplified, of course, by President Donald Trump. And that ended up being really harmful. So, a good reminder to people to think critically about what they're seeing on social media.",

YouTube says that it doesn't allow videos with false claims about elections, for example, to be monetized, but they don't remove them. Meta also says that it doesn't promote content that's been labeled by fact checkers as false. But again, that's still up there.
