Jeff, you and Kevin Liptak, I think Arlette Saenz as well put together this story. Your sources say that there's worry inside the Biden campaign right now about the President's somewhat blind approach to Hunter Biden, what did you learn?",

      "sentences": "Look, Phil, this is a chapter that President Biden and, certainly, First Lady Jill Biden had hoped would be closed. They thought that the investigation to their son, Hunter Biden, would be closed and they would move on before the campaign. We now, of course, understand after the special counsel announcement last Friday, that's not happening.In talking to a variety of advisors and allies and supporters of the President, they do not believe and research will show that voters do not necessarily mind this unless there is a link that is tied to the President and as of now, there is not. But they do wonder if there will be a blind spot about this, because it is simply not mentioned or discussed on the campaign. And one senior advisor put it like this to us, really succinctly summed it up. The advisor said this. Hunter Biden is not a topic of discussion in campaign meetings, it's just not addressed. That, of course, is because the President does not like to talk about this, this is a deeply personal family matter. However, we know that the Republicans from the House committees to the Republican presidential campaign trail talk about this considerably. So there are some quiet rumblings, is there a blind spot here for this Biden campaign if this deepens. We are going to see likely a trial of the President's son unfold at the same time as a presidential campaign. This, of course, is unprecedented.  So while the - there certainly is not an equivalence between what we're seeing in former President Donald Trump and this, Republicans will try and make it so, starting perhaps next week on the debate stage in Milwaukee. So while the President does not want to speak about this, some of his advisors are keeping a close eye on the fallout from all of this as it unfolds over the next year and perhaps even longer, Phil?",
