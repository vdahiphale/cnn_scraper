The one thing that he really, really didn't want to admit, and the one person he really, really doesn't want you to hear from, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, so Trump has finally admitted now what many of you already perhaps knew. Gold might be his favorite color, but he is not made of it. Remember that he has to post a $454 million bond a week from today in the New York A.G.'s civil fraud case. Now, you add that to an additional $10 million bucks, what's called disgorgement. That's a fancy way of saying that Don, Jr. and Eric got a payback where they shouldn't have gotten in the first place. That would then be $464 million bucks. Who's got that kind of money laying around? Well, not Donald Trump, apparently. And if he can't pay the $464 million, well, then he probably can't pay the amount plus pay the interest he owes on that amount after it's all said and done. And what is that interest? We're talking nearly $115,000 a day. Now, all of that is a lot, no matter how rich you are or aren't. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The court hearing arguments in a case brought by two conservative states, arguing that the federal government ought not to be allowed to pressure social media companies to take down information -- misinformation.I should be specific. It's a claim frequently made by conservatives who accuse the administration of a -- of a censorship campaign. But many of the justices, including at least two appointed by President Trump, were skeptical. Joining me now is a former law clerk for Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Tiffany Wright. Thank you for joining me today. First of all, this is a really complex case. There's a lot of nuances. But it comes down to whether the government, the White House, the administration can essentially pressure a company to take down what is misinformation. They were skeptical about that today, though. Why? TIFFANY R. WRIGHT, FORMER LAW CLERK FOR JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR: I think there are two reasons why they were skeptical. They're skeptical because the claim that Louisiana and Missouri were making is really quite broad, so much that it is extreme. And so, as an example, the argument that they're pressing is that if the FBI were to reach out to X and say, we know that these accounts are being run by foreign terrorist organizations or foreign governments, and we think that the information being perpetrated in those accounts is dangerous for the following reasons, according to the state of Louisiana, that is a level of pressure or encouragement that violates the First Amendment because it's the government for sort of influencing speech. And that is really extreme when you think about the environment we're in, where the government has a lot of responsibility and true need to rein in some of the disinformation that is being put out there by some of these accounts. And so, I think it's extreme. And we're also seeing some of the justices speak from their personal experience. Brett Kavanaugh being from the White House Counsel Office, for example.",

Do with that what you will. We're not telling you that you need to change your message. We're letting you know what the source is.

A Philadelphia man is now free and completely exonerated after the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cleared him of a crime he was convicted of back in 2013. A judge in Philadelphia agreeing to drop all charges against C.J. Rice after he served more than 12 years behind bars for a 2011 shooting he had always maintained he did not commit.CNN's Jake Tapper has been following this story and bringing awareness to it for years. It was his father, Dr. Theodore Tapper, who was Rice's pediatrician at the time of the shooting, and Dr. Tapper testified that it was physically impossible for Rice to have carried out the shooting given that he was recovering from a separate shooting injury himself. Rice could barely walk at the time, much less run. No DNA, no guns found, and no evidence tied Rice to the September 2011 shooting and wounding of four people. Court-appointed attorney, Sandjai Weaver, took Rice's case on, and she did not provide him with an adequate defense. Now, Weaver appears to have never visited the crime scene. We obtained location data for Rice's cell phone, which would have shown that he was actually nowhere near the crime scene. Now, last fall, a federal court ordered that Rice be released from custody, and he was finally released from prison in December. Jake Tapper joins me now. Jake, I have been talking to you about this story since your \"Atlantic\" piece came out, and it is just mind- blowing to so many people, about the connection and your father's role.

But you know that once the kids get in trouble, then you've got their friends and the circle of friends who are now going to antagonize you as a result of what you've done. And how hurtful that can really be.I'm just so sad to know that she's had to experience this, but I am totally encouraged by how proactive, Allyson, you are as a mother to wrap your arms around her figuratively and literally, and the community as well, to support her, bishop, because it's not right, it's not fair, and I hope that she sees these charges as someone taking what she is experiencing seriously. Allyson Lopez, Bishop Talbert Swan, thank you both so much.",
