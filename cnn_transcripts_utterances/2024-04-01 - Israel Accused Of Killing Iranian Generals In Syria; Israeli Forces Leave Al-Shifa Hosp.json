Tonight, Iran's ambassador to Syria says at leastfive people have been killed in an attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, and Israel is being blamed. We'll have the very latest on this breaking news story for you. Then Israeli forces leave Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza after a deadly two-week siege. We'll have more on the devastation that is been left behind. Plus, a major blow for Turkey's President Erdogan after the main opposition party claimed victory in this weekend's local elections. We are live in Istanbul with all the reaction. But first, this evening, we are tracking breaking news out of the Middle East, an attack on Iran's consular building in Syria. Iran's ambassador was not hurt, but he told reporters in Damascus, at least five people were killed and blame Israeli warplanes for the strike. Now, CNN cannot independently verify those claims. Our Nic Robertson though is here and is following all the breaking news story on this. And Nick, this is a significant target. What more are you learning about this attack?",

Eleven feet deep, five times less than the 50 foot deep channel that now is being blocked by the MV Dali still crippled there in the center of the Key Bridge and pinned under so much of the wreckage of the Key Bridge. Its bow now on the bottom of the Patapsco River here as crews swoop in and try and move the debris off of the Dali so the Dali can be moved and then they can remove some more debris. These are the blow by blows, the numbers of all of the vehicles and vessels that will be coming in here. Seven floating cranes in total, nine or ten tugboats, nine barges, eight salvage vessels, five coast guard boats. That is when this recovery operation hits full steam. Right now there are three heavy lift cranes here. This is the latest update from the United States Navy. The Chesapeake, that is the 100-ton heavy lift barge and then also the Ferrell that can lift about 200 tons and then the Oyster Bay which can lift 150 tons. But consider the challenge here. A lot of the debris that is in the Patapsco River now, officials say that weighs between 3,000 and 4,000 tons. So, they have to chunk it up into smaller sort of bite-sized pieces, then they can move those. But really it is a cut, then move operation, then they can try and get this temporary channel open, then they can move the Dali, then they can make real headway here in moving this port to full steam. About 8,000 to 15,000 people have their jobs directly impacted by this closure right now. And this is a huge spot for the import of cars, the import of things like commodities, salt and sugar. It is really, really critical. This is not just a Maryland or Baltimore problem, this is a global and worldwide issue. But there is real no definitive timeline just yet on getting this port fully back open and running, Isa.",
