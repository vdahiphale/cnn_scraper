Sources tell CNN, a Sunday call with ranking members was filled with concern about potential damage to the entire Democratic ticket up and down the ballot and the impact on Democrat's chances of flipping the House in November. The President, he remains defiant, staying in the race at least for now as he prepares to welcome dozens of world leaders to Washington for the NATO Summit this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, what happens now?MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: So, you've now got as everyone suggesting deadlock in parliament because you've got three main blocs who none of them have a majority. And the one with the biggest majority is pretty chaotic. If you look back on their history, they managed to unite in the -- in the last week around the idea of squeezing out the far-right. So, the moderates and all those leftist parties, but there's a huge range of policy differences between them. Somehow they've got to come together and decide who should be prime minister, and that's going to be incredibly difficult. I was speaking to someone from the far left, she's insisting that they can happen, and this, you know, leftist alliance is now a united bloc. But if you look back in history, it just hasn't been what the right has always had against the left, is that they're much more organized. And I have to, you know, a word of caution about the headline here, which is the left rising to the top, the right also did extremely well, much better than they have done in other elections. They've got a lot of seats, well over a 100. So, over time, the right is building here, and I was speaking to one of Macron's MPs who suggested actually in the long term, you might look at this as a win for the right. So, it's quite complex picture, but there's certainly the middle ground held and the left really helped it.",
