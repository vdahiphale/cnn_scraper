There are some options for Democrats to try to keep the Senate in session certainly, but it also is going to be a test for Senate Republicans, whether they're willing -- willing to let this happen to get someone like Matt Gaetz through.I mean, Matt Gaetz is so deeply disliked by members of Congress on Capitol Hill. I mean that that is I mean, I think likely to be as important as anything. I mean go Google what House members say about Matt Gaetz. I cannot say that on a lot of them are quotes are on television without being bleeped and I think on the recess appointments thing, its interesting that did administration, but it led to a very convoluted system of pro forma sessions as a tenuous agreement between Republicans and Democrats to ensure that Obama couldn't use that or abuse that too much. I think it's clear that there are a lot of noise we're hearing out of the Trump. The Trump transition team that they're going to push the envelope on that. But again, that comes back to testing institutions. The Senate is a huge institutionalist body. The senators like being Senate. They like being deferred to by Senate. We already have a handful of Republicans saying it's important to use the Advice and Consent role. We know Mitch McConnell will vote with Murkowski and Collins on that. And so do Republicans want to try and blow up the filibuster? Is that what were going to literally on day eight of the transition that's -- that's in play?",

Xi's going to unveil this multi-billion dollar port that China is building in Peru, not America. So how do you prevent China having more power if you're less involved in the world? There's a slight conflict there, but I think that we need to hear more about Rubio about what his plan is there to take on China economically. And, yes, of course, Taiwan is a big issue if China sees this as an opportunity to take Taiwan, how will America respond? It's a huge question. It has huge global repercussions.",

We've got about 57 percent of the northeast actually under drought conditions, with roughly 93 percent under abnormally dry. So we all know we need rain and guess what's coming. Look to the west but I want to show you something. This is the current radar. Now I'm going to take you into the future. Follow the same storm system and notice how it dives south of the areas that need it the most. I'm talking about northeast New Jersey, near the border of New York. This area where the Jennings Creek Fire has been burning over the past several days. We'll see little if no rain out of this storm system as it kind of duck dives to the south and east and moves off the Atlantic seaboard throughout the course of the day today. So behind the front, we start to dry things out again, pick up the winds and yes, therefore another elevated day of fire weather for tomorrow. Let's talk about temperatures for the afternoon today, 47 for New York, 52 for the nation's capital, 59 degrees for Atlanta. Certainly warmer across the state of Florida, where we have been talking about the potential of some tropical mischief for the second half of next week. This is the entity that were monitoring closely now the latest computer models picking up on a low pressure system that's going to bring a lot of rain to Honduras and Nicaragua and the Yucatan Peninsula. But the good news is this land interaction, Kasie, means that it spends less time over the open waters, and that means a weaker storm as it approaches Florida second half of next week.",
