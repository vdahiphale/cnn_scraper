Just ahead ontoday's show, focus on the Fed U.S. Central Bank is out with a closely watched our interest rate decision later on today market hoping for signs of an upcoming rate hike pause. Plus, debt ceiling dealing, it was President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy sitting down to discuss raising the debt limit. It is a high stakes political battle likely to drag on for months it can they actually agree on anything today. We'll break it down for you later on in the show. As markets brace for a busy day in Washington, it's looking like a lower open pretty much across the board as Wall Street kicks off. Yes, it is February 1st by the way, yes, Wall Street kicking off a new trading month. Europe however, in the green, with new numbers showing Eurozone inflation falling for a third straight month. Just released data in the U.S. shows that private U.S. employers adding a weaker than expected 106,000 jobs last month Wall Street was expecting a rise of almost 200,000 jobs, bad weather, largely to blame and ADP, the company that put out the report says that the job market does remain solid. We will be having an all-inclusive U.S. jobs report later on this week coming up on Friday. One thing is for certain though; the Federal Reserve is surely watching all of these data points very, very closely indeed. Let's bring in Christine Romans talk about all things Fed. So we have seen I mean I've lost track now. But I believe about seven or eight rate increases just between last year. And in terms of what's coming up to date, we know that it's going to be a much smaller rate high. What is going to be the reaction to that? Do you think, Christine?",

They had an effective veto on Israel's expansion of the peace circle of peace around it. I went around them; there is a formula for peace. But my view is because of the fact that the continuing the persistent Palestinian refusal, which goes back a century to recognize the Jewish state and nation state for the Jewish people in any boundary, that persistent refusal persists. If we wait for them, we're not going to have peace. People said you have to work your way outside in first, inside out first peace with the Palestinians peace where they are? Well, I think realistically, it's going to be the other way around. If we make peace with Saudi Arabia depends on the Saudi leadership and bring effectively the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end?

And that gives them a very important standing in the Islamic world. And they don't feel at the moment the Saudis don't feel or don't appear to feel that Benjamin Netanyahu, with his far right government is a leader that they can actually do a deal with who can deliver what they want. Now we're talking about the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, his son, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir apparent is may feel enabled and emboldened because he does move quickly on issues to make that rapprochement. But it's not there at the moment. And the fundamental thing that I think that the Palestinians read into what Benjamin Netanyahu says when he talks about a workable relationship. That's daylight between what the U.S. calls and they call a two state solution, and the world sees that as a two state solution. And that's also daylight between what Secretary Blinken says standing next to Prime Minister Netanyahu, when he said that way of growing the circle of peace is not a substitute for real progress between Palestinians and Israelis.

So the two sides really go into this afternoon, being very far apart. And I think that's why the expectations for at least this first meeting are pretty low. And we've gotten indication from our reporting on the Hill, that Kevin McCarthy is actually unlikely to even put a specific proposal on the table this afternoon that he basically just wants to figure out is the President willing to negotiate? Now there was this interesting moment last night that I just wanted to point you to where President Biden was speaking at a fundraiser in New York City. And he started talking about Kevin McCarthy in this meeting this gathering. And he basically was talking about some of the things that he had to do to actually become speaker, obviously, you'll remember a couple of weeks ago, there was a lot of drama, as we were all not sure if he would actually successfully become the speaker. And in order to clinch that job, he had to make some serious concessions political concessions to win over some of his colleagues. And what the President said was that those commitments that McCarthy made to his colleagues were just absolutely off the wall. Those were his words. And then he called to a - returned to or looked at a Democratic colleague of his Chuck Schumer, who is a New York Senator. And then he said to him, Chuck, I can't imagine you making one of those commitments. So it was just this sort of interesting and colorful moment where we got a little bit of insight into how President Biden has been viewing Kevin McCarthy in his new role? And sort of giving him a little job right? Saying to him, look, I know that you are the House Speaker right now but I also happen to know that you are pretty compromised in your new role. Now, the last thing I will say too is early June is sort of the timeline that we are looking at, and that's when we have our calendar circled. Because that's when the U.S. Treasury Department has said it can continue making these sorts of so called extraordinary measures taking these steps to prevent the government from defaulting. And really in Washington, D.C. a couple of months is a really long time for both sides of the negotiations to drag their feet, and this could end up being a very protracted situation.",
