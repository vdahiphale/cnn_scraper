We saw that that was an incredibly powerful driver for why the 2022 elections did not see a red wave. It's also freedom, period, right? The threats to democracy are a big issue for Americans as well, so I think that frame really does work. It also works, frankly, in terms of the freedom to work for what these families, American families, want for their future. And it gives the ability for the Harris -- a Harris administration to talk about the future, to talk about how she wants to expand the middle class, how she wants to give more families the tools necessary to be able to not just survive, but to succeed and get ahead like she does, and then be able to make the contrast with a Trump/Vance administration that wants to take away rights and freedoms and take us back to a past where not everyone enjoyed what the values of this country meant.",

And, by the way, there are some indications that the economy is doing better. And what women say to me is, Maria, my -- the economy will come back, my freedoms won't. And that's what's on the line. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, look, it's a question -- I think it's right. You look at 2022, and what people saw and the way that people voted in the end, they were saying economy was the top issue for them. It obviously was a big issue. It remains a big issue. The question is whether, as, in 2022, there will be voters who are driven by abortion rights and by questions of freedom and democracy, like they were in those final stages of the 2022 midterms. Those ended up better for Democrats than they were expecting. They're obviously hoping to repeat that this time around.",

We don't hear that anymore after they installed a nominee without casting a single vote for her.So now they're onto this freedom thing, but you hit it. At the end of the day, most people are going to vote based on their own views about how the economy is affecting them personally. The conditions in the country hasn't changed. They changed out their nominee, but they haven't changed out the inflation. They haven't changed out the economic anxiety that most working families are facing. And that's something she's still going to have to do -- deal with because she's not an independent actor. She didn't land here six weeks ago on a spaceship and said, hey, I will take over. She's been sitting right next to Joe Biden for the last four years, and all of what came with that was a mid-30s approval rating and a country that most people think is wildly off on the wrong track. So I think the economic messages will come. They're going to talk about everything but that, because they really can't run on that.",

Now that means that tickets are priced low and then increased with extra fees. Now, in a statement to CNN, StubHub says they're committed to a transparent, secure and competitive marketplace and claims the company is not partaking in an illegal scheme.

And then, at the end, when the customers ask to finally put their money where their mouth is and buy, the price is much higher than what they originally thought.

And at the end, what people are confronted with for paying for their tickets is much higher than what they thought at the beginning. That prevents people from comparison-shopping at the front end and making a decision. Before we're going to commit to take our family to Taylor Swift or Beyonce, we want to know what it's going to cost. And if it costs much more at the end of the buying process, we're put in a terrible position. Either we don't have the tickets or we end up spending more than we actually wanted to at the front end. That's deceptive. It's illegal. And that's why we filed this lawsuit.",

And their behavior is deceptive by design. They knew back in 2015 that, if they did what they were doing at the time, which was transparent, open pricing, where people knew what the final price would be at the front end, that they would sell less tickets and make less profits than if they had adopted this design that they have put in place. And since then, since 2015, close to $120 million in hidden fees have been charged, close to $5 million transactions here in the District of Columbia.
