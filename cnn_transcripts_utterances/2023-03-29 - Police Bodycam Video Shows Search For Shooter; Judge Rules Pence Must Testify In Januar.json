Additionally, we can look at the written notes that were left for law enforcement. And that's really what they're keying in on right now. Additionally, investigators are going to backtrack.

The former president had tried to assert executive privilege. But now investigators will be able to get details about conversations between Trump and Pence during what investigators have described as a pressure campaign on the former vice president. He faced enormous pressure from Trump and his allies not to certify the election results in Biden's favor. There was one particular call that multiple witnesses have testified about on the day of the capital attack where Trump launched a series of insults at his vice president. But a judge also ruled that Pence will not have to testify about anything connected to his official duties as President of the Senate on January 6. He has tried to assert constitutional protections under the speech or Debate Clause, and the federal judge appears willing to accept that. Now this is yet another victory for special counsel Jack Smith. He's had over a dozen victories as he presses to get testimony from various witnesses and really test the limits of presidential power, vice presidential power, and the separation of powers.

And so, when you have a panel of grand jurors who are considering criminality, as against the president. And let's be clear, grand jury is a panel, it's 23 people, a simple majority of which vote out in indictment. That indictment could be of the president. It could not be.

Presuming, however, that there is a continued loss to the Vice President.I think there are a number of things that the grand jury wants to know. Sir, you had meetings with the President, is that right? Yes. And with respect to those meetings, when did they occur? Who else was in the room? What did the President talk about? Was there specifics as to him overturning the election? Did he ask you about your role, Mr. Vice President? And what you could do and whether or not you could help not certify this election? Did you have conversations about that? Did he pressure you to do that? What was the nature of the circumstances? Did it occur more than one time? It will be endless, Rosemary, with respect to the specific questions they will ask him, on what occasions he met with the President, what the President said and who if anyone else was in the room leading up to the issue and ultimate conclusion of whether the President tried to circumvent.

The Vice President of the United States is also the president of the senate and presides over then could preside over the Senate and of course, has the tie breaking vote, which would be the only time you voted. And so, with respect to that Speech and Debate Clause, we should note that the -- of course, the court said, you know what, you could refuse as a relates to that. I'll tell you why that's not significant. The grand jury is not really concerned about him presiding that day. They're concerned about what led up to and what if anything, Mr. Trump had to say, in other words to reject or deny the certification of those electoral votes such that the President would remain the president and Joe Biden wouldn't be there. And so, on that basis, the federal judge ruled that, you know what, Mr. Vice President as to those questions, you don't need to answer. But as to everything else, you have no basis.

The U.S. Ambassador to Mexico says it's a tragedy that highlights the importance of fixing a broken migration system.Mexican officials have revised the death toll from that fire down from 40 lives lost to 38. More than two dozen others were injured. Now there is new video showing the moment the flames and smoke spread through the facility. CNN's Ed Lavandera has the latest. And a warning, his report contains graphic content. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This dramatic video captured what appears to be the beginning of the fire that spread through this Mexican migrant detention facility in Juarez late Monday night. You can see flames and smoke filling the detention area in a matter of seconds. Migrants scrambling for their lives and several Mexican immigration officers walking away from the area while migrants were left locked in the cells. Eventually thick smoke fills the area making it impossible to see anything else. Outside, witnesses described hearing migrants screaming for help as fires spread through the detention center. Rescue workers responded pulling people from the smoke and flames. This woman says there was smoke everywhere. Everyone was running for their lives. But all the men were left locked inside and the door to let them out was never open. Mexico's president says the migrant started the fire when they found out they were being deported. The president says they protested by setting fire to mattresses inside the building where they were being detained. The video from inside the detention center doesn't clearly show how or who started the fire. But several mattresses can be seen on the ground by the steel jail bars. Mexico's national migration Institute and Attorney General are investigating the cause of the fire as many questions remain.",

But what he's calling for is very different than the typical call for reform in the past. He wants the Knesset which -- in which he has a very slim majority, to be able to overrule the Supreme Court, which really sets a kilter the checks and balances in this country. Now, as far as what that could mean for relations between the U.S. and Israel.President Biden, we heard from him as a minute ago, he then went on to say that Israel cannot continue down the road that it's on, which is an incredibly strong and direct thing for U.S. President to say about Israel. He also said that he wants to see genuine compromise. So, let me read from a tweet that the Prime Minister said in response to that, he said, \"I have known President Biden for over 40 years, I appreciate his long standing commitment to Israel. The alliance between Israel and the United States is unbreakable and always overcomes the occasional disagreements between us.\" Now, people I'm sure would take issue with saying that this is an occasional disagreement, the way that Biden spoke was not the way that he has spoken on other occasions. He was much more direct. Now, add to all of this Rosemary, at the end of next month, there's going to be a visit from Ron DeSantis. He is the governor of Florida, he is a likely Republican presidential contender. And he has put out a statement saying that these -- the relationships between the two countries are unnecessarily strained. He did not talk about the protests.
