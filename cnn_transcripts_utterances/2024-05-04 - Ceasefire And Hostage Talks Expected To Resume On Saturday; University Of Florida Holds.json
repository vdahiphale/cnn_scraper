At stake, the fate of hostages held by Hamas and Israel's plans for Rafah, where more than one million people are taking refuge.William Burns, Director of the CIA, is in the Egyptian capital and negotiators for Hamas expected to arrive there at some point today. Hamas said it's sending its delegation with what they describe as a positive spirit. The U.S. Secretary of State says what happens next is up to Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We wait to see whether, in effect, they can take yes for an answer on the ceasefire and release of hostages. And the reality in this moment is the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, nearly a week after Egyptian mediators submitted their latest framework for a potential ceasefire and hostage deal to Hamas, we are still waiting for Hamas' official response to that proposal. Still hanging in the balance of all of this is whether or not this response will lead to the continuation of negotiations, more detailed negotiations to actually achieve a deal, or whether instead the Israeli military will move forward with a major ground offensive into Rafah, that southernmost city in Gaza where more than a million Palestinians are currently sheltering.But while we wait for that official response, we are hearing in a statement from Hamas that Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, spoke on Thursday with the head of Egyptian intelligence as well as Qatar's Prime Minister. And in this statement, they say that Haniyeh told the head of Egyptian intelligence that Hamas was studying this latest framework with a, quote, \"positive spirit\" and also saying that Hamas hoped to send a delegation to Egypt soon, as soon as possible to continue the ceasefire talks. But it's very unclear whether or not that means that Hamas is actually inching closer to a deal. Their official response is what will actually give us that indication. In the meantime, Israeli officials are continuing to warn that if there is not a deal, that a major ground offensive in Rafah will indeed move forward. And U.S. officials, in the meantime, are still expressing concerns about the potential impact of that offensive on the civilian population. Here's the Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin. LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: What we've asked, what we've highlighted for the Israelis is that it's really important to make sure that the civilians that are in that battle space move -- move out of the battle space before any activity is conducted. There's a good chance that, you know, without taking the right measures, that the civilians will be, you know, civilians -- we'll see a lot more civilian casualties going forward.",

A reporter with CNN Affiliate, Richmond Times-Dispatch, took these videos and said the police arrived soon after the interruption. And in New York, police say dozens of protesters were arrested at the new school on Friday. The university says it asked police to get involved after people trespassed and set up an encampment.

Nearby Columbia University has been the epicenter of the protests and its president says the past two weeks have been among the most difficult periods in the school's history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A local official says Ukraine shot down a number of Russian drones in Kharkiv overnight before debris crashed down and caused at least three fires. Emergency crews are responding to the fires. Ukraine's Air Force chief says Russia launched 13 drones and fired four missiles overnight.The Kremlin is pushing back on the idea that it's fair game for Ukraine to conduct strikes inside Russia. The suggestion was made by British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who visited the Ukrainian city of Lviv on Friday. Moscow is accusing him of escalating tensions around the war and creating a potential threat to the security of Europe. Cameron said Britain will funnel close to $4 billion in military aid to Kyiv every year for as long as it's needed. And he said it's up to Ukraine to decide if those weapons will be used for strikes inside Russia. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, for context, it's taken Russia a whole year to advance from the western edge of Bakhmut to the outskirts of Chasiv Yar.But here is why it matters. Chasiv Yar sits on higher ground. The red here indicates the highest elevation, giving it a direct fire line onto critical Ukrainian defensive strongholds. Kostyantynivka down there, Druzhkivka up here. Just to the north is Kramatorsk, the regional capital and vital train link. So this small town potentially decisive for Russia in its quest to occupy all of the Donetsk region. You can see in this video just how intense the bombardment has been. CNN has geolocated this to the eastern edge of the town. And as the camera pans around, you can see some of the geography here. If we pause there, the canal is just here. That's a natural barrier, and here are the fortifications. Now, so far, Ukraine says it's holding on.

The bodies, however, were found in a remote location and authorities have not been able to identify them at this moment. On Thursday, the investigation had already recovered a mobile phone and the rest of the vehicle consistent with a pickup truck that the two Australian surfers had rented to go to the beach, but again, without an ultimate clue about their whereabouts. Australian authorities and U.S. consular officials are also across the search, as well as drone units, according to the Mexican police, drone units that are being used to scout over the coast and try to find some clue as this frantic search continues.
