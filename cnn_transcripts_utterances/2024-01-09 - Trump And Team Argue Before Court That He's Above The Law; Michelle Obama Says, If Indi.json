Raindrops on roses, whiskers on kittens, immunity on murders? Donald Trump lists a few of his favorite reasons why he's not a criminal. At this point, Trump is a collector of defenses like some people collect Pokemon. But there's almost too much to count at this point. And trust us, we tried. He says he's immune, presidents can't obstruct justice. His intent wasn't corrupt. The case is moving too fast or moving too slow. It's an unfair venue. The judge is biased, and so are the clerks. The jury is too. He's never met her. He doesn't know her. She's not his type. It was his personal account, political persecution, witch hunt, perfect phone call, the deep state. It wasn't an insurrection. He wasn't notified that it was a crime. His lawyers advised him double jeopardy. The speech was peaceful. The students weren't defrauded. The Presidential Records Act. He was too busy. They were his documents. They're declassified. They aren't even classified at all, the First Amendment and the Fourth, the Fifth, the Sixth, and Tenth Amendments too.

I've defended those cases.So, you have the same type of thing here if a president orders a drone strike and they later determined that that person shouldn't have been killed, you know, could that open the box to it? And that's really kind of the argument here, is that we want to make sure that presidents do have some level of immunity so they can make those decisions without worrying about what's going to happen, you know, when the administration changes hands, but it's definitely not going to be a the blanket immunity that anything and everything you did while you're in office is untouchable.

Because he knows, as do his lawyers, that this is a terrific case that the prosecutor has assembled against him. It has Mike Pence, his vice president, testimony from Pence in all likelihood against the former president of the United States for attempting a coup to prevent the orderly transfer of presidential power, his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, also a witness against Donald Trump, his counsel, Pat Cipollone, again, a witness against Trump. This is a huge case in which the government is in a position to win and convict by all accounts a very good chance of convicting Donald Trump. Trump doesn't want it to go forward.

That's what this case is about.Look at what one of these charges is. It is about obstructing an official proceeding of the United States government. What was that proceeding? The election of the president of the United States on January 6th, as called for by the law, the one time that the presidential electors meet and elect the president, Donald Trump organized a conspiracy to prevent that from happening. That's what this is about. And why the case is so strong is because there are 13 at least aides to the president of the United States who are prepared to testify against him in Jack Smith's case. Trump understands all this. Trump also knows that the narrative of what he has done is one of sedition. He attempted a coup to keep the president of the United States, Joseph Biden, who was duly elected from taking office, a coup such as we've never experienced, an act of sedition. There is a narrative to this case that Donald Trump and those around him do not want to see explored. Because if it is explored, if it is made public, if it is done tick-tock one hour after another so that we see how he obstructed that election on January 6th, how he prepared in the months before to obstruct that election, we will get a picture of criminality of a president of the United States such as we have never seen in our history. Trump knows that. His lawyers know it. The 14 Republican lawyers who filed an amicus brief, some of whom have been on this network today, who filed a brief against Trump, they know this. They know the strength of this case. This case is much more important than the others because if it occurs before the election, then we have the full narrative of what Donald Trump has done to obstruct our ordinary democracy in this country, as we have known it for more than 250 years.
