And after a fatal crash, Iran's vice president takes over as acting president of the country. New elections expected within 50 days. And the defense begins its case in the hush money trial of Donald Trump. Live from Washington, DC. It is Monday, May 20th. I'm Jim Sciutto, in for Richard Quest. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening to you. We are following two major stories this hour. Morning in Iran after the country's president and foreign minister were killed in a helicopter crash, leaving hardliners in that country facing an uncertain future. And in The Hague, the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders. The ICC's chief prosecutor tells CNN the charges include those of war crimes and crimes against humanity in relation to both the October 7th terror attacks on Israel and Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. On Hamas' side, warrants are being sought for Gaza's leader, Yahya Sinwar; Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, as well as Mohammad al-Masri, the leader of Hamas' armed wing. If approved, warrants on the Israeli side would be issued for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Both Israel and Hamas have condemned the decision, as is the US. President Biden calls the move outrageous, insists there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. Other international leaders are speaking out as well. The ICC's chief prosecutor sat down exclusively with CNN's Christiane Amanpour to explain why the court is pushing forward with these applications together, and now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Where does this leave Iran, right? Raisi was the president. He was not the most powerful recent president or even most publicly visible one, but a significant event nonetheless. EL-GAMAL: That's right. I think that there are kind of three main issues right now that people are asking about. The first one obviously is the most immediate. What happens right now? Does anything massively change now in the immediate term? Then you have the more sort of short to mid-term, which is who replaces Raisi and what might happen if someone more pragmatic is elected president; and then you have the longer-term, of course, which is, who will replace Khamenei. Obviously, we know that Raisi was one of the contenders. Now that he is gone, who might succeed him? Those are the three issues that I see as being kind of the main ones, and when I look at two of those issues, in the immediate term, nothing much is going to change. It is going to be business as usual. There is a new foreign minister already. He was the deputy and the National Security Council is operating. And so there is nothing significant that is going to happen right away. When it comes to the long term, who will succeed Khamenei, that's also something that I don't think people can have much visibility on right now. There are so many things up in the air and it is really not the most transparent regime or decision making process. So I don't think we have much other than speculation to go on there. So the real meat is that short to mid-term, the presidential elections and what might happen during those elections?",

EL-GAMAL: Well, I am sure different people would answer that question differently, Jim. I mean, my sense is that when things are so in flux and you have such a huge event upcoming like a presidential election where you have to make some pretty big decisions about what happens domestically that the last thing you want to do is start an issue overseas or let anything rock the boat more than it already is being rocked. Now, that's not to say that Iran is not going to continue to put up the same \"resistance front\" that it has, especially when it comes to Israel. These have been some really tough times in the region, these last seven months. And so I think, they are going to want to just steady the waters as much as possible as long as until they get through this presidential election and we see what kinds of president comes up. Is it going to be someone more pragmatic with little bit more leeway or is it going to be just business as usual?",

The reason, a tense exchange between the judge and the attorney, Robert Costello, who is now a witness for the defense. He was the second witness called by the defense team. Costello, who was the subject of some of Michael Cohen's testimony remains on the stand now. Cohen's testimony wrapped up earlier in the day after 17 hours over several days, and the prosecution then rested its case. Under cross-examination today, Michael Cohen admitted that at one point, several years ago, he stole from the Trump Organization. Prosecutors redirected to focus on Cohen's loyalty to Trump and exactly how he was paid. Jessica Schneider is in Washington, DC. Jessica, tell us about this moment when the judge cleared the courtroom. In effect, the judge was saying that Costello was not respecting courtroom decorum. How so?",

Robert Costello, he sighed a few times. He said -- exclaimed, \"Jesus,\" at one point, so the judge was taking great offense to, in a sense, Robert Castello's outburst. Now this came after the judge really wasn't even happy about the fact that the defense sort of called this witness, Robert Costello, at the last minute. Costello is described as a legal adviser to Michael Cohen, not an attorney because Michael Cohen says he never actually signed off on a representation agreement. But apparently, Costello and Cohen had dozens of conversations after Cohen's hotel and office were raided by the FBI in April 2018. So Jim, the key elements of Castello's testimony will be and he has testified a little bit about it, about their conversations, but Costello claims that Michael Cohen repeatedly said that Donald Trump knew nothing about the payment to Stormy Daniels, that Cohen did this all on his own. And also Costello will testify that when he told Cohen to work with federal investigators or consider cooperating, that Cohen supposedly said, you know, I swear to God, I don't have anything on Donald Trump.

He joins us now from New York. Good to have you on. The ICC's answer to the criticism you're hearing now from for instance, President Biden, and from the Israeli leader is that it is not equating Israel who with Hamas, it is in effect equating the victims here. It's accusing them of crimes under the same umbrella but different crimes in effect, it speaks of the October 7th terror attacks by Hamas as horrible. The raping, the murder, the killing, but accusing Israel of something different in effect targeting the Palestinian people, the residents of Gaza for starvation. Do you -- do you agree with that distinction with the ICC saying that they -- they're not equating the two, but they are holding both sides responsible for the effect on their victims? LT. COL. MICHAEL FARKAS, U.S. ARMY MILITARY JUDGE (RET.): Right. Well, from a legal perspective, the law of war is a broad concept, you know, simply because you are charged or alleged to have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity doesn't mean it all falls under the same definition. It is a very broad umbrella. And it has as much to do with your conduct it -- as an intentional violation of the law, as it does about your response. So theoretically, at least, you know, I'm not going to inject my personal opinions into the legal analysis. But as a legal matter, what you said is (INAUDIBLE) the ICC or more specifically the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court who is requesting the warrant, judges still have to approve it. That could take weeks or months. But assuming they do, what the allegation will be is that Hamas perpetrated war crimes in their attacks -- intentional attacks on civilians on October 7th. And in the response to those attacks in the prosecution of its war against Hamas, Israel has crossed the line into illegal activity, war crimes by -- as the prosecutor says, intentionally directing its attacks upon civilians or targeting civilians and using starvation as a way.",

And I wonder, in international law, is there precedent for holding a country such as Israel responsible for military action and in this case, restrictions on movement in and out of Gaza that relate to humanitarian supplies for holding a country responsible for the effects of that.

And by the way, this might be the only case as you know, that it was tried before the election, depending on how the Supreme Court rules on the ongoing January 6 case. But is there a weighted judgment effect of various potential convictions here? I mean, based on what we know about voters view, views of this particular case, and the charges involved, is a conviction in this one likely to be influential?",

For many people who are notfollowing or briefly following this will be about his relationship with, you know, a porn star and efforts to cover it up. And I'm not sure that's going to kind of rise to the level of overthrowing or trying to overthrow an election. So, I do think once this all sinks in, every conviction might not be equal. Again, if that happens, there's also, you know, a very real possibility, there's no conviction in which the former President will certainly capitalize on that to say, you see, he was right all along.

If, for instance, a case on whether a President tried to overturn an election cannot be tried in between the four years between elections, would that be a failure of the U.S. justice system to not -- whether convict or acquit on that charge to decide that case, would that be a failure of the system?",

Meaning you have someone who has been accused of trying to overthrow an election being the nominee for the next election. And if the voters don't really know, kind of what the outcome is, they can't make that decision at the ballot box in addition to giving room for President Trump, if he is reelected to, you know, pardon himself. I said -- so there's all kinds of problems. I would add. Some would say there were problems to the Senate not taking action when impeachment was on the table and they kind of kick this to the court.

It is really interesting because, you know, what Microsoft teased here is that this tool is going tobe able to, for example, find you an old link to something that you were searching for online. Or if you're trying to recall a bit of info from meeting notes, you can sort of ask it a question, a very natural language and the A.I. will go and find that information for you. But it does sound kind of creepy, right? That your computer will have a log of every single thing you've ever done on it. But what Microsoft has said is that none of this is going to leave your device. The company has, you know, sort of this conflict of important technological advancements where they have this very powerful A.I. software, but also really powerful and efficient computer chips which is going to allow the computing for this to happen to stay entirely on your device without connecting to the internet. So, none of your usage activity will leave your device. And all of this will happen without any of that being used to train these A.I. models.",
