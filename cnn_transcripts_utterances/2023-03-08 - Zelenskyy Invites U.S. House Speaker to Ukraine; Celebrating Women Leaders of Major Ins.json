The annual event that celebrates women'sachievements in society, but also draws attention to the still deep inequalities all around the world this is the digital Digit-all innovation, how digital technologies can help advance women's rights and promote greater gender equality. And joining us today to talk about the promise and the significance of International Women's Day Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Director General of the World Trade Organization the underlying message as always, better gender equality, translates to good economics. And from an important message on women's day too, higher interest rates in play Jay Powell rattling investors during testimony in front of Congress on Tuesday the Fed Chair warning that borrowing costs will rise further and stay higher if the data continues to demand it. This means Friday's jobs report and next week's consumer price data will likely decide whether the Federal Reserve sticks with a quarter of a percentage point rate hike at its next meeting, or ramps up to a more aggressive half a percentage point move. Remember history shows that the higher interest rates go the greater the likelihood of U.S. recession and sizable job losses too. U.S. stocks took fright as you would imagine on Powell's prognosis. I'm actually not sure why because I think the data is pretty clear, it's resilient. Though remember in early February, he was admittedly talking about disinflationary trends and of course since then, inflation has proved sticky. Powell has the power to affect trading once again today when he appears in U.S. Congress for a second day running for the moment. U.S. futures and Europe as you can see there holding relatively steady, but just released numbers show U.S. private sector jobs growth still strong in February. This is good news but of course it complicates the inflation picture more on the power of Powell later on in the show. But first, once again, we begin in Ukraine, where the Head of the Wagner mercenary group is claiming a major victory in Bakhmut. He says his fighters now control the Eastern part of the city. And he posted a video message for Ukraine's President telling him to evacuate children and the elderly from the area. Melissa Bell is in Kyiv with the latest. Melissa will be very careful what he says and what this Wagner group alleges on social media but we know the situation there remains bleak.",

We've managed to geo locate those images of them planting their flag at a World War II Memorial confirming the fact that they were moving westwards from the river and therefore managing to take more Eastern parts of Bakhmut and that chilling video that you refer to. Yevgeny Prigozhin speaking from in front of that World War II monument we've seen him as you suggest Julia, these last few days in and around Bakhmut, usually claiming to be closer towards the center than he really was. This time he does appear to be relatively close to the city center and that very chilling message not only to evacuate the civilians, but for Ukraine to send in more of its able bodied men suggesting. Let's see this, let's fix this here and now his men against the Ukrainians and it comes Julia, even as Western Officials have been explaining the prominent role that Wagner mercenaries have indeed been playing in those Russian advances in Bakhmut, really leading the charge supported by regular force artillery. Sometimes that's not been coming through and that they say is what's been behind some of, Yevgeny Prigozhin, more emotional outbursts these last few days in less than subtle messages towards the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. But certainly now despite the toll that the fighting continues to take on them, and Ukrainian forces are saying they've killed 100 Russian soldiers in the course of the last 24 hours as those attacks have continued. Despite those losses, it does seem to be a question of time now, Julia, as to when Ukraine will announce a tactical retreat.",

It's a shift because Japan has a constitution that's rooted in self-defense and pacifism.

Can you quantify how we improve the situation for women, whether that's in business, whatever the trade links or supply chains, and what the opportunity to the global economy is of doing this better with greater equality? OKONJO-IWEALA: Let me start with one very simple and important statistic. Our studies have found that women who trade, who export, earn 2.8 times almost 3 times more than those who sell only in the domestic market, that is highly significant, 3 times more. So that's a huge opportunity. If we can get more women on enterprises participating in global or even regional trade, we can double or triple their incomes. And that means the household welfare is much improved, more children can go to school, you know, and the community's improved, and the nation is improved. So that's the kind of opportunity we are looking at doubling or tripling the incomes of women who are involved, then how do we try to do this, we have a unique opportunity. Now, Julia, we have seen because of the multiple crises we're facing, the vulnerability of supply chains, the concentration of manufacturing of certain products, and people are saying, well, this means that globalization is bad; the multilateral trade is not working. No, it means that we need to think of a different type of globalization. The first type lifted a billion people out of poverty; it was disinflationary making goods, cheaper for consumers, but it didn't include everyone. Poor people and rich countries were left behind, poor countries who are left behind. Can we re-imagine a new type of globalization, what we call re- globalization that would include those left behind, which is women, women have been left behind? How do we include them in these global value chains? How do we get poor countries in? So this is the opportunity. You talked about opportunity? I don't see these things. As you know, as there are problems, yes, are challenges. But there are huge opportunities to use it to bring those excluded, including women, and also, at the same time build global resilience by diversifying our supply chains, and the concentrated manufacturing to those countries that didn't benefit and those regions that did not.",

But if you could ask those nations to take one step, and they weren't allowed to refuse you. What step would you have them take to address the how of all the things that you were just talking about? What's one thing that they could do today to improve the situation? OKONJO-IWEALA: One thing they could surely do is to signal to their business sectors that investing in these other geographies and regions that were left behind that have the right business environment, Julia, I insist on that. But there are many countries that have been left out. Signal to them that it would be good for business to diversify there. I keep hearing that diversification is China plus one. And when they say China plus one is China, plus Indonesia, China plus India. And now we say what about China plus Morocco? What about Rwanda? What about Nigeria? What about Brazil or Argentina or Bangladesh? There are other places that they can incentivize their businesses to also look at. So that is the one ask I would have of these countries.",

OKONJO-IWEALA: Julia, I think that it is crucial, we do extend it. And I think it would be enormously difficult if it were not extended. First of all, for Ukraine, this is one way that it ensures that it continues to get its own revenue to be able to survive and pay some of its bills. But very importantly, for the outside world, if it does not continue, we have a situation in which food prices continued to be high and many countries depend on this region for food and fertilizer.

The plant base category, as it's defined by Nielsen, which includes legacy players, around Garner Burgers and things like that, that have been around 25 years, as well as you know, players like Beyond Me. And us, which are more meat replacements is plateauing. So that is a fact, right. So, you're not seeing the growth rates that you want saw a year or two ago. And there are a lot of reasons for that, you know, there are 206 plant- based players in the U.S. And a lot of those people, a lot of those brands didn't scale, they've come in, they've come out, there's high churn, some of the legacy players aren't growing as they once were.

Yes, because we're mirroring, taste texture, flavor of an animal product, using plants, which is not easy. But to find processed. And this has been a word that's been bandied about. And a lot of it's been by the animal industry, which is highly coordinated and well invested. Processed foods, first of all, most things you buy in grocery stores are processed. That's number one. Number two, the core definition of processed is high sugar, high fat, OK, with a load of artificial ingredients, you know, I think Twinkies processed.

If you want more people who favor eating animal products, you got to continuously improve your plant-based products, right because the audience is not plant.

And I take your point about them having great influence; I'm sure in all sorts of things around the world, but whether Redditors in that article paid?",

After initially mocking him onthe platform startup founder Halli Thorleifsson took to Twitter to ask the chief executive directly to let him know if he'd been fired. The Icelander said he'd been locked out of his accounts, but the company wouldn't confirm he'd been let go. Anna Stewart is back with the latest twist. And I think you have to set the scene briefly for people those viewers that weren't watching us yesterday. He asked Elon Musk about his job. They then had a back and forth. And then he came back with a very eloquent response to Elon Musk yesterday on Twitter.",

      "sentences": "The back and forth was really quite explosive. I mean, this is a man trying to work out whether he still works forTwitter. He says the Head of HR at Twitter doesn't even know if he works there. So, he goes to Elon Musk on Twitter and says, hey, am I still employed? And that sparked this conversation of Elon Musk asking what he did at Twitter sending a laughing emojis in the response to that, saying that he was fired. And then saying perhaps the worst part of all saying that Halli had used a disability isn't excuse saying it prevented him from typing, while he was simultaneously tweeting up a storm. Now to this, Halli went into great depth about his disability muscular dystrophy. He has been using a wheelchair for 20 years and he struggles with his fingers. So, there was a huge response on Twitter, as you could imagine, against Elon Musk. This including one photographer who had actually worked with Halli and said he could vouch for him saying his work ethic was next level, his talent and humility was world class. And then we got this response from Elon Musk. And I have to say, of all of the tweets that we had in the last sort of 48 hours, this is perhaps the most surprising coming from Elon Musk. He said based on your comments, I just did a video call with Halli to figure out what's real versus what I was told. It's a long story better to talk to people than communicate via tweet. And he went on to say, I would like to apologize to Halli for my misunderstanding of his situation. It was based on things I was told that were untrue, or in some cases, true but not meaningful. He is considering remaining at Twitter; there is a lot to break down in all of that. Is this the pivotal moment when Elon Musk decides not to troll people on Twitter and use his words perhaps on a video call or phone remains to be seen? What do you think Julia?",

Therewere a few things in this that I, you know, question was this real remorse? Was this legal pressure? Was it a mixture of the two? We will never probably know. Will this change the way Musk interacts on Twitter that we have to wait and see? Another intriguing part, though obvious apology is when Musk says he is considering remaining at Twitter. I mean, I believe he was fired yesterday, but perhaps he will remain lots of people on Twitter of course saying don't do it. Don't go back to the abusive relationship of your former employer. Nothing yet from Halli so be very interesting and watching his Twitter page today to see whether there are any further developments.",
