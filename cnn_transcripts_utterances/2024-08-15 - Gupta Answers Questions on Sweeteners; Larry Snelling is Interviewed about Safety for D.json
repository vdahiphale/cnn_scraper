      "sentences": "You know what they say, John, everything in moderation except moderation, right? Right. So, you've got to just make it an adjunct in your life. So, we looked into this, Martha. So, if you're looking at some ofthese sweeteners, there's acceptable safe limits when it comes to these sweeteners. So, if you look at the -- what the FDA says specifically about I think the sweetener that you're taking, we looked this up, you could possibly be eating up to 23 packets a day of that and still be considered within the safe limit. But what I will say is that we're starting to learn more, just even over the past several months and weeks. Erythritol, for example, something that made a lot of headlines this past week, what they found in a very small study was that people who were taking erythritol, 30 grams of that, could actually double their risk of clotting over the short term. So, people would actually eat the 30 grams of erythritol compared to 30 grams of glucose and their clotting risk would go up with the erythritol. So, I think what we're learning here is that just because it is low or no calorie doesn't mean you can have as much as you want. People generally have sort of understood that. But I think the data is making that more and more clear. So, you can use those again if you don't want to spike your blood sugar, but be careful, especially if you're doing it in excess.",

You know, it's hard to predict the number of people or the number of protesters who may show up. We do expect a large group of people to converge upon the city and -- be it just a visit, to participate in the Democratic National Convention, or to come here and exercise their First Amendment rights.

We planned around it. We looked at areas where we made mistakes. We looked across the country. We looked at those mistakes. And we've taken corrective action on those past mistakes.One of the things that happened in 1968 is, you know, preparation for something like this takes time. And when you have a department as large as the Chicago Police Department, we have to make sure that all of our offices have the appropriate amount of training and effective training that's going to help us respond to incidents like this better. So, the difference between 1968 and now is that the department has evolved, the city has evolved. And during that evolution, we've gotten a lot better at dealing with these types of large scale events.",
