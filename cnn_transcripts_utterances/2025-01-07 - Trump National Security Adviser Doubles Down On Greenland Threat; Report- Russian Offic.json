It has really become clear through a crescendo since his election through social media responses.But today at that news conference in Mar-a-Lago, he made clear repeatedly in question after question and answer after answer. This is something he is intent on doing, and for the first time, really cloaking it in a national security argument. As you said, this is not something we have heard the why necessarily until right now. Now, he did often sound like the real estate magnate he's been his entire life. Of course, now he's president elect. In 13 days, he will be the 47th president of the United States. So anything he says moves markets, concerns allies and beyond. Now the question, is he talking about this as a negotiating tactic? Is he trying to rattle allies? But one thing is vastly different from the beginning of his first term nearly eight years ago, which we, of course followed along with, there was an isolationist strain in his voice. An American First agenda, if you will. That is not what we're hearing now. He clearly is making a case on Greenland, on Canada and the Panama Canal specifically, and using the death of Jimmy Carter, who, of course, one of his biggest accomplishments was ratifying that Panama Canal treaty back in 1977, also saying that is part of the economic security interests of the U.S. We will see how this plays out. There are many things he talked about at his news conference, many things he is pushing on day one. But, Erin, one thing is a bit uncertain. How would any of this happen? Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters today in the Capitol he has not been part of any of these discussions at all. So never mind U.S. law. All of these things would also violate international law. So, the bluster versus the reality a bit unclear, but there is no doubt about it at all. Donald Trump is serious about Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal -- Erin.",

In fact, I think strategically, one of the mistakes here is that had they only gone to Judge Cannon, this would have probably delayed things a little longer than going simultaneously to Judge Cannon in the 11th Circuit. But as we know, the 11th Circuit has already asked the Justice Department to respond tomorrow morning, which suggests that they may be prepared to mitigate the stain that she is and the stain that she's created again for the judiciary quickly on this. BURNETT: So, Smith's office, Jack Smith's office says Garland has not actually yet determined whether he would even publicly release the report, but that if it's released, it comes Friday morning at the earliest. We know Trump's team had a chance to see it, and that's when they -- they took great umbrage with its release.

There will be likely be redactions in this case, particularly as to the two potential defendants whose case may move forward once the 11th Circuit reverses. Judge Cannon, as they are almost certainly to do with regard to her ruling that the special counsel statute was unconstitutional and Smith had no authority.So I think, they will be cautious and, and lawyerly about that. But as to the release of special counsel reports, that's a decision entrusted by the statute, the special counsel statute and internal Justice Department policies solely to the attorney general. The courts don't really have a role in connection with that. And absent, you know, highly unusual circumstances which these are not. So, yes, I would be surprised if the report is not released, assuming that that happens before January 20th. After January 20th, of course, all bets are off.

We're going to check back in with them in just a few moments here as it develops.Also, though, do want to share with you the other breaking details we have, the breaking news that Russia is paying to kill Americans. There's a new bombshell joint investigation by investigative journalist Christo Grozev, a regular, of course, to all of you, along with Der Spiegel and the insider. And it reveals that top Russian military officers paid the Taliban tens of millions of dollars to kill American troops. The report, also detailing that the covert bounty program was linked to several attacks, including a sophisticated assault on Bagram Air Base. The Taliban members boasted about the payments. They posted photos on social media showing stacks of American dollars that they were paid, paid by Russians, American dollars to kill Americans, and then said the Russian military's money was being laundered through gems like this that you're looking at here. That is an uncut emerald that was smuggled into Afghanistan. OUTFRONT now, Christo Grozev, the investigative journalist who broke this story, also, of course, the reporter who uncovered those responsible for Alexei Navalny's poisoning. Christo, we were just showing some of your exclusive photos and video, the stacks of money, that uncut emerald. So, all of this you found this is Russia directly offering tens of millions of dollars to kill Americans?",

It never happened. Russia cannot be behind the money for American soldiers that get killed.The subsequent administration of Joe Biden also denied that this did happen. It is true. We found hard evidence. It is true. We showed you the money, literally the cash that was probably used for an attack on the life of one American, apparently for one dead American, the Russians paid 200,000. What you're seeing here is exactly 200,000. We've proven this, and we've actually shown the face in the report that comes out tomorrow across a variety of our colleagues in different media. We're showing the faces of the Russian operatives who are running the program, who were running the program for more than ten years. We're showing also the faces of the Afghan nationalists who are part of this network of couriers who are smuggling gems, smuggling other forms of valuables across many, many borders. And they did it in a very sophisticated, sophisticated way. They traveled from Moscow to intermediary countries, some of them to the United Arab Emirates, some of them to India, others to Pakistan and Tajikistan. In order for them to lose the traces for the trackability of the Russian origin of the money, and then would deliver them in stacks of cash to Kabul and to Kunduz, and to other places in Afghanistan, where they were paid through intermediaries to the Taliban. So, yes, that's what we were able to prove with data, with granular phone records, with granular travel records.",

And at the end of the film, there's a scene where the Taliban are showing off their captured weapons from the American bases. They're showing off a military parade, and there are a lot of foreign dignitaries that are present there.One of them you're seeing on the screen is wearing glasses. He's a typical, I mean, central casting spy. What I did in the cinema hall, I took out my phone and I took a snapshot of this person, and I did a reverse face search. And I found that he's a very interesting character. He's a member of Russian military intelligence. And by focusing on him and on his network of phone records and travel data, I find out, found out the people that were responsible for running the Afghanistan network of couriers who were paying the Taliban. It wasn't as easy as one, two, three, but it did take several weeks. And the origin of the first phase that actually led to the unraveling of this program came from this film.",

Perhaps he liked the mystery and the speculation. After all, \"Newsweek\", \"The New Republic\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"The Verge\" were just some of the media outlets writing articles about whether the account was a secret Musk account or not, so he was getting a lot of attention over this. Reporter Jacqueline Sweet is the reporter who investigated Adrian Dittmann's account to get to the truth, and she reports in the spectator that he is not a fake account controlled by Elon Musk himself. In fact, Adrian Dittmann is a real person, a German businessman living in Fiji, according to Jacqueline's reporting. And she is OUTFRONT. So, Jacqueline, just after you posted a link to your reporting on X, and so you did in the spectator, you post a link. Everybody can see it.

The wind can take those embers a mile, two miles, and they can set another spot fire. That's what they're dealing with.The other issue around here, this is like a hilly community. The roads are very narrow. So when people were told to evacuate, it was very difficult to evacuate. Some people tried and couldn't. There were huge traffic jams. People were abandoning their cars, going on foot. Now we also saw L.A. Fire Department bulldozers just moving those cars out of the way, pushing them out of the way. So, engines like this can come in here to try to fight these fires. Now the other -- Chris, look at this. I mean, this house. You know, I was here six minutes ago. This house was pristine. Look at it. Now, these houses behind me have been burning for some time now. So the strange thing about these fires is they're kind of predictable.
