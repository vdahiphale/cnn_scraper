Tonight, CNN chief investigative correspondent Pamela Brown brings us the story of three women in legal battles with one of the largest health care companies in the world over a commonly used household item they say is responsible for causing their cancers. That product is Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum baby powder. For more than a century, the name Johnson &amp; Johnson was synonymous with baby powder. The lawsuit from these women claimed the powder contained asbestos, and these are just three out of tens of thousands in lawsuits Johnson &amp; Johnson is facing over this product which was discontinued in the U.S. and Canada in 2020. And Johnson &amp; Johnson staunchly denies these claims and you'll hear from them directly in this hour about their methodology and their science. Pamela Brown will also show just how this corporation is protecting its brand and how it could become a road map for other corporations facing mass litigation. \"Shaken: Baby Powder on Trial.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POWLESS-BUENROSTRO: Anyone tells you you have cancer, I don't care who you are, you're in shock.

The documents show that the company knew that there was asbestos in Johnson's Baby Powder going back to the 1950s. And specifically, there was some testing done by a group called Battelle, and we have one document showing in 1958 that Battelle found in Johnson's Baby Powder tremolite, and we have Battelle describing the tremolite fibrous, which is asbestos.Here's a document, April 15th, 1969, Johnson &amp; Johnson is talking about the dangers of needle-like Tremolite, and it says that we should consult the law department on that question. P. BROWN: So, I mean, Johnson &amp; Johnson is at the center of this, and so it is essential to hear from this lawyer who has been defending Johnson &amp; Johnson in court. A. BROWN: The first thing that is most important for me that people know about these cases is that they are doing an enormous disservice to a very important issue of women's health. What we can say with 100 percent certainty is that we have never confirmed a finding of asbestos in any product that has been sold, and that decades of scientific testing and study have shown that our talc is safe and does not cause cancer. P. BROWN: So one of the plaintiff's attorneys that we interviewed brought up this document. This is from the Battelle Memorial Institute. I want to hand this to you and get your reaction. A. BROWN: So there are a number of these Battelle reports, and plaintiffs often point to these findings of tremolite in an effort to suggest that they mean asbestos. But we only have to look at Battelle's published scientific articles to know that these reports do not show asbestos. P. BROWN: I want to show you this other document that I read. It says, quote, \"It is not inconceivable that we could be involved in litigation.\" A. BROWN: This is another document that plaintiffs like to use in litigation. I think it shows an important point of how Johnson &amp; Johnson was carefully studying and selecting its mines. The subject is \"Alternate Domestic Talc Source Project 101.\" Project 101 was our effort to qualify new talc mines, and this document refers to the Grantham talc mine, which is a talc mine that we never wound up using.",

Was that just a way for Johnson &amp; Johnson to avoid another multi-billion-dollar payout? A. BROWN: Absolutely not.
