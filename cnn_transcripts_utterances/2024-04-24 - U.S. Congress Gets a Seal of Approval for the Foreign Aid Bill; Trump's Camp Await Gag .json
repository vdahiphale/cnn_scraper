After months of delay in the U.S. Congress, a multibillion-dollar aid package will finally get critically-needed military supplies to Ukraine. The gag order hearing goes awry. Tensions flare between the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial and the former president's lawyers. And pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University in New York entered their eighth day after a midnight deadline to disperse came and went. Urgently-needed supplies of ammunition, artillery rounds, air defense systems and long-range missiles are expected to be airlifted to Ukraine within days after the U.S. Congress finally approved a military aid package which had been stalled for months by Republican lawmakers. Ukraine will receive nearly $61 billion from the $95 billion foreign aid bill which was approved by the Senate just a few hours ago. The rest will go to Israel and Taiwan. President Joe Biden says he will sign the bill into law in the coming hours. In a social media post, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for the Senate's passage of the bill. Israeli leaders also thanked the Senate. After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Democrat Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell addressed the chamber. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMMER (D-NY). MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE: We tell our allies, we stand with you. We tell our adversaries, don't mess with us. We tell the world, the United States will do everything to safeguard democracy and our way of life. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MINORITY LEADER OF THE U.S. SENATE: It's time to reaffirm some basic truths. Alliances matter. A foreign nation's respect for American interests depends on our willingness to defend them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The judge in the historic hush money trial told the former U.S. president's lawyers, quote, \"you're losing all credibility, as they struggled to defend at least 10 possible violations of a gag order\". Trump is not allowed to publicly discuss witnesses, the jury or the district attorney's staff. And the judge seems likely to sanction him. Meanwhile, a former tabloid publisher testified about how he bought and buried unfavorable stories about Trump that could have damaged his first run for the White House, a strategy that's known as catch-and-kill that prosecutors say was part of an election fraud scheme. CNN's Kara Scannell picks up the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Explosive witness testimony from a tabloid executive in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday. Ex-\"National Enquirer\" publisher David Pecker described acting as the eyes and ears of Trump's 2016 campaign, notifying Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, about any negative stories to help get them killed in the lead up to the election. Pecker is a key player involved in the crux of the prosecution's case, an alleged scheme to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up her alleged affair with Trump to influence the 2016 election. Questioning centered on an August 2015 meeting between Pecker, Cohen and Trump, where the alleged conspiracy was hatched. Pecker, who ran the \"National Enquirer\", testified that at the meeting, I said what I would do is I would run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents. He additionally offered, if I hear anything negative about yourself or if I hear anything about women selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen, as I did over the last several years. And Michael Cohen, then he would be able to have them killed in another magazine or have them not published or somebody would have to purchase them. Trump stared at Pecker as he described the 25 minute meeting, but he did not react. Pecker said after the meeting, he told the \"Enquirer's\" editor in chief about the mutually beneficial agreement. He said, we're going to try to help the campaign. And to do that, I want to keep this as quiet as possible. Joshua Steinglass then asked Pecker about a specific catch-and-kill incident where a negative Trump story was bought and buried. Pecker testified he found Trump's doorman was selling a story that he fathered a child with someone other than his wife, and he immediately alerted Cohen. Pecker said his colleague negotiated to purchase the story for $30,000. And when he called Cohen to tell him, Cohen responded, the boss would be very pleased. Even though the allegation was disproven, he testified, I made the decision to purchase the story because of the potential embarrassment it would have to the campaign and Mr. Trump. Steinglass also asked Pecker about another catch-and-kill scheme, buying former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story about an alleged year-long relationship with Trump. Pecker described a phone call he had with Trump after his colleague interviewed McDougal. Pecker said, I told him, I think you should buy it. And Trump responded saying, anytime you do anything like this, it always gets out. He said he would think about it. And Pecker would hear from Cohen. Trump denies having an affair with McDougal. The morning started with a contentious hearing to determine if Trump violated a gag order not to talk about jurors or witnesses. After he did so in social media posts almost a dozen times. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We have a gag order, which to me is totally unconstitutional. SCANNELL (voice-over): Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, said the order was not clear about reposts. And he tried to argue that the former president was actually trying to comply with the order. Judge Juan Merchant, exasperated with Blanche's argument, scolded him and said, you're losing all credibility with the court. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

These are warnings that we have, of course, seen before in the Beit Lahiya area where this specific message was targeted for civilians, outlining an entire block, an entire area where the Israeli military says it will be targeting what it has described as terrorist infrastructure with, quote, \"heavy force\".Now, that warning came in to civilians. It's unclear how many people will actually receive that warning. They were told to evacuate immediately. But of course, as we know, connectivity and electricity in Gaza is sporadic, to say the least. And of course, it is uncertain whether anyone would have actually received that message and able to pass that on to nearby civilians. And of course, that warning to move immediately to what the Israeli military has described as known shelters in the south and in the west. But as we have seen, as we've heard from the United Nations itself, there are very few safe places left for civilians to flee to in Gaza. And what, in fact, we have been seeing over the last few days and weeks are civilians in parts of southern Gaza that had once been deemed as safe zones actually fleeing and moving back into parts of central and northern Gaza, the very same areas where the Israeli military is now conducting repeated strikes. Many are fearing a ground incursion in the south, and in particular in the southern city of Rafah, where some 1.7 million people are now displaced. And of course, we've been hearing those warnings of a looming ground operation. And as a result, many have taken their families and moved back into parts of central and northern Gaza. So this is certainly raising concern. And as you mentioned, Nick, getting aid into Gaza is still proving extremely difficult, but more so in parts of central and northern Gaza, where it is very difficult for aid agencies to operate, where the logistical challenges of actually distributing aid are immense.

Now, of course, that stands in contrast to the response that we have since received from the Israeli military.

But ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, like other Chinese companies, must comply with Chinese legislation, including security and cybersecurity legislation.I want to share with you fresh Chinese reaction to this potential U.S. TikTok ban. We just learned from our colleague Marc Stewart in Beijing. He just asked in the last half hour China's foreign ministry for comment on a potential TikTok ban. And this is what we heard from Wang Wenbin. He said this, quote, \"I have nothing to add today.\" Now, when the U.S. President Joe Biden signs this bill into law, the clock is going to be ticking for Byte Dance to either sell TikTok U.S. or to shut it down. TikTok is based in L.A. It's based in Singapore, but it is a unit of the Beijing-based private tech company ByteDance. And that has been fueling the fears in the U.S. that the Chinese government could use it to spy or to shape public opinion. Again, TikTok denies that, says it's an entertainment app. It doesn't allow any government to influence its recommendation model. But can TikTok be sold off? What is next for the app? Now, the Chinese government has said on the record it opposes a sale. It does not want ByteDance to give up the TikTok algorithm, its core technology, and the secret to its success. And analysts that we've been talking to, they say the ramifications of a ban in the U.S. are profound here. It would actually cause a further split of the world into two tech spheres, one tech world aligned with U.S. technology, U.S. laws and U.S. brands, and the other aligned with China. I want to share with you what Alex Capri at the National University of Singapore shared with us earlier. Let's bring up that for you. He says that a ban is a loss of soft power for Beijing, what little it has left in the West. But a ban in the U.S. will spark renewed efforts to spread China's digital footprint in Southeast Asia and other mostly developing markets worldwide. Now, TikTok in the U.S. has said it plans to challenge the legislation in court. Back to you, Nick.",
