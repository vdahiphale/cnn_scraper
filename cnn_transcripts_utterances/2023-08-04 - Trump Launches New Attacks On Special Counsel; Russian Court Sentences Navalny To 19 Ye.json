Actually, he's not really asking.

Thank you both, for being here. Jennifer, let me start with you, on just the comment that Trump made, there, not -- calling Jack Smith, \"Deranged,\" which he has been doing, essentially non-stop.

But the big difference here, of course, is wherever the former President goes, the Secret Service goes with him, raising the question of if Trump got convicted, and sentenced to prison, what would incarceration look like, for a former U.S. President?

EVY POUMPOURAS, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT, AUTHOR, \"BECOMING BULLETPROOF\": I actually don't think it's going to be very difficult. He is going to a very secure location. So, depending on what prison he goes, federal or state, because he's also being charged, in New York, through the state, Miami, D.C., they're charging him federally. So, there's also a difference between the prisons. If you want to go to prison, you want to go to a federal prison. They're typically safer. State prisons tend to have more violent offenders there. So, that's one thing. The other thing is they already have their own security set up. So Bureau of Prisons, let's say, he goes federal, they've got their own system set up. It's already safe. You're actually looking at less manpower, less resources, less money, definitely less money, for taxpayers. So, when I see that I see him going to an already-secure facility.

So, the idea would be you can probably maybe pick, shuffle people around, and put those people there. But at the end of the day, it's a secure environment. Secret Service will probably give him what's called shift agents. Shift is when you see agents, who accompany the Presidents, when you see him coming out of Air Force One, Marine One. It's the group, the contingency that walks around him. That's what you might see, and detail leaders, so somebody kind of to shadow him around.",

A lot of people will not have heard of it. But if you have a teenager, in your house, you probably have heard of it. But it's not just gamers that are using these platforms. We know AOC, other members of Congress, are on these platforms. And this guy was also streaming, on YouTube, where I think he has something more than like 3 million followers. And look, that is really where young people, teenagers, are going, not just every day, but multiple times a day. The Pew, last year, Research Center, came out with data showing that 60 percent, 6-0-percent of teenagers, of all teenagers, in the U.S., watch YouTube, go to YouTube, multiple times a day.
