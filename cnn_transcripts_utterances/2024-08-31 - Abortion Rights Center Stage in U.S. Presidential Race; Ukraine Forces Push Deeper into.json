Republican nominee Donald Trump appears to have changed his stance on Florida's six-week abortion ban. And he's refusing to commit to vetoing a possible federal ban.On Friday he told supporters in Pennsylvania that he wants Americans to get in vitro fertilization treatments at no cost. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has fired back at Trump with a strong response to his comments on abortion. And her campaign announced a bus tour through battleground states to support reproductive rights. We start our coverage with Trump saying he'll vote no on a Florida constitutional amendment that would allow abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. Florida law currently bans abortions after six weeks. The amendment will be on the ballot there in November. It's another reversal for Trump, who has previously said he is against a six-week ban.

Like president Trump, he agrees that we need to find common ground on this issue. \"As a senator, he has not supported any legislation which would impose a federal abortion ban.\" It appears the new election subversion case against Donald Trump will not go before a judge before November's election. Special counsel Jack Smith and Trump's lawyers filed a status report with the Washington, D.C., court on Friday. It shows that Trump's legal team is at odds with Smith over how the case should proceed. Smith is not offering firm dates for the next phase of the case. Trump's team is recommending a schedule that could stretch into early next year and possibly even later. The new superseding indictment came this week. Smith says it's designed to comply with the Supreme Court's earlier ruling on presidential immunity. Trump's lawyers say it does not do that. Well, Trump is, again, asking the judge in his hush money conviction to delay sentencing. His lawyers have asked that the case be moved to federal court and they're asking Judge Juan Merchan to hold off on any substantive motions until after the request plays out. Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts in the case. He's scheduled to be sentenced on September 18th. The sentence could include prison time or probation.

State police confirm the siblings were bike riding and southern New Jersey when they were hit by an SUV. Sean Higgins is the 43-year-old alleged drunk driver. He was charged with two counts of death by auto police records showing that he admitted to drinking five to six beers before the accident and failed field sobriety test. Gaudreau, who earned the nickname Johnny Hockey was drafted by the Calgary Flames in 2011 -- signed with the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2022, where he tallied a dozen goals and nearly 50 assists the last season alone. Johnny played the game with great joy, read a statement from his team. The impact he had on our organization and our sport was profound but pales in comparison to the indelible impression he made on everyone who knew him. But despite the success in the rank, the true passion appeared to be off the ice, as a loving husband and proud father of two babies, the youngest born this year and carries dad's name. Matthew followed in his brother's footsteps, playing side-by-side with Johnny in Boston College. Coaches there described the brothers as full of joy for the sport.
