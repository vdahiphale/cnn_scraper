But what we understand from Russian state media is that he was arrested on, quote, espionage, suspicion of espionage.I want you to read the statement from the FSB, the federal security services, that was published in state media just a few moments ago. It reads, quote, the illegal activities of bureau of the American newspaper, \"The Wall Street Journal\", U.S. citizen Evan Gershkovich, accredited to the Russian foreign ministry, suspected of espionage in the interest of the American government have been suppressed. This is huge news, of course. We are talking about an American citizen who has now been arrested for what you can assume is doing his job doing the job, the very important job of being a journalist reporting the news on the ground. We understand that he was detained in a town on the eastern side of the Ural Mountains. The FSB statement that was published in state media goes on to say that he was trying to, quote, obtain secret information. Again, that's from the FSB relating to the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex. Again, this is a very prominent journalist, as you said. He was on CNN just a few months ago. He's someone who has reported in the past for the \"AFP\", for \"The New York Times\", absolutely something that you can expect. Right now, the State Department is scrambling to respond to and you can expect very strong statements from the White House. A reminder here, if you remember at the very beginning of the conflict, the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moscow put into place this rule, put into place this law that it said was to counter fake news, but that activists and media organizations simply saw as a censorship law and it required journalists, even Western journalists to use the language that Moscow uses to not acknowledge that this is a war in Ukraine, but rather a special military operation as President Putin has called it time and time again. So huge concern now that potentially around those reporting restrictions, what activists would actually call censorship restrictions put into place that this American journalist has been detained. And again, you can expect U.S. officials now scrambling to find out the status, the safety of this journalist and trying to get that release, that condemnation as quickly as possible.",

Hadas, these two men have known each other for decades. You know what do you what do you make of this? HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's not a very good status of the relationship if they've known each other for more than 40 years and often talk about it, but then you have the president of the United States, saying he won't be inviting his good friend to visit anytime in the near term. Now, yesterday, senior Israeli officials were briefing reporters left and right, essentially trying to do damage control. I was one of the reporters in one of those briefings with a senior Israeli official who will remain unnamed, and they were trying to tamp down on the situation, saying this isn't a crisis, they said this is a tempest in a teapot. They labeled it a level two out of 10 on crisis and relationship between the United States and Israel. That's not all how it's being portrayed in Israeli media and by the opposition who are saying that the Israeli government as it stands now is threatening to destroy one of the most important relationships for Israel, for its security and for its status in the world, because of this judicial overhaul. Now, one thing that the senior Israeli official did tell reporters is they chided the Americans for essentially trying to get involved in another democracy's internal affairs, saying a democracy should let other democracies figure it out. And he did say that they think that they expected the White House to sort of clarify the president's comments. And we did hear from John Kirby later in the day talking about how you know even the best of friends can have disagreements and how much of a supporter of Israel the United States remains, and they just want Israelis to come to a broad consensus on these reforms because that will be what last.

Let me read you some of what was said. China strongly condemns the U.S. for insisting on arranging for Tsai Ing-wen to transit across the border, disregarding China's solemn representations and repeated warnings, the United States and Taiwan colluded with each other and arrange for Tsai Ing-wen to engage in political activities in the United States under the guise of transit. Now, earlier, President Tsai praised her country's bond with the United States, saying it's never been closer. But what is really upsetting the Chinese is Tsai's expected meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, as you mentioned Christine, in California on the way back to Taiwan. McCarthy, of course, would be the highest ranking U.S. official to meet a Taiwanese leader on American soil. China has threatened to, quote, resolutely fight back if they meet in Los Angeles. China believes Taiwan belongs to China. It has refused to rule out the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. And while the U.S. acknowledges China's position, it maintains that Taiwan's status should be settled peacefully between Beijing and Taipei. And, of course, you know her trip comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing, but U.S. officials say China shouldn't overreact. This is simply routine. Take a listen.
