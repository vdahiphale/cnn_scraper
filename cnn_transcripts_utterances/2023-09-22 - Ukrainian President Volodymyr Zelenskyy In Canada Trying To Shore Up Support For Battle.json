(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) The military launched a missile attack on Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters. Take a look at this video. You can actually hear sirens as the smoke billows from this building. This is from a social media video. But here's why this attack is key. It is in Sevastopol, which is the largest city in Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Russia back in 2014. Ukraine has made no secret that it wants Crimea back. (END VIDEO CLIP) Just last week, a Ukrainian attack on a shipyard in Sevastopol damaged two Russian ships undergoing repairs. It's symbolic, as well. The Black Sea Fleet is considered the flagship of the Russian Navy. Now, to keep up with the fight, Ukraine needs money. It needs resources. That is why Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Canada right now trying to shore up support for the battle with Russia. He's been meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and thanked Canada for its support so far. His visit, of course, comes on the heels of his trip to Washington. Mrs. Zelenskyy left the U.S. with a promise of more than $300 million in new aid for the war effort. U.S. President Joe Biden has proposed a much larger aid package, but that's proving to be a hard sell to some Republican lawmakers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH HAWLEY, U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN:  What the meeting revealed to me is, is that in the words of President Zelenskyy, the conflict is a total stalemate. That's what he said. Totally frozen. All right, we'll have more on the Black Sea Fleet attack in just a moment. But first, let's go to Paula Newton, who is in Ottawa covering Mrs. Zelensky's visit. So, Paula, this is President Zelenskyy's first in-person visit to Ottawa since the war actually began. Obviously, he's addressed Parliament via video link. This is his first time there in person. Just walk us through what the two men are discussing. Obviously, it is a much more friendly audience, given that many Republicans in the United States are skeptical about sending more military aid to Ukraine.",

In terms of material support, though, what Canada can offer and what they're willing to offer, obviously in absolute terms, much smaller than not just the United States, but the E.U. allies, as well. Still, significant support, as you say, especially coming off the heels of that very bold attack on the Black Sea fleet headquarters in Crimea. The issue we just heard about how certain legislators in the United States are continuing to make this seem as if it's a stalemate, right? A long and grinding war. President Zelenskyy is here. He believes on the front foot, on an aggressive posture to say we can win. We are winning. Give us some more time and crucially give us some more military aid. I want you to listen now to President Zelenskyy being welcomed by Prime Minister Trudeau, the two at this hour sitting down again to hammer out more military aid. Listen to President Zelenskyy.

      "sentences": "Well, Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a major attack in Sevastopol at the Russian Black SeaNaval Fleet headquarters. This is a major milestone for the Ukrainians in several weeks of attacks on Crimean areas, specifically on areas that are key war infrastructure for Russia. Just yesterday, there was the attack on the Saki Air Base, where 12 military aircraft were being held, as well as an area key for training drone operators. Last week as well, there were attacks on the Sevastopol ship repair facility where several ships were being held that are key for Russia's war in Ukraine. Today's attack is perhaps the most significant yet. Huge plumes of smoke arising from these buildings, residents being told to stay indoors and be careful of the hundreds of meters of debris all around. And the Sevastopol governor, the Russian-appointed governor, warning that this is maybe going to be a second attack. Well, that ended up not to be the case, but clearly a level of chaos and fear, not knowing how many attacks there were going to be. This is a major milestone for Ukraine in a war that is struggling into the winter months now with the counteroffensive very much underway, but still making some challenging progress with some marginal gains. And while Zelenskyy is in the U.S., trying to persuade U.S. lawmakers to ensure that U.S. funding for Ukraine and its counteroffensive continues, this kind of success in terms of targeting key pieces of Russian infrastructure is surely going to help his case.

But he said he is making headway in negotiations with Ford, so he's not expanding the strike there.

She's been following this story from the very beginning since the strike first started. But just walk us through, just let's start with the good news, right Vanessa?

UAW President Shawn Fain issaying that progress is being made with Ford, and that is why you do not see workers from any more Ford plants heading to the picket lines right now. He says that in -- he was able to, in the recent proposal that Ford presented to him, he was able to see that they made really big strides on key things like cost of living, reinstating that, that was something that workers lost in 2009, job security, that if folks were laid off of their jobs, they would receive two years of income and benefits. Also, an increase in profit-sharing from these companies and the elimination of tiers that is basically bringing lower wage workers, temporary workers up to the wages that people have been receiving at the company for many years in a shorter period of time, a 90-day transition from temporary to full-time workers. But of course, GM and Stellantis not proposing that same robust deal that President Fain seems to be liking right now. So, now you have, just moments ago, workers from 38 facilities, GM and Stellantis, heading to the picket lines across the country, across 20 states, that is about 5600 workers now joining the nearly 13,000 workers that have been on strike for the past eight days or so. We do want to note, though, from Ford and the union, they are still far apart on key economic issues. In the proposal that Shawn Fain presented from Ford, notably missing was wages. We have heard so much about how the union wants a 40 percent wage increase over four years. The latest public offers from the three companies have been 20 percent. Both Ford and the union saying that there's still a long way to go on that, and obviously still a long way to go for GM and Stellantis, as they are now facing workers from 38 of their facilities heading to the picket lines just moments ago, Zain.",

How long are you going to wait here? They said they're going to wait here until they let them in. The migrants tell us they've been robbed and attacked on the Mexican side of the river. After hours of waiting, the migrants figure out a way to crawl under the razor wire. In a surreal scene, one man instantly apologized. They wanted to apologize for crossing illegally into the U.S. and that they're begging and asking for mercy, but to understand that they're coming from a country where they're persecuted and they feel like if they were to be returned home, they would be killed. The mass influx of migrants causing tension between federal and state authorities. Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted this video accusing border agents of cutting razor wire at an undisclosed location in Eagle Pass, allowing trapped migrants to turn themselves in. DHS officials refused to comment on the governor's allegation. On Wednesday, about 3000 migrants crossed in Eagle Pass alone. It's something very strange.

No, I'm talking about clothing, and much of it has to do with the world of fastfashionearth.org., says that it's had a direct effect on the fashion industry as a whole, and that clothing sales have doubled from 100 to 200 billion units a year. So, how and why are these fast fashion brands doing so well? Well, one thing, obviously, they're literally fast. Many times, customers are able to get their items the next or even the same day. Prices are also incredibly competitive and among the lowest in the industry. They're also so reasonable that many consumers don't bat an eyelid when they throw items away after wearearth.org estimates that $500 billion are lost every year in waste.

Human induced climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution related health impacts. These are three major things that we really need to pay attention to.

I mean, we've had conversations withofficials in Chad, for example, and places like that who have welcomed in refugees and who are overwhelmed, quite frankly. I do want to touch on this idea of potential peace at some point in Sudan, because both military leaders are saying that they're open to peace talks. But there's a big gap between being open to peace talks and having peace talks and actually having a ceasefire that you stick to. How does the international community help with bridging that gap?",

Democracy is another, given the string of coups that we've seen, and of course the civil war in Sudan.

And this initiative that we step up to do is to bring the private sector in to know that the partnerships to do this is a narrative for Africa that speaks to investments. Now, we have the international community that for years have supported with overseas development assistance. It's insufficient to go from billions to trillions with that alone. And so, what we need is a different financial system that opens up access to credit, that brings and showcases how business is happening in Africa with young people, with entrepreneurs, and is encouraging the international community to make that and take that to scale on energy transitions, on food systems. These are hundreds and thousands of jobs that can be created for young people and for women to look at the digital connectivity that's needed because today that's almost taken for granted in the developed countries. But in developing countries, of course, need the investments in infrastructure and therefore to make that connectivity happen. But these are climate -- is energy transitions. If we see energy transitions and they're going green, that will see that Africa that's had leased, for instance, to -- to do with it will benefit from leapfrogging in the transitions.",

In terms of the solution, obviously. There is a lot that the international community can do in terms of investing in infrastructure, but there is a lot that Africa itself can do, especially given that so much of the natural resources that are needed for that transition are sort of -- their home is in Africa. Just walk us through how much Africa can be the sort of solution to its own problems when it comes to climate change.",

The critical minerals that are in Africa can help to supply that transitions that we would have to batteries, to electric cars, to solar power. So, these are some of the things that we can offer. But for that to become a reality, they require investments. And those investments do not have a financial environment which is conducive to that. The constituency does not lean towards giving credit risk profiles to Africa to invest in those critical minerals that would bring about a green transition. The Climate Action Summit in Kenya occurred very recently and very clearly there are many solutions put on the table discussed further here at the Climate Action Summit in how we get to COP28 in the UAE with tackling first mitigation, we have got to reduce the emissions. Otherwise, as the Secretary General has obviously said, is that we're not only warming, we're boiling right now. But we've got to do the transitions and the transitions need to come with resources. We're not short of solutions. We are not short of the capacity to deliver on those solutions, but there are not the resources at the scale that we need to have in Africa today. That needs to change. That's the discussion that has come out of New York this week. It is a discussion that will go on to Marrakesh and the World Bank IMF annual meetings and hopefully land in a much better place at COP28 in Dubai.",

Spanish players are saying that they are fighting systematic discrimination, that they want change. The players would have faced fines for refusing to play for the team.

Sweden hosting Spain, at the top Group A, they're in Gothenburg, our fight! There's a banner. There was a banner ahead of kickoff there. Our fight is the global fight. There you go. And then the hashtag, Se Acobo, which is Spanish for it's all over. It's finished. Every Spanish player wearing a wristband on it with the word Se Acobo on it, as well.

The Spanish Secretary of State for Sport Victor Francos has now backed off on any fines and bans, though this is the good news for them, calling the pair's decision to leave the squad, quote, \"absolutely respectable\". So, as well as all hope, Zain, this is the start of a new world for Spain and perhaps women's football, as well. I just want to just flesh out a bit more on the stance from Leon and Patri, basically saying that, for them, their situation is, quote, \"different than for the rest of our colleagues\", as well.
