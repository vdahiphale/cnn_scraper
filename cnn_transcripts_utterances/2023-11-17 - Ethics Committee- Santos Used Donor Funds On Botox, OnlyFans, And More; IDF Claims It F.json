I'm Kasie Hunt.Those were some of embattled Congressman George Santos' constituents reacting to the House Ethics Committee's scathing report on him. It reveals that Santos repeatedly used campaign funds for personal expenses, including thousands of dollars spent on the luxury brands Hermes and Ferragamo, multiple Botox treatments, and an OnlyFans subscription. The committee voted unanimously to refer its findings to the Justice Department and now, Santos says he will not be running for reelection. After the report was released many lawmakers who had previously voted to protect Santos indicated they now support his removal from Congress. Let's bring in Mica Soellner, congressional reporter at Punchbowl News. Mica, good morning. It's always great to have you. There's a lot here. I want to show everybody a little bit of how George Santos has justified this -- just get his side of the story on the record. Let's take a look at that and then we'll talk about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY):  Were there mistakes made on those forms? I'm -- now I know they were. Was I -- were they malicious? No. Did I understand the reporting dates? So, this is from last year to current date this year? No, I didn't -- I didn't understand how that worked. And I'm a new candidate and I'm sorry that, like, mistakes were made. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But he's been also doing sit-downs with big media networks and telling his side of the story. So he's been trying to get his side out there. So it's really no surprise that he announced a press conference to defend himself as he has done.

So I think we saw a dozen or so -- perhaps more -- lawmakers say that yeah, they're ready to expel him. And I spoke with one congressman, Don Bacon of Nebraska, who expects this vote to come very quickly after the Thanksgiving break. HUNT:  Yeah, we'll see. Let's talk a second -- for a second about his district. I mean, this is a pretty swingy district in New York and it was his fellow New Yorkers who honestly were mounting part of the most aggressive push to get him out.

So it's no wonder that they were really trying to push and get him out of the way to score some political points for themselves.But Santos' seat is going to be highly contested among both parties. Republicans are going to try to keep it, which is going to be difficult after the challenges faced by Santos.

New overnight, the Israeli military says its search of the Shifa hospital complex has found the bodies of two Israeli women. The IDF says 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old Army Corporal Noa Marciano were retrieved from a structure near the hospital. The IDF did not disclose the circumstances of their deaths. A few days ago, a Hamas video claimed Marciano was killed in an Israeli airstrike. The IDF also claiming its search of the hospital complex revealed a Hamas tunnel shaft. This is IDF footage of what they say they found. CNN has not been able to independently verify the military's claims and Hamas calls them baseless lies. CNN's Scott McLean joins us live from Istanbul. Scott, good morning. Good to see you again. Let's -- pull this all together for us. I mean, what is the significance of what the IDF has discovered and what have they proved, if anything?",

The accusation is that there is a sophisticated multilevel underground command and control center underneath the Al-Shifa hospital.What they have shown so far -- what they have claimed to have shown so far is videos showing that there are weapons inside of the hospital. And others released yesterday shows that there is what appears to be a tunnel shaft about 30 meters away from the main building of the hospital. CNN, by the way, isn't in a position to be able to verify what these videos purport to actually show. And while the U.S. says that it is confident in its intelligence that there is, in fact, a Hamas control headquarters underneath of the hospital, the publicly available evidence thus far does not support that claim. It is possible that it's there. And the Israelis say that, look, it could be days, it could be weeks before we actually are able to fully prove the accusations that they have made. And the Israelis say that they have already justified -- or the evidence that they found has already justified their decision to go in, but there's plenty of critics from the international community who would disagree with that. And that is why Israel is under so much pressure internationally to actually prove these allegations, especially in this region in the Middle East. You have the Turkish President Recep Erdogan saying just recently that Israel, in his mind, is a terrorist state. You have the Jordanian foreign minister saying that this conflict has set the region on fire in his words. He also described the backward progress -- the progress that's been made over the last few years in strengthening ties with Middle Eastern countries and Israel, and now they've just simply gone up in smoke. He said that, at least in his country, there is no -- people just don't see value in actually doing business or trying to strengthen ties with Israel right now.",

The special counsel overseeing the federal criminal investigation into Hunter Biden is using a California grand jury to try to obtain more documents and issuing subpoenas to several people, including James Biden, the president's brother, who was once a business associate of Hunter's. The probe is focused on Hunter Biden's alleged failure to pay taxes. But his legal team says he's fully paid his debts. Joining me now is Katie Cherkasky. She's a criminal defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor. Katie, good morning. It's always great to see you. The use of a grand jury indicates that the special counsel David Weiss might be preparing new charges against Hunter Biden. What do you make of this latest twist? KATIE CHERKASKY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR (via Skype):  Well, the news that there is this grand jury in California indicates that there is certainly a possibility Hunter Biden will be charged in that district. After his plea deal fell apart, essentially what happened is that the charges that were at issue in the deal were on the table but also, potentially, other charges. So we don't really know the extent of the exposure that Hunter Biden has at this point. The other thing that we need to keep in mind is that he still has the possibility of entering into some sort of plea deal. So we don't know for sure what the outcome will be here but as of right now, the investigation remains open and the charges look like they could be coming in another district.",

But it really is the case that you have to make those decisions about where strategically you see things going because -- especially when you have potential plea deals that could be on the table you really want to put the pressure on the government to show them that this is not going to be an easy kill. That there's not going to be some sort of guaranteed conviction of some sort to put yourself in a better negotiating position.

And we're also seeing some consolidation on donors, too, especially after Tim Scott dropped out of the race and some of these big-money people like Spencer Zwick have gotten behind her. Honestly, one of the more interesting things is that Chris Christie is there right behind here, running in New Hampshire. What do you make of these numbers? STRAUSS:  I mean, it depends on the candidate here. For Christie, let's remember that the last time he ran for president there was a strong focus of that campaign on New Hampshire. But he, in the end, fell woefully behind -- not just Donald Trump, not just Ted Cruz, but also John Kasich. At the same time, though, let's move over to Nikki Haley here. Haley has really, from the beginning, taken a slow and steady approach to this race. She has not come in with a huge amount of fanfare compared to her rivals. She did not spend a huge amount of money. She did not come with the biggest war chest, and that has been to her benefit. She has run a lean and mean operation. She's benefitted probably the most from all of her debate performances where she's really shown sort of a fighting spirit. And this is what the result is. Republican voters want to see some kind of candidates who have that fighting spirit in them, and I think that's what we're seeing in this polling. She's focused on New Hampshire, too -- a state where there is a strong Independent streak and a strong curiosity for alternatives to frontrunners, and Haley is fitting that bill right now.",

From the beginning of this cycle, Christie has run notably an outspoken race as an anti-Trumper -- someone who is willing to take Trump head-on. So the Republican support he's has in New Hampshire is going to be highly skeptical of Trump or any Trumpian candidate.So if he were to drop out it would likely go to someone like Haley who has shown more of a resistance to Trumpism than Ron DeSantis. I'm still skeptical at the end of the day that any consolidation of support is going to be enough to, like, dramatically surpass Trump simply because Trump has been this dominating force in almost every poll within this Republican Party for years now.
