Moscow has avoided an armed insurrection from its own mercenaries for now but faces a world keenly aware of major weaknesses that are now exposed. Today there is no word on where Yevgeny Prigozhin is the head of the ruthless mercenaries, the Wagner Group, abruptly turned around his troops when they were within just 125 miles of the capital. Russia said Prigozhin would not be prosecuted and instead would be exiled. Prigozhin's news service, as they're calling it, tells CNN that he will answer questions when he has, quote, \"proper communication.\" You might remember these stunning scenes last night as mercenaries were greeted as heroes in some towns for confronting the government they feel has abandoned them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY, RESIDENT OF ROSTOV REGION (through translator): There are very serious problems in the country and they need to be solved. People who can no longer tolerate it, they resort to such radical methods as Prigozhin. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He walks us through a whirlwind chain of events that have exposed shocking weaknesses in the Putin regime. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): A weekend of chaos and drama in Russia. Mercenaries declared a mutiny and then called it off in under 24 hours. Yevgeny Prigozhin issued a call for rebellion. The head of the Wagner mercenary group accusing top Russian military commanders of gross mismanagement of the war in Ukraine. Then Prigozhin released video of an alleged Russian airstrike on a Wagner camp in Ukraine demanding revenge. Russia's Defense Ministry denied the attack. And soon Russia's top prosecutor announced criminal charges against Prigozhin. Then in the early hours of Saturday, Prigozhin followed through on his threats, sending his fighters across the border from Ukraine back into Russia. Footage surfaced at dawn showing Wagner fighters surrounding the military headquarters in the southern Russian city of Rostov. Some locals stood nearby watching. At around 7:30 a.m., Prigozhin was then shown dressing down senior Russian military leaders and issuing demands. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER GROUP CHIEF (through translator): Again, we came here. We want to receive the chief of General Staff and Shoigu. Until they show up, until they show up, we are located here, blockading the city of Rostov and we'll go to Moscow.",

The Kremlin says it's dropped charges and Prigozhin will go to Belarus while promising his fighters contracts with the Russian military. For now, a crisis apparently averted.

We learned just moments ago that he also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today. Trudeau tweeted that they talked about the, quote, \"evolving security situation in Russia.\" Yesterday the president spoke with other top allies including the leaders of Germany, France and the United Kingdom. And one thing that was stressed in that call is trying to ensure that the leaders keep the temperature low, that they don't try to make any statements that would suggest or give any credence to any claims that the U.S. is trying to be involved in this matter. The White House has really taken a very quiet strategy after the rebellion that was waged by the mercenary Wagner Group over the course of the past 48 hours. That a rebellion did seem to be quelled a bit in the past day but we did start to get the first reaction from the administration to the situation earlier today from Secretary of State Antony Blinken who called the situation extraordinary and said that it has shown that there are some cracks in Vladimir Putin's hold on power in Russia.

That there was an expectation among the intelligence community that something like this could take place and the fact that something like this was imminent, to the point where intelligence officials we're told briefed the so-called Gang of Eight, the leaders in Congress, both parties and both chambers, and also the leaders of the both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. And actually, we heard from the head of the House Intelligence Committee Mike Turner earlier today who said that something like this was expected. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): The intelligence community was very much aware of it. The conflict between Prigozhin and Putin was inevitable. This is not a weekend trip he's taking. Taking his convoy and his military convoy up to Moscow. There's a number of accomplices included as we saw some of the Russian people on the border with Ukraine who clearly support the Wagner Group, in contrast to their support for the Russian government.

Prigozhin, as you pointed out, is not the kind of person to give up fairly quickly, so there must have been a deal, the dimensions of which we don't understand.We assume, but only assume that it may include the resignations at some point soon of the Defense Secretary Shoigu, who Prigozhin hates, and Shoigu returns the favor. We assume that there are some other elements to that deal. But we're not certain what they are.

Are they going to feel like they want to follow in Prigozhin's footsteps? How do the elites feel?Maybe that's something that's important but I think -- I'm going to say I think in terms of the military elite, I think it's actually unlikely that he gets rid of Shoigu and Gerasimov because that would be really completely capitulating to Prigozhin, and I don't think he wants to do that. I think he picked his battle and picked the military. So I think he had that a little bit in the box. But geopolitically, you know, these things are going to reverberate for some time. Wagner, we think about in terms of Ukraine, but we should not forget that Wagner is actually the most powerful instrument that Putin has in projecting power and influence in the Middle East and Africa, and he uses it incredibly. He doesn't want to lose that. But yet, with the loss of stature and maybe with the loss of Prigozhin now, all of that is up in the air.

We've reported as has CNN, but we've reported in \"The Times,\" that as early as Wednesday, maybe before, they had a pretty good sense of what was going to go on. It's interesting that the administration chose not in any way to getinvolved. For a couple of reasons. First, they didn't want to be seen backing Prigozhin, I mean, he's sanctioned by the United States. They certainly didn't want to be helping Putin, so this was a fight between two pretty unsavory characters. But second, if you listen carefully to President Biden over the past year, he always wants to make sure that Putin has an offramp because a desperate Putin, a Putin who is fearful that he would lose power, is also one much more likely to trigger his nuclear arsenal.",

Sam, this is a combat ready private army that's been instrumental to Russia's military objectives for nearly a decade especially in Ukraine in recent months as we know. Now Moscow wants these mercenaries to join its army? That sounds a little far-fetched but how likely is that to happen?",

They don't really have much choice, Jim. I think that the Wagner Group was able to reject that idea before they turned their guns against their own people -- their own military but now that they've attempted to sort of storm Moscow, they captured a military base in Rostov-on-Don, have been accused of potentially downing to aircraft recent. Social media showing that they may have shut down two aircrafts.This is very serious stuff. The Kremlin or Vladimir Putin accused them of treason. They've done a deal now that allows Prigozhin to get out of the country and the guys to get back to their camps. I think they'd be very wise to sign up for the military.",

But he might be considering that very unwise location to go to that doesn't put him beyond the reach at all of Russia's secret services.He could easily suffer, you know, an unpleasant encounter with the Novichok nerve agent or similar. He might be much safer to try to go to some of the African locations that Wagner has very strong links with, and Libya, Central African Republic and similar. That may indeed be why we haven't heard from him for a while. I think he's got to go and find somewhere safe to start talking from, if indeed he does do that. ACOSTA: Yes. Belarus does not sound like the safest destination for Prigozhin at this point. And I wanted to ask you about this, Sam. Many of the images that we've seen of this insurrection have come from the platform, Telegram. Prigozhin has embraced this social media tool to share Wagner's exploits in Bakhmut. It's to mock Russia's military leaders. He was putting out these messages yesterday about, you know, we are going to call this off, I don't want to have any bloodshed and so on. Do you think he's going to keep this up?",

But I think, ultimately, he has done some very serious damage on that platform by launching attacks not just against the military establishment which have become almost routine from him, Jim, but when he said that the premises laid out by Vladimir Putin for the whole Russian campaign in Ukraine, in particular the threat as they perceived it in the Kremlin, that Ukraine would park NATO missiles on Russia's border, and so on, and that these were fallacious. In other words the central motivation for the invasion of in Ukraine, he said, was false. I think that's very, very damaging. He might want to keep a low profile after saying that.",

But there has been really little substantive change. There's been a lot of discussion about changing the energy market and there's been some legislation passed, but essentially for the last 20 years, the state of Texas has seen its capacity really dwindle. And there's really no capacity market here that would guard against extreme demand.So we've seen in successive days over the last few weeks that the energy demand has hit record levels. The state's energy grid and of course San Antonio is part of that. We have our own energy utility here, and we're in good shape if it's just local. But, you know, the energy grid is such that if there are other challenges in the state, we've got to make sure that we provide some onto the grid itself. So there's some challenges and there have been advisories already issued by ERCOT. Please encourage people to reduce energy use as much as possible. So, you know, we are still living through the results of lack of regulation and the things that we dealt with in the winter storm.",
