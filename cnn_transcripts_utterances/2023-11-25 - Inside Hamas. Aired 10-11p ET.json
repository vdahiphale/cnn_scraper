      "sentences": "Welcome to \"The Whole Story.\" I'm Anderson Cooper in Tel Aviv. The October 7th attack by Hamas which the U.S. labels a terrorist organization left at least 1,400 people dead. More than 200 people are being held hostage according to Israeli officials, and many more people are still unaccounted for.In response, Israel began a bombing campaign in Gaza. According to the Hamas controlled health ministry, more than 4,000 people have died there so far. The story of Hamas is complex. Its roots date back to the formation of Israel in 1948. It has many factions, including the so-called military wing which perpetrated the terror attack. Over the next hour, CNN's Sara Sidner brings us the whole story on Hamas from how they were formed, what their ideology is, and how they have evolved over the decades. We want to warn you some of the images you'll see in this hour may be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
