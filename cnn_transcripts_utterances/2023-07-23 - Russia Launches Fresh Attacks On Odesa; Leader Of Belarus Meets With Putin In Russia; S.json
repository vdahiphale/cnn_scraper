      "sentences": "Good morning, Victor and Amara. Special Counsel Jack Smith has contacted Georgia Governor Brian Kemp as part of his long running investigation into the 2020 election aftermath. Our colleague Kaitlan Collins confirmed that Smith's team was in touch with Kemp this past week.Now, Kemp's office really is not saying much and the timing of a possible FBI interview or grand jury appearance for the governor is unclear. But Kemp make no mistake, he is a key figure in this investigation. That's because in 2020, Donald Trump both privately and publicly pressured Kemp to overturn the election in Georgia. Trump wanted Kemp to interfere with the vote counting blocked certification of the results, and convene a special session of the legislature so that he could appoint fake Trump electors. Now going beyond Kemp, the Special Counsel is also still in the process of scheduling interviews with additional witnesses. This list of possible additional interviews includes a former Trump lawyer and a longtime ally of Rudy Giuliani. All this comes as possible indictments in the case are looming. Jack Smith sent a target letter to Trump last weekend signaling that Trump might be charged with crimes for trying to overturn the election. The grand jury that sits here in Washington, D.C. is expected to meet in the coming days. Then guys, there is also Mar-a-Lago case where Trump is already facing 37 felony charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and obstructing that investigation. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and he pleaded not guilty. Now, on Friday, a federal judge in Florida set a new trial date for May, 2024. That is pretty late in the GOP primary schedule. By then, Trump might already be the presumptive nominee. Special Counsel Jack Smith wanted that trial to take place this December, presumably with a verdict coming before the Iowa caucuses, but that's not going to happen. The trial is now set for May. Though, of course further delays are always possible and Trump's team is optimistic that with just one or two additional delays, they might be able to get that case postponed all the way past the 2024 general election.

Thanks so much, Chad.Well, as a heat wave stretches into another week, calls are going to make sure low-income families have the resources they need to deal with these record shuttering temperatures. One solution, providing air conditioning equipment and insulation for families who can't afford it. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association is leading the initiative to get congressional funding to retrofit homes for cooling. Mark Wolfe is at the front of that fight, and he is joining us now this morning. Good morning to you, Mark. Thank you so much for your time. How is the process to get this funding for retrofitting going? MARK WOLFE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ENERGY ASSISTANCE DIRECTORS' ASSOCIATION: Well, it's challenging, you know. We're expecting it to be this hot this summer. You know, when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, provided additional $4 billion for families to retrofit their homes, which at the time seemed like, you know, a good step and direction of helping families do this. And that's enough money to help about 400,000 families. It sounds like a lot, except that. They're close to 30 million low-income families in the United States. So, what it really shows is that temperatures are increasing faster. And the programs are increasing, and since all sites point to, you know, this year being, you know, the hottest in the last 10 years and not getting any cool in the future, what it really shows is that we need a national plan and a strategy to help retrofit the low-income housing stock. So low-income families can be safe as these temperatures keep increasing. [07:25:00]",

It's especially important for people who are in frail health conditions.They're much more vulnerable to high temperatures and so it's important to have a national strategy. And I think to put that in place now, because I think we thought we had more time. You know, when this went -- I'm sorry when this summer started, NOAA, the National Weather Service thought that temperatures would be about as high as last year. Now, they're much higher. It's not only that, but the cost of home cooling is going up rapidly. So, a few years ago, it cost about $400 on average to cool your home in the summer. Now, we could have 600 this summer. So --",

So once people get air conditioners installed, how do you make sure that they can actually afford to turn it on?Well, there are really two things that have to happen. One is the equipment and -- excuse me, and second funding, I'll pay for it. You know, we found the last few years when states provide families with air conditioning equipment that sometimes they're afraid to turn it on because they're afraid of the bill and that's perfectly legitimate because the cost of home cooling is going up. So we need two things. One, tell families retrofit their homes essentially add insulation, overhead fans and air conditioning, but also to help them pay for it. And that's really important. So we're also asking Congress for an additional $3 billion this year. Tell about $6 million families pay the cost of cooling. You know, Congress gave us an extra $2 billion this year. It sounds like a lot of money and it is and we thought that would be fine. And so, I think what we're seeing as well as the rest of the country is that temperatures are rising faster and quicker than we expected and they were being caught short. We need to protect lower-income families because keep in mind that half of all elderly families on social security, only have social security income. They have no other source of income to work with.

Tupac Amaru Shakur, a young man with big bright eyes and a poetic sensibility who spit out lyrics that detailed life as he knew it, unvarnished. He revealed the beauty and pain of his life and those around him. The theme stretched from violence in the streets, to black liberation, to the love between a mother and son.",

He was a young black man who unchained himself from the extreme poverty he grew up in in Baltimore and California. His school friends say his nose was always in a book, always learning, but it was his music and acting that set the world alight. AFENI SHAKUR, TUPAC SHAKUR'S MOTHER: Tupac was extremely passionate, very honest, and raw in his approach to communicating. SIDNER (voiceover): He became a world-famous icon of an emerging genre of music, hip-hop, only to be gunned down at just 25 years old near a Las Vegas street corner. Retired Las Vegas Police Lieutenant Chris Carroll was first on the scene that September day in 1996.",

But a new program run by the U.S. embassy in Havana is attempting to fill in some of those gaps. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OPPMANN (voiceover): A business seminar in a hotel meeting room may not seem that groundbreaking. But not long ago in Cuba where all capitalism used to be outlawed. It would have been impossible to imagine. All the more so since the man teaching this business boot camp organized by the U.S. embassy in Havana is Cuban American development expert Gustavo Arnavat, who left the island as a young boy to flee Fidel Castro's revolution. He's been invited by the U.S. government to share his knowledge with Cuba's trailblazing entrepreneurs.",

Every entrepreneur is going to have to good days and bad days, and some days are going to be extremely challenging to point where, you know, give up. Again, no different than any other country, but here is particularly difficult.OPPMANN (voiceover): Particularly difficult because for decades following the 1959 revolution, all private enterprise was banned in Cuba. Cubans were required to work for the state. Then following the collapse of the Soviet Union, official prohibitions on self-employment slowly began to ease. OPPMANN: The first entrepreneurs in a generation here faced a unique problem. There are no business schools, scarce knowledge that can be passed down about self-employment. Cuba's budding capitalists have but to learn by doing. OPPMANN (voiceover): Juan Carlos Blain (ph) has turned a side business selling hamburgers into a restaurant franchise, a small supermarket, and logistics company. Altogether he says, he employees more than 60 people. Attending the business boot camp, he says, helped him to identify areas of future growth. We've done courses on e-commerce, marketing, risk capital, private financing, he says. There are very current things, very modern, and things that we can use a lot. Even though the U.S. government says it wants to help Cuban entrepreneurs, U.S. economic sanctions intended to impact the Cuban government also hurt business people here. Making it all but impossible for them to access the U.S. banking system or receive financing. The U.S.'s top diplomat in Havana says, the Biden administration is studying if sanctions can be eased for Cuban entrepreneurs. BENJAMIN ZIFF, CHARGE D AFFAIRES, U.S. EMBASSY IN HAVANA, CUBA: There's a shortage of food, there's a shortage gas, there's a shortage of water. The Cuban state economy is no longer able to provide for its people. And the answer to that is not a necessary evil private sector, it is more better, more empowered private sector. OPPMANN (voiceover): So far, the U.S. embassy in Havana says about 200 entrepreneurs have taken this boot camp. And the hope is that they could move beyond the decades of hostility between the U.S. and Cuba. To not only transform their lives, but their country. (END VIDEO CLIP) OPPMANN (on camera): Over the last two years, the Cuban government has authorized about 8,000 new small and medium businesses here. Experts say though, that's not nearly enough to jump start Cuba's flagging economy. A lot of the Cuban entrepreneurs I've gotten to know say that they see that how when Cubans leave this island, they're able to have great success starting businesses abroad. And all they want is the same ability to thrive in their own country. Amara, Victor.",
