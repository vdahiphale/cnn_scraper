The Peach State has now become ground zero for the abortion rights fight after ProPublica's disturbing report on two Georgia women, Amber Thurman, who is seen on the left here, and Candi Miller. They died in 2022 because of a lack of care most likely tied to the state's abortion ban. Georgia outlaws the procedure as early as six weeks of pregnancy.

But the reason that this came together was for - what you described - was that ProPublica reporting about the mothers who died, One of whom from a treatable infection, who didn't receive medical care in time. And that stemmed, according to this reporting, from the state's abortion restriction.So this was the report that brought the Vice President here. I'm told by sources that she directed her team to add this stop to her schedule this week to talk about reproductive rights. This is a detour, of course, before she heads to Wisconsin later this evening. Of course, this is the campaign keeping the issue of reproductive rights front and center, looking for these moments to elevate and amplify these issues. And we can already get an indication of what the Vice President is going to say. If you look at the signs behind me, it says one in three women lives under a Trump abortion ban. That was a phrase the Vice President actually coined earlier this year in Arizona, when she did a similar sort of rapid response trip to that state over its abortion restrictions. So you can expect an impassioned response here. I will also note that the OBGYN or a OBGYN is going to be introducing the Vice President, but as of now, it has been a quite somber tone. And we anticipate that going into the next few minutes when the Vice President is set to speak.",

In Amber Thurman's case, you know, the - we don't know what was in the doctor's heads. They've had plenty of opportunity to say, they waited 20 hours to perform the one simple procedure that could have saved her life called a D&amp;C and that it's unclear under Georgia law whether it's legal to perform that in that case.

She already had an abortion. She had leftover pregnancy tissue and was bleeding out and obviously infected at that point.I know what it's like to be on a medical table bleeding out. I've been in this position not as a result of an abortion, but as a result of a miscarriage. And I, too, was delayed in receiving that care. And it was actually before Roe v. Wade was overturned or there was any of these confusions. This happened to me, obviously, again, a miscarriage, not abortion. But I know what it's like. And I can't imagine if my family didn't have me with them today. And so I sympathize with her family. But the reality is that the law in Georgia allowed those doctors to give her the care that she deserved. And I don't understand why they did not do that. I think it's unacceptable.
