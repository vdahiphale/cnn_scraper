      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\". I'm Bianca Nobilo in for Max Foster today. Just ahead, wildfires in Maui have killed nearly 100 people and the death toll is expected to rise. Meantime state officials have launched an investigation amid growing questions about the emergency response.Then the latest on Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a new wave of Russian missile attacks on Ukraine's port City of Odessa leaves three people wounded. And China calls Taiwan's vice President a \"Troublemaker\" shortly after he made a stopover in New York. We began on the Hawaii Island of Maui where the death toll continues to rise after those catastrophic wildfires. 96 people have been killed with only 3 percent of the disaster area searched so far. Hawaii's Governor said more search and rescue crews and cadaver dogs are on the way. Authorities are asking family members of the missing to provide DNA to help identify those who have died. Meanwhile, the fire that devastated the historic town of Lahaina is now the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century, with loss estimates nearing $6 billion dollars. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUSAN SLOBODNJAK, MAUI RESIDENT FOR 31 YEARS: When I drove through on Friday, I had no clue what I was going through. I got so everything's gone. I lost friends in there, you know, they were going back to get their animals, you know when she died. So I mean, you know, it's really sad because people come over here, you know, I heard there was a snorkeling boat looking at behind a town. Give them respect, you know, it's so bad. This isn't you know, people died here. You know, people, I mean, it's not just a vacation. It's not just a place for vacation. We live here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We'll have more on this in a live report from Maui coming up in just a few moments. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry is strongly condemning what it calls Russia's provocative actions in the Black Sea.The Russian Defense Ministry says one of its warships fired warning shots at a dry cargo ship on Sunday that it claims was headed to Ukraine. Russian soldiers then boarded the vessel. Hours later, Kyiv says Moscow launched waves of missiles and drone attacks on the Southern Port City of Odessa. CNN's Nic Robertson joins me now. Nic, fascinating, the earlier you were telling me that these two events might be linked.",

At that moment, Russia really focused some drone strikes on the port of Odessa, and also on ports on the Danube as well where the grain can go. So when you see a ship that sailing towards the Danube to pick up grain or other goods from Ukraine that's boarded by Russian troops that who've fired warning shots from a ship and a helicopter and the captain is questioned on border ship. That does tend to point towards Russia's ongoing concerns about what's happening in the Black Sea. And again when Odessa is hit three waves of attacks last night, 15 drones eight different missiles. Again, that shows Russia is focusing on concentrating on a desert, we can only guess that it's hopping back to the Black Sea Grain Deal and more favorable terms for Russia.",

China is condemning the transit of Taiwan's Vice President through the United States calling William Lai quote a troublemaker through and through.

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, this is certainly the reaction that everybody was expecting when you have Taiwan's Vice President, as you say, as well, the leading presidential candidate transiting through the United States, Beijing will respond. So I think there would have been great surprise if they hadn't. Now whether this changes anything in the grand scheme of the relationship, the relationship is very strained at this point. So it's uncertain if this is going to make anything significantly worse. As we have seen William Lai do this in the past in January of last year, he transited through the United States.We had President Tsai Ing-wen also, earlier a transiting through the United States and meeting high ranking U.S. Officials while she was there, for example, Kevin McCarthy, the House Speaker, so this is an expected response. But it's certainly something that as you heard there from William Lai that Taiwan is not going to back away from that they will continue to do this. Now we do have a statement from the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, saying that there should not be any kind of official interaction with the U.S. and Taiwan also saying, \"Lai Ching-te clings stubbornly to the separatist position for Taiwan independence. He is a troublemaker through and through\". So that is certainly an expected response. We have heard from U.S. Senior Administration Officials saying that these kinds of visits by senior officials are unofficial and they are also in keeping with the One China policy but that's simply something that Beijing does not accept. Beijing does believe that Taiwan is part of its territory, even though it has never had any kind of control over Taiwan. It is a self- governing democratic Island. But as far as Beijing is concerned, these kinds of transit visits should not be happening, and anytime they do happen in the future, which they will likely continue to. There will be a strong response from Beijing, Bianca.",

So this, the Prime Minister of Niger said he was comforted that they actually came and they were there with the backing of Nigeria's President, Bola Tinubu. So there really is a prospect of peaceful resolution in this. But at the same time, hours after this meeting, President Bazoum was charged with high treason, and it sends some sort of mixed signal in what has previously been a standoff. ECOWAS has threatened military action. And we're waiting to see what the next steps will be from them, but some kind of hopeful picture but at the same time, tough action from the military junta, in charging the President Bazoum for high treason, Bianca.",

In the U.S. state of Georgia prosecutors looking into his efforts to overturn his 2020 election last there reportedly have evidence connecting members of his legal team to a voting system breach in the state in January 2021. It was allegedly part of an effort by Trump's allies to prove the 2020 vote had been rigged. This comes as sources tell CNN that the Fulton County District Attorney will pursue more than a dozen indictments when she presents her case to a grand jury this week.She has been investigating efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to pressure election officials and put forward fake electors in Georgia after his 2020 loss. Keep in mind that these are state charges separate from the federal indictments brought by the Special Counsel and state charges brought in New York. So could Mr. Trump see his fourth indictment this week? CNN's Sara Murray joins us now from outside the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta with the details. Sounds pretty loud there, I think unless that's an audio issue. Sarah, what are we expecting today?",

As early as today, you know, this is really the next step in what has been a 2.5 year criminal investigation where she's expected to see charges against more than a dozen individuals. Just one of the ways that this case is going to look and feel different from the federal cases we've seen. You know, we've seen the Former President charged federally related to election interference and what happened on January 6, but we saw a lot of unnamed co- conspirators who also did not face charges. That is not likely to be the case here in Georgia. The District Attorney has been investigating not only that call that Donald Trump made to the Secretary of State here pressuring him to find the votes needed to overturn the election but also the fake electoral scheme. Also this voting systems breach in rural Coffee County, Georgia that we reported over the weekend, investigators believe was more of a top down effort that Trump's team was coordinating, rather than something that sort of sprung up organically from Trump's backers here in the state of Georgia. So there's a lot of evidence she potentially has to present before this grand jury. Her presentation could take up to two days. And we've heard from some witnesses who were told essentially to be on standby and prepared to testify before the grand jury tomorrow, but we will be on high alert for any indictment announcements today, as well as Tuesday.",

MURRAYAnd it became clear that pro Trump operatives in this county it's very rural, it's very Republican, had gained access to these voting systems here. And what we are learning in our new reporting is that this was not something that was just coordinated by operatives here on the ground in Georgia. That they were in touch with various members, attorneys, who were working with Donald Trump as he put forward his post-election challenges just to try to stay in power and that a number of them were also working for a Former Trump Attorney Rudy Giuliani and Giuliani's search to find election fraud. Now, Giuliani's attorney insists to me that he has nothing to do with the breach in Coffee County. But we know that Giuliani is one of the targets of this investigation and it's possible he could end up facing charges.",
