The Kremlin says no one was hurt and is accusing Ukraine of a terrorist attack. It's the third time in the past month that drone debris has hit the area.Meantime, the U.S. has committed to approving F-16 fighter jets for Ukraine as soon as training is complete. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from London. Nada, we talked about this yesterday -- it was a little bit in limbo -- but Ukraine believes those jets still won't arrive until next year.

      "sentences": "Well look, Danny, the supply of these F- 16s really depends on the training of Ukrainian pilots. That is the sticking point here. These are advanced U.S.-made fighter jets, and it could essentially take months for Ukrainian air force pilots to be fully trained to operate them.We heard yesterday from a spokesperson from the Ukrainian air force saying that they certainly wouldn't be able to operate them before the end of this year. And that is a significant blow to Ukraine's military and air defense aspirations, particularly as the counteroffensive continues to grind now. Now, of course, as you mentioned, we've heard from U.S. officials saying that the Biden administration is prepared to approve the transfer of these jets to Ukraine as soon as that training is complete. We've heard from a U.S. official familiar with this matter saying that. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been in contact with counterparts in both Denmark and the Netherlands to assure them of this commitment. But, of course, the U.S.'s European partners have been taking the lead on that training program. It was anticipated that training could begin this month. Right now, it's unclear when it will begin or how long it will actually take. We've heard, of course, from other European partners they are focused on developing this training program. Ukraine's air force says they are hopeful that this can begin in the near future. In the meantime, the U.S. government is said to be in talks with other European partners who do have a supply of the U.S.-made F-16s to see who else might be prepared to supply these jets to Ukraine when they are ready.",

      "sentences": "Just unimaginable.All right, let's switch gears now to politics. The first Republican presidential debate isn't until next week but there is already news from it. The New York Times reported that a super PAC behind Ron DeSantis' campaign posted a number of documents, including a debate memo with strategies, like going after Vivek Ramaswamy and defending Donald Trump. Well, DeSantis' campaign is denying any knowledge of this, writing in a statement, quote, \"This was not a campaign memo, and we were not aware of it prior to the article.\" For much more on this let's bring in Akayla Gardner, White House correspondent for Bloomberg News. All right, Akayla, listen -- DeSantis' team is denying having anything to do with this memo -- fine. Regardless of that, though, do you think his team has to maybe rethink their debate strategy? AKAYLA GARDNER, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, BLOOMBERG NEWS (via Webex by Cisco):  I think the release of this memo certainly puts them at a disadvantage, especially if they are planning to use it and draw from it. I mean, this memo is pretty wide-ranging. It talks about Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, Tim Scott, Chris Christie -- all these folks that he's expecting to face next Wednesday. But I think something that's interesting here that's underlying is the campaign has seemed to rely more on the super PAC in recent weeks, especially because they're going through a cash crunch. There's been some instability in the campaign. We know that DeSantis has gone through multiple campaign managers in recent weeks. And so it could be signaling, again, this reliance on this PAC. We know DeSantis was on a bus tour that was funded by the PAC recently. But I think the bigger problem here is DeSantis is already at a disadvantage in the debates. Anyone who has followed him knows that debate skills are not necessarily his strength. But at the same time, we know that he's preparing at least once a week. He's hired a veteran coach, Brett O'Donnell, who has worked with Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush -- all folks who have clenched this nomination. But he's also going into this debate, frankly, with nothing to lose and everything to gain. He's 40 points behind Trump. He's fallen significantly in recent weeks. And frankly, this is about shoring up his political career. He needs to have some sort of breakout moment or at least hold his ground for this to be a success for him.",

He's calling DeSantis robotic, seemingly hitting on some of his issues with connection to voters. And he's called some of the attacks boring and canned. But I think specifically about this memo that's interesting about their attacks on Ramaswamy is they plan to bring up, basically, some of the things that he's touting as an asset. His time as an outsider. His time as a business owner. Specifically, his decision to start a firm with a Chinese state-owned company. And also, some of his ties to the Democratic financier George Soros, who we know has been the subject of a longtime criticism for Republicans. So he certainly should expect those attacks if not from DeSantis from other folks.",
