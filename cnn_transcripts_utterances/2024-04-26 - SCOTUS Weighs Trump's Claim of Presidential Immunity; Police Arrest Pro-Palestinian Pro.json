And they were afraid. Now it seems to be the conservative Supreme Court's turn. The arguments yesterday suggest they, too, are going to kick the can down the road, instead of quickly deciding one way or the other whether voters will have a chance to consider a convicted or exonerated Trump before they all have to vote in the 2024 election. Arguments yesterday suggest that their split decision will just delay the trial, most likely well past November 5, 2024. Trump's lawyers now arguing the failure of those Senate Republicans to convict is exactly what lets Trump off the hook from criminal prosecution now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMY CONEY BARRETT, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, U.S. SUPREME COURT: So Mr. Sauer, you've argued that the Impeachment Clause suggests or requires impeachment to be a gateway to criminal prosecution, right? D. JOHN SAUER, ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP: Yes. I think that's the plain meaning of that second phrase in the clause. Keep in mind that the criminal prosecution of a president -- president prior to impeachment contradicts -- you can argue with the plain language of the Constitution -- but also hundreds of years of history.

And this is where Donald Trump and his experience in courts and courtrooms and in legal issues, they figured out how to have a delay tactic to get them past the point where he can be held accountable.
