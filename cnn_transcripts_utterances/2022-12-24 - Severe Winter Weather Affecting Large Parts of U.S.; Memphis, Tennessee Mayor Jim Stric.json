Thank you so much for joining me on this Christmas Eve.We begin this hour with winter weather wreaking havoc this holiday weekend. Many in the United States are facing their coldest Christmas in decades. Right now, more than 175 million people are under windchill alerts. The arctic blast extending from Montana all the way down to, get this, yes, Florida. Some temperatures in the Midwest dipping into the negative 30s. Even Atlanta is seeing negative windchills. The bitter cold proving extremely dangerous. At least 15 people have lost their lives across the country so far. In Tennessee, people are seeing intermittent power disruptions as the bone-chilling weather pushes the state's power grid to the absolute max. More than 840,000 customers are now without power nationwide. Whiteout continues make it too perilous to travel. New York officials are issuing a driving ban for several counties amid blizzard conditions there. And if you are trying to fly this weekend, I've got to give you some good luck and a prayer, because more than 1,700 flights have already been canceled today, on top of the more than 5,900 flights canceled yesterday. Treacherous driving conditions in Tennessee, icy roads causing several cars to spin out in Memphis. We saw this live yesterday morning. That's a four-wheel drive that cannot get up that hill. Officials are warning drivers, if you can avoid going out, do. The state's transportation department has been salting the roads over the last few days, but still warn to go as slowly as possible if you do have to get out there. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Valley Authority is directing local power companies to interrupt service in 15 minute intervals to conserve electricity there. Joining us now on the phone, the mayor of Memphis, Tennessee, Jim Strickland. Mayor, welcome to the program.",

But look, in all seriousness, authorities here on the ground are very much worried about these conditions that are not letting up, Sara. I'll let you -- you can even listen to the howling winds over my voice here as this is a look in downtown Buffalo.What we heard today from authorities is that at this point, Buffalo and many of the surrounding communities do not have any emergency services. We're talking fire, police, ambulance services. And that's because roughly two-thirds, according to county officials, of the emergency vehicles are actually stuck. And so what they are doing is they're taking advantage of a slight, and I mean ever so slight improvement in weather conditions, not to mention the daylight, to actually have public works vehicles go out and clear some of these streets. But this, authorities are stressing, is not for people to go to grandma's house. This is to open a pathway for emergency services to respond because they are not saying that they are not going to try to get to people suffering a medical condition, for example, but there are no guarantees that they will actually make it there. County officials confirming that two people died recently in the area due to medical complications because authorities, medical officials could not make it to them. And so that just speaks to the tremendous situation that's happening here in Buffalo, what is being described as ground zero of a massive winter storm affecting millions on this Christmas weekend, Sara.",

Folks have been showing up the entire day out here, making sure they've got their bags ticketed, they drop them off, and they go on to their flights.However, everyone is keeping a pretty close eye on the departure board, and that's because out of the airport here well over 100 flights have been canceled. The number, it's not a whole lot better when we're talking about the rest of the country. The latest numbers that we have right now across the U.S., we are looking at well over 1,700 flights that have been canceled and well over 2,000 other flights that have been delayed across the U.S. because of this cold weather. Next to us just behind me, though, are a group of people that aren't quite happy with the airline because they are not going to be able to get out anytime soon. The folks here, all of these people standing in line have been told they are going to have to figure out another way home if they want to make it in time for the holidays. These folks here are all being rebooked on other flights. Everyone, however, is still hopeful that they are going to be able to make it home in time for the Christmas holiday.

And just as Polo talked about, it's making travel dangerous. So, again, if you do not have to be out, please don't be. Buffalo sustained, that means constant winds of 33 miles per hour, gusting up to 47. Detroit 28 sustained miles per hour, gusting to 39. Even St. Louis sustained winds of 30 miles per hour right now. We do still have some snow anticipated for today, but it's going to be focused across the Great Lakes region. Michigan, areas of upstate New York. This is a live look at Watertown, New York. Again, there's the plows. They are out. They're doing everything they can. But it's still coming down, and it's coming down so fast, they are just constantly having to do runs. Most of these areas will likely pick up two to six inches of additional rain, but some spots could pick up as much as a foot. We talked about the good news here. Take a look, Denver, Dallas, and New Orleans all finally going to get their temperatures back above the freezing mark for today. Other places like Atlanta, New York, D.C., it's likely going to be next week before we really start to see the temperatures go up.

Denys went ahead, but he convinced Ievgeniia to first evacuate his family from Kyiv, which was then under heavy Russian bombardment. Ievgeniia did that.

Players have all sorts of tricks to stay warm, like wearing rubber medical exam gloves under their football gloves to keep the heat in. There is a thick, pasty cream that you rub on your arms, your nose, and your ears to cut the wind. And the key for windy games like in Chicago and Cleveland is to put tape over your ear holes on the inside so that the wind cannot get in and whip around and make it even colder. They also, Sara, replace Gatorade with hot chicken broth. It still has the electrolytes and the sodium, but keeps you cozy. All right, Sara, we go now to a story about a Patriots fan whose grace brings great inspiration and hope this Christmas Eve. Jerry Edmond, who was subjected to a Raider's fan's aggressive heckling in the Raiders' win over the Pats in Vegas on Sunday has been invited to sit in the club seats at the Patriots seats in Foxborough today. He will be on the sidelines pregame and meet owner Robert Kraft, who thanked him for representing Patriots fans with class. I reached out to Jerry and asked how he kept his grace and composure. And he told me, \"One thing I've learned as a black man in America dealing with a situation like that, any reactive response would result in a lose-lose situation for me. I didn't want to ruin my experience doing something I would regret afterwards.\" This was his first NFL game. He also said he didn't want to ruin anyone else's experience that day. Jerry's wisdom and grace are a blessing. He told me that the Raiders also reached out, apologized, and offered him tickets to attend the Pro Bowl in Vegas in February.
