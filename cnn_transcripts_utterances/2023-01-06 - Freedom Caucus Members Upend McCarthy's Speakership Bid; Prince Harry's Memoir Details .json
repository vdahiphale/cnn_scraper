What are your initial impressions, not having yet read the book but having seen all of these allegations? FOSTER: Well, I mean the point I've been making that there is one sided here. We're not getting the other point of view. So, you have to think about that. And then I think it's just up to people to make up their own minds. I think the most relatable part of it certainly is, you know, his experience of growing up and being so damaged by the death of his mother and then he then brings that forward to, you know, how he was then treated as a spare. So that compounded his sort of suffering. And America has a lot of sympathy for that. I think there is in this country as well. Also, in this country I think is, you know, the sense of reality that it is a monarchy and he was the spare. And it sounds quite brutal but that is the reality of his constitutional position.

But unfortunately, the spare will be treated slightly differently. But also, they are afforded more freedom, more opportunities.

And he says in the book that he and his brother actually wanted to reopen that investigation because they didn't think that it was entirely plausible. Maybe oversimplified.But then if he has such strong feelings towards tabloid culture, his book, his memoir has become the ultimate material for the tabloids to dissect, to become click bait and to create that kind of salacious atmosphere in the media that he claims to have such a problem with.
