But look, it's so important for people to hear exactly how they came to this historic decision, because this case has come under a lot of criticism.And while that juror said that he believes that, yes, this was a legitimate pursuit. A different juror told our colleague, Hannah Rabinowitz, that they did not believe that this was a good use of taxpayer resources. And we learned from the jurors that initially when they did their first poll of the jurors yesterday, as they began deliberations, they were split 6-6. And then this morning when they came back, it was actually 11-1 in favor of conviction. And then they focused on that one juror who had concerns about whether prosecutors had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hunter Biden knowingly lied on this ATF orb. And they focused on that juror and they were able to build consensus. But learning about this process, yes, this will likely be used by defense attorneys on appeal. But this is fascinating because we were also able to ask that juror if politics weighed on any of these jurors while they made their deliberations, made their decision. And here that juror said, no, President Joe Biden's name only came up once during deliberations. Now, it's interesting that that juror also does not think that Hunter Biden should go to jail as a result of this. Again, I don't think that that is going to be considered too weighty a factor when his sentence is calculated. But it's notable because we've heard even high profile Republicans today, like Representative Matt Gaetz, criticizing this case. Earlier in the trial, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump opponent, said, yes, look, I think that the Los Angeles tax case, that is something that should be pursued. But he said here, this gun case, no good can come from this. So it is really interesting to hear from the people who had to ultimately make the decision how they came to this decision. I think it is a really important thing for the American people to understand. But I completely agree with Elliot. This will likely be used by Hunter's lawyers on appeal.",

This was a case that and frankly is very sad, it's a case about addiction. And while it's a legally correct verdict, I think even this judge who has done a lot to hobble the defense here will see this as a human tragedy.I mean, this is a case that started really because of a - the finding of a gun dumps in - tossed into a dumpster by his then-girlfriend, Hallie Biden, who's his sister in law. He is the one who took steps to have it retrieved. And that's what started this case in the first place. This is a case that was supposed to end in a plea agreement with pretrial diversion. He was not supposed to see any jail time at all on it. And that plea fell apart in large measure because the parties wanted Judge Noreika to be in charge of deciding whether he was in compliance with that plea agreement or not. So it fell apart and went to trial. But I don't think there's any reason to believe that there should be a trial penalty here, that because he went to trial, which really wasn't his choice, that he should wind up with any significant jail time as a result of it going to trial rather than it going through pretrial diversion, which would have resulted in absolutely no jail time. He's still looking at significant jail time in September where he's expected to be charged, tried in California on three felony counts of tax evasion and failure to file. That is a case that is actually giving him far more grave legal consequences than this one.",

The first lady of the United States is sitting in attendance at the trial. For them to ignore it is something that is commendable. The, you know, the case itself was very strong. It was a legally strong and sound case that the prosecutors put forth. You can obviously question the politics of how it got to go to trial in the first place, but they took it seriously.

And of course, people would go in and say these things amongst each other and so on. Now, if you're a defense attorney making an appeal, you're making a case that these jurors deviated from discussing the facts and the law.

Here is Jamie Raskin. He texted me just a short time ago. He also said a similar thing during the House Rules Committee.

This has been an issue they've been dealing with in the aftermath of Beau's death, his other son, in 2015. The family has tried interventions. It has been difficult.And Joe Biden may be president of the United States, as he says, but he's also a father who's tried to intervene to save his son's life. And this was a matter of life and death. As you saw, he purchased a gun to do what with it? We don't know. So I think it will affect Joe Biden much more personally. In terms of the campaign, you know, I agree with Larry. I don't think it has much impact. The only impact it has is pointing out the hypocrisy of Republicans talking about a two tier, you know, justice system being unfair. And, you know, here you have Hunter Biden being prosecuted, just like the president of the United States was prosecuted, completely different kinds of cases. But a conviction was a conviction and he was taken to court. You know, you might argue this case wouldn't have risen to the level of having been brought before a jury if his name weren't Hunter Biden. But let's not even go there. Let's just say that the Republican argument that, you know, the Democrats are treated better than the President was, is ridiculous. I mean, you have a senator on trial now, Bob Menendez.

Donald Trump didn't have much of an effect, but I think a consensus has formed that maybe a point or two has been subtracted from its total in certain key swing states and maybe nationally.
