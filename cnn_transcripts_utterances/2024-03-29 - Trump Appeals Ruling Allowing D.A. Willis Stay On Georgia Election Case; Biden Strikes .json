I'm Laura Coates in Washington, D.C. And what a week it has been. Tonight, in fact, there have been two major developments in two of Donald Trump's legal battles. And the delay, delay, delay strategy, it's now officially in overdrive. Let me break it down for you, because, first, President Trump and his legal team in the Georgia election subversion case are making it official. They are appealing a judge's decision to let District Attorney Fani Willis, stay on that case. The judge did say that if she stayed, her handpicked special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, would, of course, have to resign. That was because he had been accused, there had been reports of a romantic relationship between the two of them, and that they went on fancy vacations together and funded by that special prosecutor's salary. Now, as you know, Wade did, in fact, step down, but that apparently was not enough for Trump's legal team, because in their filing, they claim that D.A. Willis has, quote, covered herself and her office in scandal and disrepute, as she has squandered her credibility and repeatedly and flagrantly violated the heightened ethical standards demanded of her position, unquote. Now, how long this could actually delay the trial and how long would that last, if at all, that seems to be unclear, as you and I are talking right now. The court does have up to 45 days to rule on this motion. And Trump could also go beyond this appellate court and go even further to the state Supreme Court and maybe even above the state Supreme Court. But Willis, for her part, seems wholly unbothered. She made it clear last weekend that there's no stop in this train. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is a columnist in Washington Post and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, also with a CNN Contributor and former Nixon White House Counsel, John Dean. Gentlemen, a pleasure to have both of you on this evening. What a day and what a week and what a really legal season this has all been. Let me begin with you, John Dean, on this, because there have been some major legal threads tonight, as you well know. Fani Willis is still on the case, but there is an appeal.

I mean, Trump is trying to turn every trial, every 1 of these 91 counts against him, as an attack that he thinks will appeal to his political base.I think the trouble here is that he's not in the Republican primaries anymore. He's more or less secured the nomination. And I think voters who aren't Republican, independents, and obviously especially Democrats, will be less sympathetic to this strategy, that being on trial is not a good thing for Trump.

It shows Trump basically speaking with contempt for Haley and her supporters and saying, come on with us and save the country. And so, yes, I think that, you know, will he make a pivot? It seems very hard to see him do this pivot. And John Dean is right. This is his M.O. And going after a judge's daughter is such an outrageous thing to do, but he is happy to stoop to it.

It's all Donald Trump's voice just saying -- demeaning the voters that supported her.I do think, though, SherMichael, to your point, is that Joe Biden has talked about issues that Nikki Haley voters will care about, whether it's Ukraine, whether it's what he did try to do on the border, most recently with the bipartisan bill that fell apart because of Donald Trump. So, I think you will see them begin to talk more to Nikki Haley voters. We did this in 2020 when we got the endorsement of Cindy McCain, Republicans for Biden.

Trump hasn't even selected his vice president, and I think that is going to play into some, where some of these folks. So, strategically, I don't think it's a bad thing that they haven't heard from him. Also, a lot of those lawmakers, the Biden administration, was working with them to get a policy actually passed.

Now, this was the map before redistricting in 2022, six Republican districts and one Democratic district. And now this is the map that was challenged after it was drawn in 2022, the same number of districts, but a few changes near Charleston that make one district less competitive than it was before. Civil rights groups sued. They argued the map was drawn to intentionally move thousands of black voters into a different district for political reasons and dilute their voting strength. A three-judge panel frankly agreed. South Carolina appealed that to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments back in October, but the justices have told June and they might use all their time because they have not announced their decision just yet.
