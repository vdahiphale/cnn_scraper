We don't want to go to war with them, but we better be - we better come to that from a position of strength. I would talk to them about their help with Russia going into Ukraine. They certainly winked and nodded and said it was okay to go. But goright after the Olympics? That's an unacceptable position for them to have. And Americans need to realize that Russia and China are coordinating military efforts now. They're coordinating economic efforts. Russia wants - China wants to displace us. And these are countries that don't have free speech, free press. They have ethnic cleansing. They punish their political opponents, which is why we have to have the strongest economy possible. This is why we have to rebuild the great American middle class. This is why we have to dominate the industries of the future and go to shop class and robust investments in joint vocational school because we've got to be the manufacturing powerhouse of the world. We've got to be the arsenal of energy for the world. This is a real deal. And when we got out of the World War II generation and the greatest generation, we've kind of lost that connection to our role to defend freedom in the world. And we have to do that in Ukraine. Yeah.

Rugged individualism. It's all about the self. But we find that, you know, that's obviously not exactly true. There is sort of this idea of helping your own family. Sort of the idea of kin being somebody that you will actually do acts of kindness for. Even your groups, people who you identify within your own groups. But it's this idea of stranger selection. People you don't know. Random acts of kindness for a total stranger, which actually causes these sorts of changes in the brain. That's the big difference. Why would we do that evolutionarily if it's all about protecting the self? Well, it's about protecting the species, protecting strangers.
