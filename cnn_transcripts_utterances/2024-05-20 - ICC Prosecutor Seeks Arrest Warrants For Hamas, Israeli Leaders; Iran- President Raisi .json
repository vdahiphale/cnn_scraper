So, this is the kind of reaction that probably everybody expected. When I made those very comments regarding Prime Minister Netanyahu's predicted response, because he had made that those kinds of responses before when the idea of arrest warrants was first floated publicly by the press, actually, a few weeks ago. He had said that it would amount to an outrage, or miscarriage of justice. He said, it would be anti-Semitic, it would be, you know, part of hate speech and the like. So, I put that to the prosecutor. And he said, this is not a witch hunt, not against the Israeli government, nor against any of the other parties involved. This is the attempt to apply justice equally, and to hold everyone responsible and accountable for what their role is, according to these allegations, in the attacks on October 7th by Hamas, the slaughter the rapes, the, you know, killing of individuals, and not only that, of course, the kidnapping of hostages are from even the very elderly and women to the youngest, including children, and their sexual abuse, the rapes, that have even apparently happened in captivity, according to eyewitness testimony. Now, that is what he believes needs, they need to be held accountable. And they believe that Israel needs to be held accountable for most importantly, he is put it as using starvation as a weapon of war. Now, this would be the first time in history that, that particular charge has been levelled, if indeed, the, you know, pre-trial panel does agree with these arrest warrants and seeking of these arrest warrants. The use of starvation as a weapon of war has not yet been tested. It's unprecedented in an international court such as this, but many, many, certainly, the U.S., certainly, Europeans, certainly many people around the international aid, piece of all of this, have said that there is starvation setting in, in Gaza. That there is famine in certain pockets. We know that there has been, at least, two dozen counted and named deaths because of hunger and malnutrition-related situation. And we know according to the prosecutor, what Israeli leaders, including Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, who is also one of those targeted in this search for arrest warrants said the very couple of days after October 7th, when he announced a draconian siege on Gaza, and said, we are fighting human animals, and we are going to take all these measures, in other words, the siege and everything else.

DINA ESFANDIARY, SENIOR ADVISOR, INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP'S MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA PROGRAM: Well, this is going to be a major challenge for the government now. They have 50 days to mobilize voters, to come out, to give the system added legitimacy and vote for the candidates that they will have vetted beforehand. And keep in mind again, they only have 50 days to select those candidates. And they have to do that at a time where as you've outlined there has been record low turnouts for elections and people are just tired politically.

He was trusted by Khamenei, but it's unclear really whether he would have been the next candidate. Having said that, as president, he would have had a certain amount of influence over the process. And again, they would have been able to shape the process and shape succession. And that now has been taken away.

Now, that would be the right thing to do to ensure greater voter mobilization if you will. Invite reformist candidates to also take part in these elections. Then, you might reinject the political process with a little bit more legitimacy and get more people to come out and vote. And as a result, inject that legitimacy into the system. But given how close we are to a potential succession, which really is a key moment, in the Islamic Republic's future, I think that's unlikely to happen. Because if you do that, you also open it up to a potential complete overhaul of the system or change or people demanding more. So, I think what's more likely to happen is that the system is more likely to double down, it's more likely to toughen up, there is going to be some internal rivalries amongst the hardliners who are -- who are competing for these key positions within the Iranian system right now, including the presidency now.

And they said they have a few hours left of cross examination and we're watching the feed from our court reporters inside, and they are continuing to just hammer away at his credibility. Let me give you a couple of examples. For one, on direct, Michael Cohen said he spent much of his time before the 2016 election focusing on those hush money payments that's at the center of this entire case. Well, Todd Blanche, the defense attorney just basically got Cohen to admit that he was working on a number of projects for the Trump Organization. And so, he couldn't possibly be solely focused only on that one issue. Another thing they are chipping away about and painting him as again, a liar is the amount of money that was reimbursed to accompany, which was added into those calculations for the hush money payments that were allegedly given back to Michael Cohen. So, again, they're just hammering away at his credibility, trying to show that he is a liar, that he cannot be trusted. And that is really the focus of how they conducted this entire cross examination. And now, as you just pointed out, Becky, the prosecution is going to have a chance to redirect try to narrow this, you know, write the ship again if they can with this lead witness of theirs.

The Supreme Leader is the commander-in-chief, but he was really basically a serious contender to replace the commander-in-chief Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader. The Supreme Leader is ill, is 85 years old. So, this creates a big question about the question -- a major challenge the question of succession. There are some people who basically oppose appointing the son of the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as his replacement to his father, many conservatives in Iran argue that Iran should not follow the hereditary model of other Arab states. So, what you have one of the major challenges internally is not the contestation of power between conservatives and reformists within the conservative camp. And that's why the coming elections in 50 days are very critical. The question, I mean, for your viewers, will the Islamic Republic select a candidate, a conservative candidate, and opposed by any other candidate, or will basically the Islamic Republic the clerics go for the contestation of power? This is a serious question, because we know that Iran is deeply divided. There is internal dissent.

He is seeking arrest warrants accusing both sides leaders of committing war crimes, as well as crimes against humanity. In Israel's case, he is focusing on the targeting of civilians during the war in Gaza over the course of the last seven months, as well as what he describes as a policy of intentionally trying to starve the people of Gaza and the collective punishment that he says has ensued. As it relates to Hamas's leaders, he's focusing, of course on the October 7th massacre, the abject killing of civilians that day, as well as the taking of hostages, sexual violence committed by Hamas's own member accusing these three Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh of being the masterminds and of directing those attacks and the continued holding, of course, of nearly 130 hostages. We are of course getting reaction across the Israeli political spectrum to this decision by the ICC, including in just the last hour from the Israeli prime minister himself, saying at a meeting of his Likud party that the application for warrants from The Hague is a political outrage. He says they will not deter us and we will continue in the war until the hostages are released, and Hamas is destroyed. Netanyahu's political rivals have also weighed in with similar criticism of the ICC, striking out in particular at this decision to seek arrest warrants against Hamas leaders, as well as Israel's leaders criticizing the ICC for the moral equivalency that they see in this dual decision. Hamas is also issuing similar criticism actually of the ICC, saying in a statement, Hamas strongly condemned the attempts of the ICC prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against the number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis. And Hamas is also calling on the ICC to cancel out the warrants for its -- for its leaders. But certainly, this is a step that that many have sought on both sides. You know, I was with the families of hostage -- of hostages in February when they traveled to The Hague to deliver a complaint urging the ICC leader to file charges against the leaders of Hamas. He certainly has done so in this case, but he has also of course, filed seeking arrest warrants for Israel's leaders as well.",

CNN's U.S. national correspondent Brynn Gingrass is live outside the court with the very latest and just tell us what happened and how much damage has the defense done with this cross examination? BRYNN GINGRASS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Becky. So, these are the line items that we were talking about in regards to the entirety of the hush money payments in those line items that were paid back to Michael Cohen. There was something there for services rendered from a technology company, they were supposed to be paid back $50,000. Well, Trump admitted it -- I mean, rather, Michael Cohen admitted on the stand so that he only paid back $20,000 in a brown paper bag in cash. And so, when the defense attorneys questioned him further about this, they essentially said, so you stole from the Trump Organization, because where's the $30,000, essentially, and Michael Cohen admitted that he stole, so it became sort of a dramatic moment in that courtroom, where Trump's shook his head apparently to this and gave a little bit of a smirk. But this has been their tactic for cross examination is just going after every single lie that they say is a lie, basically, from what the prosecution has laid out in its case. We do expect the defense to wrap up with Michael Cohen shortly. And then of course, we're going to see some more redirects to try to see how the prosecution sort of wiggles its way out of some of these lies that the defense clearly has brought up out of the testimony with Michael Cohen.",
