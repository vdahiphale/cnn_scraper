Although the way North Korea fired, it essentially went very high reaching about 4000 miles in the sky according to the Japanese, and landing in their exclusive economic zone. If you stretch out that trajectory, according to Japan's foreign ministry, it could theoretically have struck the U.S. mainland and that's why this particular launch, the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile is so concerning. It indicates that North Korea is pressing forward and learning as they move forward with their ballistic missile tests. And we've seen this so many times this year. They have tested ICBMs in the past in March as well as in previous years, but that doesn't mean it's any less concerning.

She is now at a penal colony in western Russia and set to begin serving out her nine-year prison sentence on drug charges. Yet, publicly and privately, the Biden administration still says and insists that it is fighting to get her home. Kylie Atwood is at the State Department for us and joins us now. Kylie, what are you hearing there about the fact that she has now been transferred to the penal colony, and what that really mean?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Kate, the expectation was that she was going to go to a penal colony. But what we really don't know is what the conditions at that colony are like because across Russia, penal colonies vary and how they treat their prisoners. But there are reports of extremely harsh treatment of prisoners in these penal colonies. According to a State Department report on human rights in Russia, there are some who are abused, abused to the point where they actually commit suicide or die when they're in these penal colonies. There's harsh labor. They're put into solitary confinement. So, those are the concerning factors to consider when we consider the fact that Griner has now been transferred to this penal colony.Now, according to her lawyers who were able to visit her earlier this week, she's trying to stay strong as she adapts to this new environment. But we should note that Russia had never officially told the United States that they were actually transferring her. State Department spokesperson is saying that they strongly protest that. They want to hear from the Russian government. Now, on the flip side of the coin, there's another American, Paul Whelan, who's also detained in Russia, and he was actually able to receive a visit from diplomats at the embassy in Moscow -- consular diplomats earlier this week. That was the first time that they visited him since June. So, of course, that's a positive development. But we're all waiting to see if the wheels really start turning on any prisoner swap to get both of these Americans home, Kate.",

They had their communications cut that only got restored late yesterday. It's happening in other cities as well.The prime minister today said that half of the country's energy supply system is now disabled -- disrupted. In some of the more remote cities in the east of the country, particularly those close to the frontlines, people are quite literally lining up in hours in the cold to get free bread handouts. They get two loaves of bread for the whole week. They're hunkering down in their basements. They might have one electrical heater in there to keep them warm. But the reality is when the power goes off, and I spoke to an old lady who told me that she'd survived World War Two, in fact, was born into World War Two. She said, you know, when the electricity goes off, this small heater that's heating several dozen people down. When the electricity goes off, they just put another coat on, put a blanket around them, and go to bed. And she said to me -- and this was really a super sad moment. She said, look, I was born into war and a fear I'm going to die into -- in war. And the mayor of that city said to me, yes, I'm really worried. People -- old people, pensioners, and there are many of them there in that particular city all at -- all other places across the country, too. They don't have the ability to withstand what's coming. They really are going to suffer this winter. And that -- and that's where the situation is right now.",

It's so much more than just a social media website.

And you have big accounts, influential and powerful accounts, like the President of the United States, like the Pentagon, the State Department on Twitter.
