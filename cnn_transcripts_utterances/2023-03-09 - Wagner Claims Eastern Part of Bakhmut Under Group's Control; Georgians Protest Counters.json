The longest and deadliest battle the war so far has seen a staggering loss of life. And now the head of the mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, says his fighters control all of Eastern Bakhmut.

So a protracted war is clearly where Putin is going.I think what plays into this, obviously, is his assistance that he's getting from the likes of Iran, North Korea, and ultimately, potentially China in terms of military assistance from China.

Now, from what we can ascertain from the video, we are yet to hear fully from the judge is that the fans raced down to the field after Arema had lost and the police took the opposing team into the locker rooms and then started as you know, firing tear gas and continued to. Thousands, yet tens of thousands of people race for the exits. And that is why so many were trampled to death, suffocated and trampled. The judge said the reason he only handed down this very lenient sentence of one year and six months is because he had tried to ease the burden of the families, this chairman had tried to ease the burden of the families.
