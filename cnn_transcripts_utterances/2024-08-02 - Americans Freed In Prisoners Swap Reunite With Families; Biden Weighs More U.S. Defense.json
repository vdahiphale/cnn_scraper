They are home. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, all walking off a plane at Joint Base Andrews just before midnight Eastern Time last night, free from Russian captivity. One by one, they were greeted by President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and then the ultimate moment, their family. The largest prisoner swap since the Cold War pulled off successfully. Turkey playing the role of mediator in this deal, which involve 24 detainees and seven countries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN:  Great satisfaction and relief for the family. To me, this is about the essence we are as a country. It really is about personal relationships. It's about families, it's about being able to have access to your own people you love and your door.",

And efforts have been going on, going way back.And then, I think a really interesting part of this important part is the fact that it wasn't just the Americans who were freed, that you had these -- you can call them dissidents or opposition people, Russian citizens who were freed. And that's very rare. So there are a lot of aspects to this. And now to mention, of course, where they all came from I think some were you know, when you look at the Russians who are being held they were excuse me in Slovenia, Norway, Germany, et cetera, so seven countries.

It's -- it felt informal in a way, children running out, et cetera. If you look at what happened in Russia, I think it is symbolic of the way that Putin looks at this. There were soldiers in uniform. They had their rifles with bayonets, a very formal type of thing. And who comes down the plane? Of course spies. People who've been involved in crimes like shakedowns and hackers, et cetera. This is really what Putin wanted. I mean, we can look at it and say, yes, it's spies, but that is what he wanted. He is a former KGB agent. He wanted to get his guy back. And I think that in the context of Russia, which right now I would argue is an extremely militarized society, that's his message. You know, you fought for the fatherland. You were loyal. We're going to welcome you back and they're two very different messages.",

And so that's another chapter that will go on. But it's tough. I think this is -- there are so many different levels to this historic because of the size, Putin in the midst of a war that he's started and his reasons for doing this and outgoing president in the United States -- I mean, it's really quite, quite amazing.",

I mean, he could not deliver on his own what Putin wanted because Putin wanted his assassin, FSB assassin, who is being held in Germany and obviously the American president cant tell them what to do, but the German chancellor, said, I will do this for you. And so, there were a lot of uncomfortable political decisions that had to be made on the part of Germany and other allies. And the fact that Biden was able to pull them together is part of his big message that the United States needs its allies. And this is obviously a political message that has resonance right now, but it's a very important part of the Biden administration approach.

This Hamas leader getting all kind of the accolades and respect from the Qatari government as he's being laid to rest, and honored in the national mosque in the capital of Doha. That's the Imam Abdul Wahhab Mosque. The prime minister of Doha, of Qatar, who was a mediator in the ongoing hostage release ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, after Haniyeh's assassination, effectively stated that what's the point of mediation when the negotiator on the other side of the table is assassinated? Which does not put much hope to any kind of ceasefire, which President Biden was just talking about, a need for that. So that puts us in this position in the region where the so hopes for any negotiated peace are dwindling or have been torpedoed. And meanwhile, Iran and its allies are talking about and threatening in some kind of attack against Israel, which could only further escalate potentially, the tit for tat attacks and drive this region into a regional war. And that's really the worry right now. We're hearing reports that Delta and United Airlines have canceled their flights to Tel Aviv. We've had some flight cancellations here to Beirut, and that might just be the tip of the iceberg depending on what happens in the coming days -- Jessica.",

Haniyeh was staying at a compound a guest residence that is reportedly a run and guarded by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. \"The New York Times\" initially reported and CNN has backed this up, confirmed it with a source familiar with this, that Haniyeh was killed by some kind of a bomb that had been planted in that building. Apparently in Haniyeh's room itself, which killed him and his bodyguard, and that is a devastating failure on the part of the Iranian security establishment.You've also had a parallel failure that took place here in Lebanon where Hezbollah, hours before Haniyeh's assassination, Hezbollah saw one of its top officials killed in an Israeli airstrike claimed by Israel in the southern suburbs of Beirut. How these individuals were found and slain so close together indicates that that these organizations, their security has been compromised. So they're threatening retaliation against Israel, but they also have some very serious questions to ask about their own internal security. Back to you know.",

They say that nearly half of the U.S. population today experiencing heat influenced by climate change itself. It's just incredible, 100 million Americans with some sort of heat alert stretching from coast all the way to coast. That is why it's impacting such a large population. And what we're talking about here is not only what we considered extreme heat in the past to be the new normal, it is becoming more frequent. So we're seeing that climate shift, what we call in our Earth's environment as well. And it's imperative and what we can see clearly in our temperatures here just shows the picture of a woman world really. And we've got our active wildfires that were still monitoring mean over the western U.S. So many too highlight, but I want to get right to the tropics because this is also an important threat, something that's impacting over the next 24 hours.
