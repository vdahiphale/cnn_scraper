Larry, I'm going to start with you. What is the biggest legal threat facing Santos right now? LARRY NOBLE, FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL, FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, good morning, Don and Poppy, and thanks for having me. Probably the biggest legal threat are questions of where the $705,000 loan to his campaign came from. This is a man that when he ran in 2020 said he had few assets -- reported few assets. And now, all of a sudden, he's reporting large assets and allowed -- that allowed him to make a $700,000 loan to his campaign. A candidate can make a loan of any size to their campaign but it has to be their own money. So the question is where did that money come from? And if that money came from another source --",

And his idea that he worked hard and earned this money -- where is it showing up on his reports? In 2020, he didn't have it, so he must have gotten it since 2020. And his financial disclosure reports with Congress doesn't really show, as it should, the real source of the money. It shows it coming from his company, but he doesn't show any clients. So there's something just very fishy about all of this. And when you're talking about sanctions, I also should mention there is the possibility -- remote -- that he could be expelled from Congress. I don't think that's going to happen because it's a two- thirds vote. But there's also that. So I think he does face real problems and I don't think Congress should avoid looking into this.

No receipts for all of those. Does that mean that those expenditures were bogus? I mean, they are also a lot of expenditures to companies that were brand-new and not working in the campaign space, tied to Santos and people close to him. So there's lots on the expenditure side as well that's really fishy that the FEC and federal prosecutors should be looking into. LEMON:  There was this watchdog group last week who filed a complaint, asking the FEC to investigate. Do you think -- and, you know, you've been talking about this and the legal jeopardy, Larry.

Let's get answers to all these questions.The problem with the FEC is that in recent years it has deadlocked over serious investigations. The three Republicans on the FEC have basically said they don't want to investigate unless you give us proof that there was a violation. So, I'm somewhat skeptical. But having said that, there are cases that are even too much for the FEC, where they say they have to investigate this. I think this is very well one of those cases because one of the things going back to the expenditures for a second -- one of the things is that one of the allegations is that he's used some of this money for personal use which, again is a serious violation. It's one that the candidate himself will be liable for. And if what he was trying to do was hide the real sources or the real expenditures and where they went to, because some of this could be seen for personal use, that even shows some sort of scheme. Now, I don't know that's what happened but it is very strange to see $199.99. I guess it's the $199 dollar store for political expenditures.
