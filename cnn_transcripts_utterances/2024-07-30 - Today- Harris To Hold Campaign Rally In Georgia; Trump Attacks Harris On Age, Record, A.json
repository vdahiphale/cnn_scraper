You see a lot of people who have suddenly tuned into the race really, a lot more energy and engagement.People find Harris accessible a lot, especially folks who are under 30 here, in communities of color, in the diverse and dynamic metropolitan Atlanta area. But people don't necessarily know her I think is really important thing here, which is giving the campaign, they both see on both sides here the opportunity to really reset and redefine who Harris is.",

I mean, talking about her laugh, for instance, which is not dissimilar from the way Trump has attacked other female politicians, if you think of Hillary Clinton and make quite personal -- he goes very personal, sometimes quite offensive. Are they already hearing something to fuel those worries in the way Trump and others are attacking Harris? Well, we will remember for years, Trump called Nancy Pelosi crazy as well, and regularly I'm used this exact same attack as you said on woman politicians. So I do think that when voters hear a lot of Trump workshopping, shall we say, when it comes to women candidates, candidates of color, they are hearing a lot of the same things that we've heard for the past nine years when it comes to Trump, if not before, when it came to birtherism with Barack Obama.",

They were attorney general at the same time in their respective states.He is, you know, championed a lot of the same policies as Harris and whatnot. So it's interesting that he took himself out specifically because of some constitutional issues in North Carolina, basically I do think that you're going to be seeing a lot of still organizing and energy there.
