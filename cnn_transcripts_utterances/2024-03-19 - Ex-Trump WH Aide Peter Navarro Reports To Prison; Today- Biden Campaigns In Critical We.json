That's where Joe Biden is heading as the person that kicks off a three-day campaign swing in Nevada and Arizona, two battleground states that are critical to his path to reelection.Plus, the power of a Trump endorsement. It's being put to the test for the first time in 2024 high stakes Republican primary in Ohio today that could ultimately determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. And Donald Trump is pushing a dangerous antisemitic trope, claiming Jews who vote for Democrats, quote, hate Israel. I'll talk to a Jewish progressive congresswoman whose father survived the Holocaust about the power and perils of the former president's words. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start today with the breaking news out of Florida. Peter Navarro, a former top White House adviser to Donald Trump turned himself into a federal prison in Miami, where he'll serve a four-month sentence for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. It's the first time an ex White House official has been imprisoned for contempt of Congress. As expected, the scene was a spectacle because it carries weight, not only because of the precedent it sets, but also the legal and political stakes for Donald Trump and his current bid for the White House. CNN's Randi Kaye is live for us outside the federal prison in Miami. Randi?",

And for much of that time, Dana, he railed against the Democrats, the January 6 committee, the judge in his case.As you know, he was convicted in September after not complying with a subpoena from the House Select Committee. They wanted him to come testify and handover some documents. He refused to do so. And then he asked the Supreme Court, of course, to let him remain free while he challenged that conviction, but they rejected that. You did mention, of course, that he is the first former White House official who is expected to now be behind bars for contempt of Congress. He's expected, Dana, to serve about four months. He said that this is going to be harder on his family than him. He said he wasn't that scared of prison. But this is also some more of what he had to say at this news conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER NAVARRO, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Every person who has taken me on this road to that prison is a friggin' Democrat and a Trump hater. Let me walk you through it. It starts with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who forms the J six committee blows away all the rules, improperly constituted, unduly authorized and unlawful committee. He puts on seven Democrats. Every single one on fact checking. Every single one of those went after Donald Trump through to impeachment and the Russia hoax, and all they want to do is stop Trump.

But then he is officially in prison custody.We are also told by his prison consultant that he is expected to remain there in -- for his time there in airconditioned dormitory where there will be about 80 elderly inmates. He is 74. And Navarro is also expected to have to take classes, work a job. His prison consultant was telling us that he hopes that he would work a job inside given the warmer conditions here in Florida. But certainly, it's going to be a difficult time for him there. Dana?",

As he's looking to defend the two states where he beat Donald Trump back in 2020. Now the president will start here in Arizona -- Nevada before traveling on to Arizona and then Texas on Thursday for a pair of fundraisers.[12:05:00] But the president will start his day today up in Reno, meeting with campaign workers and volunteers before coming here to Las Vegas, where his big pitch will focus on ways to make housing more affordable. At a time when many Americans are struggling with high mortgages and high rents and it's struggling also to even buy a first home. But at the heart of President Biden's pitch, while he is out here in the west will be trying to appeal to Latino voters. Latino voters make up a sizable portion of the electorate, both here in Nevada and in Arizona. And it comes as former President Donald Trump has tried to make some inroads within the community. So, President Biden is trying to shore up support with these groups. Ahead of the trip, he taped a pair of Spanish radio interviews, where he argued that former President Trump's language regarding to migrants, his treatments -- language relating to Latinos show that the president quote, despises -- that Trump despises Latinos. The president's campaign has also released an ad today, trying to present a clear choice between Biden and Trump to Latino voters, arguing things about insulin saying that that'll help Latino grandparents in a way that Trump's policies have nots. The president a little bit later today will be heading to Phoenix where he will launch the campaign's Latinos con Biden-Harris initiative and organizing program to really try to mobilize Latino voters. The campaign recognizes that work needs to be done within this Latino community, which has typically made up a strong portion of the Democratic electorate, but that Republicans have really tried to dig into in recent years. So, they're laying that groundwork early, trying to reach out to those voters now as they are expecting a very close contest in these two states heading into November.",

I want to talk more about all this with my great panel, CNN's Eva McKend, POLITICO's Olivia Beavers, and Margaret Talev of Axios. Welcome back Olivia. I knew you when.Let's start by kind of setting the table by looking at Nevada first. And the stakes given where the state has gotten. I mean, recently on the presidential level, it has gone democratic. But if you look closer at every two years and even in the midterms, about how close it has gotten. I mean, the Senate, it owes only by less than a percentage point, governor 1.5. And then if you look back at in 2020, it was decided just by little more than 2.5 percent. And if you kind of go back, you can see it's changed just a little bit. When you look at the presidential -- excuse me, the governor and the Senate race 2022. In particular, the fact that the Senate race was decided by about 8,000 votes. That is what the Democrats and Republicans are both looking at when they're looking at traveling to Nevada and making the case that we deserve President Biden is today.",

Latino in Arizona could be as high a share as one in four who may go to the polls. This year, Latino vote is extremely important in these two states.But Democrats have been slowly coming to the realization in the last couple of cycles, that you can't just count on Latino voters to punch the ticket and vote Democratic. And look housing, the price of daily goods, all these matters to all voters, but they have real impact among Latino voters.

So, they look at their democratic governor in Arizona, for instance, and say that she has been able to stave off some of the most draconian immigration policies at the state level.

Because right now, both presidential campaigns are fighting for that core group of voters. And President Biden won about 24 percent of Latino voters in 2020.And some polling suggests, which, you know, Democrats are a little bit dismissive of is that he's down to 7 percent with them and that is a huge jump.

They're talking about housing and the price of food and gas and goods.You got to live somewhere, and you got to eat. And that is the dividing line between upper middle class and wealthy voters and middle class and working-class voters. And the Republican Party has been fairly successful at rebranding themselves during the sort of Trump years as the party that's courting the working class -- working class messaging, housing and food are working class and middle-class issues, period paragraph.

It's been really for the last couple of weeks with early voting and the polls will be open until 7But the candidates here in this heated battle really have been going after one another in an incredibly acrimonious way. And Donald Trump has loomed large in this race as well. This is the only race that he essentially has not cleared the field with his endorsement. But he did endorse Cleveland businessman Bernie Moreno, one of the candidates in this race. She's also endorsed by Senator JD Vance, who Moreno lost to in 2022. And Ohio Representative Jim Jordan, the chair of the Judiciary Committee also has endorsed Bernie Moreno in this contest. Matt Dolan is a state senator from Ohio. He's endorsed by the other wing, if you will, of this Republican Party. Governor Mike DeWine, former Senator Rob Portman have endorsed Matt Dolan. And the competition between Bernie Moreno and Dolan has been so significant. It's been heated. It's been, quite frankly, pretty nasty here. $40 million have been spent on this race. All of this worries some Republicans who believe that Senator Brown could actually win in November if this race ends in a certain way. I caught up with Governor Mike DeWine, who actually lost to Sherrod Brown back in 2006. He had this to say about why it's so important to pick the right candidate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Sherrod Brown is very wily. He's been elected three times in the United States Senate. He has been running for office for 40 years. He's very, very good at campaigning.
