You have to really submit yourself to the rigors of the campaign trail. And we haven't quite seen that in 2020.President -- then-candidate Biden spent a lot of time in Delaware because of the COVID pandemic. He wasn't spending as much time on the road. Now, he's going to be four years older. He's going to be 80 and 81 during the height of a presidential campaign, where he's going to be expected to travel around the country. There's going to be questions about whether or not he can keep up that schedule. Now, White House aides will say he's been keeping up a pretty rigorous schedule as president traveling overseas. He's going to have probably half a dozen foreign trips this year. And they want to show that as president, he is going to be leading the country in a way that will make a campaign seem easy. That's their message. But the American people, obviously, have questions about his age. And they're going to be looking very closely at this report from his doctor to make sure that the things that they're worried about aren't actual medical issues that are behind those things.",

Its Democratic voters who in a majority of recent polls have said that they don't want to see Biden re-nominated.

Are you contrasting him with former President Trump? Because if it's former President Trump, their age difference is not that significant, and the questions that you would raise about Biden's age, you could also raise about Trump's age.So I think who he is running against is going to be a really key determining factor here as to how much voters are thinking about this and worrying about Biden's age.",

This is what they said that the long awaited important sections of the Georgia report, which do not even mention president Trump's name, have nothing to do with the president because president Trump did absolutely nothing wrong.\" Now, in this statement, which was sent to us by a spokesperson, he goes on to say that Trump did exactly what he was entitled to do, that he was allowed to have that phone call with the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, because it's freedom of speech. It was his opinion. And it goes on to say that it was -- because he believed that there was some integrity at risk in the election in 2020. I will note I think we are going to hear from former President Trump. Again, I've already heard from one advisor, talking about the portion of that Georgia report that talks about the unanimous decision made by the grand jury that there was no widespread fraud in Georgia in the 2020 election. That is something that is going to rankle former president Donald Trump, but it's something that he still talks about to this day. And it is in part still his defense, when it comes to this Georgia probe, saying that he really believed that there was widespread fraud, which is what entitled him to make that call. So we're going to keep talking to sources on the ground here to see what the reaction is inside of Trump's inner circle. We'll get back to you with that.",

Well, investigators say he had contact with some people who worked or were affiliated with those businesses, including a warehouse where they say the 43-year-old shooter was once an employee. Investigators also telling us they recovered two guns and those guns, as you mentioned, were purchased legally, but they were not registered. Also in a backpack, the 43-year-old was carrying, they found eight loaded magazines, plus a pencil size pouch containing about 50 loose rounds of ammo, and two empty magazines. We know that Monday night, he shot multiple people on the campus, critically injuring five of them, killing three of them.

You got the African-American studies course, the blocking diversity initiatives, even migrants relocating them to other states, COVID-19 bans. But when you go after parents and their kids and their college credits, something tells me that that is maybe going into some territory, that might be a little trickier. PARTI: It might be trickier, you know, for general election voters, perhaps, if he -- if he does decide to run in a presidential bid and make it that far. But I think still for the Republican base these days, you know, casting these institutions, academic institutions, major corporations as the elite, the liberal elite and going after them, can still carry some weight in the Republican primary. It's basically red meat for a lot of voters that could still help him in the Republican primaries should he decide to run.",

They want to show that they are standing up for parents' rights, standing up against the, quote-unquote, \"woke agenda\" that's going into schools, standing against things like critical race theory, even though those things aren't being taught in schools.It's really just an effort. It's an arms race, in a way, to try to get ahead of the pack and sort of saying that, I will be the person to stand up against, you know, this liberal indoctrination of students. Now, it remains to be seen how that would play in a general election. We are in a place where the primaries could be leading candidates so far to the right that it may be harder for them to come back to the middle. We saw that in the midterms with a number of candidates who struggled. And so right now, we're in the red meat zone and primary zone, but it does remain to be seen whether or not any of these candidates can modulate and be able to win over not only Republicans but also moderate as well.",

And for him, obviously, it's going to be the culture wars. But it is a bet because like you noted, Mike Pence trying to out- culture war him already.

And that is -- there was a great piece in the New York Times over the weekend, by Nate Cohn, looking at the numbers. That's the unusual part about this. Unlike 2016, there is another name that is polling in the 20s and some polls in the 30s. And Ron DeSantis, if he's -- if he's looking at that, he likes that.",
