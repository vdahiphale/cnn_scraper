And if you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.A U.S. House committee voted just a few hours ago to advance articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Republicans accuse him of failing to enforce U.S. immigration policies at the southern border, so the measure now moves to a vote by the full House. France is a step closer to enshrining abortion rights in its constitution. The French lower house of Parliament passed a historic bill on Tuesday by overwhelming margins, nearly 504 and 30 against. The bill now moves to the more conservative Senate, where it isn't guaranteed to pass. And a Thai court has ordered the country's most popular political party to stop campaigning to change the kingdom's notoriously strict royal defamation law. The penalty for insulting Thai royalty is up to 15 years in jail.",

CNN's Jeremy Diamond has our report and a warning, some of the images are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israeli forces disguised as civilians and medical staff storming a hospital in the occupied West Bank. Weapons drawn. As they move through the hospital corridor, one man is temporarily detained. Shouts of army, army ring out through the hospital corridor. Several are wearing hijabs. Two of the operatives could even be mistaken for new parents. Baby carrier in tow. A dozen Israeli forces infiltrated the Ibn Sina hospital in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, killing three Palestinian militants affiliated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Israeli military claiming this man, Mohammed Jalamneh, planned to carry out a terrorist attack in the immediate future without providing any details. In a statement, the Israeli military said: For a long time, wanted suspects have been hiding in hospitals and using them as a base for planning terrorist activities and carrying out terror attacks, while they assume that the exploitation of hospitals will serve as protection against counterterrorism activities of Israeli security forces. Legal experts say the Israeli commandos may have violated international law by disguising themselves as civilians and medical personnel. One of the men targeted, Basel Al-Ghazawi, was being treated for injuries from a rocket explosion. The hospital said he was sleeping in his bed when he was killed. He and his brother Mohammad, also killed by Israeli commandos in the same hospital room, were affiliated with Islamic Jihad. The Israeli military said one of the men carried this gun but did not say their troops had been fired upon. NAJI NAZZAL, IBN SINA HOSPITAL DIRECTOR (through translator): They killed the three youth, Basel and Mohammed Al-Ghazawi and Mohammed Jalamneh in the room while they were sleeping on their beds in the room. They killed them with cold blood, with direct gun shots to the head. DIAMOND (voice-over): Fierce battles later broke out in Jenin, where the Israeli military has been cracking down on Palestinian militant groups, killing at least 381 Palestinians in the West Bank since Hamas's October 7th attacks, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

This, you know, could become an iconic image in this election. I think the big question here, this is a big litmus test as to how far the Kremlin is going to allow this to go. They have said they don't see him as a rival. And what they want to get out of this election, because, of course, this is not a democratic society, and the purpose of this election is not to elect a new leader.
