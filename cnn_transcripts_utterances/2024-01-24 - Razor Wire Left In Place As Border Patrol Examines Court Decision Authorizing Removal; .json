Many of them, frankly, fearful that Donald Trump's impact down ticket could hurt their chances of taking back the Senate, something they witnessed back in 2022. Something they fear that could happen again, particularly as you look at the numbers from last night over the last couple of states in which Trump has, in some ways, struggled with some of those more moderate voters last night, and particularly struggling with independent voters.And that is the question that I put to a number of these top senators today, who -- even the ones who have endorsed Donald Trump. Senator John Cornyn, who was one of them, came and announced his support of Donald Trump last night. He has raised concerns in the past about Trump's electability and made clear that Trump needs to broaden his appeal to -- beyond his base in order to win in November and help Republicans down the ticket. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): I think if the president would pick Tim Scott as vice president, I think that would be a really a good ticket. But I think you're right. There needs to be outside -- after a primary, there needs to be a broader appeal than just the primary voters. You can't win with just your own base.",

I asked him about Nikki Haley's criticism, that Donald Trump was not fit to be president. That he said that that is not a view that South Carolinians will show. But the concern also among Republicans is that this will go on for some time. That the party will have a harder time to unite, particularly if it's Donald Trump gets pulled into a back and forth with Nikki Haley, as we saw last night.So, the concerns about one unifying to about actually appealing beyond his very hardcore base, beyond Republican voters and into those -- into the key demographics of his key for swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. Things that Donald Trump needs to win back the presidency. All of which is -- underscores just the hesitance among Republicans here in the Senate, in particular, to get behind them. And a lot of them, too, have fresh memories of everything that happened in the aftermath of January 6th. One of them, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who, right after January 6th, said that Donald Trump was morally and practically responsible for the actions of that day. Yesterday, I asked McConnell whether or not he will have to repair his relations with Donald Trump in order to go forward, in order -- if he is the nominee. He declined to comment. Also declined to say whether or not he would endorse him even as some other members of his leadership team are backing him. Not every member of the Senate Republican leadership team. It just shows you the challenges that Trump has had in appealing to some of his -- who we would assume, would be his closest allies. Republicans in Congress, from the Senate side, still some hesitance and concerns about the likely top of their ticket, guys.",

This was the biggest film of 2023, making over $1.4 billion, and the first film ever to cross $1 billion at the box office to come from a female filmmaker, that is Greta Gerwig. You cannot overstate what big of an impact this film had, not just on the movie industry, but also on women in film.Now, we have not heard yet from Greta Gerwig or Margot Robbie. But as you said, we've heard from America Ferrera. We have heard from Ryan Gosling. And I reached out to Women in Film, which is an advocacy group that fights for equity for women in the entertainment industry. And here is what they told me. They said, \"While we are thrilled to see a record number of films by women nominated in the best picture category, it is disappointing to see that women at the helm of both \"Barbie\" and \"Past Lives\" were disregarded in both directing and lead performances. The industry often takes women's work for granted. And even the women behind the highest grossing film of the year or most critical -- critically beloved are not exempt.\" Now. you see there that they are also calling out another great film, \"Past Lives\", which comes from a different female filmmaker, Celine Song. This just highlights that the Academy has a big history and a big problem with recognizing women in film. In the 96-year history of the Oscars, Kate, only seven women have been nominated for best director and only three wins. But of course, this goes to the bigger question of \"Barbie\". It goes just beyond women in film. The cultural impact of this film was immense. From people celebrating it when they turned out in droves to go to movie theaters wearing pink. And now we see it with society defending the fact that these two women were snubbed.",
