      "sentences": "Hello everyone. At This Hour, enduring hope and continued heartache. More earthquake survivors have been pulled from the destruction in Turkey and Syria. At the very same time the death toll is soaring. Plus, Russia firing dozens of missiles across Ukraine, escalating attacks ahead of a new offensive. And former Vice President Mike Pence is facing a decision what to do about the subpoena from the special counsel investigating the insurrection. This is what we're watching At This Hour.Thank you so much for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan. The numbers in Turkey and Syria are staggering today. Nearly 23,000 people have now been reported killed after that massive earthquake that just rocked the region. And this is five days ago. And clearly five days on. Time is running out to find survivors. Still this morning, we have incredible videos and stories of hope. A teenage girl being carried to safety, miraculously still alive after 107 hours under the rubble. I want to show you another video, a family of six in Turkey, six parents and their four children were pulled from their home 102 hours after it had collapsed around them. And you can see one of them waving as they were being brought out on stretchers. And two teenage sisters were rescued after more than four days. Firefighters saying that they kept talking to one of the 15-year-olds to try to keep her conscious, and she told them so sweetly that she missed eating ice cream in the midst of all of this. True, true miracles. But the Turkish government says that they have not been able to reach the families of hundreds of children that have been pulled out alive. The reality is so stark there. Salma Abdelaziz is live for us in Turkey. Salma, what are you seeing with rescue and recovery efforts and what's all around you today?",

      "sentences": "What incredible stories of survival, Kate. I'm at an aid distribution center here in the heart of Istanbul. Hundreds of volunteers here are prepping goods, prepping supplies to get them to that affected area. And it's those stories of survival that are motivating them, that are pushing them to keep working. There's been some criticism, I would say at minimum, of President Erdogan's government. There's a sense that maybe he didn't respond quickly enough that the country wasn't as prepared as it should be, particularly considering it sits in a fault zone.It absolutely has had major earthquakes in the past. And anger and grief is setting in as more and more bodies are being pulled out of the rubble. Families want answers and they also want help, Kate. You have hundreds of thousands of people now who are living on the streets, made homeless by this crisis. President Erdogan has vowed to help them. He says that he's going to pay the rent for any family that has survived this tragedy. Pay their rent for a year. He says he can put them up in hotels. They're sending down tens of thousands of tents to this region. But this is just a tiny fraction of the need on the ground. Remember these freezing cold conditions there, but some people refusing to leave the site of their destroyed homes until they are able to retrieve their loved ones, able to finally put them in the ground. And then you also brought up the case of those children, hundreds of children, Kate, who now have no parents or their guardians can't be found, a really horrific flight. I mean, just the scope and scale of this tragedy is so unprecedented, unprecedented. President Erdogan calling it the greatest disaster in a century for Turkey, and everyone here very much feels that. Many of them saying they can't just sit at home, they had to help. But there will never be enough help when it comes to a tragedy of this scale. Kate?",

Earthquake happened in the middle of the night when most people were sleeping. So they certainly have their beds and sheeting around them that potentially keep them, especially in the cold areas because it does get fairly cold here at night in the 20s. So we certainly have optimism and we're going to work tirelessly to keep searching and rescue any victims that we do find until the Turkish government has no more need for our services.",

And with a disaster this widespread, it certainly is a large task. So working in conjunction with the local authorities, they sort of set their direction for where they think we should start and then talking to people on the streets, getting their sense of where they may have heard people in buildings or along those lines. So it certainly is a large task but this is specifically what we're trained to do and we're ready to accomplish it.",

They're very well trained.However, when a disaster of this scale strikes, they really need that international cooperation. So when they reached out and requested for international assistance, USAID stepped up and sent our team here. And so we're proud to represent the United States and be here to do our work.",

Joining me right now to talk about U.S. assistance to Turkey and Syria is Amanda Sloat. She's Biden's, senior Director for Europe on the National Security Council. Amanda, thank you.

In the State Department's press release, it says, we call on the Assad regime to immediately allow aid in through all border crossings, allow the distribution of aid to all affected areas, and to let humanitarians access, all people in Syria who are in need, without exception, is the Assad regime holding up aid from getting in?",

The 85 million that the U.S. Agency for International Development announced is to help all of those affected by the earthquake, both on the Syrian side as well as on the Turkish side.USAID Administrator Samantha Power has spoken with the head of the White Helmets, which is leading the rescue and recovery effort on the ground. NAID has also been working closely with all of our implementing partners on the ground in Syria to serve as much assistance as we can. To your broader point, obviously there continues to be concern about access and checkpoints on the ground. The Bab al-Hawa crossing from Turkey into Syria is open and is being used heavily by our implementing partners. There are continued efforts at the U.N. to try and get the Syrian government to authorize the opening of additional crossings. Martin Griffiths is currently on the ground in Damascus working on that with the Syrian government, and we're also supporting that effort at the United Nations in New York.",

Second, we have always made clear that our sanctions and E.U. and other sanctions do not affect the provision of humanitarian and other types of assistance.And in the event that was unclear, treasury issued a general license yesterday that further made clear that any provision of humanitarian assistance during this period was not going to be subject by two sanctions and was fully supported by the administration. So from our perspective, the commitment has 100 percent been there to help all of the Syrian people affected by this. Our sanctions are not an impediment to the assistance, and we have issued additional clarification to make clear that all humanitarian assistance is welcome.",

But FBI and Justice Department wants to make sure that they have everything. And what tends to happen when someone has a private lawyer that finds documents, they're often not clear to see classified information. So the moment that they see something, they will kind of turn it over and not look further. So the FBI needs to go in themselves just to make sure that they have everything.

You decided that a criminal investigation was warranted. They obviously decided that in the case of former President Trump. Did they decide it in the case of President Biden? I'm not sure. But they went ahead and appointed the Special Counsel, I think, in an excess of caution.So the question for Pence is, it's exactly like the Biden case. So if there was a warranted criminal investigation for Biden, really, there ought to be one for Pence. The question becomes, do you go ahead and just do it at DOJ? Because, frankly, I don't think they're going to charge here. It could be pretty quickly done and then closed. Or do you appoint a third special counsel? I don't expect them to do that. I think if they look at this at all as criminal, they'll probably just do it in house.",
