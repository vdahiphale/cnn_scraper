Read's boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, was found dead in January of 2022 outside the home of a fellow officer. The prosecution claims Read killed him in a drunken rage. That defense says she is being framed by the police department.With us now, CNN's Jean Casarez, outside the courtroom here. There is a lot of interest in this, Jean.",

      "sentences": "This is overwhelming social media, John. I mean it has gone viral. And people are so passionate about this case. There are many, many people that believe that Karen Read has been framed, that she is innocent, that she did not commit any crime at all. But then you have the victim, John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer, and many people say, yes, she did. She was the last one that saw him that night, and she ran over him with her car.Now, there are people that come here to the courthouse every day that are in support. But let's look at the facts, because this is a serious murder case. The top charge being second-degree murder. Here are the facts that we know. In January of 2022 Karen Read, who was an adjunct professor of finance at a local college here in Canton, Massachusetts, and her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, they'd been a couple for a couple years. They were very close. People said they were very volatile also. That she and he got in a lot of arguments. But they were at a bar that night, a couple of them, with a lot of people. They - friends they knew. Police officers. There was an after party at one of the family's homes. The Albert home. Everybody was going there. Well, Karen Read and John O'Keefe, it is a fact, that they drove to that house. It is a fact that John O'Keefe got out of Karen Read's car. But here's where it diverges because the prosecution is alleging that Karen Read got into a terrible argument with him on the drive over to that house and she shoved that car into reverse and she backed up and she plowed into him and she left him and she sped off down the road in the middle of the night. Now, the blizzard was just beginning at that time when all of this was happening. The defense is saying, no, John O'Keefe went into that house. It was all filled with police officers. They started to argue. There were issues. And they are the ones that killed John O'Keefe. And a dog, a 70 pound German shepherd in there, bit him repeatedly, and they threw him out in the cold. But there are minutia - there are things here - the devil's in the detail. One of Karen Read's good friends, in the middle of the night, wrote, how long does it take for somebody to die in the cold? Also, when first responders came to the scene, Karen Read, according to their testimony, said, I hit him. I hit him. I hit him. And there was all of that tail light that was found later in this snow. But the defense is saying, all the police officers, they planted that. But, John, here's the thing. If you believe there was a conspiracy from the beginning against Karen Read, you've got to believe that the Massachusetts State Police, the Canton Police, local authorities, and all the police officers in that house that night, they all conspired together against Karen Read. The jury will start deliberations very soon.",

But the fact that everything that has happened in the campaign so far has not really changed the trajectory of this race. Even after the convictions, the guilty verdicts, 34 of them last month for Donald Trump, that has largely not moved the conversation. So, our poll of polls, as you said, what that is, is an average of polls that are conducted nationally shows the Joe Biden at 47 percent, Donald Trump at 49 percent, that is within the margin of error. We are seeing a little bit of different movements. The Fox News poll actually showed some movement toward Biden after the convictions. \"The New York Times\" poll did not. So, what we know, that this is a tight race. So, that's why the debate tonight is the biggest single moment of this campaign. It could change the fact that this has been so, so close, Kate.",

There are 55 percent of voters say that they would prefer someone else as the Republican nominee, but 64 percent say the same about Joe Biden. So that shows sort of their strength with their respective bases. There are many Democrats, some even independents, who would have preferred someone else other than President Biden. There are a smaller majority of some Republicans who's say the same thing. But the reality is, these candidates are facing one another. That's why this debate is so early. It's why the campaigns agreed to the early debate, to show voters that this is the choice.So, both sides are trying to use this as a chance to show those contrasts. But, boy, there is a sense that a lot of voters out there in America simply do not like there options, but that's what they are. Kate.",

New this morning, Boeing has a new explanation for why a door plug blew off mid-flight on Alaska Airlines - on an Alaska Airlines flight. They say that the tech crew removed critical bolts on the plane, then sent it off to a second work team without paperwork. Boeing says the second team performance the temporary fix, likely thinking someone else would replace the bolts. Again, the paperwork they're blaming there. The plane flew nearly two months in that condition before the plug blew out mid-flight. Sara.",

The specialists in San Diego, they had been preparing for months and they're trying to make their habitat very similar to the one that they had in China. So, all of this is in preparation for these beautiful creatures that are going to be arriving. But as you said, there - it is multilayered. Not only is this incredible for conservation efforts, as there are more than - just around 2,000 giant wild pandas left in the wild. So, conservationist will be able to study these creatures once they arrive in San Diego. But this is also about U.S.-Chinese relations.
