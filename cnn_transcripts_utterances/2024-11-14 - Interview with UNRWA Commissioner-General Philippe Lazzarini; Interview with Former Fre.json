I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Donald Trump will be inaugurated in a couple of months' time, but will he get the cabinet he wants heading into his second term? Senator Marco Rubio looks set to be secretary of state. But some of Trump's other picks are raising eyebrows, not just amongst Democrats, but in his own party. Like his choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, the now retired Florida congressman known for his pugnacious personality, who was under investigation by the Ethics Committee. Or Tulsi Gabbard, for Director of National Intelligence, who critics accuse of being in the pocket of Russia's President Putin, even Syria's Bashar Assad. And his pick for secretary of defense, Army National Guard veteran and Fox News Weekend host Pete Hegseth. These are not just ardent loyalists, their lack of relevant qualifications for such important roles concerns Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and others, especially if Trump tries to ram them through without appropriate Senate consideration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT):  I mean, that, that would be, you know, the end of the United States Senate. If the Senate chose to end its power of advice and consent and just allow the president to choose without any input, confirmation process, or approval his cabinet, I don't know why we would continue to show up for work.

What would the rest of the world think of an America that has this kind of situation going on, especially if they're rammed through. What are you hearing in Washington? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Look, Christiane, this is going to be the first real test of Trump's mandate, if he perhaps over exercises it, or if Republicans follow along. We are going to see that in the Senate. Look, the role of the Senate is to advise and consent. It is hard to imagine that all Republican Senators would go along with these nominees. Let's start with Matt Gaetz. There is no more divisive figure, even among Republicans, and an unserious figure than Matt Gaetz. However, he has one qualification, first and foremost, that drew him to the president-elect, that is his loyalty and his willingness to do virtually everything -- whatever he would like. I mean, there's one regret that stands above all from Donald Trump's first term, that is Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, who, of course, went on to recuse himself in the Russia investigation. And Donald Trump is not going to have that this time around. So, loyalty is first and foremost. But how many Republican senators will stand up? Matt Gaetz will be the ultimate test of that, Christiane.",

But, you know, hasbecome very prone to conspiracy theories and has become friendly with the president-elect and his team. Look, the irrelevant senators on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, are really going to scrutinize her. She will also have an FBI background checked. There are a lot of questions about her. So, if not for Matt Gaetz, there's no question in my mind that Tulsi Gabbard would be the first on the list of some eye rolls among Senate Republicans, and I think the rest of the cabinet nominees on from there. Defense secretary, there's no doubt, I think what the plan sort of is going forward on that, but it is Matt Gaetz and a Tulsi Gabbard who I think will -- you know, it is the president's cabinet. He has the ability to put in who he would like but I believe that he has some challenges on those two. Hegseth for defense, I would be surprised if he did not get confirmed, at least, unless we learn something else. He's a Fox News Weekend host. He is a rising star on the conservative side of the aisle. And I think that most Senate Republicans will probably swallow that and not buck the president- elect on many things.

But this is something that, you know, is going to be a wait and see. But in terms of how the world views is, Christiane, I'm struck by is President Biden is flying off for what could be his last foreign summit at the APEC Conference. He will be asked by world leaders. What is going on? And it reminds me of what President Obama, at the time, in the fall of 2016, was asked about. Who is this man, Donald Trump, that America has just elected?

(END VIDEO CLIP) HOLLANDE (through translator):  This message hasn't always been properly heard or understood, but now that Trump is going not only to withdraw American forces stationed in Europe, there are U.S. soldiers who are going to return home after all, but he will almost certainly ask NATO share the burden of cost of the security of Europe. Obviously, the Americans will do what they want, but it is essential that Europe takes responsibility for its own security in proper agreement, of course, with the Trump administration.",

His objective is to challenge the independence of Ukraine and to install in Ukraine a puppet regime as he did in the past.

HOLLANDE (through translator):  Well, first of all, we in the west must talk to the Arab countries because they're the ones who must come up with a solution for Palestine and for Israel. Recognizing that Israel also needs to acknowledge a Palestinian State. Obviously, the position of Saudi Arabia is decisive here. And Arab countries actually can influence Trump because they have links between the various leaders and try to convince him that the major risk would be a conflagration throughout the entire region. Trump doesn't want war. All of Trump's speeches to the American people are about using force to prevent war. But we have to get the message across to him that in that region, force can actually trigger war, war with Iraq.

No humanitarian aid of any consequence is getting in, and the U.S. deadline has passed. Should there have been a serious attempt by allies of Israel to withhold military support for this war? HOLLANDE (through translator):  France, and indeed most European countries are not supplying Israel with any more arms, whereas the U.S. is. So, it's up to the U.S. to convey the message that humanitarian aid, over and above the weapons question, is essential, even an obligation on their part. So, Trump would be committing a very serious error if he didn't lay down a condition before he takes power in February. And the humanitarian question could spark an international outrage, which would boomerang on Israel and there would be extremely harmful consequences.

Well, you know, my conceit was that we are about to get Trump 2 and one of the manythings you can say about Trump is that he's one of the most transactional presidents, one of the most financialized presidents, one of the most self- interested presidents that we have ever had and we'll have again. And to me, that sort of dovetails with self-interested markets and self-interested economies. And for the last 40 years or so, with a couple of exceptions, I would put the Biden administration is one of the big exceptions, we've had economic policy that's been run, I think, in a very selfish way. It's been run on the sort of Chicago school shareholder value model, where as long as share prices are going up and consumer prices are going down, everything's fine. You have Trump about to inherit an economy that was actually doing very, very well, but for a variety of reasons, one being the felt experience of the inflationary blip that we saw, big blip that we saw during COVID, which is hit a lot of people hard, but also an idea that he was able to present that trickle down works, tax cuts will make the economy grow even faster. We're taking a strong economy and an economy that was working well, you can like Bidenomics or not like it from a political standpoint, but the evidence was that the U.S. had the best recovery of the post-COVID period. So, it was working. And he's now going to inflate that economy even more by using debt and deficit to bolster asset prices, to deregulate markets at a time when that's the last thing we need to be doing for the safety of the economy, and I'm very worried that we're going to get a big correction. And so, that's what I mean by the U.S. as a distressed asset. My feeling is that, in some ways, we are politically buying in at the top of the market, and we're about to see a potential downturn in the next couple of years because some of the policies that this president may implement.",

In fact, oftentimes share prices for a specificcompany will go up if they stop investing in things like research and development, if they lay people off, if they cut costs, if they offshore jobs, that will all make a stock price go up, but it won't enrich a community, it won't develop the new, new thing from an innovation standpoint, it won't create jobs, it won't create income growth. So, stock markets and the real economy are often inversely correlated. And in fact, over the last 20 or 30 years, as markets have become a more and more important part of how we drive growth, and by that, I just mean asset growth, asset price, inflation of stocks and homes, et cetera, you've actually seen slower and more volatile real economic growth. You've seen more financial instability. You've seen more financial crises. So, in some ways, you could take an X and say, when the stock market's doing better, you can sometimes argue that the real economy is doing worse. What I will say is this, if you look historically, we are at a period in this country where we are about six years overdue for a slowdown if you discount that quick V shaped downturn in recovery of COVID, which was kind of a one-off event. Recession and recovery cycles tend to happen about every 10 years, it's been over 16 since we had the last one, the last real one. So, no matter who was in office, we were probably due for some kind of a slowdown. To have a president coming in and trying to bolster the market and create more debt and deficit growth at a time when you already have the potential for a slowdown, that creates a very risky dynamic, that's the sort of times that you get big stock market corrections, financial crises, and serious downturns.",

It's about using the consumer market as kind of a bargaining chip, which I expect that he will do. We will hear a lot about that. If the country is not doing what he wants, you may see tariffs pulled out as a threat. That's a very different way of thinking about a tariff than say, a one-off measure to correct against anti-competitive practices on the part of China, let's say for dumping steel or for dumping electric vehicles below price into a market. That's a way of protecting U.S. workers. I think what Trump is going to do is not what he says he's going to do, which is put 60 percent tariffs on China across the board and 20 percent on other allies because that would actually probably crash the U.S. stock market and potentially weaken the dollar. I think that what he's going to do is use tariffs as a bargaining tool in a very political way that will create a lot of uncertainty in the market and to the extent that they're used in any broad-based way, because there's no real industrial strategy to go along with it, you would probably see that as an inflationary tax on the U.S. people.",

So, for those people asset price inflation is great, saying, oh, I'm going to cut corporate taxes. Oh, I'm going to get rid of antitrust policy. And so, potentially there'll be a mergers boom, and that'll create a short-term sugar high, maybe a little more stock gains. That's good if you own a lot of assets, but if you are like the average American, and you get most of your money in a paycheck, that may not necessarily mean good things for you, because what tends to happen during M&amp;A booms, layoffs. Companies merged. They don't need half of their back office anymore. Those jobs go away. This is happening at a time when A.I. is starting to move higher and higher up the food chain, and you've got tech titans like Elon Musk now potentially coming in and, you know, right sizing the government, which will mean more cuts. So, this again creates that dichotomy between the asset owning class and people who really make their money in a paycheck. I will also say that I think some of the policies that Trump has proposed, like no tax on tips, are incredibly cynical because only the lower 5 percent of the socioeconomic ladder even makes money in tips, most of those people make so little money they're not paying taxes already. It's not going to make a difference on the federal balance sheet. And what we really need is decent jobs. You know, we need a guaranteed minimum wage.

Those two things are going to be very politically unpalatable. And so, does that create a kind of an emerging market style crisis in the U.S.?
