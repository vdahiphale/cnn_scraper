I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we're following the latest this hour as treacherous snowfall and bone-chilling temperatures colliding, hitting most of the U.S. this weekend. Lake effect snow is more than three feet in parts of the Great Lakes region with the worst still to come. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro issuing a disaster declaration for Erie County after heavy snowfall shut down several highways in the area. Nearly 2 million people are under lake effect snow warnings through Monday. Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is here with the latest. So how long is this arctic blast going to be around?",

We've had at times very heavy bands. At other times it's been almost whiteout conditions where it's very impossible to see. And we've been seeing similar conditions on portions of highways. Interstate 90 that runs from Buffalo back through Cleveland is now closed in some spots because of how bad the roadways have gotten. Interstate 81 that runs just south of Watertown, New York, also having some pretty treacherous spots. And again, even some of the side streets, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, all looking at times at some very heavy bands of snow moving through.You're going to continue to see the heaviest bands coming off of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as we go through the rest of the day today and also into the day Sunday. Now, keep in mind, whatever we get from this point on is on top of what they've already had. Some of these areas, this began late Thursday evening for some of the snow. Look at this, northeast Pennsylvania picking up over 40 inches of snow. Ohio, Michigan, New York also picking up amounts that are well above 30 inches already. Keep in mind, too, some of these reports, they don't do them every hour. Some of these reports are two, three hours old, so we know those numbers are even higher than what they're showing now. You've got all of the winter weather alerts in place. But we also have a secondary system independent of the lake effect. This one is stretching from portions of western Missouri all the way over into West Virginia. Now, this one not quite as high of a snow maker. Most of these areas picking up about two to five inches. But if you're traveling along Interstate I-70 through St. Louis, going down over towards Louisville, you are looking at that snow to stick to the roadways. The heavier snow, however, is going to be farther north here. Not necessarily inches, but feet is what we're measuring. Some of these spots when it's all said and done could end up seeing as much as six feet of snow in just a few short days.",

We're not just talking the northern states that are used to the cold. A lot of these areas right here along the gulf coast are looking at these frost and freeze alerts. Panama City, Tallahassee, Mobile, these places that are not used to temperatures this cold, especially this early. Some of these temperatures you might see maybe mid to late January. Certainly not the very end of November.But the other thing we talked about, it's the prolonged event of this cold.

But unfortunately for her, a judge disagreed and allowed the player in question to continue competing. This was a federal judge in Denver. Then the appeals court also agreed, allowing this player to continue in this championship, which means that they will go on and play.I want to read a statement from the conference commissioner about the players eligibility. She said this, \"The student athlete in question meets the eligibility standard.\" And then she went on to say, \"It breaks my heart because they're human beings, young people, student athletes on both sides of this issue that are getting a lot of national negative attention.\" And despite the negative attention, despite what's going on here, we said, you know, this game will go on in three hours. And if San Jose State wins, what happens is they automatically get into the 64 game NCAA tournament. So this means it can continue this controversy. It could be at an even bigger scale as, of course, the NCAA tournament is a big deal when we're talking about volleyball. So we'll see what happens in a few hours.

I'm going to read for you some of what he wrote. He wrote, quote, \"I just had a very productive meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, where we discussed many important topics that will require both countries to work together to address, like the fentanyl and drug crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of illegal immigration, fair trade deals that do not jeopardize American workers, and the massive trade deficit that the U.S. has with Canada.\"He went on to say that they also spoke about energy and the arctic. But look, this is notable. I think the one thing he didn't say in that was that he didn't make any announcement to move away from that commitment he made earlier this week when he vowed to impose steep hikes in tariffs on both Canada and Mexico. And what's been fascinating about the fallout of that post, Fred, and that threat of him -- he specifically said he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico, is that we really have seen the leaders of both countries react swiftly. We know that Justin Trudeau earlier this week got on the phone with Donald Trump. They said that they had a productive call, or at least that's according to our sources familiar with that phone call. But then we saw him yesterday fly down to Mar-a-Lago to meet directly with Donald Trump. And one thing as well is we heard the prime minister of Canada, in an unrelated press conference yesterday morning before taking that flight to Florida, addressed this as well.

It's just the things that we buy in the shops that we might need for something, I don't know, a birthday party or whatever it is. But quality is really a big issue here. And if you're going to make things cheap and at scale, then the thing that often goes is quality. And then if something doesn't last for a very long time, then you buy it, it wasn't very expensive. It breaks. It's annoying, but you chuck it out. And I think that's where consumers have a bit more power to make some more choices around the things that we buy, and just not falling for stuff that is probably not going to last very long and is going to end up getting ditched quite soon.",

She was able to slip past two I.D. verification stations, one of which included the boarding process itself where you show your I.D., you show a ticket to get on that flight.Now she was screened by TSA in that initial security screening, and both her and her bag did go through that screening. But she was also able to avoid detection, as you mentioned, on the aircraft itself, where she seemed to jump between lavatories during what one passenger called a completely full flight. Now the flight crew did not detect her until they landed in Paris, where Paris authorities arrested her, detained her, and will send her back to the U.S. One explanation, one potential explanation could be the fact that she was able to do this during a very busy, busy time for the TSA and for airlines.
