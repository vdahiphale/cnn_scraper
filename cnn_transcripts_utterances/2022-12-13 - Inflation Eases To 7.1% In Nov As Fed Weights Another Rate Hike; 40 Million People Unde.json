The Fed has been slamming the brace on the economy, rapidly raising borrowing costs to get inflation under control.As we speak, the Fed is meeting and debating what to do next. In just under 24 hours, the Fed is expected to have another hike. The expectation is to slow the pace from hike, go from 75 basis points the last four meetings to 50 basis points. Today's report does give them some cover to do just that. Victor and Bianna, the hope is he Fed won't have to raise quite as much next year. And that would lover the rise of a recession in 2023 or 2024.",

That's going to continue to migrate through the east throughout the overnight hours tonight and into much of tomorrow. On the northern end, we have winter alerts. We have blizzard conditions ongoing in southern Nebraska where we've had winds of 45 miles per hour, and zero visibility, with the snow just coming down. So that's going to continue. Travel will be impossible across many of these areas. Look at these wind gusts. More than 50-mile-per-hour wind gusts in Cheyenne with very heavy snow. Rapid City, 63-mile-per-hour winds. Current visibility down to almost nothing across a large port of this area. Bianna and Victor, this will continue throughout the overnight hours.

According to medical experts, COVID-19, RSV and the flu are pushing some facilities to the breaking point.On top of it, health leaders warn a growing number of people are not getting flu vaccines this year because of what they're calling vaccine fatigue. Now according to the CDC, just 26 percent of adults received their flu shot by the end October and 43 percent of children received theirs by the end of November. Dr. Steve McLaughlin is with the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of New Mexico. His hospital is seeing a surge in patient levels so severe that it put up a triage tent outside the Emergency Department. Doctor, thank you for being with me. Give us some numbers behind this. What does it look like there at the hospital, and how is this impacting your ability to offer care? DR. STEVE MCLAUGHLIN, PHYSICIAN, DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO: Hi, Victor. Good afternoon. We've been experiencing historic volumes of patients over the last six to eight weeks. The way this is appearing at the hospital, we have a large number of patients admitted that are boarding in the Emergency Department, waiting for beds in the hospital. While they wait, they're in the Emergency Department. That, of course, takes up space, makes it harder to see the new patients coming into the Emergency Department. The tent helps us to have that flexibility space to see the new patients as they're coming in.",

HAKEEM OLUSEYI, ASTROPHYSICIST &amp; VISITING PROFESSOR, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY &amp; AUTHOR: Thank you for having me. This is not hyperbole. This is truly a fundamental breakthrough in developing the energy of the future. So the greatest stores of energy that we have is what we call matter. Albert Einstein informed us 100 years ago that matter, as we think about it, may not really exist at all. Basically what we call matter may, in fact, be combined energy. We now know this has been confirmed. If you take the proton, the particle that makes up the nucleus of all of our atoms, along with neutrons, 99 percent of what we call mass is energy inside of them. So the question is, how can we get that energy out? There are three ways to do it. The first way we've been doing for decades. That's with this fission reactors. But they're really dirty with radioactive waste. Now there's this, fusion. This is how starts do it. Energy is at a premium, yet stars have the ability to pump out energy for billions of years. Now we may be able to do that. The final is matter-antimatter conversion chambers like \"Star Trek\" does.",

We'll say two plus three equals five. But when you add those things together, two plus three does not equal five. Two plus three equals four. You ask yourself, where does that other one go? The other one was converted into energy. So you end up with less mass when you plug these things together, and that mass was converted to energy. \"E equals MC squared\" tells you how much energy you get. For one unit of mass, you get a one followed by 17 zeros units of energy. That's a big win.",
