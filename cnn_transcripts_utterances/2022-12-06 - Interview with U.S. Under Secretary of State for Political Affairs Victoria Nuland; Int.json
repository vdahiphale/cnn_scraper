Authorities in the region Kursk, close to the border with Ukraine said today a drone had hit an of crossed, roads close to the border with Ukraine, said today the drone had hit an airfield. This comes a day after Moscow claimed that Kyiv had used drones to attack two military airbases deep within Russian territory, in the regions of Saratov and Ryazan. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for those attacks, but they would confirm that the country does now have the capacity to hit targets many miles beyond the frontier. With the ground war grinding on, Russia has launched yet another barrage of missile strikes on civilian infrastructure yesterday. knocking out power and water across several Ukrainian regions as the dark and cold winter sets in. So, do the strikes inside Russia signal a new phase? I asked the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, who's just back from visiting Kyiv where she met with President Zelenskyy. Critically, we also discussed how Ukraine will manage Putin's weaponization of winter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But they are all being targeted for the same reason, to attempt to stop journalists doing their job and reporting and telling the world what's really happening in the region that they are in. It's important to remember that with Jimmy Lai, what has happened to him since 2020 is the sharp end of a process which has been continuing for many decades. Right from the outset, when he set up the \"Next\" magazine in 1990, horrified as he was by the bloodshed in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The authorities targeted him. They targeted him financially right from the outset. He had a clothing business, which was targeted in 1990, as soon as he started writing pieces that were critical of Beijing's leaders, including China's then prime minister, the late Li Peng, I often refer to as the butcher of Beijing. And for years, he was targeted using surveillance and so on. But what we're not seeing is the sharp end of the process in the last two years.

He couldn't reach him. He made the -- he made his way down from Kyiv, it was a two- to three- day journey. When he got there, he went to his home, there were Ukrainian soldiers living in his home. He said, have you seen my father? They said, no, but across the street there's a small wooden cross in a bunker or near a bunker. And so, he went. And, of course, very wisely, he called the deminers first because when the Russians left, they left everything mined and booby trapped. Once it was demined, he immediately recognized the feet and the legs of his father and the cane of his grandmother. And then, had to wait for the prosecutor to send a team of police to come and actually do a proper exhumation so they can identify the wounds and the bodies and do a sort of autopsy on the ground there.

You see the carcasses of dead animals everywhere. And that is something that is incredibly noteworthy because people in Somalia depend on their animals. They depend on them for milk, for food, for sustenance. And so, when you see animals in a mass dying across Somalia, that is something that is very noteworthy because people are dying because their animals are dying.",

You know, and then, they go down to 30. And what do you do as your source of milk and food that feeds your children dies off because there is no water? You know, the other thing is, people who don't have cattle who are dependent on pastoralist, who -- people who provide them or sell them milk, they also leave the area because they have to go in search of water because there is no rain. And so, I think, you know, a lot of the families I interviewed, I say, so, what are you eating now? Porridge, some of them have porridge. The water source is not clean. You know, you're -- you -- they don't have access. Sometimes they move just to get to Baidoa because they know that organizations like Save the Children and Mercy Corps and WFP are there providing water, food. There are water trucks coming and filling giant bladders with water so people can actually drink water. But I think it's hard to imagine, you know, one mother said, she gives her children one meal a day, that is it, and it is usually porridge. And if there is anything left over, she will eat herself. You know, we're not even talking about the mothers who were malnourished, you know, because, of course, the children are more vulnerable, so they die first.",

But, of course, the first thing I am thinking of when I approach a woman like Idaba Yusuf (ph) is, it's so unfair. You know, she has this life because she is born in a place that, you know, she doesn't have the opportunities that we have, one, for example, because I was born in America, you know, I have access to food and water, and shelter, the opportunity to work, the opportunity to do what I want for a living and to make my own money. And most people around the world do not have those opportunities. And I think that is one of the things that drives me to do this work year after year, no matter how devastating it is, because I don't believe it is fair. You know, I think that there is so much injustice in this world. And I just hope that sometimes these stories will make a difference.",
