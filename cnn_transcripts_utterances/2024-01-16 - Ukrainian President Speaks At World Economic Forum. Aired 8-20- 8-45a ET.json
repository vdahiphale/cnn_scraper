You do not understand what differences is between -- between us, you and this man, Putin, because as you have mentioned and in Europe, question was all the difference between autocracy from democracy, is that you mentioned for how long the people -- the people of Russia will allow Putin and then afterwards, it is not important whether it's war, the elections to be the head of the state being question, is that we -- we equally understand this, you and us, for how long will people allow and that is the principle of democracy. And that is the difference. The people do not allow anything to the President Putin. The question is, what President Putin allow to his people? And therefore, we need to stay the question differently. For how long are the people ready to post able to be deaf, to not hear anything, to not see anything? To pretend like everything is all right and is moving all right? So that is not the question to me. That is the question to the people of Russian Federation, whether they are capable of changing themselves or not and that is the situation. And Putin, he -- that is what I was saying. I don't believe that that man is capable of changing because only humans can do that.",

It was a pitch for his money, wasn't it? He's saying he needs money to make this war, this when decisive this year. So he's trying to set a timeline on it, but obviously needs money to do it. He's really worried about having what he called a frozen war.",

      "speaker": "BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST",
      "sentences": "Yeah and he said a frozen war will never lead to peace, Max. It was interesting because he had to counter both the gratefulness that he and the nation feel for the West support for now going on two years of Russia's larger scale invasion of Ukraine, obviously reminding the audience and the world that it's been nearly ten years since Russia first illegally annex Crimea and Eastern Ukraine and the Donbas area.But I think the real theme is, I'm grateful, but. And he proceeded to an a very graceful ways chastise the audience by saying we did everything that you told us to even though we knew what the outcome would be -- be patient, don't escalate, don't escalate, don't escalate, we were told. And in his view, he understands Vladimir Putin better than anyone else, and in his view that \"don't escalate\" led Putin to where he is right now. So yes, once again, he's saying that Putin is trying to normalize what was eradicated, what the West thought was eradicated in the 20th century. He says that obviously more weapons do need to be supplied. And he also went on to say that if anyone thinks that Vladimir Putin is stopping at Ukraine, or is that's where the war ends, that they are gravely mistaken. And what stood out to me as well was his line that he's reiterated before, which European nation can provide a combat-ready arms like ours? And obviously he was very grateful for or the E.U. talks that have now finally started with the accession talks that have begun. But of course that can take years to come. It is an end to the war and then full NATO membership that they are looking for. But, Max, lets not lose sight of the fact that there's over $100 billion in combined Western aid that has still not been delivered to Ukraine. That's combining E.U. aid and aid that's stuck in Congress. They are looking a bit more optimistic. But everyday that goes by, more Ukrainian soldiers die, Max.",
