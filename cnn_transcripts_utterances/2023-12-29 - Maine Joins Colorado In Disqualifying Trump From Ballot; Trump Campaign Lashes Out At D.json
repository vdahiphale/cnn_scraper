Still, Trump remains the clear frontrunner in the Republican primary, and his opponents are forced to fight for attention in the news cycles that he creates. Plus, as we close out what has been yet another wild year in American politics, we're going to look back the good, the bad and the ugly in 2023. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, December 29, just 17 days until the Iowa caucuses, 311 days until Election Day. This is today's STATE OF THE RACE. Welcome in. First Colorado, now Maine, they have become the second state to remove Donald Trump from the 2024 primary ballot. Maine's Secretary of State disqualified Trump. Here is how she explained her reasoning to CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHENNA BELLOWS (D), MAINE SECRETARY OF STATE: I said this in my decision that it is unprecedented. No Secretary of State has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. But, no presidential candidate has ever engaged in insurrection and then disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've Mo Elleithee, the Executive Director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics &amp; Public Service, also former Communications Director for the DNC, and spokesperson for Hillary Clinton back in 2008. Doug Heye is a Republican Strategist, former Communications Director for the RNC. Seung Min Kim, CNN political Analyst, also White House Reporter for the AP, and CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider joins us today as well. Thank you all for being here on what has been a less than quiet holiday week as we close this out. Jessica, let me start with you, because let's try to focus on the legal situation here, although it's really hard, in my opinion, to separate it from the political. Let me show everyone a little bit more of Shenna Bellows explaining why she did what she did, what the laws are like in Maine. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Doug, let's dig into the politics of this here, because I have to say, when I talking to democratic sources, even they -- a lot ofthem think, and Mo, you weigh in here too, that this is a bad idea for Democrats to start pulling him off the ballot this way, because in the event that they did beat him, it wouldn't give him a clean win. DOUG HEYE, U.S. REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, &amp; FORMER RNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: No. And I think it does a few things, short term and long term. In the short term, if there is one constant that we've seen from the 2024 primary, it's that when something that would be bad happens to Donald Trump, the people running against him on the Republican side back him up. That's true whenever he gets indicted. That's true with Maine and Colorado, and now with Maine. This is a constant. So, it shores Trump up politically in the primary, and comes at a time also, if you're Nikki Haley, this is good news for Nikki Haley. It knocks her off the front page a little bit with her comments. But, if you're Ron DeSantis and you were charging forcefully against Nikki Haley, you're yesterday's news as well. So, there is a lot that happens that really sort of benefits Donald Trump here.

COMMUNICATIONS DIR.: I get the people who want to go down this path, who are incredulous over the fact that a guy who is being accused of leading an insurrection could run for President again, and are looking for justice, right, this notion that nobody is above the law. I get that. But, politically, it is the absolute worst approach to this. If you want to beat Donald Trump, you have to beat Donald Trump. You have to make Donald Trump a two-time loser. And that's the only way if you want to put an end to Trumpism. If he does start getting, as you mentioned earlier, if you do start pulling him off the ballot, it's just going to be a rallying cry for his people.

Susan Collins, I think we should note, not a fan of Donald Trump. SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS, &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, not a fan of Donald Trump, voted to convict him in his second impeachment. Also, I thought the reaction from Jared Golden of Maine, the Democrat who represents that Trump-leaning district, was also interesting. He pointed out that I voted to impeach Trump at that second trial. I do not think he should be President. However, this decision was wrong. And I think it goes a lot of to what Mo said, why you're hearing kind of this apprehension from Democrats and also from Republicans who do not like Trump. They don't think this is the way that he should be pushed out of public life or pushed out of public office this way.

She knows a lot of people. And she has met a lot of people. She has done these town halls and events all over the states. So, I think there is a huge benefit of doubt from her supporters. The difference is that all these undeclared voters, 40 percent of the voters in New Hampshire who are undeclared, they can vote in either primary. Instance, President Biden is basically ignoring the New Hampshire primary. There is not really much action over there. So, they'll generally come to the primary where there is more fun, and that's ours, on the Republican side. And they may be a little off putting for them. May be they'll look around. The problem is there is no -- only two people are going to get delegates to make it 50 percent. It's going to be Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. Everybody else is going to fall below 15 percent. So, is there a big surge that these undeclared that go to Christie, where there is no chance Christie has another state to go to? He is not on the ballot in most states. He is 00 has no infrastructure in other states. He is sort of a one state wonder. He is doing what he thinks is right. But, he is not going to attract voters because he is going to be the nominee.
