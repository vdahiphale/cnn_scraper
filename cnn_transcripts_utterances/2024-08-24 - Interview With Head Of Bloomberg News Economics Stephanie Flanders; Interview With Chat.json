And she certainly also represents, you know, first woman of color, all of those things. They're trying to give the sense that there's change. But you're right. Every time I'm talking to policy advisers, and this was not a week really for policy works (ph) or detail, we would they -- all the speeches were steering well clear of that.

There's also the gender issue. But I'm really interested in what you tweeted about the convention, and we're going to just put that up. Basically, how normal it is to see -- you know, to see a woman now. \"Just take a moment. There's a woman sitting, waiting to speak on Thursday. Her dad from Jamaica, her mom from India, and she's leading the polls to be president of the United States of America, and it seems so normal.\" Does it though, Leslie? LESLIE VINJAMURI, DIRECTOR OF U.S. AND AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE AND FOREIGN POLICY ANALYST: Look, it is for many people going to be a very hard decision to make. There is a sense of it being normal of the style of communication being non-elitist. And I think this is really critical when you think about the last female to run, Hillary Clinton was really attacked as being part of the establishment and very much an elitist. And I think the rhetoric and the discourse that's coming out of this campaign is really aimed at being something very different, very every day, very about -- very much about neighbors, everyday America, non- elitists. And so, it has a feeling of normal. But you're absolutely right, a lot of people when they are ultimately faced with that decision in November it's -- you know, we say it's about the economy, we say it's about prices and inflation, we say it's about reproductive rights, but time and again, it's also, do -- can I imagine that person representing me?

Listen to these great numbers. But she then pivoted to say, we know that people are still hurting, we know there are things to do.

I mean, those -- my colleagues at Bloomberg who are much more kind of knee deep in sort of seeing some of whether it's A.I. or some of the trolling or some of the attempted kind of negative memes have been struck, at least in the last week at those -- most of those are failing to gain traction. When you look at how many likes they're getting, how much times -- how much they're being retweeted. For example, there's been quite a lot of repeated efforts to suggest that Kamala Harris is an alcoholic with, you know, frankly, rather absurd fake photos. They have not gained the kind of traction that you might have feared. But it is clearly, you know, there'll be one of these that does get through. And, you know, it just goes to the, you know, relatively urgent need if you're sitting in the -- on the Democrat side to establish your message early so that, you know, people are kind of pre-inoculated.

I have heard in my conversations with what we might call working class Americans, middle class who -- you know, whose interests are being represented to the extent that we know Kamala Harris' economic policies, their interests are being represented, and they are concerned that she's you know, giving away the store for free. So some of that attempt to frame her as a socialist is -- you know, might work. And that, I think, is going to be very tricky and important avenue that the Democrats are going to have to work, is persuading people that you can do things for people, that you can give them, you know, $25,000 towards their first house and it's not going to tank the economy.

And we would look at each other and we finally figured out, you know, we're not only competitors, we're people. And Martina had feelings and Martina had a private life and Martina had emotions and so did I. And we were very vulnerable with each other those last Sundays that we played in the final. So I mean, I think that's what started the ball rolling. And then, ironically, you know, Martina got -- had -- got cancer first. But I mean, I can only tell you about my journey was having ovarian cancer. My sister, Jeannie, died from it. And I found out that I had the BRCA gene. So, you know, I went in for preventive surgery to basically get a hysterectomy because I had a 40 percent chance of getting ovarian cancer. And they found out that I did have ovarian cancer and I didn't -- wasn't feeling anything. I mean, that's why this ovarian cancer is so insidious and so sneaky because you don't feel anything. Meanwhile, Martina was fighting her own battles with breast cancer twice, I believe, and throat cancer. And so, we were going through -- you know, she was going through radiation and chemo, I was going through chemo, but we were staying in touch. And just thinking about how ironic our life has been, where things are happening to us, the same things are happening to us simultaneously and that's really how we got so close.",

And then Chris returned again this year. So, she kind of bookended me. And we kind of have that inner radar of when to call or when to text and say, how are you doing? How's it going? What can I do?
