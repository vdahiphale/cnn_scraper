I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with a defiant Vladimir Putin making a surprise visit to Ukraine overnight just days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him accusing him of war crimes. He made a stop in Russian-occupied Mariupol, a city largely destroyed by his own forces. Ukrainian officials slamming the visit saying I'm quoting now, \"As befits a thief Putin visited Ukrainian Mariupol under the cover of night.\" CNN senior international correspondent Ivan Watson joining us live now from Kharkiv. What else did Putin do while there?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, the Kremlin says that he arrived by helicopter. And then he was shown in a pretty long unedited video driving a car, being briefed by a top Kremlin aide, driving into the very outskirts of Mariupol. The aid was describing Russian government efforts to build hospitals and kindergartens and residences while also acknowledging that much of the city had been destroyed. That there were ruins of buildings that were being demolished and that much of the city was also empty because Ukrainians had fled.Putin was shown meeting a couple of people who were living in what were described as newly-constructed apartment buildings. Those people thanked Putin for their new homes saying they had had nothing before that. And we've been hearing some pretty furious reactions from Ukrainian government officials saying that he had to make this journey under cover of darkness to hide all the damage to the city. I spoke with a refugee from Mariupol, a woman who fled under Russian bombardment and she said that this was like seeing a serial killer returning to the scene of the crime, Fredricka.",

They had encircled the city, the Russian military, and were bombing it from land, sea and air.The Ukrainian civilians that I interviewed, and I interviewed dozens of them, said that they hid for weeks in the basements of their buildings terrified. With no electricity, no heat. Some of them described seeing their neighbors killed by the Russian bombardment. And that they described seeing corpses buried in the front yards of their apartment buildings. That they had to gather water from rain gutters. And again, fleeing under bombardment, traumatized, terrified people including some that had taken shelter in the Mariupol drama theater by the hundreds which was then hit, again by Russian artillery. And we don't know how many people died there. So that's part of why the outrage is so extreme right now that the president of Russia conducted what the critics are calling basically a propaganda tour whereas the Russian government is trying to show that it is starting to rebuild some of this city, Fredricka.",

But Western leaders are skeptical of Beijing's portrayal as a mediator. Xi and Putin declared a no limits partnership last year when Putin visited Beijing for the Winter Olympic opening ceremony. Xi has met Putin in person 39 times since becoming China's leader even exchanging gifts, including pandas.China has refused to condemn the invasion or even call it an invasion. Instead, Beijing has parroted the Kremlin's misinformation while blaming NATO. On China's heavily censored social media, it's all hearts and thumbs up emojis in response to the government's official post about the state visit with comments like \"Hope Russia will win soon\". \"Hope there will be world peace.\" And \"Long live China-Russia friendship.\" Beijing has also strengthened economic and military ties with Moscow by boosting trade and holding frequent military exercises. Western officials have raised concerns that China may be considering providing Russia with lethal military aid. Beijing has denied the accusation. Last month, Putin told China's top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow that relations between their countries are reaching new milestones. The two nations bound together by their shared vision for a new world order no longer dominated by the west. And while Xi he has spoken to Putin multiple times since the invasion, virtually and in person, he's not yet had a single phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Though Ukraine's presidential adviser says negotiations about a potential conversation Zelenskyy-Xi conversation are ongoing. As Xi heads to Russia, the ability of China to help resolve the conflict hangs in the balance. Selina Wang, CNN -- Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Really as if he's kind of the savior. How do you interpret what he's doing there? And why? The signal that he's trying to send? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it may be something for Russia domestic politics, Fredricka. But we see it as a taunt. This is Putin's way of saying you charge me with war crimes, I have Mariupol. And it's the scene of one of the greatest war crimes in recent history. And he's walking there and saying I've got it. You can't do a thing about it. It's a taunt. It's part of the ongoing information war struggle between Ukraine, the West and Russia on the other hand.",

Yes, China will want to be part of that. But I think that's two or three steps down the line.

But we are providing both the antiradiation missiles and the glide bombs that are necessary to give them a little bit deeper attack capability behind Russian lines. And this is very important because there are Russian forces back there that are not committed that if something were to happen in Bakhmut or elsewhere to give a Russian breakthrough, there could be, as President Zelenskyy said, a breakthrough of Russian forces.

First, I want to tell you what we know about how the process would go should he be indicted. We expect that the president would surrender. He would be brought here to be processed and booked. He would be fingerprinted. There would be a mug shot that is taken of the former president. And then he would likely be released on his own recognizance. Now as far as those protests are concerned, law enforcement here in New York City is preparing for that possibility. And the district attorney, Alvin Bragg did respond in a memo to his staff over the weekend telling them that he is working with the authorities to make sure everyone is safe. He said quote we do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law. Our law enforcement partners will ensure that any specific or credible threats against the office will be fully investigated and that the proper safeguards are in place. so all 1,600 of us can have a secure work environment. So underlining the fact that even if the president is indicted, this is still very much a criminal court that needs to continue to operate.

But what is the one two punch for southwest Florida is that we already have an ongoing toxic species of micro algae called Karenia brevis. And blooms are commonly known as Florida red tide.
