Twitter has now suspended his account for inciting violence after he posted a Star of David with a swastika inside.Now, just hours before that anti-Semitic image popped up, West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, made incredibly disturbing comments praising Adolf Hitler. And I think it's important to hear him in West in his own words so you can hear his tone and you have the context. So here's the exchange with right-wing conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. And I do want to warn you, it is deeply offensive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX JONES, HOST, \"INFOWARS\": You're not Hitler. You're not a Nazi. You don't deserve to be called that and demonized.",

These things are happening right now. And that's a lesson that's been all too easy to impart to them this year. And we've even had to postpone lessons on the Holocaust because of these incidents keep coming up and want the kids to know this is happening right now. And we also want the kids to know that they have a responsibility as the next generation of Jews to understand what happens and be fighters in the battle against this hate. And it gives me additional comfort to hear my kids, when they see comments like that, talk about educating their family and friends, standing up and speaking out when they hear things that shouldn't be said. And just wanting to be a good person, make their communities a little better than they found it. That's the sort of reaction we need right now from all corners, in addition to denouncing what are such horrible comments, but to keep acting in a way that proves that we, as Jewish people, are not the people that anti-Semites make us out to be. We're better than that and prove it each day.",

Just this week, in Florida, what really caught my eye here, thinking about all that is that there were three 16-year-olds arrested for writing racist and anti-Semitic messages in public spaces, a playground, a bath bathroom. Just 16 years old. How is it this kind of hate is seeping into this new generation?",

And it's a scary time for Jewish people and our allies. And we've seen it -- I've seen it at my local elementary school. Swastikas posted on the sidewalk or anti-Semitic flyers in our neighborhood. Kids are not born to hate. They learn it. In the same way they can learn to love. And what we try to do in our classroom, what we teach when we bring them to the Holocaust museum in Washington, D.C., is to show them the forces of love are stronger than the forces of hate. And they can be soldiers in that battle. They have to be because, in order for the hate to go back underground where it belongs, it is the forces of love and good conscience, respect and tolerance that need to win the day. Those are the forces that were the example of my grandparents' lives. And those are the forces I try to bring to my classroom and successive generations in order to fight back against this. CABRERA: Adam, I'll admit that when my show team discussed covering this story today, this issue, we were pulled between not wanting to give hate like this oxygen and also making sure we're not ignoring people in positions of influence like Kanye West, who are spreading such vitriol. Do you think it's important, conversations like this one, happen and what's missing from the conversations like in that we're having?",

At our Hebrew school, in our class, we have a saying that we remind the kids all the time, the importance of being an upstander and not a bystander. Not being silent when we hear these things. Not being silent even in the face of violence against our religious institutions, our neighborhoods and our people. The only way anti-Semitism can get driven back down underground where it belongs is if those who espouse a far different world view stand up and say, this is wrong, there's a better way. And we will happily sit with any allies we have across all races, religions. The forces of love strongly outnumber the forces of hate. And when we rise together, we can put anti-Semitism back where it belongs.",

After he sacrificed his body literally for the goal that propelledTeam USA to the knockout round of the World Cup, Star Christian Pulisic is officially clear to play tomorrow when the U.S. faces the eighth-ranked Netherlands. At stake, what could be Team USA's first visit to the quarterfinals in 20 years. CNN's Don Riddell is live there for us in Qatar at the World Cup. He's been dubbed Captain America, even though he's not technically the team captain. So how did he look running through the drills today? DON RIDDELL, CNN ANCHOR, \"WORLD SPORT\" Hey, Ana. Yes, we spent 15 minutes training with the U.S. team a couple of hours ago. I was about 50 yards away from Captain America and his dazzling orange boots and he looked pretty good. I mean, he was out there kind of running the drills. I wouldn't say he was going at it full tilt but looked pretty good. And the news is that he has been cleared to play. We can bring up the tweet now from the U.S. men's national team. After the training session, they had a good look at him and decided that he's good enough to play. And that's just huge news for the United States. They've looked really good this tournament, but they've really struggled to score goals. They've only scored two and he's been involved in both. If it wasn't for his goal against Iran, they'd be already home back now. They wouldn't be in the knockout round. Of course, you've described how he put his body on the line. It was the pelvic contusion heard all around the world. And for the last few days, it's led to a lot of speculation about what that injury actually meant. So he was asked about that in the press conference. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTIAN PULISIC, MIDFIELDER, U.S. MEN'S SOCCER TEAM: I mean, it's a pelvic contusion. You know, I just -- it's not a euphemism. It's what it sounds like. No, but at the same time. I didn't get hit in the balls. I'm all right. It was very painful. And it just, you know, that bone is there for a reason to protect you, I think. And I hit it well and it was sore. But like I said I'm getting better. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
