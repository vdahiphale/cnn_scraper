And Delta Air Lines is dealing with a new attempted stowaway. The New York Stock Exchange is open after the Christmas holiday after about -- in about 30 minutes. Let's have a look at the futures. Pretty negative there, hopefully they'll be up for the start of the year. Meanwhile, new details are emerging from the investigation into a deadly Christmas Day plane crash in Kazakhstan killing at least 38 people. Azerbaijan Airlines said preliminary investigations have found the disaster occurred, quote, as a result of physical and technical external interference, according to Azerbaijani state media. A U.S. official offering a more direct assessment, that source says early indications suggest a Russian anti-aircraft system may have downed the passenger jet. The U.S. official says it may have been a case of mistaken identity, in which poorly trained Russian units fired negligently against what they thought were Ukrainian drones. CNN's Nada Bashir following this story for us. What are the Russians saying about this? They must know surely.",

They have been calls for nospeculation, we've been hearing from Russian authorities who have said that the flight the pilots are actually offered landing in other airports as well due to bad weather conditions. But again, there are a lot of questions around what actually led to this crash, as that investigation continues. And as you mentioned, both black boxes have now been recovered, and that will provide investigators with crucial information as to what led to this crash the moments ahead of it, including flight data as well as recordings from within the cockpit. But we've heard from authorities say it could take around two weeks before there is a full assessment completed of that black box data. But again, we've been hearing from other officials as well, one U.S. official telling CNN yesterday, as you mentioned, that this could well be the cause of Russian anti-aircraft systems that echoed earlier reporting from Reuters. They were citing multiple unnamed sources familiar with this investigation, saying that they also believe this could have been caused by a Russian air defense system. So that is certainly a key point of investigation at this stage. Important to note, of course, we've seen the images in the video of the wreckage as well, showing perforations, holes and the fuselage. So that has raised some questions around perhaps shrapnel. Coming into the plane as well, and what may have caused that. And of course, we've been hearing reports and questions around nearby drone activity. So, for many there will be concerns around the safety of flying in a region where there is an active war nearby. We know that the plane crashed shortly after a drone strike in Southern Russia. So, whether or not it's even safe for commercial flights to be flying in this region, that will be a question as well.",

And it's interesting because you mentioned this ghost fleet, this sort of fleet of tankers, that's basically there to elude the international G7 sanctions that have been slapped on Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

But you know right now we're at a time when Russia and Putin are trying to signal their strength, very mindful of the fact that President- elect Donald Trump has said that he wants to see a quick end to the war in Ukraine. Now how that exactly will happen, we still don't know. The road map to that negotiated settlement is still really very far from clear, but at least in terms of the sort of the messaging that we're seeing coming out of Russia, there's been a lot of sorts of, you know, posturing, both, you know, talking about, you know, Russia's nuclear deterrence or its new weapons that it wants to test out and some of which it's used on Ukraine. Basically, as a way of signaling strength ahead of any kind of negotiation.

CNN has also heard audio messages from a nurse and a journalist inside Kamal Adwan Hospital who say it's surrounded by Israeli forces.

Israel's military says it's investigating the allegation. Elsewhere in the region, Israel's military says it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen early on Friday before it entered Israeli territory. That comes just hours after Yemen's Houthi rebels vowed retaliation for a string of deadly Israeli air strikes on the country on Thursday. The Houthis say the attacks on Yemen's main airport, a power station in two ports, killed at least six people and wounded dozens more.

This was the fourth time Israeli planes have attacked the Houthis, who say they're firing on Israel and international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. On Wednesday night in the war battered enclave five men, all of them journalists, according to hospital officials and AlQuds Today TV were killed while sleeping in their van. The channel affiliated with Palestine Islamic Jihad, which the U.S. and others proscribe as a terrorist organization, says the men were carrying out their journalistic and humanitarian duty. Israel says they were Islamic Jihad militants posing as journalists. For evidence, it provided what it said was a list of operatives it picked up during operations in Gaza, edited to translate names and details on which four of the men's names appear along with their roles. And as the war in Gaza rumbles on, cease fire talks aimed at securing the release of the 100 or so hostages still being held captive appear to have hit another snag. On Christmas Day, Hamas accused Israel of moving the goal post to negotiations, and said this was why a deal had yet to be done. For its part, Israel said Hamas was lying and reneging on understandings that had already been reached, whatever the case, despite renewed optimism that a deal could soon be done. The reality is the two sides appear no closer to reaching an agreement that could end the year long war and bring all the hostages, home. Elliott Gotkine, CNN, Jerusalem.",

The problem spots across the south, really increase going into tomorrow as some pretty strong storms ignite, that severe storm threat is on the lower end today. You can see by tomorrow, we have a level three of five enhanced risk for Saturday, where we could have damaging winds, large hail and even some tornadoes. And then that risk shifts to some bigger cities along the East Coast, from Charlotte down to Atlanta, something to watch out for. Now, that tornado threat tomorrow is pretty healthy, especially for December. We're talking about the likelihood of strong EF2 tornado. So again, could be pretty significant, especially given that December is one of our least likely months for tornado development. We average only about 40 a month much different than our more active months, April and May, where it's 200 or more reports that we get in that those springtime months. Now this year, we have been way above average for tornado reports, more than 1700 it's been a very active year, one of the most active in more than a decade. So, you can see where the showers and storms ignite today. The rain stretches up to the Great Lakes, but the storms really explode going into tomorrow. These storms that are capable of that severe weather would be very tall. If it can produce a tornado, it's a tall thunderstorm with a lot of lightning. So that means any planes would need to fly all the way around this, so could take you longer, and it would definitely be a bumpier ride. You can see where you've got some of those travel problems across the south on Saturday with those storms. The rain stretches up the East Coast by Sunday, so travel problems from Washington, D.C., New York and Boston. And then notice the Pacific Northwest doesn't stop with these delay problems, because the rain and snow just continues to kick as that atmospheric river just continues. So that will be a problem spot as we go into the weekend as well.

So that is all the good news. The bad news is, and the CDC does call this concerning, is that with this severe case where this patient was hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu, it appears that the virus mutated within the patient to acquire the ability to potentially be able to infect human cells in the upper respiratory tract better. One of the things about this bird flu virus is that it isn't very good at infecting humans. We haven't seen person to person transmission, and that's because it doesn't infect the cells that we have in our upper respiratory tract. We have seen these mutations in another severe case of bird flu and a teenager in British, Columbia, Canada, very similar situation. It appears that while they were hospitalized, the virus mutated. Again, they didn't spread it to anyone else, either. So, this does raise a level of concern, you don't want to see these mutations happening, but because it has not spread to anybody else, the CDC is still saying the general risk to people, is currently low. We've had about 65 cases reported here in the United States of bird flu. Most of those have been acquired from either dairy cattle or from poultry flocks, from workers in those agricultural settings. And there are a couple cases this one in particular, they caught it from a backyard flock. Others where we don't actually know where they got it, but so far, we're not seeing this person to person spread, which would really raise the threat level, Max.",

One Trump Adviser told me his interpretation of what Donald Trump has been saying this week is really that he wants to force foreign leaders to the negotiating table to bolster United States trade, but also to try and curb both Russia and China's larger influence over the global region. Now, as it relates to Panama, specifically, Donald Trump believes that Panama, and as it relates to Panama Canal specifically, is taking advantage of the United States and its companies. He really is pushing for a new agreement that would lower the price that different American vessels pay for passage throughout the Panama Canal. He also believes that many Chinese companies are controlling the ports around the Panama Canal, essentially giving them more control over which ships can pass through, and again, what the prices are for other countries. Now, as it relates to Greenland, I'm told that Donald Trump's kind of fixation on that has been about trying to curb Russia's influence in the Arctic region. And that's part of why he's continued to say that he wants to buy Greenland, even though we know that its prime minister, who controls the Danish territory, has said that Greenland is not for sale, just like it wasn't for sale, back in 2019 when he first floated this idea of trying to purchase the country. Now, all to say this is what one of the Trump advisers told me. They said, quote, everything has to be looked at in terms of curbing Russia and China influence, while also protecting the economy. Now, to be clear as well, to go back to go back to the Panama Canal here, and what Donald Trump has been saying. Donald Trump has actually been fixated on this for several months now, I'm told. And I would actually point to an August interview he did with Tucker Carlson on X where he brought this up. He said that he believed that the Former President, Jimmy Carter, who negotiated this treaty to give Panama control over the canal, despite it being U.S. made, was a stupid idea.
