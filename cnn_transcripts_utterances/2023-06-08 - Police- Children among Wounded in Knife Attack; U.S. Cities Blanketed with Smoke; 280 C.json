The ages of the four children who've been critically wounded in that stabbing attack are 22 months to two year olds Becky and a three year old. And what the video the amateur videos that emerged from that scene this morning suggest is that this man very deliberately walked through this park attacking with his knife as many children as he could. In fact, you can see him on the images, very deliberately pushing the adults away. It was the children he was seeking very methodically as he went through that park extremely shocking scenes again Becky in a country where you simply don't see these sorts of attacks targeting children very often. We wait to hear more about the fate of the children. We understand that several of the victims and today's attacks are now between life and death. And much more of course, we await to learn about precisely what motivated this man is Syrian refugee he had sought asylum in Sweden, 2013, come to France and sought asylum here had it rejected, Becky, on account of his already having it in another European country. What is emerging from the French press, which is as you can imagine following this story very closely, as rare as this kind of incident in this country. It is a picture of a man who is in fact a Christian Syrian and who used that, as part of his asylum claim when he came to Europe. What precisely he was hoping to achieve as he set out with his knife in the park next to D'Annecy Lake, we have yet to better understand but a clearer image emerging of precisely what went on about 9:45 am in France. It's a really hot day people went out in the park and a lot of people are being referred to as victims who were not just wounded with the knife, Becky but who happened to be in the park watching what a particularly gruesome attack, Becky.",

But I think at the same time, there's no doubt that these are two very politically different men. They're obviously very different generations, Sunak 43, President Biden at 80. I think, from a White House perspective, from an American perspective, they do view Sunak as this voice of stability in Downing Street after that tumultuous, you know, a couple of months over the summer, when the Brits are going through Prime Minister's every, you know, month or so. They do view that as you know, a welcome partner in Downing Street, this level of pragmatism that you are seeing. But at the same time, this is not you know, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, this is not even President Obama and David Cameron. These are two men who are still getting to know each other in some regards. Certainly President Biden has been very eager to partner with Rishi Sunak on Ukraine, and that is at the top of their agenda today. But you know Sunak is coming into this meeting with some pretty major economic initiatives that he wants to discuss. There is not talk at this moment of reestablishing negotiations on a trade deal. But he is certainly interested in bolstering American investment in the United Kingdom. And as you mentioned, he just wants to talk about artificial intelligence. He is proposing this idea of a summit in the fall of world leaders really trying to raise Britain's profile in that regard, as they try and look for ways to regulate develop this emerging technology. And so, those will be among the items that they're discussing. But really, this is the most formal of their meetings that they've had so far. It's taken a while for President Biden to invite him here to the White House. He is staying across the street at Blair House. And you know I was talking to a senior British official this week. They did sort of make the point that President Biden doesn't often hold press conferences with his foreign visitors and they will hold a press conference later today.

And it quickly became clear to the Biden Administration if that wasn't possible. But it really did set the tone for this relationship, particularly in the wake of the very warm relationship that the kingdom had with the Trump Administration. So that is the overarching theme of this trip that Secretary Blinken was trying to get this strange relationship back to a much more positive place. Of course, there were individual things that the U.S. has said they were trying to accomplish on this trip, a meeting with GCC ministers talk about the D-ISIS campaign have bilateral meetings, including that meeting that Blinken had with the Crown Prince. And certainly one of the top agenda items for the United States was to try to make progress on the normalization of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Of course, Israel has normalized their relationship with four different Arab countries.

So we went back in, it's not hard to find and you see why there are no Jaguars left in this 2 million acre territory.
