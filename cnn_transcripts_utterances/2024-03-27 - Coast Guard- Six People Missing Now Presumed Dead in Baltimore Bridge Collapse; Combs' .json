Prepare crews were working overnight fixing potholes on the bridge when it came crashing down around 1.30 a.m. local time, hit by a massive cargo container which had lost power. Eight workers fell to the freezing water below. Two were rescued, one unhurt, the second in a serious condition. The other six now presumed dead. Before the collision, the ship's lights were flickering on and off. It was billowing black smoke. Maritime officials say the ship's pilot did everything possible to avoid a collision, including dropping anchor.A Mayday call from the ship before the accident gave authorities enough time to stop traffic from crossing the bridge. It was not enough time, though, for the construction workers to make it to safety. The Coast Guard says conditions in the water are just too dangerous for divers, but a search for bodies will resume in the coming hours. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Security video shows minutes before the impact, the lights on board the dolly shut off twice. Then the bow swung right. Briefed by the Coast Guard, Maryland Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger says the crew experienced power issues and a loss of propulsion with alarms on the bridge blaring. GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD): The preliminary investigation points to an accident. We haven't seen any credible evidence of a terrorist attack. MUNTEAN (voiceover): Key to investigators will be the ship's black box mandated by international law. A voyage data recorder captures parameters like heading, speed, and water depth as well as the condition of the engines, thrusters and rudder. The recorder also captures crew conversations on the bridge, key to investigators probing what caused the crew to apparently lose control. JENNIFER HOMENDY, U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD CHAIR: It will be critical. It's a critical piece of our investigation, which is why we have a recorder's team here. MUNTEAN (voiceover): The latest data shows the dolly was traveling at a speed of eight knots, roughly nine miles per hour, fast enough to trigger a disaster that could have been much worse.

With access by road into Gaza severely limited by the Israeli military, many countries have resorted to airdrops as the only way to get aid into the territory. The U.S. confirms the parachute malfunctioned during its most recent airdrop and adds the packages were dropped over the water deliberately to try and avoid injuries on land. More details now from CNN's Jomana Karadsheh. But a warning, her report contains graphic images.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT(voiceover): As they spot a plane and the aid it begins to drop, they run as fast as they can. It's the rush of a people so desperate, so hungry, who would do anything to feed their children, now on the brink of starvation. This is what survival in Gaza has come to, fighting for food. That little bit of aid that makes it into the north, where manmade famine now looms. People chase parachutes that fell into these choppy waters. It is desperation that drives them into the sea. What you're about to see next is disturbing. It's the reality of a war growing more cruel by the day. The fastest, the fittest emerged with boxes of American issued and ready to eat. Others didn't make it out alive. People gathered around the thin, frail body of a man who drowned trying to reach that aid. Twelve people drowned, according to paramedics. The parachutes fell into the water, Abu Hamad says, but people went to eat. They went into the water and drowned. The current was so strong, they didn't know how to swim. It's what you do when you have nothing left to lose. A man goes in swimming to get food for his children. He returns dead, this man says. Bring us aid through the land crossings. Our children are dying. We are dying. What are you doing? Where is the world? The world has been piling up life-saving aid into trucks stuck at land crossings, seemingly powerless in the face of Israel that's accused of using starvation as a weapon in this war, a charge it denies. Forcing the international community to resort to dropping aid from the sky. Several countries carried out aid drops on this day, deliveries that have been criticized for being ineffective, insufficient and unsafe. Earlier this month, another airdrop disaster when a parachute failed and eight packages came crashing down, killing at least five people. It's a war that's testing humanity.

And that's one of the big questions that the investigators are going to be looking at right now as they interview the crew and study the ship's logs and information.Now, I'm coming to you from a boat approaching Victoria Harbour off the coast of Hong Kong next to a container ship. This is managed by a different company, but it's to help give our viewers a sense of the scale of these enormous cargo ships. The Dali, which slammed into that bridge in Baltimore, was constructed in 2015. It was about 300 meters long. Now, I don't know the length of this particular ship, but it does give you this -- a bit of the sense of the size and the scale of these monster vessels. The Dali could carry up to 10,000 containers like that. The ones that you see stacked up there, up to 4 and 5 containers high on that ship. At the time of the collision, the Dali had about 4,600 -- 4,679 containers like that on board. And industry insiders and our ship is -- our boat is being pitched back and forth, as you can see by the wake from this enormous vessel. So try to imagine a ship of the size of the Dali slamming into a bridge. Now, it was owned and managed by a company called Synergy, relatively new in the industry, an insider tells me from Singapore, which manages hundreds of other vessels. But there are a whole host of different kinds of companies that were chartering the ship that actually own the ship. And then Synergy, which managed it. There is a lot of regulation and inspection of the types of ships that take place, and the Dali is no exception to that. So as recently as, I believe, September, the Dali was respected by the U.S. Coast Guard and given a clean bill of health. Yes, that's right. September 9. That was in -- in U.S. waters. And then it was also inspected in June of 2023, where it had a deficiency. This is at a port in Chile, in San Antonio, Chile, where there was a deficiency for propulsion and auxiliary machine gauges and thermometers. That's going to be a big question. That's within the last year. Could whatever have been seen to have been going wrong then have contributed to the apparent loss of power and the fact that the crew had to use anchors to try to slow the ship before it ultimately collided into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore? A final factor is that there are 22 Indian crew members on board. Now, imagine a ship of this size with only less than two dozen crew members on board. And that's how a lot of these container cargo ships are operating around the world right now. All of them are believed to be healthy right now. Back to you, John.",
