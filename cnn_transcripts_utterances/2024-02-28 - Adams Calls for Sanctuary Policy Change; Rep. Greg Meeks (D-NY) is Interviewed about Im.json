      "sentences": "Good morning, John.Well, some of the details. The context is growing concerns about public safety and immigration at top of mind for a lot of voters, and certainly a lot of Democratic mayors of big cities who have been dealing with this crisis of a huge influx of migrants since about the spring of 2022. And so now Mayor Adams, who has been calling the migrant influx into New York City a crisis for more than a year. The city is now sheltering some 65,000 migrants in shelters. Many, many more have already been through this system. But now he's responding to growing concerns about crimes where migrants have been accused, for instance, a high-profile shooting in Times Square were a tourist was hit and a 15-year-old Venezuelan migrant is accused of that crime. So, this is why he's publicly now endorsing, for the first time, a shift in the city's sanctuary policy that could mean more cooperation. So, for instance, someone who is accused of a crime could be handed over to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials, otherwise known as ICE. Here's what he had to say about this at a press conference yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: I don't believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city. There's some people that feels that they should be able to remain here, keep doing the actions, until they eventually convicted. I don't subscribe to that theory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, you heard that language there. That language, until they're eventually convicted. That's one of the things that's causing concerns among immigration advocates and also just general people who are concerned about civil rights because of the lack of due process there. He said at a town hall just the day earlier on Monday, Mayor Adams said, the overwhelming number of migrants are coming to the city. They want to work. They're law abiding. But he said, \"we need to modify the sanctuary city law that if you commit a felony, a violent act, we should be able to turn you over to ICE and have you deported.\" But, again, the concern is that only being accused, not convicted of a crime, is going to lead to a lot of trouble in the community of migrants.And I should note that this is -- you know, he's also tried to respond to this problem that Democrats have been facing, both in Congress, in big cities, as I mentioned, and, of course, the Biden White House, because immigration is so important to so many voters. We've seen that in recent special elections and we know that for President Biden it is the issue upon which he scores the lowest when it comes to approval ratings. So, this is probably another headache for them. But we should mention that Mayor Adams has not specifically outlined exactly what changes he wants to make and he'll need the cooperation from a majority of New York City council to make any changes. It doesn't look like he's likely to get that anytime soon. But still very interesting to hear him speak this way. John.",

Now, there are two interesting concessions that Republicans made to Hunter Biden and his attorneys in order to make this appearance possible. This will not be videotaped, and the transcript will be released to both parties simultaneously and we expect it to be released pretty quickly. While these concessions were meant to allay concerns from Hunter Biden and his lawyers that GOP lawmakers could selectively leak portions of his testimony.

And it's also interesting that this study seemed to point out data that's especially important for people who might have a history of heart attack and stroke and they use cannabis.

The visit to this hospital apparently lasted less than an hour and then he returned to the Vatican. Now, this morning, he did attend a meeting with Armenian bishops, followed by a general audience, where he spoke briefly and said, I have a slight cold and I'm going to let my colleague deliver him my address for me. And what we've seen is that of late he does seem to be under the weather. On Saturday, all his public appearances were canceled. Then on Sunday, he did hold the usual Angelus prayer from the apostolic apartments overlooking St. Peter's Square. But then on Monday, once again, the Vatican announced that all his appointments, or rather audiences, had been canceled because of flu-like symptoms. But then again today, he did appear and it doesn't appear that he's going to - he's canceling anything for the rest of the week. In fact, after the news came out that the pope had gone for this brief visit to the hospital for these tests, it was announced that on Saturday he will be meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. However, there are persistent concerns about his health, keeping in mind, of course, that back in March he under -- he went to hospital because of a lung inflammation.
