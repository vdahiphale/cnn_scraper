So I believe that they're very close. But I think what people need to remember is -- and this was alluded to in the previous interview or the previous reporter said -- he's got to be -- Walt has to be feeling trapped even a little bit right now. It is very expensive to have to hire attorneys to fight, of course, the justice system but also to fight Donald Trump. He's famous for keeping people up in litigation. I have been subject to it and it's terrifying. If you don't have the finances to do it, you're going to take any free lawyer you can get. Another thing I will say, is to leave that circle has got to be scary right now, too. Because it's all-hands-on-deck and the wagons are circling.",

So I hope that Walt Nauta is getting sound advice from his loved ones around him to hire a lawyer that is looking out for his best interests rather than Trump's best interests. And that's typically what happens when you have a Trump-paid lawyer. For example, you look at Cassidy Hutchinson, one of the key witnesses in the January 6th committee.

Think about when we were looking at, you know, information about China at Mar-a-Lago and South Korea and North Korea. I mean, he talks about it all the time. Why didn't he give them back? It's because he thinks those are his. He's like a child holding onto his little toy train and nobody is going to take it from him. My reaction is I'm very upset, especially when I saw those pictures.

      "sentences": "Let's talk about this with our panel.First of all, let me just say, like I am glad and grateful that we have insights from people like Sarah and Stephanie and also Alyssa Farah. They really do open a window into a bizarre world. DANA BASH, CNN HOST &amp; CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: They do, but it's also very telling that there are people like the three you mentioned and many, many more who are willing and, in some cases, eager to talk about that bizarre world. Because, according to the way they talk about it, it was and is very, very bizarre. And the fact that people have cycled through Trump world, particularly as he has become a politician and then president, speaks to the one- way street that we just heard about that Stephanie was talking about when it comes to loyalty. Which does sort of put into question what is going to happen with Walt Nauta. He is very much in legal jeopardy. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I think they were discussing something that's really important when it comes to Trump. Leaving Trump's inter circle is an extremely difficult thing to do. It's financially taxing. It is isolating to people who are forced into that position. Walt Nauta is facing that. We don't know what's going through his mind. But the example of Cassidy Hutchinson, I think, is really instructive in a number of ways. It wasn't just that she wanted to not be led into legal peril by wanting her own lawyer. But she had to be brought out of that situation, in part, by -- by Liz Cheney, who basically took her under her wing in some ways and helped make that possible for her. We can't, I think, discount, just on a human level, how difficult it is for people to stray from Trumpism. It's hard to see a world outside of it. I think a lot of people around Trump don't want to be necessarily considered Never Trumpers. And so, if you are a Walt Nauta and you're facing real serious legal peril, your choices are stay in Trump world or exit to a very uncertain, and I think for most people, very scary future. That's going to be a factor in this as we go along in this legal case. JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: But I think it's critical as Trump plays victim -- which is the playbook he always uses --, listen to the people who have had eyes on him. Sarah and Stephanie, right there who worked with him, read the indictment, text messages from people who worked with him, the notes from the lawyer who worked with him. His own voice captured on an audiotape, which CNN's great reporters obtained the transcript of, go back to the January 6th hearings, Trump throws up all this smoke that everybody is out to get him. But if you read the words of the people, some who have left him, like Sarah and Stephanie have, who have decided they have had enough, and others who are loyal to him and get interviewed under oath in these investigations. That is where you get the most damning accounts of Donald Trump and his behavior and the cavalier treatment of discussions and government. And one other quick point, his statements today, this is another moment of choosing, not just for Donald Trump -- he is making history right now, sad history -- but for Republicans again. Because he has taken a chisel at times, a jackhammer at other times to the institutions of our government. Jake, what he said about the prosecutor here, he is a thug, that he is a Trump hater, as well as his friends and family.",

Instead, he's said, I'm charging this in a red state on your turf, Donald Trump.

On that, what we just heard from another Trump attorney, Alina Habba, who is not handling the case, but she was the attorney who came out and spoke with the media.We were listening to her comments a few moments ago there when Jake was playing it. And she said that they don't love America, those who are prosecuting Trump in this case. You kind of had a visceral reaction to that. You're a Republican, a former Republican who has been in this courthouse many time, and prosecuted many cases. Do comments like that help when there are concerns about the safety of the prosecutors even when you disagree with them?",

You can be political, but to be -- what Trump said is outrageous.And there is an adage that, if the law is against you, argue the fact, and if the facts are against you, argue the law, and if both the fact and the law is against you, argue the prosecutor. And this is Trump on steroids. And Jack Smith has been a consummate professional. The federal government talks in court. And so I think that it is appropriate, when you bring in an indictment, to make a brief statement. I did it many times as a U.S. attorney, you talk about the charges. But it is incredibly important to explain to the American people why classified information matters. The disregard and complete disrespect for classified information and the rule of law set forth in this indictment is astonishing.",

We are learning that with exclusive information that the hearing has started, the former president is under arrest, and he before Judge Goodman. He is going to utter the words and plead not guilty.And, Paula, one person we're learning is also in the room, is also Jay Bratt, who is the head-who was actually one of the attorneys. He went down to Mar-a-Lago on June 3rd to collect those classified documents from Evan Corcoran, the Trump attorney who went through the boxes, not knowing that Walt Nauta had moved some of them. And he was also on hand the day they executed the search warrant. He is an incredibly significant presence on this special counsel's team.",

There were questions about whether he could join the special counsel's office. He did. Again, he has been a consistent investigator in this case. Arguably, the top prosecutor before Jack Smith came in. And there is no love lost between Jay Bratt and the former president's legal team. They have publicly attacked him, levied accusations against him. But it's likely that he will be leading most of the case. And this is, for the defense attorney, a full-time job and occupation for him. He's a very experienced prosecutor. And particularly in the national security matters. He has been in this case throughout the entire thing. And it is great to have that continuity, because Jack Smith was just appointed in November after former President Trump announced that he would make another run for the White House. So it is significant to be seeing Jack Smith, but Jay Bratt will be taking the helm, and expects more attacks from the Trump team.",
