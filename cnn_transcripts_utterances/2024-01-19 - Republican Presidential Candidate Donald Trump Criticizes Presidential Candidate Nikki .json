It doesn't mean that all of them are going to support Nikki Haley, but her team feels pretty good about drawing them in and having them support her here in the primary in just a few days. The other thing she's doing is tying former President Trump and Joe Biden into the same bucket, talking about the Trump-Biden nightmare, asking why voters would want two people running for president in their 80s. And then as Trump has been cranking up his attacks on Haley, she's been going back at him. She's been defending herself, she defended herself against his racist dog whistles earlier this week, saying that, in her view, that just shows that he is threatened by her. And when he said last night that she has no shot, that she doesn't have MAGA supporters, here's what she told Jake Tapper during that CNN town hall.

Whether it's the Chips Act, elements of the infrastructure act, the Inflation Reduction Act. Does that concern you?

Joe Biden basically said if you elect me, I'm going to bring people together. And when we do things together, we can do big things. And he actually put the ball in the hoop in four of the biggest pieces of legislation that we have seen in the last 50 years in an effort to rebuild America, to invest in America, to invest in the American people, to create jobs, to create economic growth, and to give people, as he likes to say, a little breathing room.And in fact, as of today, we have 40,000 projects, seeds that have been planted all over this country rebuilding the roads and bridges, the airports, the ports. He was in North Carolina yesterday talking about the importance of making sure that everybody has access to high- speed Internet, not only in the cities but in rural areas where it's critically important as well, making sure that we have clean air and clean water, getting rid of water in lead pipes, and then building a clean energy economy. And so this president, it speaks a lot to his character that he's willing to do a deep dive investment that not only is going to have short term benefit, which we'll talk about in a second, but also the long term benefit. I'm fairly confident by the time this campaign is over, American citizens will be fully informed of the incredible work that he's done and the benefit that they have to them. And as the president announced just a minute ago, just as one metric for the people of America, since he's been president, over 14 million jobs have been created. And since we're likely to be running against Donald Trump, it's worth noting that Donald Trump lost. He's the only president since Herbert Hoover that lost jobs. And it's minus 2.5 million. So when people ask, who is putting people back to work, who is really getting the benefit? Joe Biden is fighting for working men and women every day, and he's succeeding.",

As a matter of fact, as he sent me across the country, he made sure, unlike Donald Trump, that this money got spent everywhere, not just for people that voted for him.But it is true that there is a philosophy coursing across the country that we have to call something -- Trumpism, call it the far right of the party, a theory of governing that causes chaos. And that is what we're trying to point out. I think the president has profound respect for every human being. He doesn't call people vermin. He doesn't say that people poison other people's blood. But we do have to call out this extreme rightwing agenda that has threatened democracy in this country. We'll figure out what to call it in a respectful way, but you can't hide from the fact that it's damaging who we are as a country and who we promised each other in America we'll be. And the president of the United States, Joseph Robinette Biden, is going to remind people of that. That's the reason why he ran, and that's why he's running again.

From what you read on that, do you believe that laying it out in such stark terms will prevent parents from ever having to do that again and facing so many obstacles? MATA-RUBIO:  Absolutely, that's what this report is for. It is to serve as a warning to other communities and to prepare law enforcement agencies around this country. But it is a very reactive approach, and I'm disappointed in the federal government for not taking action sooner and for not taking action after Uvalde so that we don't have to rely on something like this.",

MATA-RUBIO:  There are several individuals named that are running for re-election this year and I hope voters take note of that.",
