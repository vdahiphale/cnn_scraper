Now, this is a forceful response by President Biden to the death of Alexei Navalny and, again, ahead of that two-year mark of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.And this fresh slate of sanctions is on over 500 targets. That includes on the military-industrial complex, as well as companies that are helping Russia access certain goods, the idea here being slowing down Russia's ability to get certain goods and also their ability to build weapons. Now, as you heard there earlier, President Biden teased these sanctions yesterday after his meeting with the widow of Alexei Navalny and his daughter while in California in a fundraising swing this morning. The president releasing a statement saying the following, quote, these sanctions will target individuals connected to Navalny's imprisonment, as well as Russia's financial sector, defense and industrial base, procurement networks and sanction evaders across multiple continents. They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home. Now, U.S. officials had already been working on a sanctions package ahead of the two-year mark of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They supplemented that after the death of Alexei Navalny. But all the same, while U.S. officials are citing this as a consequence to Russia, they're also continuing the steady drumbeat and the pressure on Congress to pass the $60 billion to Ukraine. Without that, they said this is only one tool in the toolbox. They still need Ukraine to get those funds, so they still have a chance in this war against Russia.",

But that certainly seems like a lofty goal right now because recent polls have shown her behind former President Trump in this state by 30 or 35 points.One thing I do want to note is that at many of her events, I have talked to voters who are supporting her, who have recently moved to South Carolina. They're from places like Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Jersey. And that is a portion of the electorate here that her campaign is hoping will compel her, will boost her in the polls. We'll just have to watch and see how that plays out.

And I'll throw in three, which is their complete failure to communicate clearly during the crisis. It was -- if you went to their website, at some point, they put up a banner saying, we're experiencing technical difficulties. If you went to their Twitter site, it was all kinds of videos about ways to have fun with your phone.

Ordinarily, when you get arrested on a case like this, you have to bring the defendant to the closest judge, or in this case, magistrate, which is a sort of lower level federal judge. That's what they did. They brought this defendant to a magistrate in Nevada. Prosecutor said, you have to lock him up pending trial. He's too much of a flight risk. And the magistrate disagreed, said, I'm going to release him with conditions, but I'm okay releasing him, take his passports, put him on electronic monitoring. Ordinarily, the next step then, as a prosecutor, is you wait for the person to arrive at their assigned district judge, in this case in California. That usually takes a week or so. Prosecutors were not willing to wait that long. Instead, they went to the judge. They said, we need a new warrant. They re-arrested him on the same charge. And now he's in custody.
