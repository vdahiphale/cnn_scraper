First, and this is new, breaking this morning, the father of a student, a U.S. student, who's been missing in France for the past two weeks tells CNN, just a short time ago, that his son, Kenny DeLand, Jr., is alive and that he's spoken to him. We are following the developments of this story very closely. What happened here? We're going to be live in France in just a moment. Also this morning, the situation growing more complicated at the U.S. southern border. Overnight, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Biden administration's bid to end the so-called remain in Mexico program. This in addition to the scheduled end next week of Title 42. It's causing border towns to brace for a crush of migrants this weekend. CNN will be live once again at the border. Plus, another development in the last 24 hours. Twitter has suspended the accounts of several high-profile journalists from the nation's top news organizations, including this one. Accounts that have covered Elon Musk aggressively in recent weeks. Those accounts now suspended. Why? First, we begin at the southern border. CNN's Ed Lavandera in downtown El Paso. I wonder, Ed, what kind of preparations you're seeing there.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, once again, dozens of migrants sleeping on the streets because the shelters here in this city simply overwhelmed. You can see many of the migrants just buried under blankets because the temperatures here have been so painfully frigid at night, into the low 30s over the course of the last week.And, you know, there are a bunch of different reasons for why this is happening. Shelter space is very limited, but there are also a number of migrants who are traveling in family groups and they get released at different points. So, these areas around bus stations have been kind of like the central gathering points and they don't want to stray too far away from that so that they can be reunited as quickly as possible. But it is causing a great deal of concern here, Jim, because the mayor of El Paso is now saying that if Title 42 is lifted next Wednesday, December 21st, that's the date that everybody is looking toward, that right now the number of migrants that have been coming into El Paso is about 2,500 per day, the mayor here fears that that number could reach 5,000 people per day, which would be a very difficult situation to handle. Of course, many of these migrants not necessarily staying here in the El Paso area. It's a transportation logistical issue. You know, they're waiting for buses or flights to reach family members or sponsors in other parts of the country. We've talked to migrants who are traveling to Nevada, all the way to Connecticut. You know, so there's a wide array of places where many of these people are going. But it does take some time and shelter -- people who have been running the shelters say that there are more people coming in than they can get moved out. So that becomes kind of the logistical nightmare that cities along the border could very well be facing next week. Jim.",

It's not -- it's not something that is foreign to them. This has happened before. They've seen it before. You know, perhaps this is a little bit different. But the overall sense that you get from talking to people around these communities is that they've seen this before. It's something they're very much used to.

He wasn't sleeping with no news. You can only imagine how he felt when the news came through, finally the good news.Now, since then he's confirmed to us that he has spoken to his son, although we still don't have an explanation, Jim, as to where he was or why contact was severed to begin with. We do know that he had been seen on the 3rd of December sort of an hour to the south of where he had been studying, and then nothing at all until this morning. We've reached out to the prosecutor here in France who opened that missing person's investigation, who's confirmed that Kenny DeLand Jr. has been found and that he's in Spain. So, he crossed that border. We don't know why. We don't know the circumstances. A good news story this Friday morning, Jim, but with a lot of questions still unanswered.",

You've already started to see a lot of conservatives urging Mitch McConnell to block this larger package in the Senate where they have ten votes, the Democrats are going to need to move this across the finish line. Of course, we also have rank and file Republicans in the Senate, like Senator Lindsey Graham, who is going to support this larger package, telling reporters yesterday that, you know, House Republicans can't even pick a speaker, how are they going to fund the government next year when they get back into office and have power in the House of Representatives. So, it gives you a little sense of the dynamic at play here. At the end of the day, we will have not seen any top line for this larger omnibus package. We also haven't seen any details about what this package is going to include. But aides on both sides of the aisle still very confident that they're going to get there.
