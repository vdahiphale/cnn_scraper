Hello and welcome to \"Connect the World\", I'm Becky Anderson. We have extensive coverage this hour and next on the crisis inside Gaza. And that is where we begin in the Gaza Strip where hospitals already collapsing and our daily targets on the frontlines of the Israel-Hamas war. This video which I warn you, is graphic shows bodies wrapped in the yard of Gaza's largest hospital Al-Shifa with nowhere to bury them. Conditions at that hospital are catastrophic according to its Director and its Gaza's second largest outputs where operations ceased days ago under Israeli bombardment. The Israeli military says it returned fire at the hospital entrance on Monday killing Hamas fighters. While the IDF sent journalists this highly edited video showing what it says is a man carrying a rocket propelled grenade launcher at the entrance of that hospital, saying after the terrorists fired they returned to hide in the hospital. The Palestine Red Crescent says no armed individuals were inside. The Israeli Prime Minister has doubled down on the fight against Hamas saying Israel will see the war to the end. But Gaza's hospitals are being decimated in the process. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has a closer look and a warning his report does contain graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gaza's largest hospital collapsing under the weight of war. Doctors at Al-Shifa Hospital scrambling to keep patients alive amid power outages and severe shortages, including these premature babies wrapped in foil and blankets in a desperate attempt to keep them alive out of their incubators. In the hospital's yard dozens of dead bodies slowly decay unable to be buried. The hospital's complex has been struck repeatedly amid nearby fighting with Hamas militants. Israeli military now closing in, accusing Hamas of operating an underground command and control center beneath the sprawling multi block medical facility.",

      "sentences": "Well look as Jeremy outlined, Becky, the situation is dire, doctors on the ground are describing the situation ascatastrophic and as we have learned today, from officials. There is only one remaining Hospital in Northern Gaza out of around 30 hospitals in that region, which is now able to accommodate more patients is actually able to function as a hospital at this point. This hospital Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital already accommodated with some 500 patients. But according to officials on the ground, other hospitals in Northern Gaza simply are unable to provide that urgent care that is so desperately needed. We've been hearing from officials for the last couple of days for the last week from the Al-Shifa Hospital Gaza's largest hospital from the Al-Quds Hospital, as well as officials at the Al-Rantisi Hospital describing the situation as deteriorating by the -- . We know that Al-Shifa they have had to close down their operating theatres. We know that babies, premature babies have been taken out of neonatal units out of their incubators because they have run out of oxygen supplies. The vast majority of Gaza's hospitals are running out of power in order to keep their generators going because of that siege on fuel that ongoing siege and fuel getting into Gaza. But it isn't just the medical supplies where they are facing shortages, but it's the situation around the hospitals as well. We are seeing ongoing bombardment on the vicinity of his hospital complexes, particularly around the Al-Shifa Hospital, as you heard there in Jeremy's reporting the IDF. The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas around these complexes. They claim that there is a Hamas command and control center beneath Al- Shifa. This has been echoed by U.S. officials, but important to note that this has also been denied by both Hamas and doctors on the ground as well as health officials on the ground. We've been speaking to international humanitarian workers who have worked for Al-Shifa for decades who tell us they've never seen any indication of a Hamas presence at the hospital. And there is widespread concern that as Israel continues to intensify, its bombarding of what is said to be Hamas targets. We are seeing more and more civilians being caught up in this war losing their lives and hospitals unable to provide the care that is so desperately needed by many of them. Now, the Israeli government has said it has established corridors for evacuation, particularly from the Al-Shifa Hospital. They say there is a safe corridor on the eastern side of the hospital. But we've heard from doctors on the ground, including medical staff and doctors without borders who have described the situation they faced as impossible to evacuate both staff civilians, as well as of course, patients. Many of these patients need specialized medical evacuations. They can't do the long walk from Northern Gaza to Southern Gaza, including the elderly, including those who require constant medical care and of course, newborn babies, premature babies requiring incubators. And they haven't yet received guarantees of a safe medical evacuation. And of course, when it comes to evacuating from Northern Gaza to Southern Gaza, there is still no guarantee of safety in Southern Gaza. We are still seeing airstrikes in Southern Gaza just overnight, further airstrikes in Khan Younis hospitals that are also overwhelmed. And the fear is that while we are hearing these calls for citizens, civilians to evacuate while the idea claims that this is the safe alternative for civilians, there is nowhere safe for the civilians to turn.",

And there have been calls for China to take the movement of these different products more seriously. In fact, it was just a few weeks ago, that a delegation of U.S. lawmakers a bipartisan delegation, including Chuck Schumer, the most Senior Ranking Member of this delegation came here and actually had a face to face meeting with Xi Jinping and I talked to those lawmakers right after. And they brought up two points. One, they felt that the time spent with President Xi was much longer than they had expected. So that was noteworthy. And two, they told personal stories about the addictiveness of fentanyl, with people in their own districts and he paid attention to that too. This is an area where I think there has always been seen as perhaps some kind of middle ground or an agreement point on. So that is not necessarily surprising. But you know this is certainly an opportune backdrop to present this kind of agreement. Real quickly, I do want to mention about other points that could come up in this conversation. And not all that different from what Arlette said, even though we are on other sides of the globe. When it comes to these military issues and the need for conversation, this will likely be a chance for President Xi to make it very clear to President Biden that Taiwan and his view is there's. He's aware of some of these military flights over the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. He's going to set the lines but again, does not want any kind of surprise to cause this relationship to escalate out of control.",
