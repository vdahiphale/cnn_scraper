It has been a non-stop 72 hour roller coaster of emotions from the moment the match began and Argentina took the lead in the first alpha then France clinging in reopening the match. And then of course, penalties, which means the roller coaster in itself. And then from that moment, it was just a wild party going on. I think the sales of our calls have skyrocketed over these, this weekend here in Buenos Aires, at least from what we see from our vantage point nine floor above the avenue.

Of course now there is also as with many of these events, it's so, so big, so crowded that the question of will the selection actually the national team actually be able to drive through these ocean of people.

But then when that game turned and France tied in, I've talked about this with many people. From the moment that Mbappe knocked in that penalty kick to make it 2-1, for the next 90 minutes is arguably the most exciting 90 minutes in sports history. From when France tied it then to extra time, then to penalty kicks, it was just incredible. And they say you know championships are so much sweeter when you have to suffer to get there. And those Argentina fans had to suffer through that game because they thought they had it they thought they blew it. They thought they had it they thought they blew it multiple times. And so that's why these people are so happy out there. And you remember this was a first winter World Cup it was in Qatar, they had to have it in the winter because it's still so hot there, even in the winter.

He moved to Ukraine and got married before the war. Now part of a Russian volunteer corps is protecting Snake Island for Ukraine. RIPLEY (on camera): How do you feel about Russia now? RIPLEY (voice over): For us they're enemies no matter what, most of the Russian volunteer corps lived in Ukraine before the invasion, he says. We were living life had families good jobs. And here comes Russia attacking us. If some other country attacked us we would fight too. Life on Snake Island means almost total isolation. Soldiers tell me the simple act of switching on a cell phone brings Russian rockets within 40 minutes. They say Russia attacked the island just last month. RIPLEY (on camera): We are now out of time we've been on the island just about an hour and it's important that we get off before the waves get too big and before the Russians know we're here. RIPLEY (voice over): The Ukrainians say Russia blew up Snake Island historic lighthouse and museum on the site of an ancient Greek temple. Evil spirits are rumored to roam these 46 acres of rock and sand bearing witness to centuries of bloodshed. Ukraine is not the first nation to control Snake Island, but vows it will be the last.

Of course, the European Union has taken a firm stance on Iran's crackdown on those protesters in the past and has placed sanctions on Iran. And it is still demanding that the Iranian regime, of course, eases its crackdown on protesters and brings a total end to the violence that we're seeing in Iran. But of course, as you laid out there, the focus was also on the nuclear deal and on efforts to salvage that deal. We heard from Iran's foreign minister speaking during that conference, he thanked EU's Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell for what he described as his constructive role in those negotiations and said that Iran is open to a revival of the deal, providing that the government's so-called red lines are observed. Borrell for his part acknowledged that relations between the European Union and Iran have become particularly strained in the wake of Iran's crackdown on those protesters. But did say the two officials agreed on the importance of keeping those channels of communication open and on focusing on a revival of the nuclear deal based on those Vienna negotiations. Because we do know that just yesterday, Iran welcomed a delegation of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency for talks. They're focused not only on the current state of those negotiations, but also on future cooperation, where those talks have really stalled in the wake of that crackdown. And those protests are still very much ongoing. More than three months on the crackdown, I have to say is growing more violent. By the day, we've already seen protesters now executed by the regime. And despite that crackdown, despite the rising death toll, protesters are still taken to the streets every single day. And in fact, today marks the second day of what is said to be three days of strike action in the northwestern Kurdish region by shop owners and market workers eerily quiet street scene and video merging on social media of people taking part in that strike action. And what is perhaps more significant is the fact that we've also seen oil workers now going on strike. They've threatened that they could see further strike action if the regime doesn't respond to their demands when it comes to pay and working conditions but of course, is one of the key pillars of Iran's economy. This is a significant development. But as far as the international community goes, there is still growing pressure on the Iranian regime to end its crack down and bring an end to the violence that we're seeing against those peaceful protesters.",

These Argentineans know that the country is notdoing well, it's in deep negotiations with the International Monetary Fund or their repayment of a debt that was negotiated a few years ago and probably the upcoming Monza of the summer. Here we're in the middle of the summer, but they're coming full season, which is the month of January, February and March, it will be tough for most of these people. Right now the inflation is at over 90 percent annual rates. So that means the prices keep growing and growing. The salaries of course, are not being adjusted at that rate. And so these people are facing a hard time but for today, and for the last two days because this is truly a three day party.

I'm sure those fans wouldn't mind spending all day out there if they could to just soak up as much as this moment as they can because as we mentioned before, you know Argentina has not won a World Cup since 1986, so many of these people experiencing this for the first time in their lives. They always heard their parents and grandparents talk about it when we won the World Cup back then, but now they guarantee it through experience themselves and cheer on their hero, Lionel Messi and it's just such a great moment for him and his national team. You know, they've gone through so much over the years, you know, it'd become Messi story. Oh, he can win everything in Europe, but he can't bring home a championship to Argentina. Well, he erased those doubts in 2021 when he won Copa America with this squad. And he gave a legendary pregame speech in the locker room beforehand it's just like it gets you going to play anything listen to him say all that.

Instead, if you look past that, you'll see the highest bridge and that's where they're directing people that is one of the formal land crossings that then has a lot of the officials trying to process people. But for folks we spoken with, it has been a journey where some have actually made it across before the barricade went up. And what happens next? Well, it depends on who you ask. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (voice over): We watch as they step over a debris field of personal belongings, clothes and trash reminders of the thousands who crossed illegally before them most hoping for asylum in the U.S. In this very spot last month, we introduced you to Georgia Gutierrez, her husband Franklin and their five year old son. Like so many migrants chasing their American dream, they waited for the right time to step across. CULVER (on camera): Are you scared? Said he's a little scared. It's always hard because you don't know what's going to happen. CULVER (voice over): That was their second attempt to enter the U.S. They're now in Indianapolis near - brother and staying with a friend. There's still the fear that they can expel us Franklin says, we don't want to do anything bad that will call attention. When they entered the U.S. they say border agents brought them in, no questions asked a sign they say of the seemingly overwhelmed land crossing. They only told us what we needed to do go here go there, she says. After seven days and immigration detention in El Paso - says they were granted conditional release. Now they wait for a January court hearing to determine their status and future in the U.S. Rafael Rojas shared with us his treacherous and deadly journey from Venezuela to Mexico witnessing tragedy throughout. When we met him last month, he held tied to his shoes and follow the same stone path Jody Bell (Ph) took just hours earlier. But unlike Jody Bell and her family, Rafael says he was handcuffed and immediately deported more than 700 miles from Ciudad Juarez. And his last message to us, he said he vows to keep trying until he makes it to the U.S. Then there's - family. Four weeks ago, 9 year old Ruby told me all the countries she traveled through just to get to Mexico. Their dream destination sketched out. We caught up with them still in Mexico now renting a small home, no kitchen no heating, Ruby's still without a school but determined. She wants to learn English. They no longer live at the encampment because those tents no longer exist. In this messy clash with Mexican police late last month, the migrants living here were forced to leave, tents and blankets burned as the space was cleared out. Ciudad Juarez's Mayor, Cruz Perez Cuellar tells me the migrants were offered city shelters.",

It seemed like things were moving forward and then just in the last hour or so, all those people have vacated this courthouse behind me where the hearing was supposed to take place and no sign of Sam Bankman-Fried, so a bit of a mystery. Yesterday there were some fireworks in the courtroom as the prosecutors and the SPF's attorneys clashed. There was obviously disconnect between his Bahamian attorney who said that he had no knowledge of a planned extradition agreement and his U.S. attorneys who basically presented this as a done deal. So by the afternoon his Bahamian attorneys appear to be on the same page saying yes, they had consulted with their client and then he would waive his right to fight extradition here in the Bahamas. Why no hearing today, it remains something of a mystery. Usually, by now, we would have expected Sam Bankman-Fried to be brought here from the prison where he's being held. There have been no preparations to do so. And the hours continue to click by. I was sitting next to SPF in Court yesterday and I have to say he seemed confused throughout much of the proceedings as the prosecutors and as attorney went back and forth and kind of argued over the most basic points. And as the hours were on, I'm starting to share that sentiment. It is a very confusing situation. A lot of drama in the Bahamas right now. And even though everyone says there for extradition, this point no indications that that is going to take place anytime soon.",
