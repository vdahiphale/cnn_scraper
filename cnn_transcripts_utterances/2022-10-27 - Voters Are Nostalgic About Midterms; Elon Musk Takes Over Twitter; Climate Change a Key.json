If you look at, I know it's a polar coaster, oftentimes there's a great poll out right now, and it talks about whether Americans think that things are going in the right direction. And to put on the screen, overall, 74 percent think it's going in the wrong direction, everyone, the wrong direction. And it breaks down to 53 percent of Democrats feel this way, 76 percent of independents feel this way, 93 percent of Republicans, 93 percent of white Evangelicals, 80 percent of white voters, 58 percent of black voters, 66 percent of Hispanic voters.

The 93 percent of Republicans think we're going in the wrong direction.

And so, I think it's been going in the right direction since 1950.I think for laying the groundwork. What are we defining as a red wave? Because if that means up and down the ballot, Republicans win all the governor's races. They take the House, they take the Senate. That's how I define a red wave.

I don't think that Democrats are going to take that 2010 shellacking that they did, but I do think things are trending toward Republicans right now.Part of it is because Democrats have had trouble walking and chewing gum at the same time. Continuing to message on Roe, also trying to tout the positive aspects of President Biden's record, which there are positive aspects, but also trying to address in a way that voters will respond to the negative aspects of President Biden's record.

But I think John makes an important pointer and imply implicit distinction, which is, look, nosta -- I was a conservative for many years. I still have many issues. I mean, nostalgia can be harmless. Nostalgia can be even a pointer towards a kind of healthy don't assume everything's bad just because it's a later chronological time, right? You want to have people in the country saying, wait a second. Not everything that you say is progress is automatically progress. Maybe our forefathers got and mothers got some things right, and you know, we should preserve those things or improve them or whatever, not just throw them overboard. So, I was always more sympathetic to nostalgia in the past, but I've got to say in the last six or eight years when it's been weaponized the way it has entered into a bitter hostility to change to immigrants, to, you know, to minority groups. A refusal to face up to any of the problems in the past, the 50s. I mean, there was kind of a lot of unpleasant stuff happening in the 50s and 60s and in that respect, I think I was too nice to nostalgia. And I think what we see in America today is this, this sort of downside of the politicization and as I say, almost a weaponization of a kind of nostalgia. CAMEROTA:  Yes, and I'm not saying it's right or wrong, Mar, I'm just saying, doesn't that explain how some people are voting for these candidates who are promising to stop progress. I mean, at least stop progress, certainly on the immigration front and all of this has to do with. MARA S. CAMPO, JOURNALIST:  But I don't think it's as innocent as just nostalgia of wanting to harken back to a time before school shootings and when your kids could ride their bikes until after dark. I think this is a little bit more sinister than that. I think this is people who want to go back to a time when they had a little more power because the system was structured differently. Because there were fewer rights for blacks, because there were fewer rights for immigrants, because there were fewer rights for women. I mean, women couldn't own credit cards until the 70s. Now credit cards weren't created until the late 50s, but it took 16 years before a woman could open a credit card without another man signing on. So, I think there were a lot of people who really want to go back to the time when they would've had more power. It reminds me of when we first started hearing the slogan make America great again, and a lot of black people were saying, well, wait a minute, when you say again, exactly what time period are you referring to? Because it wasn't great for us back then. And there's no surprise that in this poll, the group of people that least wants to go back to the 1950s are blacks.",

That's how people want to sort of cultivate and plant the seeds of, remember when, in some ways it's not all that different than the question, and I'm paraphrasing here of, you know, are you happier now than you were five years ago, or four years ago, or two years ago? Making people use these comparison points makes the ones who are not in power sometimes feel like, see, I have the ticket in the vehicle for change.
