Already this morning, in this section, we have seen four cars spin out of control. That car right there, that vehicle, that SUV, is the lone one that is just stuck and it can't move because of the ice. Not only is this ice on this road hard to drive on, but it's absolutely impossible to walk on. I got a chance myself to see for myself that it is ice. Ice for sure. And for the most part, people are having trouble going up the hill, also down the hill, as you see this crashed out car right here. Also, with people coming down this hill right here, people are ending up, up that hill. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Infants under the age of one, they don't always maintain their body heat as well as older people do, as well as adults do or older children, so keep them dressed warmly, especially while they're sleeping.Also, the elderly are most at risk. And also we should know that people who have heart disease, cold weather puts stress on the heart. So, keep that in mind as well. Also, cold weather can aggravate asthma or other lung diseases. So, there may be -- you may have asthma or some other lung disease and you're usually fine, but in the cold, it may make it much worse. So, where are your rescue meds? Where's your inhaler?

There were researchers who looked at what happens to our nose that are responsible for keeping germs out, they don't work so well. They just don't function so well in the cold. So, there really is a reason why people tend to get colds more when the weather is cold. There's other reasons, too.

In normal times that would sound still too hot, but it's coming down from 7 percent, 6.5 percent, 6 percent, now 5.5 percent. Month over month up 0.1 percent.That year over year number is the slowest since October 2021 when this inflation nightmare began. So that is a good sign here overall. There's some core numbers inside this data that also showed signs of cooling. So, when you look at the trend, it does feel like the worst of the inflation drama is behind us, with still some more work to go. Look, inflation is peaking. Gas prices are down 50 cents over the past month. That might be one reason why consumer sentiment rebounded this week. And, Jim, we talked about this yesterday, GDP grew 3.2 percent in the third quarter. So, heading into the end of the year on a solid footing for the economy.",

I also want to show you one other thing, and it is the people of El Paso who are seeing what is happening here and are bringing these migrants food. Just a normal resident here who made tamales and brought pan dulce. So it's the traditional sweet bread and the traditional tamales that you get for Christmas.

But for those waiting in line, this is the final step in a very long and dangerous ordeal. They don't want to go home. CNN's David Culver spoke to Venezuela migrants who are now stuck at the southern border. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  There are those who cross illegally, streams of people, every day, every hour. And then there are those who watch, wait, and face the unknown. Here in Ciudad Juarez, this is what the U.S. looks like for Ulexi Fernandez (ph) and Lucy Bastilaz (ph). We're not criminals. We're good people, they stress. The two met while serving in the Venezuela military. In October they started their trek north, fleeing political turmoil, hiking through jungles, rafting murky waters, riding a train from on top. So close to their final destination until policy and this halt their journey. Before sunrise Tuesday, we watch as Texas law enforcement mobilize, sealing off this popular access point to American soil. One of the state's efforts to stop the flow of migrants. But it only reroutes them a short distance down river, creating a new bottleneck for illegal crossings, and a tense standoff. The setting sun ushers in freezing temperatures. By nightfall, migrants settle in on the U.S. side of the river, building campfires to keep warm. Hours later, some rush another border entry point about a mile away. Under Title 42, they can still be immediately expelled on the grounds of Covid prevention. Lucy and Ulexi determined to enter legally. She wants to do it the right way, she tells me, and knows exactly where she wants to go. Far from their big apple dreams, unable to return home, stuck in international purgatory. I'm here with my partner, she says. Discriminated against, they say, because they're migrants, they're women and they're a couple. To be safe, they avoid public displays of affection and travel in groups. Another reason they want to get to the other side -- when we're there, we're going to help all of our families, she says. The very mention of family triggers emotions Lucy's carried since leaving Venezuela. Lucy, missing her mom and siblings. Ulexi, her 10-year-old daughter. We hurry across traffic, about a half mile from where we first met the couple, and arrive at this local shelter. With nowhere else to go, families line up, hoping to escape the freezing cold. Lucy and Ulexi among the fortunate. This is home, at least for now. We meet some of their new friends, fellow migrants from all backgrounds.",
