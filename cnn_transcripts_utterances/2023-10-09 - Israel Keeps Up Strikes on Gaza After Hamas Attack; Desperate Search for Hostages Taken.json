      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak.It's seven in the morning in Israel. You're looking at live pictures, where the military says it's keeping up its strikes on Gaza and on Hamas militants after the group's large-scale surprise attack over the weekend. Hamas also claiming to have launched a major missile attack on the Southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Just hours ago, militants say 100 rockets were fired in response to Israeli Defense Forces targeting their safehouses. And Israeli police say the rocket attack made a direct hit on an apartment building. This all comes as Hamas claims to now be holding more than 100 hostages in Gaza, including high-ranking Israeli officers. Inside Israel, the death toll from Hamas's multi-pronged attack now climbing past 700. Since then, Israeli forces clashed on the ground with Hamas fighters and responded by pounding Gaza with airstrikes. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says at least 413 Palestinians have been killed, including 78 children. More disturbing images are emerging after Hamas's attack here. The bodies of victims from a music festival near the Israel-Gaza border, seen under tents. Emergency responders say at least 260 people there were killed. That site, just one of several targeted by militants on Saturday. CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments closely for you. She joins me now from London. Nada, people are bracing for what more is to come.",

The real question is what we can expect to happen next.At this stage, the priority for the Israel Defense Forces, for the Israeli government, continues to be on trying to secure those areas around the Gaza Strip where we have seen Hamas fighters infiltrating Israeli territory. We've heard from the Israeli authorities there. They say that gun battles have continued overnight between IDF soldiers and Hamas fighters on the ground. We've heard, in fact, from our teams on the ground who have witnessed some of these fire fights. And of course, overnight we have continued to see rockets being launched from Gaza into Israel, many of them, of course, intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system, but some making landfall. We have learned, of course, of a building in Ashkelon being hit by a rocket overnight. And, of course, in response we have also seen continued strikes in Gaza by the IDF. They say they are targeting Hamas positions. They say they have been successful in targeting a Hamas command center in Gaza, but this has also raised concern over what could be next in the potential for an escalation of those strikes in Gaza, as is anticipated. Now, of course, while that remains the priority at this stage, and of course, as you mentioned, being able to rescue those Israeli citizens and soldiers taken hostage and captive by Hamas and taken into Gaza. There are questions around the next phase. And of course, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken on this. He spoke about this being the first phase, but in the coming days, moving on to a military response. And it is anticipated that there will be a severe military response by Israel. Of course, we are anticipating there could well be a ground incursion into Gaza. Now of course, it isn't clear this is eminent at this stage. There is no telling when this could take place, but it is appearing to be, at this stage, a question of when, not if this will take place. And of course, there are several complexities at hand, particularly with regards to the fact that there are Israeli settlers who have been held captive in Gaza. It will be almost imperative for the Israeli forces to have some sort of crowd presence in order to extricate these citizens. But of course, the continued airstrikes also poses some difficulty, because it is anticipated that some of these Israel citizens, as well as Palestinian civilians in Gaza will fall victim, fall into the crossfire there. This is a tiny enclave, densely populated. And as we have seen on multiple occasions in the past, these strikes on Gaza have devastating civilian tolls. So of course, this is a huge concern, but that will be continue to be the focus at this stage. We know, of course, that Israel has been in touch with its allies, particularly in the U.S., calling for further military support on that front, but all eyes will be on what this next phase of Israel's response will look like.",

Instead, it is a message to others in the region outside of Israel. President Joe Biden said on Saturday, warning others actors in the region, without specifically naming home, but telling them not to get involved or try to exploit this opportunity without naming them. That was clearly a message to Iranian-backed Hezbollah and Lebanon, and Iranian-backed militias in Syria, a message of deterrence to them. Not only that carrier strike group heading from the Western Med to the Eastern Med, but also several more fighter jets added to the region as a message of deterrence to Iran. Those fighters will go to Israel, but there are other areas where U.S. fighters are based, again, as a warning to Iran not to carry out any more aggression or take advantage of the situation. Israel, we've also learned from a U.S. official and an Israeli official, has requested certain arms from the United States, in particular precision-guided munitions, as well as Iron Dome interceptors. And those are the two munitions the U.S. -- Israel has used at this point. Israel has carried out air strikes in Gaza using precision- guided munitions, so it makes sense that they're requesting more of that. And then Israel's Iron Dome has been incredibly busy intercepting barrages of rocket attacks from Gaza, pretty much since the moments this began, with an opening salvo of rocket fire. So, Iron Dome has played a critical role there. And Israel looking more -- for more of the Iron Dome interceptor missiles. Israel, of course, has its own stocks, and it uses those. But there's also an understanding that Israel can tap into U.S. stocks, some of which are in Israel, in the event of an emergency. And certainly, this qualifies as one.

And it was a complete surprise. I mean, we got used to the rockets. We live here with the rockets. We have a kind of a routine to go to the safe room and to take care of ourself. But this was a completely different attack that nobody was prepared for, and nobody can ever be prepared for such a thing like this. And there are two other families that their son and the daughter-in- law were brutally killed in their beds, in their house. And they left two little children, babies, alive, alone the whole day there. And another family where her son is a soldier and was -- so it's a small town of 200 families, maybe.

Because, first of all, many of these communities were destroyed, homes were burned. They -- there were terrorists that were holed up there. So those people decided to leave. Just this morning, we heard of another battle that took place in one of the communities along the border with Gaza, where dozens of Hamas terrorists, gunmen, engaged with Israeli soldiers. Possibly the fear is that maybe they came out of a tunnel underground. That's how they got there. Although we do know that when they crossed that border on Saturday, they caught -- crustaceans of spots. So the border itself is still breached in a number of locations. But they're not there anymore. I would anticipate that if there is a ground offensive, and the rocket fire is going to intensify, more people will leave that area for the center of the country.",

It takes time to gain some certainty and confidence and to understand the picture of what's happening. That took some time. It, of course, took time also yesterday on Sunday. I think that today, there's a better handle of what's happening. Better coordination between the air force, the ground forces and the different elite units that are also operating. We saw already some elite forces that -- that were able to abduct a top Hamas commander, as well. So Israel is regaining its footing.
