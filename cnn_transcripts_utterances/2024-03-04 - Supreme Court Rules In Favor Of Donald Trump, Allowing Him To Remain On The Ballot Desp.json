Today, the Supreme Court ruling 9-0 that Donald Trump should stay on the Colorado ballot and on the ballot in any state that had disqualified him based on the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban. The Supreme Court case concerned Colorado specifically, but Maine's top election official has now formally restored Trump's eligibility in that state as a consequence of this ruling.As for whether the former president engaged in insurrection, the Supreme Court justices sidestepped that issue. This all amounts to an unequivocal win for former President Trump, and it comes on the eve of Super Tuesday when he's trying to lock down the Republican nomination. Let's bring in CNN chief legal correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, get us up to speed on this historic decision.",

Super Tuesday, and here the unanimous court found that Colorado cannot remove former President Trump from its ballot based on the so-called insurrectionist ban. That is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution that bans insurrectionists from holding office.Now, the court wrote, quote, because the Constitution makes Congress, rather than the states, responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse the Colorado Supreme Court. We conclude that states may disclose, qualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office, but states have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency. Now, Boris, they wrote how they were concerned that if each state was able to enforce Section 3 on its own, it would create what they described as a patchwork and result in chaos, and they said that is not what the Constitution intended here. Now, it's interesting. Four justices did offer concurring opinions. This was a unanimous. This was a unanimous decision before justices insisted that some of what they said here went a little bit too far, that they would not have required Congress to pass legislation. You see here, you have the three liberal justices. They issued their concurrence. Justice Amy Coney Barrett also issuing her own concurrence, not going quite as far as the liberal justices, not wanting to side with their language, but holding similar in spirit.",

We didn't even hear his name uttered in the oral arguments for good reason.

That's interesting for us, because this is what the Supreme Court does, right? They take on contentious issues.

At least to understand the perspective of these particular justices, who I think might have wanted a vehicle absent of specific legislation for federal courts to enforce this provision of the 14th Amendment against particular candidates going forward, rather than waiting for Congress to act.So the thrust of the opinion here is that state actors can't make these federal candidate, basically, decisions, or adjudge the qualifications of individuals for federal office, though they could for state office.

We also have the presidential immunity case coming up. There's a number of January 6th cases coming up as well. And so there's a lot on the docket for the Supreme Court in terms of protecting American democracy, establishing norms for the rule of law, and dealing with January 6th defendants and the way federal law has been applied to them.And so certainly, I think Justice Barrett's position is that given how highly polarizing and salient these issues are, she wants the American public to kind of have trust in the court. But I think certainly, as all things are with the Supreme Court, they're political in nature.
