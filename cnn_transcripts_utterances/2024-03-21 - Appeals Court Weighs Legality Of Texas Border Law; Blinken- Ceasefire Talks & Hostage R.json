I think there was that much, to begin with. They'll -- they will -- there will be even less. Yes, I -- you know, Donald Trump -- the retrospective that Donald Trump wants to frame the race around is the idea that the economy and the border were in better shape, at least at the end of 2019 than they are now.

But the court heard oral arguments from the lawyer representing the State of Texas as well as the plaintiffs in the various organizations and the Department of Justice that have brought suit against the state of Texas for this controversial immigration law.So, while we await that decision, the legal challenge, that's kind of to decide whether or not this law could go into effect temporarily while the bigger lawsuit continues to play out in court. Now, one of the things that was interesting, Jim, is that the judges who heard that hearing yesterday appear to open the door to the possibility of allowing parts of the Texas law to go into effect. Remember, there's a couple of different components. One would allow local law enforcement agents like police, Sheriff, state police to arrest people suspected of entering Texas illegally, but it would also give judges the ability to deport those migrants to Mexico. So, there are a couple of different components of this law. Judges seem to be open to perhaps, maybe allowing parts of it to go forward while the bigger lawsuit continues to play out. And incidentally, there's a much bigger hearing scheduled for early April on that lawsuit. So, no matter what we hear now from the federal appellate court, there -- you know, there could be more changes or more developments legal -- on the legal side of all of this as this continues -- this case continues to make its way through the courts, Jim.",

Israeli military officials on loudspeakers telling people not to leave the building saying that they will be shot if indeed they do so. So, a very precarious situation.

And if you hear the story, it is clearly well-deserved. These men were not soldiers at first. They were recruited, as you pointed out, from ad agencies, art schools, tech schools, and their job in the weeks and months around the D-Day invasion, the invasion of Normandy was to essentially fool the Nazi Armony into how many U.S. troops there were and where those troops were focusing their effort.So, they used inflatable tanks, loudspeakers, radio transmissions, fake airfields even to try to convince the army of Nazi Germany that U.S. troops and allied troops were moving in different directions, were in different locations, and at one point, as was pointed out in this ceremony, they created a diversion such that Allied troops could cross the Rhine River. A critical moment in the battlefield that was allowed by the Ghost Army. In terms of the significance of what they did, the estimates are that they saved as many as 15,000 to 30,000 Allied troops, as the war was pushing on the door of Nazi Germany.",
