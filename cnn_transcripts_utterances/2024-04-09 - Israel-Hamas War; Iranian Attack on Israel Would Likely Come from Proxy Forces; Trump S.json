That is how many Palestinians have flooded into Rafah, the city their last refuge for safetyafter they were forced to flee the fighting elsewhere in Gaza.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and announcing on Monday that a date for the operation has been set and vowing today, that, quote, \"no force in the world will stop it from happening.\" This looming offensive coming amid dire warnings that what is already a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza could reach unimaginable proportions in a war that has already seen more than 33,000 people killed.

He said so in commentsyesterday, just hours after his far-right minister -- national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, effectively threatened to collapse the government should a Rafah offensive not happen and should the war end before such an offensive would take place. So it's important to take the prime minister's comments about a date being set for this offensive in the context of that kind of political pressure that the Israeli prime minister is currently facing, perhaps even more so than in an operational context. But nonetheless today, during an event with Israeli troops, the Israeli prime minister continuing to vow that that offensive will take place, no matter the forces trying to prevent it. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator):  We will complete the elimination of the Hamas battalions, including in Rafah. There is no force in the world that will stop us. Many forces are trying to do this but it will not help because, this enemy, after what it has done, will not do it again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But for weeks now, despite that, those comments from the United States, despite those efforts to prevent Israel from carrying out that offensive, Netanyahu has only emboldened himself on that front, vowing that it is essential to take out what he has described as Hamas' last bastion and vowing that offensive will take place regardless of what the United States provides as alternatives.",

And that breaks the pattern that we have seen in the last few years, in which the Israelis have attacked Iranian officials, military installations, et cetera, in Lebanon, as well as in Syria without a strong response from the audience because of the fact that the Iranians have played a longer game and have wanted to avoid direct confrontation. But rather want to confront Israel asymmetrically. But this attack against the constant breaks violates an Iranian red line, which is that it was technically on Iranian territory. And as a result, some form of direct response is expected. I'm not so sure, however, that it would come from some of the organizations that are aligned with Iran. We saw the United States under Trump assassinate Soleimani, the head of the Quds Forces, the Iranians made a point out of responding directly themselves from Iranian territory to signal that this was a major escalation by the United States.

But the Iranian response has also been that they want to see a reciprocity from the American side in making sure that there's a ceasefire in Gaza. There are some reports  out there in the Arab media that says that the Iranians have offered to refrain from attacking Israel if the U.S. secures a cease-fire. And that could potentially be something that Iranians are doing as a double win; on the one hand, they will be off the hook from actually having to retaliate against Israel and risk a major confrontation. And they could simultaneously take some credit for saving the people of Gaza, whether those reports are true or not, it's not entirely clear at this point.

But remember, this is the first time in this country that parents of a school shooter have not only been charged and convicted but now they're being sentenced. And so the defense is really finding issue with some of these aggravating factors here. For instance, that the defendant intended to kill as many people as possible in that mass shooting. That is something that can add years to your final prison sentence. They said no, the defense is saying we will establish, we will concede gross negligence over a continuing pattern. But once Ethan Crumbley got that gun in his hands, once he went to school with it, pulled the trigger and killing four and injuring many, that was his decision. The parents have nothing to do with that. They should not be at fault and blamed for what their son did when he finally was that intervening, independent factor that did the shooting. We'll see if the judge goes with that or not, because the prosecution is wanting 15 years in prison, total 10 to 15 at best. The defense is asking for about two to close to five years. They have been behind bars for over two years now, so they should get some time served. But there most likely will be a prison sentence here, not probation. So it just determines how long because I think both parents want to start their life again. Their son, Ethan Crumbley of course, charged as an adult, convicted, defense making a lot of that, that he was charged as an adult, meaning that he was responsible for his own acts, never to get out of prison. Life in prison without any possibility of parole, Becky. Jean, as you say, we are waiting on those victims statements and those are likely to be emotional. Jean, it's good to have you. Thanks.",

He's also someone I know who has been pressuring Donald Trump to try and embrace a national ban around 15 weeks. He said he was disappointed with the statement Donald Trump gave, as well as Marjorie Dannenfelser. She is the president of a leading anti-abortion group in the United States. She added that she was very disappointed as well. And this is something that clearly has frustrated Donald Trump, because we saw him lash out at this criticism publicly on Truth, Social yesterday, he criticized Lindsey Graham, said that him (sic) and Marjorie Dannenfelser have been really standing in the way of Republicans' ultimate goal.

He refused to give in to the pressure he was receiving from people on the Right as well as from some of his own advisors on his team, who thought it would be smart of him during the primary to come out and back a ban. He avoided doing that and that's exactly what he's doing now. And look, I think it's even more important for him during a general election to try and play the politics of this. This is something that Donald Trump has always done, particularly when it comes to this issue. He's really tried to have both sides of it. He's been taking credit for the overturning of Roe versus Wade, for his role in putting three conservative Supreme Court justices on the bench, while also while trying to punt this to the States. But I think the main message here in the big picture, Becky, is that, regardless of the outrage we're seeing from some of these Republicans on the Right, they're still going to choose Donald Trump if this is their leading issue. People who believed that abortions should not be allowed at a certain number of weeks will choose Donald Trump over President Joe Biden, regardless of their disappointment with how he's handling this.",

We were hoping it would recognize that states have to reduce their emissions in a way that are sufficient to protect those in the most vulnerable parts of Europe. The court found that states other than Portugal don't owe obligations to those living in Portugal. In other words, don't owe extraterritorial obligations. But ultimately the fact that the court has emphasized the importance of the 1.5 degree upper limit is we think really significant in terms of protecting those that are most vulnerable in Europe; 1.5 degrees is not by any means a safe level.
