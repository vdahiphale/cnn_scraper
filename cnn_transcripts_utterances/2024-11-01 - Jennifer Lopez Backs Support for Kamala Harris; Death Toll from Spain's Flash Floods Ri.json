Harris was joined Thursday night at a rally in Las Vegas by actress and singer Jennifer Lopez. The Puerto Rican superstar's appearance came just days after a comedian at a Trump rally sparked outrage by describing Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage. Lopez said all of humanity found a tasteless joke insulting. When Harris spoke to an enthusiastic crowd, she warned about what she called the dangers of another Trump presidency. Here she is.

This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and is out for unchecked power.

And we've seen that the Harris team has seized upon this, that Trump doesn't really care about Hispanics. It's all transactional. He just wants them to vote for him, but he doesn't really explain why they should vote for him. And regarding this whole outpouring of celebrities and there are celebrities on both sides but this really doesn't change people's minds that are already made their mind up the celebrity elements just drums up enthusiasm gets people excited it draws a lot of energy to the campaign and makes people feel good but it's not probably can change people's minds.",

All this stuff doesn't play well with women and I can't imagine that's what he wants to close on because women vote more than men do, they vote more than men by three or four points. And we're seeing that this is the trend I would be looking at the most. If the female voter turnout is really high, this is not going to be good for Trump. And we'll have to look at it in comparison to what male turnout is. That's his base, it's mostly white males. And part of his base is not the type of voter that tends to vote all the time. So that's why he's trying to get enthusiasm with that whole Madison Square Garden Macho Fest. He's hoping that that's going to bring out his supporters.

As you mentioned, this is the first time that the suburbs, the southern suburbs, have been targeted in nearly a week. Israel's focus had seemed to be the north in recent days, particularly the area of Baalbek, a sign of just how much it was expanding its offensive on Lebanon. But these strikes today on the southern suburbs come after the IDF had vowed retaliation yesterday. Some 90 Hezbollah rockets were fired towards Israel yesterday, Thursday to the city of Metula where four foreign nationals, four Thai nationals, were killed along with one Israeli citizen. This retaliation appears to be taking place right now in those southern suburbs. But as the fighting continues and expands and claims more lives, there is a huge diplomat underway to put a temporary ceasefire in place that would stop this fighting in Lebanon at least for a period of a month and allow the warring parties to negotiate further, to negotiate a longer-term deal. That proposal is, of course, being pushed by U.S. officials. I want you to take a listen to how Blinken put the progress so far.

Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister, perhaps, expressed more optimism, said yesterday that he is hoping for a deal in the coming weeks or days. Why is this challenging? Why is this so difficult? Well, you've had these signals from Israel's military leaders that their task, if you will, their mission on the ground in Lebanon is drawing near, but trying to set up a more permanent system, well, that involves potentially enforcing a U.N. resolution, a U.N. agreement that's been in place between Israel and Hezbollah for some time. How does that enforcement take place? Who enforces it? How and where and when? All of those details may keep these talks going for some time.

You could argue that Beijing would like to see Donald Trump because he has been very critical of alliances such as NATO at a time when China's trying to portray itself as the leader of a new world order.
