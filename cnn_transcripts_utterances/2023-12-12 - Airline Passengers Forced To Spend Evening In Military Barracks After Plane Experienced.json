So they landed there in Goose Bay. Deplane the flight. For about 24 hours, the passengers were stuck there. And there's not a lot of hotels in Goose Bay. I looked it up online a little bit ago. There's a military barracks there. It's an Air Force base there for the Canadian Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force. They ended up going to a barracks there to spend the night. I did read a quote from one of the passengers that, you know, it was not all that bad. It was kind of like a hotel basically. So we should not try to make it sound so terrible. The good news here is that Delta did send another flight to go back and pick up these passengers, called a rescue flight. One issue, though, the crew on board that flight timed out. So then they had to wait for a bit more time for that flight to ultimately get them back to Detroit, their original destination. That did happen last night around 7:00 p.m. So ultimately, this ordeal took about maybe like 26 hours in total. Have you ever seen the play \"Come From Away,\" which is sort of the story of these folks who got diverted after the 9/11 attacks? They got sent to an airport in Gander not too far away. Another similarly small town. Only about 8,000 people live in Goose Bay. So the population was the same significant when you think about the percentages going down. But yes, not unlike \"Come From Away,\" they had to put people up in homes at that case, in the military infrastructure there --",

Walk us through the testimony. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Rahel and Boris, Shaye Moss, really AN emotional day of testimony from her. She walked the jury through how her life had been personally affected by the conspiracy theories that Rudy Giuliani was amplifying after the 2020 election. And she also told them she remains in fear for her life. She always feels like someone is watching her. I want to highlight one moment from her testimony that really underscores the persistent fear that she feels that is a direct result of these conspiracy theories. She said, \"I am most scared of my son finding me or my mom hanging outside my house on a tree, or having to get the news at a school that his mom was killed.\" Moss really detailing in pretty graphic terms there for the jury about how there's a direct line between the conspiracy theories that Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump were peddling at the time as they tried to overturn the election, also the impact it's had on her family. So this really does draw a stark comparison to what we've heard from Rudy Giuliani in this case so far. You know, obviously Shaye Moss was asked if Rudy Giuliani had ever apologized to her. She said no. But just last night, he continued to push some of the same conspiracy theories he's being sued over.",

Ultimately, this is just about the amount of damages that Giuliani is going to have to pay. A judge has already ruled that he did, in fact, defame these two poll workers in Georgia.

In the opinion, the justices wrote, \"No one disputes that Ms. Cox's pregnancy has been extremely complicated. Many parents would be devastated that their unborn child's trisomy 18 diagnosis. Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose a heightened risk to the mother that the medical exemption encompasses.\" The attorneys for Kate Cox say that Texans should be enraged by that opinion. They have been arguing for several days and much of the last week that Kate Cox's concern about her future fertility, as well as the continuing with this pregnancy and possibly be a threatening situation to hurt as it progressed. The attorneys are saying the medical exemption as it exists in Texas right here now simply does not exist. They say it's virtually impossible for any doctor or hospital to agree to perform an abortion, given what the Texas Supreme Court has applied in this case.

We know somewhere close to 15 to 20 percent of those that serve in the military do have a history of post-traumatic stress. They have a history of depression. Could that have played a role here? Was there any other abusive drug? Things like that. That'll be tested. They'll do full toxicology. But also, aside from CTE, people can develop post-concussive syndrome. Again, I want to be crystal clear. No one is drawing a cause and effect between those types of things and gunning down people as we heard with this particular man. But I think if you look at post-concussive symptoms, people may have the same things we talk about with CTE but at a lesser scale. Mood swings, feeling impulsive, difficulty sleeping, things like that. Was there a relationship between any of those things and this sort of behavior? Again, we may never know.
