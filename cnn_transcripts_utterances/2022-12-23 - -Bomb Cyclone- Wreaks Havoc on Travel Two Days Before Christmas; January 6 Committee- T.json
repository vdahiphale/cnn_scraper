I'm Jake Tapper.We start with the national lead and this nightmare weather scenario before Christmas crippling conditions stretching coast to coast with snow and ice in cities such as Seattle and Portland, Oregon, to the massive bomb cyclone system moving east. Nearly 180 million in the U.S. are in areas with temperatures below freezing, 70 million are in areas below zero. This system is so powerful meteorologists say its atmospheric pressure is equivalent to a category 2 hurricane, which means forceful wind gusts and coastal flooding. Along the Great Lakes today, the mayor of Buffalo, New York, banned all driving. This is what it looked like around 8:30 this morning in Buffalo. Two hours later the same neighborhoods and roads surrounding it covered in snow. The system has, sadly, also been deadly. The weather is to blame for at least four deaths in Kansas and Kentucky that we know about as of now. Three were involved in car crashes. Police say a man in Louisville, Kentucky, died after being exposed to the elements. From Denver to Atlanta to Chicago and beyond, CNN is covering this weather disaster coast to coast. CNN's Omar Jimenez starts us off with the havoc on the day before Christmas Eve. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From record snowfall in the Midwest to dangerous road conditions in the Deep South, now more than half of the country is under massive winter storm and wind chill alerts.

We stay below freezing through Christmas. We are on the verge of the coldest Christmas Eve ever here in Atlanta, 1.2 million customers without power because of this arctic outbreak across the eastern U.S. Just incredible.

This is the location of the cold front moving across the East Coast. Boston you're in rain right now but the front will move through and you will get a wallop of snow and then it comes to an end, maybe the skies go clear. If you get sunshine tomorrow, it will be completely deceiving. I want to take you to Buffalo, because this is ground zero from the heaviest snow from the storm system, up to 3 feet downwind from Lake Erie, as well as Lake Ontario. This is where we'll see the snow measured in feet going forward. The winds, we cannot talk about this weather forecast without what is happening with the winds, gusting near category 1 hurricane strength. That is incredible. That's why there's wind alerts, wind warnings in place all along the eastern seaboard. Those aren't typos, Jake.
