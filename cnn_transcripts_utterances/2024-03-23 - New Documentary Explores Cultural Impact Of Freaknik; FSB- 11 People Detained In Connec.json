Now actually, the Russians fear that that is actually still going to rise. They say right now that the authorities are actually combing through that building the Crocus City Hall on the outskirts of Moscow in a place called Krasnogorsk. The roof of that building obviously partially collapsed, a lot of the place has been burned down. So the Russian authorities still going through that right now.Now, as far as the attackers themselves are concerned, the Russians are now saying claiming that they have apprehended not just the four attackers that they say went inside the Crocus City Hall and started shooting people at point blank as eyewitnesses said, they also say that they have seven people who they say worked together with these perpetrators, so not 11 people in total in custody right now. The Russians are saying that the alleged gunman fled Moscow in a white car and that they were stopped and apprehended in the Bryansk area. Now that's significant, because that area is very close to Ukraine. And as of right now, in all this still preliminary as far as the Russians are concerned, they claim that the attackers and their accomplices wanted to flee to Ukraine, wanted to go across the border and had quote, \"relevant contacts inside Ukraine\". They have so far not confirmed that they believe ISIS is behind all of this. The U.S. obviously says that, at least says I have no doubt that about the claim that ISIS step it forward. ISIS, of course put forward their claim. The Russians at this point in time, appearing possibly to talk about some sort of possible link to Ukraine. The Ukrainians, for their part, of course, have vehemently been denying having anything to do with this, Victor.",

And about as you said, the added emotional burden caused by the responses to the diagnosis and the return. Help us understand what that is, especially on the scale of Princess Kate.TRISHA GODDARD, HOST, \"THE WEEK WITH TRISHA GODDARD\": I'm so glad. Thank you so much for asking that. Actually, that's such an insightful question. People imagine how they would be in in the situation. So you often get and Catherine is going to get this unfortunately, everybody knows somebody. I mean, sometimes when you finally tell someone that you have cancer, they'll say, oh my God, I know so much about it. My aunt and my cousin Mike, they had this terrible death of cancer. It's -- the first person you do not tell about terrible deaths in your family from cancer is someone who's just told you about it. The other thing is labeling someone brave. When you say someone's brave, you shut them down from being able to cry, be upset, et cetera. Unsolicited advice. Oh, I've been told if I drank dandelion tea, and if I, you know, use garlic, then the cancer will go. We -- we don't need um, you know, unsolicited advice about diet because the person give it -- giving it. However much they think they're an expert. They don't know what stage of treatment you're in. Your ethnicity, what your allergies may be. You know, there are special oncologists nutritionists who have your medical notes who can do that. Now, Catherine, in that last message that you played, I'm so glad you played that. You notice she didn't say to all those battling cancer. She said people and people going through cancer hate that term battling. Many of us won't say anything, because it's said with the in the kindest way. But really, Victor, how do you battle cancer? You know, we talk about this person won the battle with cancer. This person lost. I mean, what do we do go big, big. If we don't buy cancer. We get up. We are not our diagnosis. There are currently millions of Americans, millions of Brits, and I actually want to reach out to black Americans who are going through this because we know you -- we don't show up in hospital. We don't show up for our tests enough. We're scared. There's too much, you know, rubbish surrounding you know, too many mad ideas about it. Please, if you see something a little bit scary or feel something a little bit scary, worry the hell out of your healthcare provider. But, you know, the thing is, we are not our diagnosis. We want to live we want to be moms. We don't want to be hassled. Catherine doesn't need to be hassled by people saying exactly what kind of cancer have you got? What stage is it?

The NCAA survey found that black people are also more likely to bet specifically on college basketball. And this is worrying, black people bet more often, wager more money and lose more money, according to the survey. Dr. Timothy Fong is with us. He's a co-director of UCLA's Gambling Studies Program. Thanks so much for being with me. I want to read more of these stats and then get your insight here. 68 percent of black respondents to the survey say they've engaged in sports betting, higher than any other racial demographic, black sports bettors are twice as likely to bet $100 or more, 10 percent of black betters are losing reportedly 500 or more than a single day versus the 6 percent of the general population. Is there any insight into why? DR. TIMOTHY FONG, CO-DIRECTOR, UCLA GAMBLING STUDIES PROGRAM: Oh, absolutely. Thank you for having me. Well, number one, gambling is a human condition. But number two, we're certainly learning more and more that gambling is disproportionately affecting communities of color.
