I think it's actually legit as a primary strategy to point out Donald Trump's clear shift away from gay rights towards a more -- what's now more of a GOP-based position.I think if the ad had stopped there, you can make that argument, but the ad keeps going with either homophobic or homoerotic images, depending on how you want to analyze it. Lots of muscles, guys and masks, lots of oil. But so the purpose of the ad is to portray Ron DeSantis as a champion against gay rights and sort of LGBTQ plus issues. And that's a little different than portraying the shift of Donald Trump. It is actually to portray DeSantis as a fighter against these issues as part of the culture wars block. And again, that is a primary election strategy. It would be very problematic in a general election, you'd have to completely walk away from it, because you -- what you need to be a Republican nominee who's elected in a general election is suburban women, kind of centrist voters, old line Republicans who are kind of more like interested in economics and not social issues.",

In the past, you may have a candidate go and hear from different voters in Iowa about kitchen table issues, about the economy, what have you. But instead, now you have a prominent candidate who is really seeing firsthand the ripple effects, the ramifications of more than a year, more than two years of false claims about the election. We were warned about this over and over again, that it wouldn't just be statements that go out into the ether, that people would actually believe these statements and have a lack of faith in the Democratic system and continue to believe it.
