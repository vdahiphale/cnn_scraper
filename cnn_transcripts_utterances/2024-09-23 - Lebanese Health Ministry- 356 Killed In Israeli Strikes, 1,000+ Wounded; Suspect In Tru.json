Israel's long simmering conflict with Hezbollah is now some feared on the brink of all-out war, this after the deadliest today between Israel and Lebanon in some 20 years. The Lebanese health minister called the numbers, quote, on unprecedented said Israeli strikes have killed at least 356 people, including women and children, and wounded more than 1,000.

If you look at, for instance, the death toll, 356, according to the ministry of health, keep in mind, that's essentially a third of the entire number of people killed, Hezbollah and civilians in the 34-day war in 2006. And among them the dead, the death toll so far today. And of course this is not the final death toll, we're talking about 66 women and children.What we're seeing are tens of thousands, if not more people streaming out of south Lebanon after they received those messages from the Israelis via cell phone, text messages and the Israelis breaking into the broadcast in a local radio station telling them to leave, but they strikes began just around 5:00 a.m. local time this morning. Intense strikes as many as 1,000 at this point so far today, that really just sent people streaming the road, the highway between the south and Beirut is jam-packed on both sides of the highway. Many people have just stopped by the side of the road to wait until things clear up. Those who are coming to Beirut are taking shelter in schools. Also, of course, schools, universities have all been canceled throughout Lebanon. And as I said, as you mentioned, they are now striking the Bekaa Valley. You call it a Hezbollah stronghold, but it's actually home to hundreds of thousands of people, many of them have nothing to do with Hezbollah, and they were given a essentially a two-hour warning to get out of any house or building where they believe Hezbollah was storing weapons. The recommendation from an Israeli military spokesman was get 1,000 meters at least away and perhaps take refuge in local schools. But we can expect tens of thousands if not -- poor people to stream out of there. Many of them will be heading into the mountains where they believe they say they're safe. But if this war really accelerates, then there may be no place in Lebanon that's safe -- Jim.",

      "sentences": "Well, that certainly is one of the questions that is being asked tonight, across Israel. It was a question that was posed to the Israeli military spokesman tonight and he would not answer it directly, only saying that the military is prepared for all scenarios. What we haven't seen yet is the kind of major call-up of reservists that would be -- that we would likely expect in the event of a major ground defensive, there has been some movement of troops being redirected to the northern front, some troops being called up for reserve duty, but nothing out of the ordinary thus far. Instead, it seems that the Israeli military has chosen that for now atleast, it will rely primarily on its overwhelming airpower, striking more than 1,300 targets in Lebanon today alone, making this the most intensive bombardment of Lebanon since the 2006 war. What more will follow -- we'll just have to wait and see. What is clear though is that the Israeli government has made a decision that they are no longer going to engage in this kind of tit for tat with Hezbollah, which began on October 8 when Hezbollah began firing rockets in solidarity with Hamas and the Palestinian people. Instead, the Israeli government has decided to radically begin escalating the situation in Lebanon, strike -- striking far more, far deeper in Lebanon than they typically would and they are doing so to try and change the equation, they say. The Israeli prime minister today talking about changing the balance of power to try and restore security for Israel's northern residents. For now, though, there is no indication that Hezbollah is going to be cowed by these strikes instead, what Hezbollah is doing is they are striking deeper into Israel than they typically do. We saw them strike tonight right here I am in Haifa at least five rockets that were directed towards the city all intercepted according to the Israeli military. But the first time that rocket sirens sounded in this major population center in northern Israel. And earlier today, we also saw several rockets fired into the West Bank, just east of Tel Aviv, some 60 plus miles away from the Lebanese border. And so that is how Hezbollah is responding right now then we wait for the next response. Ben Wedeman, Jeremy Diamond, thanks so much. Here to discuss the military terms of this, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. Good to have you on. I wonder in military terms, Israel clearly focusing on Hezbollah leadership, both with these strikes and that pager attack, but also weapons stores here. Is it weakening Hezbollah in a lasting way or are these capabilities in personnel that has bullock and easily replace?",

So this is basically the first phase of their operation against Hezbollah. They want to make it clear that they're going after Hezbollah as an organization, not Lebanese state, toward the Lebanese people. But regardless, they are still going to have to create a lot of damage on Lebanese territory in order to achieve their goals and so far, this seems to be a very escalatory step and its clearly aimed at, at the very least softening up the Hezbollah target for further Israeli action.",

They said that the agent, the Secret Service agent, who they say encountered Ryan Routh on the golf course after seeing that the barrel of the rifle through the fence, they said that the defendant was in a position that provided a clear line of fire, Jim, to the sixth full putting green. Now remember, Donald Trump was on the fifth poll putting green at the time in court. Prosecutor said that would have put him just about 12 to 15 minutes from the sixth hole, putting green.

And on that electrical tape they say preliminary findings show a fingerprint that prosecutors say belongs to Ryan Routh. A couple of other quick things they did search his car, they found six cell phones and on one of those cell phones, they say was it Google search for how to get from Palm Beach County to Mexico. Also, cell phone data tracked Ryan Routh, they say and put him here in Florida as of August 14, that would have put him in this area around Mar-a-Lago and around the Trump International Golf Club for about a month, they say that his cell phone pinged on several of the cell phone towers in the area.
