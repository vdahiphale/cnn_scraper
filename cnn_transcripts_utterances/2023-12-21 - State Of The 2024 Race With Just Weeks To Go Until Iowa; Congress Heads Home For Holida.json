And you heard the President weigh in, not on the actual court ruling and what the court should do, but weigh in on the notion that Trump has an insurrectionist yesterday. So, make everyday a referendum on Trump.If indeed House Republicans move forward with impeachment on Biden make that a political advantage, not unlike Donald Trump did with his first impeachment or Bill Clinton did turn that into a rallying cry for the base because Joe Biden's mission is to start bringing the base back to him, those pieces of his coalition that have drifted away. And another way to do that they believe is keeping abortion rights front and center. It is the one most animating issue for Democrats right now.",

They have left a long to do list behind them that will need to be tackled as soon as they get back. On that list, aid for Ukraine and Israel, border security and oh, that pesky little thing called government funding. Deadlines looming in mid-January and early February.CNN's Lauren Fox is live in Washington D.C. with more for us this morning. So, a lot to get done here. And still, plenty of internal divisions within each party. Is there a sense that this is actually going to come together after a little break?",

And the expectation is they're going to have about 10 days to find a path forward on government funding. Specifically, there are deep divisions between Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate at what the best path forward is right now. And despite the fact that negotiators have been trying to find agreement on simply how much funding the government should be spending next year, so far, they haven't been able to find any agreement on that question.You know, Senator Susan Collins, the top Republican appropriator put it to me this way, January is not going to be that enjoyable of a month. And the other reality here is that despite the fact that negotiators were working around the clock to find some kind of border agreement, they're going to continue meeting virtually over the next couple of weeks, they still have not been able to clinch an agreement on what border policy changes that they can agree to. That, of course, is keeping aid for Ukraine, aid for Israel from passing in the House and the Senate. And even if Senate negotiators can find a path forward, there's no guarantee that the new speaker Mike Johnson is going to put it on the floor of the House. So, you have this entanglement of issues coming up in January, that's going to make this a very difficult few weeks for lawmakers when they return. And they've just punted everything. They are now home for the holiday. And there's just no clear guidance right now on how they're going to get this all done in a matter of about three weeks.",

First, it was overheard testimony before Congress, and now it's her writings that are under intense scrutiny here. And so, here's the latest, Harvard is confirming that Gay is issuing corrections to her 1997 PhD dissertation, because of what they described as, quote, inadequate citations. Now note, this is on top of the corrections that were issued just last week to her scholarly work in the 2000s. And those corrections came after an independent review by Harvard's top board.Now Harvard says that its top governing board has concluded that these issues are quote regrettable, but that they don't constitute research misconduct, which is something that would be punishable -- a punishable offense. Now meanwhile, as you mentioned, the House Committee on Education is also reviewing these plagiarism allegations. They're alleging that there's a double standard here. They're requesting a written response from the university from eight days from now. Let me read you what Chair Virginia Foxx wrote in this latest letter. I'm quoting, if a university is willing to look the other way and not hold faculty accountable for engaging in academically dishonest behavior, it cheapens its mission and the value of its education. You got to wonder whether the way that this news has come out in this drip, drip, drip fashion is only hurting matters here. And whether Harvard officials wish that they looked at all of Claudine Gay's work, instead of just sort of a portion of it, because that's not helping matters.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, one of the interesting questions here is why Harvard has decided to this point, not to punish Claudine Gay over these plagiarism issues. Now Harvard says that what they've uncovered again, it doesn't constitute research misconduct, and they point to their policy, which states that for it to be research misconduct, it must be a significant departure from accepted practice. It must be, quote, intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. And it must be proven by preponderance of evidence. And the school is indicating basically, it hasn't met all three of those criteria, most notably, that second one around intentionally and knowingly or recklessly misconduct.So that's why the school hasn't taken action against her to this point. We should also know what Claudine Gay has said. She said that she stands by the scholarship of the integrity of her scholarship. Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards. But clearly the scrutiny here is only intensifying.",
