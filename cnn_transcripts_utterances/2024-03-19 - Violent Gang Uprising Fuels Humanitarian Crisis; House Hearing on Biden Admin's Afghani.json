In just a few hours from now up on Capitol Hill, a critical hearing on the Biden administration's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan will get underway up on Capitol Hill. The House Foreign Affairs Committee will hear from two of the top military officials who oversaw that exit, Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley and Former Central -- U.S. Central Command -- Commander General Kenneth McKenzie. The U.S. withdrawal was marred by a pair of August 2021 suicide attacks outside the Kabul airport that left 13 U.S. service members and dozens of Afghans dead. Let's talk more about this with CNN Military Analysts Retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. I mean, Colonel, it has been almost three years since this messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, but still some very important questions remain. Take us through what we might be hearing today and some of the really key points that lawmakers are trying to get to on all this. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOINT STAFF, PENTAGON, AND FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING, NSA: Yes, this is going to be really interesting, Jim, because one of the key things about this was that the U.S. was really surprised by the rapidity of the Taliban's advance. It took them, basically, less than four weeks to get from almost nothing -- ACOSTA:  Right.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, definitely a stretch. There's almost no chance that the Fed cuts interest rates tomorrow. The market is pricing in a 99 percent chance that the Fed does nothing and keeps interest rates steady. And we know Fed officials do not like to catch investors off guard.Fed officials, they have been clear that they really need to see more progress in the fight against inflation before they're willing to give borrowers a break. Wall Street's also betting, no rate cut at the next decision on May 1. So, the real drama is really over what happens in June. And it's almost an even split, 60-40. A 60 percent chance of a rate cut in June, 40 percent chance of no change. And those numbers should change tomorrow because we're going to get new projections from Fed officials on where they think inflation, unemployment and interest rates are going next. Jerome Powell, he's going to take questions from reporters tomorrow where he may drop some hints. Listen, all of this is obviously a very big deal to Wall Street, but it's also really important to Main Street and to the election too because the longer the Fed keeps interest rates high, the more that we're all going to be paying for mortgages and home equity loans, car loans and credit card debt. So really, the stakes here are very, very high. Remember, the Fed had to cut interest rates to basically zero during COVID to try to save the economy. Then it had to reverse course and spike interest rates to fight inflation. You could see that on the chart on your screen. And interest rates have basically been stuck at these 23-year highs. Tomorrow would be the fifth straight meeting where the Fed keeps interest rates steady. And the Fed is kind of in a tough spot here, right? Because if they ended up cutting interest rates too soon, they could actually make inflation worse, that's what happened in the 1970s. But if they end up waiting too long, they could actually damage the jobs market and potentially even cause a recession. So, Jim, it is a very delicate balance and the stakes are pretty high.",

In the meantime, out this morning, new video, released shows the Princess of Wales in public for the first time in months as speculation regarding her whereabouts has been rampant. For days now, this latest sighting comes just days after Kate Middleton faced backlash for a photoshopped Mother's Day image that she posted. And for months now, questions have swirled over her health after keeping a low profile following some abdominal surgery. CNN's Max Foster joins me now in London. Max, is it time to move on? What do you make of this latest video we're seeing of the princess? MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR AND ROYAL CORRESPONDENT:  You know what, I think if you're a royal fan, you're a monarchist, you're looking at this video, you're really reassured. You're seeing Kate looking really well. She's carrying bags. She's with William. It's all positive news. Of course, the world we're in on this story doesn't really operate like that. It's not the normal rules. So, the conspiracy theorists are out in force and saying that it's all fake again. So, this is the problem that we're facing with all of this.",

Taken by Kate that we've also found manipulations on it's from last year. It shows that the Queen, the late Queen, with her grandchildren and great grandchildren.
