Now here's what the document actually says.The comparison showed a statistical match specifically, the SPR profile, is at least 5.37 octillion times more likely to be seen if the defendant is the source. And they're saying rather than anyone in the universe, basically. They go on to say in this document -- it's the first time that they have admitted to this. That they actually did genetic genealogy. They say the FBI took it over. They say the FBI went to a public database or public databases. And they took that unknown DNA from the knife sheath and put it in there to see if there were any matches, even very, very remote matches to that DNA. They then did -- according to the document -- old-fashioned investigative work. Social media sites, public databases, birth certificates, death certificate looking for geographical location. And the document states -- the motion, quote, the FBI then sent local law enforcement a tip to investigate the defendant. Now, the whole point of this document is that the prosecution believes that the defense should get no information on genetic genealogy because there are parameters of it. The FBI just has their working notes, it says. And that those are not subject to discovery. Now the defense has not responded to this at all. There is a gag order so they cannot publicly comment.
