Right now, the two leaders are working through an onslaught of challenges. There's Russia's brutal war on Ukraine right on NATO's doorstep, an increasingly aggressive Iranian regime, China flexing its muscles, post-pandemic economic tensions, and anti-democratic forces emboldening on both sides of the Atlantic, so, so much on the line right now. CNN's Phil Mattingly is at the White House inside the room where we're going to have this press conference with the two leaders any moment now. What are the two leaders saying at this point? And, overall, what is President Biden's goal with this visit?",

      "sentences": "Look, I think the symbolism is both very real and very intentional. Having President Macron here at the White House for the first state dinner of President Biden's time in office, it's something that underscores, yes, a very longstanding relationship, the first and oldest ally of the U.S., but also the critical role that France and President Macron play in all of those geopolitical challenges, which are quite consequential that you laid out, Ana.In each element of that, whether you talk about Ukraine, whether you talk about how the president has tried to shift the West in terms of its posture with China, President Macron is a central figure in that and a critical player inside the bloc, particularly as you have seen other European nations and some other European leaders perhaps lose some of their ability to push things in a specific direction. What we know for a fact that Ukraine is obviously central in this moment in time. Where the leaders agree is on the overarching process, on their overarching decision to back and unify behind Ukraine. Where they disagree, to some sense, and what we're going to try and figure out during this press conference is about the scale of the approach going forward, whether there should be negotiations, how the negotiations should happen, how the endgame actually plays out here. But I do think it's worth noting right now that there's a very real tension point when it comes to the economy. As much as the relationship has recovered from an early stage kind of rift related to a submarine deal, right now, the decision by the administration to sign legislation that would have major -- put out major subsidies to North American companies has been a real tension point and one that President Macron has not hesitated to call out, been very aggressive in his language, making very clear he's going to raise that. So there are -- it's not all kind of roses and butterflies here. It's not all just glitz and glamour, in terms of a state dinner. There are very real issues to discuss. But there's also a very real relationship, something the president discussed in the Oval Office. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Emmanuel is not just the leader of France. He's one of the leaders of Europe. He's been very outspoken, and he has been very, very commanding in Europe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think the White House implicitly, by having France as the first state dinner, is acknowledging President Macron's role there, his central role in the European bloc.One other thing I would note, in terms of how things are going to move going forward, we are already past the allotted time that the two were supposed to have behind closed doors for this bilateral meeting. That is not a rarity. They have gone over time in past phone calls and meetings in the past, and say that they do have a genuine -- genuinely positive personal relationships. So, when this press conference is actually going to happen remains a little bit of an open question at this moment, given how they tend to interact with one another. But there's no question that that interaction is really centered on a series of very substantive, very consequential issues.",

      "sentences": "It really does.I mean, this dinner, though, it is the first state visit, as Phil said, of the Biden administration, after two years in the office. So, the last time that Macrons were here with President Trump and Melania Trump, it was a smaller dinner, about 120 people inside the White House. Tonight, it's going to be a totally different story. It's about 400 guests, I'm told. There's a big tent on the South Lawn. There's going to be far more in terms of pomp and circumstance and guest list. The menu is going to be a sort of an equal parts nod to France and nod to the United States. They're going to be serving caviar and poached lobster, beef, of course. And there will be little touches, like there will be French champagne flutes, but American sparkling wine served in them. So, again, it's that mix of French and American culture that's going to be on display. And then also Jon Batiste will be performing. During the Trump administration state dinner, the Washington National Opera performed. So it's, again, a very different vibe tonight than the last time the Macrons were here. And I will say there is the traditional exchange of gifts between the two couples, another sign of the good-natured friendship between the U.S. and the French, the Macrons giving the Bidens a few things here, a French-made peace of Christofle china, and also a vinyl and C.D. of the soundtrack of the movie \"A Man and a Woman,\" the famous French movie from 1966, apparently, the movie that the Biden saw on their first date more than four decades ago, when they were dating. And, also, Dr. Biden got a copy of \"Madame Bovary\" and some more French literature. Of course, she's a teacher. And, in exchange, the Bidens' gifts to the Macrons consisted of a mirror that's made from wood that had fallen on the White House grounds, so, of course, sort of a historic nod there, and another viny. -- I don't know why vinyl.

So there's a little bit of American history there as well.And then Jill Biden gave Brigitte Macron a necklace from a French- American designer. So, all of these sort of protocol moments are part of this massive undertaking that really is the highest pinnacle of soft diplomacy, if you will, that the Bidens or anyone at the White House and the administration can give to the French visiting, culminating in this dinner, these gifts, these special moments. We will see some people arriving late. I do hear there are celebrities on the list, another change from when the Trumps were here. There weren't a lot of celebrity-heavy state dinners, of course. But, before them, the Obamas always sort of brought out the star power here in Washington. So people are expecting a little more tonight, that we will see that from the French-American dinner tonight, Ana.",

During the Obama administration, some of the smaller ones were -- it could be a quarter-of-a-million dollars, up to half-a-million dollars. That's the latest data that we have. You're looking at an event planner tonight that the Bidens used to do this whole event, from the decor to the flowers. They didn't use the White House floral shop. And a fun fact here, Ana, also. They could not use the traditional presidential china that most presidents use for these kinds of dinners because it is happening in a tent on the South Lawn. So the White House curators, who are kind of sticklers about where and when the China can be used, said there's just too much risk involved to perhaps have some breakable historic China be taken down to the tent. So there are rentals tonight being used for things like the plates and the chargers and the linens and the glasses and all that stuff. So, it's definitely you're eating at the White House, but you're not -- you could be eating off of some rental plates. But that's just how it goes sometimes with these larger state dinners that need to be held outside of the State Dining Room. But, again, they are expensive, but it is an investment. The White House will tell you, it's an investment in our country's diplomacy and our relationship with France. It's all part of this whole entire pomp and circumstance that we're offering them this evening.",

It's significant that it's Biden's first state dinner and that he chose Macron to be the beneficiary of it.Of course, this is coming at a time when Germany has kind of faded into the background. Before, it was Angela Merkel holding together Europe, and she was the main European leader, the main kind of -- with Trump in office, the main one who was holding together the transatlantic order. With the U.K. in political disarray, still getting its shop back together after Liz Truss' tumultuous, very brief prime ministership, you have Macron emerging as the preeminent leader of the European continent. And you cannot understate how badly the U.S. needs Europe to stay united and behind the U.S. when it goes to bat against Russia in defending Ukraine, in going toe to toe with China in the Pacific. So, this is very important to keep the Europeans on board. And Macron is the point man there.",

We will talk to you more after the press conference.I want to get to this other news happening on the Hill right now, the fate of the economy heading into the holidays hanging on a fight over sick days. Here's the deal. Railroad workers want more paid sick time. But a bill aimed at dodging a strike being forced through Congress right now only gives them one day, one personal day. And the effort to add more doesn't appear to have enough Republican support in the Senate. Lawmakers now have this choice, stand by unions or keep trains running. Now, if the trains stopped for a strike, experts warn it could mean a billion-dollar hit to the U.S. economy in just the first week. Food and gas prices would rise. More than 750,000 Americans could temporarily lose their jobs. Let's get to Capitol Hill. CNN's Manu Raju is pressing lawmakers. Manu, the Senate could hold votes as early as today. Why isn't there enough support to give these rail workers more sick days?",

That amendment to do just that seems unlikely to be approved amid Democratic opposition. But they need to have an agreement to set up a vote because the United States Senate requires all 100 senators to agree to schedule a vote. Otherwise, the Senate majority leader needs to take time-consuming procedural steps that could take several days to play out if they do not reach an agreement among the -- all 100 senators. So that is what they have been negotiating, Ana, since last night into this morning about getting to a -- getting to some sort of resolution to schedule the votes. And Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, indicated to senators that they should not leave town .They should not leave town today, where they usually leave town on Thursday afternoons to go home for the weekend. They're -- he told them not to do that because they will stay in town until they get it done, because the economic impacts of a potential strike could be felt as soon as this weekend if they don't get a deal immediately, get a vote immediately, so a real sense of urgency in the Senate, even the lawmakers on both sides have concerns with this deal, concerns about voting for this deal, concerns about its lack of paid sick -- paid sick leave. His push now is just simply to get it done. We will see if they're able to do just that.",
