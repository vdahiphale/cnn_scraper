So, I think we are going to look to see if he does return when his lawyer is giving the statements.

Right now, also, a jury in Michigan is hearing more witness testimony and the jury is facing an unprecedented question. Should a mother be held criminally responsible after her son committed the worst school shooting in the state's history? Court today began with tension as Jennifer Crumbley's defense attorney argued with the judge over testimony. Now, you remember, she and her husband are charged after their son killed four of his classmates at Oxford High School in 2021. Their son, he will spend his life in prison after pleading guilty. Let's go back to today now and what's happening in court still. Jean Cazares has been following this very closely. And you've been watching all of these proceedings live. What's happening?",

But he admitted to psychiatrists that it was all a lie. That he had never said anything like that to his parents.

And just moments ago, he touted this PCE report saying that it is, \"An important milestone that means more breathing room for working families.\"Now, the way the president is going to try to convey this message is by hitting the road. And a clear example of that is his pitch in Wisconsin just yesterday, where he made the connection between his legislative accomplishments on infrastructure and a transit point between Wisconsin and Minnesota, and the fresh round of funding that was going to that bridge. That he called a vital link for the U.S. economy. And so, that is what he will be doing over the months to come. Is visiting different places, including battleground Wisconsin to make the connection to voters that what they are seeing and feeling on the ground is directly correlated to what he's done in Washington over the last three years. Now, his polling has shown that that hasn't quite resonated yet, and so this will be a challenge. But you can expect to hear from the White House over the course of today and in the months to come that there are positive indicators in the economy that voters will feel and perhaps feel a little brighter about moving into November.
