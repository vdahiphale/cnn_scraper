That's something that investigators had previously asked about. And now, they're sort of circling back, too. They're checking on it again with other witnesses. That's the kind of thing you would expect to see at the end of an investigation. You know, we know that they brought Rudy Giuliani in. They talked to him in a voluntary interview for two days. He is sort of a late in the game witness, another box for them to check late here. And we know that they have negotiated some sort of limited immunity deals with folks. Again, something you would expect to see later in the investigation. We also know, though, Alisyn, that there are a few witnesses out there that they haven't talked to yet.

It's consistent with statements that John Kelly made to \"The New York Times\" directly a few months ago about the same topic.The interesting development here, though, of course, is that he has made these same statements now under oath, under penalty of perjury, and apparently, they are backed up by notes that he took in these meetings where Trump made these requests about IRS investigations of Pete Strzok and Lisa Page. So that's a substantiated, you know, essentially a piece of evidence, if you will, in that argument. Of course, it rings a bell for me because I was the subject of a very rare and invasive IRS audit as was Jim Comey. You know, the likelihood of the two of us being subjected to the same sort of allegedly random audit is infinitesimally small although the postal service IG looked at this and didn't find any, I guess, particular suspicious things about it. I feel very differently about the conclusion. I don't think it's surprising to anyone that Donald Trump was trying to use his access to the levers of power in Washington to exact retribution against his perceived enemies, whether that's through the Department of Justice, through baseless criminal investigation like the one that was focused on me for two years, or through the IRS.

Half the party wants to do Trump and half wants to do something else. The half that wants to do something else, he has got the biggest chunk, but he hasn't been able to dispatch the other, you know, several people who got into the race.

Sharks are crepuscular, which means they hunt during dusk and dawn. So, choosing to avoid swimming during those times is a good idea.And then, of course, if you do encounter a shark, just stay calm because that panic, that splashing, that's what leads to the case of mistaken identity which sharks are biting people.
