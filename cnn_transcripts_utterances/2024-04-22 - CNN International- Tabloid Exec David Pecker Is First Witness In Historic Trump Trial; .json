A first witness on the stand in the people of the state of New York v. Donald J. Trump. In opening statements this morning, prosecutors recounted a salacious catch and kill scheme in which Trump, with help from a tabloid executive, paid to cover up an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels and falsified business records some 34 times in the process. Why? Prosecutors say to prevent a revelation that Trump feared could lose him the 2016 election. In the words of the prosecution, quote, it was election fraud, plain and simple. Trump's defense had a very different take, telling jurors, quote, I have a spoiler alert. There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy and his attorney introduced a different motive for those hush money payments saying, quote, Trump fought back to protect his family, his reputation and his brand. That is not a crime. A wrap for the day after brief testimony from the first witness in this trial that was David Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump's former tabloid media executive. His testimony will continue tomorrow, all just the beginning of this historic criminal trial of a former president and current candidate for president. Watching all of this with us, CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, let's begin with the prosecutions case here, because they are alleging not just an alleged affair, not just an attempt to hide that alleged affair, and not just an attempt to pay a person to hide that alleged affair, but that all of this was part of an effort to influence the election in a pattern of doing the same. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Something to aid Donald Trump's campaign. That's what prosecutors presented to the jury today. And were already starting to see that with David Pecker on the stand as the first witness, who was chairman of America Media Inc., the publisher of \"The National Enquirer\" that was an organization that wanted to do three things, the prosecutors say, make sure there were flattering stories about Donald Trump. Make sure that were negative stories about his opponents in 2016 in American politics, and to find, and get the rights and the country roll over stories of women, lemonade you might be coming out alleging affairs with him and to bury those stories. We are hearing from David Pecker already not just about what he is role was at American Media, Inc. He's talking about how he was somewhat a control of the very important stories related to celebrities. But we're going to see a whole ark that the prosecutors present from of how this media organization was being used and David Pecker at the very beginning in 2015, sat down with Donald Trump. Michael Cohen, his personal attorney and made an agreement with them that he could be the eyes and ears.",

POLANTZThat's where prosecutors can say in their openings in their closings what they want about Michael Cohen, question him, but the judge wants to make sure this trial is protected. Witnesses don't feel intimidation. Trump comes out in the hallway and says, Michael Cohen as a lawyer, he doesn't mention by name but clearly refers to him that he wasn't good in representing people and that he invoiced Donald Trump for his legal work and I got indicted.

Your -- tell us what the legal bar here is, for basically proving or deciding between the two arguments we saw from the prosecutors, this was an illegal attempt to influence the election.

There's something about those two to come together. I wasn't particularly enamored with the opening statement of the defense, I thought it was rather haphazard. I thought that it went from one thing to another thing without a real chronological order or any kind of semblance of organization. The defense attorney who is addressing them as more -- look more like a prosecutor who was just trying to answer a defendant's closing statement in rebuttal. I thought the opening statement of the state was very organized, very chronological. It was very direct. And I think it presented a lot of problems for the defense in this particular case.",

We want you to look here. We want you to look there and basically keep it short, which is why I think the defense opening statement was about half the length of the prosecutions. Because the prosecution carries the burden of proof, they need to get the jury on their side to start out with. The defendant only needs to poke holes in the case and try to find that one juror who buys their theory of the case. And that's all they're really looking.",

Stormy Daniels, too, remember, she did receive money in exchange for this.So credibility is always a central issue in the cross-examination of any witness. And when there's something to latch onto from a defense perspective, of course you do. I actually think David Pecker -- look, there's going to be a lot of messages or witness testimony that really lays out what this catch and kill plan was all about. And he's going to be the one that's going to be able to talk about that. And that's really important because of that issue of intent. Now from a defense perspective, you're going to say -- well, guess what? He has a non-prosecution agreement. He's an agreement with the prosecutors in order to testify, so that he is not, in fact, going to be indicted on something. So, that's always something that defense is going to bring up. But to that point, David Pecker has to be truthful. Truthfulness is a key component when it comes to a prosecution agreement. If he is not truthful on the stand then he does risk actually finding himself in legal hot water. So there's always a yin and a yang for lack of a better word to every single witness. But, of course, the defense goes hard on credibility, on cross-examination to any witness in this case.",

They keep basically just doing which tell him not to or don't do what you tell them to you have to get forceful. And I've had that circumstance where it came within about a hairs breadth of putting a lawyer in jail and then all of a sudden, he decides -- he was calling around saying, am I -- is he really got to put me in jail? And other judges were saying, yes, you're defying him in open court. Yes. You're going to go to jail and that's when he did exactly what I told him he should do.

Because he himself went down to the area around Gaza, but a week after October 7, and actually talked about the failures, talked about the unit under his command, the intelligence unit had failed in its most basic tasks to the people that they had not done the job that the war was this, this war had begun, begun as a result of an intelligence failure. And he laid out it very explicitly that that was an intelligence unit under his command. So he really did take ownership of it at that moment. It was sort of in something of a slowdown and a pause in the war in Gaza. A lot of the troops are out. It's far from over, but perhaps this is why were getting this resignation now, we may here for more. He's not out of the job. He's just waiting for his replacement to be assigned before he actually leaves. But I think this tells you a lot about the military command who've had an investigation, internal investigation to make sure that they don't make similar mistakes because the war is still going on, as opposed to political resignation. So which there have been none and many people would hold the prime minister possible to -- responsible, but to your point, specifically, it was very well-documented that some of the junior staff on the front line, the gathering intelligence, saw Hamas training, even in that paragliders, reported it up the chain of command, and it was ignored, and not acted upon.
