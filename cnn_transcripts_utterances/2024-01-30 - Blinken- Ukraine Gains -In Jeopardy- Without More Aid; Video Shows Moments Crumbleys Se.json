It's missing. He calls up and he turns in his son to law enforcement authorities. He calls the sheriff's department.

So they are there for a while and I think we have that video just with the investigators, and you can hear them talking a little bit. It's hard to understand. But Jennifer says he's never done anything bad before. And then James starts talking about the math sheet. Remember, he was on the math sheet. He put bullets, blood everywhere -- my life is useless -- that morning. And she stops him. She says I think we need an attorney. And so, that's when it stopped. And I think it was because he was implicating his son with that drawing. Then it comes to the point where they're going to go in to see their son who is handcuffed to a chair. Let's listen.
