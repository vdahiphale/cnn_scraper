Two groups of anti-Putin Russians are claiming responsibility for the attackers. Ukrainian officials denied any direct involvement. Well, in Moscow a hearing for jailed Wall Street Journal Reporter Evan Gershkovich to decide whether he stays behind bars until his trial. 16 years after she disappeared police in Portugal are looking for new evidence in the case of Madeleine McCann. Investigators are searching around a dam 50 kilometers from where the little girl vanished. And police in Spain have arrested seven people over racist abuse directed at Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr., Spain's LA LIGA announcing today it is trying to change the laws to better fight racism. We begin with Russia responding to what it calls an act of sabotage on its own soil. Moscow claims it is now eliminated the fighters that carried out Monday's raid in the Belgorod region just across the border from Ukraine. It says more than 70 of those fighters were killed and the rest were pushed back into Ukrainian territory. Well, the Kremlin refers the attackers as Ukrainians though Kyiv denies any involvement. Two groups of anti-Putin Russian nationals are actually claiming responsibility. One Ukrainian official saying they are Russians who want to get rid of the darkness in their country. Let's start this part of the show with CNN's Matthew Chance who has the details for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russian forces insist that taking back control from a group of what they call saboteurs infiltrating this leafy border these images purporting to show a Russian soldier detaining three of them with broadcasts on statement. Meet the anti-Kremlin Russians now taking the fight back home. This is how we work he says amid a bold armored raid across the Ukrainian border into Russia itself. CNN can't independently verify any of the images. But this entire column of vehicles was spotted crossing the frontier. Ukrainian forces insist it's not them but exiled Russian groups fighting against the Kremlin.",

You can tell that in all the statements from Dimitri Peskov, you can tell that from other Russian officials as well, like, for instance, the Defense Ministry Spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, who's also calling the people that crossed the border, Ukrainian nationalists. Now we know from them if they say that they are Russians, and they are fighting against Vladimir Putin. But for the Russians, it's very important to keep up this message that they've been trying to put out that essentially, these are people who are sent by Ukraine, from the Ukrainians to do the bidding of Ukraine. And I thought one of the things that I heard earlier today by Demetri Peskov was extremely interesting, where he essentially used this incident to try and justify Russia's wider invasion of Ukraine, this all-out war that's been going on here for such a very long time, where he said that all of the shows that Russia is under attack by Ukraine, and that Russia needs to fight back with what it called a special military operation. I think that's also one of the reasons why you're seeing these big denials coming from so many Ukrainians over the past 24 hours as well. I spoke to the National Security Adviser earlier today. And he also said, look, we have absolutely nothing to do with this. Yes, these Russians are fighting on our side in Ukraine. But what they do when they crossed the border into Russia is something that they do independently. But I do think that for the Russians, it's extremely important to portray this as something that is not something an uprising or something coming from inside Russia, but something that's being fomented by the Ukrainians, Becky.",

I think it shows that, at least to the Ukrainians, and certainly shows to many Russians as well, thatthere are weaknesses, certainly in that border area. And I mean, one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that this border area is extremely important to the Russians, the border area there in Belgorod. It's right across from Kharkiv, which of course, is an extremely important Ukrainian city. But the Russians have tried to take several times in this war and have failed so far. But if you look at the border area, and actually had the chance to spend a lot of time in that border area, right when the war started. There are a lot of Russian military bases there. And Belgorod itself is a city that is extremely militarized, that also has a lot of military bases that are in that area as well, and from where the Russians are running a lot of their operations inside Ukraine. So certainly, this is a big significance that in that highly militarized and very important area right on the border with Ukraine that these pro- Russians or these Russians were able to get in there and also stay there for such an extended period of time. And we're talking over 24 hours that this has now been going on. And the Russians just now just a couple of minutes ago, actually, before we went to air have said that they are now ending what they call that counter terror operation that they've had going on there with the residents still not being able to return home Becky.",

And I think it really showed just how difficult thesituation is for the Ukrainians who are fighting there on the ground and some of the suffering by the Ukrainian troops that has been going on for such a very long time there in Bakhmut. One of the things that I think the Russians really are trying to play up is the significance of Bakhmut that day now, obviously control large parts of the Ukrainian say they still have part of it. But it certainly doesn't appear as though Bakhmut is a strategic victory for the Russians. Right now they seem to have most of that city, but that city is surrounded by high ground, so it's going to be very difficult for them to advance any further. The big question is when will the Ukrainian start their larger counter offensive that so many people have been talking about? They seem to have the weapons for that in place, the Western main battle tanks, the Western infantry fighting vehicles, a lot of Western artillery as well, the big question are they trained up enough to not only use those weapons, but to use them in a combined way with one another for an attack against some very well fortified Russian positions. Now, earlier today, as I said, I was with the National Security Adviser of Ukraine, and he told me that they have a plan. They are working according to their plan. But the final decision obviously will be made by the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and of course, also some of his top officers and generals as well. It's unclear when exactly that is going to be. But certainly it's going to be an extremely tough fight. And on the whole at this point in time, I would say, Becky, for the Russians, things are looking extremely difficult on the battlefield for while they might be able to hold some of the positions that they currently have. Right now, no one's really talking about larger Russian advances or Russian victories, and no one has been for a very long time. So that's certainly something that must be cause of concern for a lot of Russians and certainly for the folks in the Kremlin as well, Becky.",

Well, a Moscow courthas just extended the pretrial detention that the American journalist Evan Gershkovich. The preceding was closed to the media, the Wall Street Journal Reporter is being held in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison charged with spying which he denies and which his paper called a baseless claim. CNN's U.S. Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood is following the story for us and that news just coming in, what more do we know at this point? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that this pre- trial extension is going to last through August 30th. That is, according to the news, just in from the court ruling on this, this is something that his team wanted. What it means, I believe is that Gershkovich isn't going to actually move to a different location while he is being kept in jail during this pre- trial detention period. He's going to be in the same jail that he has been in. But significantly, U.S. officials have not been able to visit him since he has been in that jail. Twice now the Russians have turned down the U.S. request for consular access. That's really required by you know, international law and U.S. officials have been pushing to have access to him while he is in jail. What we're going to wait to learn a little bit more from this court hearing today is who was allowed into the room? |You were saying that this was closed to the media. So we don't have any images from inside the courtroom like we had with a previous trial that he had. But one thing that's important to see is just which diplomats were allowed, if any, because they have been turning down these requests for consular access to U.S. diplomats. And significantly his parents actually arrived at the courtroom earlier today with his Russian lawyer. Of course, that's very interesting, because our understanding is that, you know, these parents of his live in the United States, so they would have had to travel over to Russia for this hearing. So that is a really fascinating development, something that we don't typically see for wrongfully detained Americans as they're going through this Russian court, legal proceeding process because it can be dangerous for them. You know, to travel over there while this process is ongoing, but of course they felt that it was important to be able to see their son today and we'll look to learn more about you know what they say after that.",

This is not the first time this area has been searched. Today's activity comes after police received a tip. Scott McLean has more on the investigation and the prolonged mystery surrounding Madeline's disappearance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Madeleine McCann would have turned 20 this month. Her family last saw her when she was three. She disappeared in 2007 during a family holiday in the Algarve region of Portugal. She was with her younger twin siblings while her parents were dining with friends nearby in the resort of Pride Deluce (ph). The mystery of her disappearance gripped many across the UK, Portugal and Germany. On Tuesday, Portuguese Police at the request of German authorities will search a reservoir near the Portuguese City of Silves around 50 kilometers from Pride Deluce. Over the past 16 years police have searched numerous wells and properties in the area, including this one, which was searched in 2008. It is unclear whether it's connected to Christian Brueckner the German suspect first named in the case in 2020. Brueckner a convicted sex offender lived in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 in an apartment about a mile away from the resort where the McCann's were staying. He's in prison in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman committed in Portugal at the same resort. He has not been charged in McCann's disappearance and denies any involvement. But one German prosecutor said he believes she was killed by Brueckner.",

And you know why nowthat they've decided to go and look there. According to Portuguese Police sources, they say that they're trying to find evidence of Christian Brueckner. The suspect in this case is potential activities in that area. But we're talking about a very vast scrub land surrounding a very vast reservoir; it seems like a needle in the haystack. They also have already searched this particular reservoir back in 2008, just one year after this happened. And in that case, they recovered some bones, it turns out, they were only animal bones. And so now they're revisiting this site for reasons that we still don't have a clear answer as to why? The German prosecutor in this case said that this is not in vain. He said that they are there on the basis of certain indications, but he couldn't say why? He couldn't say what they're looking for, in particular, there? And I should also point out that there are divers there are, there are boats on the site. But it seems like most of the searching at this stage of the game Becky has been taking place on land around the reservoir. It seems like prosecutors in this case also have some amount of circumstantial evidence, it seems that the physical evidence may be part of the difficulty. Circumstantial evidence, like his cell phone being in the area at the time of this crime, the fact that he tried to reregister one of his vehicles just a day later, and his story has changed as well. But under German law, the prosecutor has made clear that he needs to be able to convince a judge in Germany, that in fact, he will be able to secure a conviction before he can even lay charges in this case, clearly, they haven't got there quite yet.",

There were early missteps by the police, they were accused of not securing the crime scene early enough. They are accused of not putting roadblocks across the area for any potential suspect with the child to actually get out. And the Portuguese Police ended up actually closing the case back in 2008, a year later. And there were for years, the only people that were actually investigating this case actively were the McCann's themselves. It seems like part of what has kept this going is the fact that David Cameron's government, the Former British Prime Minister, set aside a certain amount of money, it's now more than $15 million to this point, to actually keep this case alive to keep investigating this case and it has led us in part to where we are right now, with this naming of a suspect but still no charges, Becky.",

Just take a look at this impressive, visible satellite imagery. Now this was taken a few hours ago. But you can see straight through the eye all the way to the bottom part of the Western Pacific Ocean that is called the stadium effect. Meteorologists look for that as a sign of how powerful the storm actually is. So here are the details. 155 miles per hour that makes this an equivalent to a high end category 4 Atlantic hurricane. It is teetering on a category 5 that is just impressive. If it crosses that category 5 threshold, it will make it the fifth category 5 hurricane or typhoon equivalent across the planet and we on average have five in an entire year and it's the month of May right so that's impressive in its own right. Now the eye is kind of filled in. We're going through what is called an \"Eyewall Replacement Cycle\", but you can clearly see it on radar. This is Guam's radar. The storm is currently located about 130 miles to the south and east of the Andersen Air Force Base, which is on the Island of Guam. And as we zoom in a little bit closer, you'll start to see that the outer rain bands already starting to lash the island here with strong winds, heavy rainfall and of course the storm surge threat that is going to continue to build into the overnight hours. By the way, the strongest part of the storm mid-morning on Wednesday, local time for Guam will coincide with high tide that will occur so that will exacerbate the problems. Here is the latest winds you can see Andersen Air Force Base 25 miles per hour gusting to 40 miles per hour. So here's the storm surge threat. This is not a typhoon. This is direct from the National Weather Service Guam's homepage 20 to 25 feet of coastal storm surge right in those very vulnerable East facing shorelines depending on the exact track of where the storm goes. Keep in mind this is a volcanic island. So not a lot of communities on the coastline but 20 to 25 feet that's impressive 6 to 10 elsewhere, that will certainly inundate homes and businesses. On top of that part of this triple threat I mentioned earlier, is the inland flood threat. We have the potential for 10 to 15 inches with locally higher amounts over the next three days. That's over 300 millimeters of rainfall. So the potential here to lead to catastrophic flooding, landslides and mudslides does exist with the passage of this super typhoon. So we've got two of the three threats that are facing Guam. What about the winds? The hobbyists, right? We don't want to forget that. Winds gusting on Wednesday morning and into the afternoon hours over 115 miles per hour that is just impressive. That has the ability to take down any structures that don't have any concrete reinforcement for instance. And get this as the storm crosses Guam, it has the potential to reach Category Five status and then it's off to the races as it enters the Western Pacific because water temperatures here are warm and they are like jet fuel for strengthening and maintaining typhoons or hurricanes of this stature. We have a storm that's going to maintain or if not slightly increase its strength going forward over the next five days. You can see the water temperatures here. That is just impressive. So we have to watch out the Philippines into Taiwan. That is a future forecast but something that we are going to monitor very closely here, Becky in the weather center for potential impacts into Southeast Asia going forward Becky.",

Ogan said in his speech that you heard earlier here on this show that the nation alliance, that is the alliance that your party has gotten to dealt with, could not offer a perspective that would convince us about the future. Looking back, could things have been done differently? Because at the end of the day, what he's pointing out is that he doesn't want to see a divided presidency and parliament, you are a parliamentarian yourself. You've been elected reelected.

The opposition candidate, Kilicdaroglu, who is a member of the same party that you are, has really been veering to the right on some issues particularly that of sending Syrian refugees back home. That is coming across as somewhat desperate, in an attempt, it seems at least, and correct me if I'm wrong, to try and woo these nationalist anti- immigrant voters.
