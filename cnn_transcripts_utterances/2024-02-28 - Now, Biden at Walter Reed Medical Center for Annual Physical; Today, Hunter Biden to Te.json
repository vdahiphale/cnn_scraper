Dr. Sanjay Gupta is standing by to weigh in. Meanwhile, up on Capitol Hill, Hunter Biden is testifying. What we're learning about the president's son and what he's going to say behind closed doors. And disaster in Northern Texas, wildfires are raging across the panhandle as communities are scrambling to evacuate. One resident tell CNN it looks like Armageddon. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington and this is the news right now. And we begin with the breaking news. President Biden at Walter Reed Medical Center right now for his annual physical, marking what is likely to be his last update on his health before the 2024 election. Joining me now is CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz and our Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Arlette, let me go to you first. What do you think we're going to hear from the White House about this visit?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, President Biden has been at Walter Reed Medical Center for about 40 minutes now. And the White House says that they will provide a summary of his annual physical upon his completion a little bit later today.This typically takes several hours, so we likely won't be seeing the president back here at the White House until a little later in the morning or in the early afternoon. We're also expecting for him to deliver some remarks when it comes to the issue of combating crime in American communities. But this comes as the president, as his physical fitness and his age have been under scrutiny in the 2024 campaign. Now, this is an annual routine physical that the president is undergoing. He did one back in 2021 and also around this time in 2023. At that point, his physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, in his summary, after the physical, said that the president was healthy, vigorous and fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency. But many will be watching this physical and the results very closely at a time where his age has come under scrutiny. The president is 81 years old, the oldest to ever serve as president. If he's elected for a second term, he would be 86 at the end of that term. And this comes, as you have heard, his Republican opponents really try to hammer away at the president's issues when it comes to his age, when it comes to his memory. And there is some concern from some American voters as well. If you take a look at a recent Quinnipiac poll, it found that only a third of voters think that the president has a physical fitness and the mental fitness to serve a second term in the White House. So, many will be closely watching to see what exactly this physical will outline. One thing that some of his Republican opponents have noted is that they think the president should take a cognitive test. But cognitive tests really haven't been a part of these presidential physical examinations in the past. Ultimately, that is something up to the patients and their doctor as well. And in the past, the White House has said that they didn't feel that this was warranted. But everyone or many will be watching for the president's results very closely as he's undergoing this annual routine of physical over at Walter Reed. We expect to know a little bit later this afternoon about how it went.",

      "sentences": "All right. Arlette, thank you very much.Let me go to Dr Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, Arlette was just saying, you know, Biden had this physical around this time last year. What is your sense of it? What are we going to learn about the president's health from this physical? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  I think probably similar to last year, Jim, we'll get a written summary at some point. I don't think that they'll make the medical team available for questions. In the summary, we'll sort of look at what a routine physical really sort of hones in on. So, we know, for example, from 2023, we know, as Arlette said, that he was felt to be healthy and vigorous, also taking a statin medication. He's on a medication to prevent blood clots, known as Eliquis. That's because of his atrial fibrillation. His gait, his walking, has changed a lot over the years. Last year, they said that was primarily due to spinal arthritis and some arthritis in his foot, as well as some neuropathy. So, these are the sorts of things we are likely to hear. It's typically not very -- it's not -- there's not a lot there, Jim, in terms of overall medical information. It's a very typically a brief sort of summary, unless there's some sort of concern. [10:05:06] Obviously, we hope to hear it if there is. Lab tests and stuff like that are done as well. A lot has been made, as Arlette was talking about, regarding cognitive testing. I will tell you that just to give you some context, Jim, about 16 percent of seniors who go in for routine physicals get some sort of cognitive testing. So, the majority of people do not, and it's typically something that is directed by the doctor. The doctor says, hey, look, I have some concern. Let's screen for any kind of cognitive problems. What you're looking at on the screen there, Jim, you may remember this, this is the Montreal cognitive assessment. This is the one President Trump took a few years ago, said it scored a 30 out of 30 on that. I'm just leaving it up on the screen for a couple of minutes. People can get a sense of what this test is like. You're connecting numbers and letters. You're drawing a three-dimensional cube. You're drawing the clock hand of a certain time. You're having a test of memory. That's what it does. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes and serves as a screening tool, not diagnostic, but a screening tool that would actually lead people to do further testing.",

And I'm just curious, how is President Biden, when it comes to revealing what is going on with his health versus Donald Trump? I mean, that was one of the issues when Trump was in the White House. They were not so revealing about how his health is doing. And that became an issue back then.",

It's been usually a very brief sort of paragraph summary of things, the medications they're on and any specific issues that they're dealing with, something as simple as allergies to, as I mentioned with President Biden's case, the gait, the spinal arthritis that he has that causes him to walk the way that he does. But it's usually not very detailed, Jim.I'll tell you just as a side note, you and I worked here a long time. Back in 2008, Senator McCain was running for president. He was 71 at the time. At that point he picked a couple of us to go review all of his medical records. There was some several thousand pages of medical records and he said, look, I just want to be as open and transparent as possible. So, he gave us a few hours to review that and come to our own conclusions. Really, we haven't seen that over the last 15 years or so now.",

In the meantime, right now, a pivotal moment up on Capitol Hill as Hunter Biden is about to face off, the Republicans behind closed doors. They will finally get their chance to question the president's son for their impeachment inquiry into the president following months of tense negotiations and some key concessions.

And in light of that, they're anxious to try and distract from that and to salvage what they can from the questions of Hunter Biden.I think Hunter Biden and his team are probably rather looking forward to this. They've negotiated very smart conditions, no videos, transcripts have to be released in full pretty much simultaneously, so there can't be any political spinning taking things out of context. So, substance-wise, I don't think they're going to get much, but they will do as much as possible on the optics side.",

And in Texas, they measure both time and distance on a football field. So, imagine 150 football fields a minute being consumed by this fire, a couple of seconds. It's moving so fast.
