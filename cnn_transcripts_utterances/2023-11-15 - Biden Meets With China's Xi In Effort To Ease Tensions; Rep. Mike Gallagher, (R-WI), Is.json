Could this go all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court?And leading this hour, President Biden and Xi Jinping may be all smiles in front of the cameras but there is simmering tension behind the scenes from spy balloons to cyberattacks to military showdowns and trade wars. Friction as leaders of these two worlds superpowers meets. The White House just announced the Biden Xi meeting has wrapped up. And CNN's David Culver joins us now from California. David, are you hearing anything about how this meeting went? The meeting started, obviously, with reasonably optimistic statements and smiles by both leaders.",

The two will dine together, no doubt, continued discussions. But you mentioned that optimistic tone starting things off. And we expected that from President Biden, there's a bit more transparency on the U.S. side going into this. Of course, they wanted to cool some of those tensions. It's another issue off his plate if he can essentially stabilize things between the U.S. and China. What surprised me was President Xi, in his opening remarks, he actually even spoke a little bit longer than President Biden. Here's a little bit of what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES; We have to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict. And we also have to manage it responsibly, that competition. PRES. XI JINPING, CHINA (through translator): It is an objective fact that China and the United States are different in history, culture, social system and development path. However, as long as they respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation, they will be fully capable of rising above differences. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And what we have seen in the past 24 hours are glowing headlines and remarks, cherishing people to people, exchanges between the U.S. and China, revisiting President Xi's past trips in a almost romanticizing way, and seemingly very hopeful. And that's important because, obviously, we know it's heavily controlled by the CCP.So it's, in many ways, an indication of what the sentiment is from the leadership. But the one headline, and you can see the underwater (ph) call, it goes on to say that flying across the Pacific and feeling the warmth, current of people to people exchange between China and the United States.

The lab contain 1000s of vials of biological substances and mice used for testing subsequent inspections, determined labels on some of the vials said in Mandarin and encode that they contain infectious pathogens, including the AIDS virus and COVID and tuberculosis and the deadliest known form of malaria.

I mean, you need an identification, a driver's license to get Sudafed in a local pharmacy, but you don't need even that to get Ebola online.

I would also say I think our intelligence community needs to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the very opaque connections between PRC nationals, you know, businesses, United Front Work Department organizations, it can be very complicated to unpack that at times.

The IDF released this video claiming to show where Hamas terrorists hid and stash their weapons. We should note, this is video being released by the IDF, the Israeli military, we cannot independently verify the contents as CNN is not on the ground there. Al-Shifa hospital officials have not yet commented on this.What is clear, conditions in this hospital are horrendous. Doctors are trying to keep the hospital running. They are running out of fuel and supplies. Not to mention, there are reports of being interrogated by the IDF. Given the risk to civilian safety, Israel is under pressure to show proof of whether there has been any indication of terrorists or hostages held there.

His grandparents on both sides were survivors of the Holocaust. And they luckily made their way to Israel, and were the founders of the country. R.
