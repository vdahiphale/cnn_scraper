Here in Kherson, along the southern banks, we've been hearing intermittent shelling for much of the day. A town that was liberated from Russia over a year ago now.But the bad news, it seems potentially increasing from Avdiivka. That was liberated over the weekend. Liberated, I used the phrase Russian forces would use there. They withdrew, the Ukrainians, from there on Saturday. Now, since then, we've heard from both Ukrainian commanders and also the commander of Russian forces in general in Ukraine, Valeti Asamov (ph), appears to have been near that area meeting soldiers who took part in that particular operation, and also it seems hearing of future plans to advance. So, suggestions on both sides there that the Russians have, in Avdiivka, adequate forces to potentially push further forward in that direction. Bad news too around Robotyne in the south. That was a tiny village. A key gain of Ukraine's southern counter offensive. That's under, it seems, intense. Russian pressure. And also very confusing reports about a very small village not far from where I'm standing on the left bank of the Dnipro River. That's the part still held by Russia. Now, Krynky is a place that's long been talked about over months, a Ukrainian operation to try and form a bridgehead, like a foothold on the other side of the river to try and launch a new phase of operations has long been talked about. Well, Russia's defense chief yesterday suggested that, in fact, Russia had taken control of that again after many months of Ukrainian troops putting their lives on the line there. Ukraine denies that, but it's yet another source of potential issues for Ukraine in the months ahead as that aid really seems to be changing things on the battlefield here by not arriving.",

But the Russian criminal justice system has a pretty solid conviction rates and a due process that many frown upon as a forgone conclusion. So, deep concerns over that U.S.- Russian dual national.

New Mexico workplace safety regulations hold the armorer responsible for storage, maintenance, and handling of all firearms and ammunition on the set, as well as loading firearms.

But, you know, a journalists would -- would perhaps have taken out the public interest elements of those documents and then broadcast them, as opposed to dumping the whole lot.
