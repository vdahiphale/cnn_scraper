Democrats blaming on the state's abortion ban and now propelling her story to the front of the presidential race. All the while, Donald Trump and Republicans say women won't even have to worry about abortion. Family's response to that tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"It's the issue that got Nikki Haley asking tonight, are you trying to lose the election? I'm talking about abortion. The issue has become Donald Trump's Achilles heel. And new polling suggests tonight that it's costing him some votes, as he and Republicans up and down the ballot struggle to land on a message to defend the fallout from the end of Roe vs. Wade. Case in point, the GOP Senate candidate in Ohio said this at a town hall last week in newly uncovered audio. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERNIE MORENO, REPUBLIAN OHIO SENATE CANDIDATE (voice-over): There's a lot of suburban women, a lot of suburban women that are like, \"listen, abortion is it. If I can't have an abortion in this country whenever I want, I will vote for anybody else.\" Okay, a little crazy by the way, but -- especially for women that are like past 50 -- I'm thinking to myself, I don't think that's an issue for you.

Of course, our interests are wide and varied and far-reaching. But you have to be a fool to think that it doesn't matter to women, including those above the age of 50.This new CNN poll showing women breaking towards Harris, who has been hammering Trump day after day on, you guessed it, abortion rights. Now, it's not a small margin. She's ahead with women by 10 points. Harris is trying to seize the momentum. She's now vowing to even use the nuclear option in the Senate and get rid of the barrier blocking the passage of a bill that could codify abortion rights. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (voice-over): I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe. And get us to the point where we, 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.

Glad to have you all here. Look, we were all listening. My heart still is racing from hearing from Amber Thurman's family about what happened to her at that hospital.

Wade, right?We've heard many stories of women being turned away from emergency rooms or being denied life-saving care in hospitals because doctors are struggling to interpret these laws. And I think it's not surprising that the more people hear about the impact of these laws, especially on women, the more salient of an issue this becomes for voters and for the American electorate. It's not just an issue for women. I've talked to many moderate and suburban voters who also include men who think about what if this was my daughter, what if this was my wife, or what if this was my sister. So, I think that it's part of why you've seen in the 2022 midterms and potentially now in the upcoming November election abortion continuously ranking in the top three issues for voters at the polls.",

I don't think most voters want the government to utilize compulsory force to dictate what they can or cannot do with their bodies. I'm a conservative, I have very disparate views on this particular issue, but I'm very, very cautious about utilizing government to be restrictive in this form.With that said, the recent CNN poll that came out had some interesting data. Trump is ahead of Vice President Harris about four or five points, with white women in particular. I thought that was fascinating. Also, in terms of who do you believe support issues that best align with your views, Donald Trump is ahead of the vice president on that front as well. So, this suggests some very interesting strengths for the former president if he can stick to other issues such as the economy and immigration and stay away from the reproductive issues.",

And they're tired of hearing that they can't get past a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. That's not good enough for them. You've seen that on issues like gun violence, you see it on issues like abortion access. In fact, with a lot of these issues, when you put them on the ballot at the state level, even in conservative states, you've seen voters take steps to protect abortion access.

Well, it all started with the real estate management company denying requests to fix up their buildings in Aurora, Colorado. The reason? They claimed that Venezuelan gangs had taken them over. That claim was then repeated by the mayor and a city council member.Then this video went viral, showing armed men in an Aurora apartment complex. Now CNN has not been able to corroborate the video. But Donald Trump and right-wing media, they have seized on it. And when the mayor tried to walk the narrative back, the narrative had already taken hold, and a strong one at that. Now, I want to bring in the mayor of Aurora, Colorado, Mike Coffman. Mayor Coffman, thank you for joining me this evening. Many people remember seeing this video and everything that transpired after that. I do wonder, Mayor Coffman, what is your message to the former president about the claims that he is making about your city?",
