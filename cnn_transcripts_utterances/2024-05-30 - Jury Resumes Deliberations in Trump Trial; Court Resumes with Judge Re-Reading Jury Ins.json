One of the things that they had asked for was David Pecker's testimony about a Trump Tower meeting. They also asked for Michael Cohen's testimony about the same Trump Tower meeting. I talked to a number of legal experts who said that could be them trying to corroborate Michael Cohen's testimony know that the defense painted him as somebody who did not tell the truth.But when it comes to David Pecker, the interesting thing about a lot of his testimony was the fact that the prosecution focused so heavily on it in the closing arguments. They called it damning. They said that it was critical to the crime that was being committed. So, that might play into why exactly they were calling to rehear some of the portions of David Pecker's testimony. Again, these were people who were friends, Donald Trump and David Pecker, for decades. Pecker himself testifying that he believed that Donald Trump did not want these stories out there in \"The National Enquirer\" because of the campaign, not necessarily because of his family.",

      "sentences": "They have no idea. They have no idea. I think right now it's a guessing game. One of the things I reported last night was that they've been trying to read the tea leaves with the jury. We know that they brought in, as you mentioned, several different lawmakers, donors, allies. One of the things that those people were doing when they were observing was observing the jury and relaying back to the Trump team what they saw. Some lawmakers who were more recognizable said that they thought some of the jurors looked at them favorably. They said at least one juror, they believed, was nodding along with Todd Blanche, essentially when he was questioning Michael Cohen. Now, they will be the first to admit they have no idea if this isaccurate and if it's true or if these people were just being polite and making eye contact. But it goes to show you how little anybody knows. They're grasping at straws to try to kind of glean any information they can about where this jury's head is at. H COLLINS: Yes, and as we've heard from other trial attorneys, you know, they've thought certain jurors were on their side, only to find out that was actually the one who pushed them over the line. Paula, the - you know, we already know part of what this court reporter is going to be reading back to - to the jury, and they don't have transcripts of the testimony in front of them, which is interesting because they do have a laptop that has the exhibits of the evidence on there, but they don't have the actual testimony that they can read through themselves. But we do know part of it is, you know, when there were questions about with - between David Pecker and Dylan Howard and question - who was also working for him at \"The National Enquirer.\" And he was asking about that Trump Tower meeting and how they set it up. And, of course, that was the infamous meeting in the August of 2015, right before Trump - when Trump was becoming a candidate, where they were talking about this deal that they had hatched where David Pecker would be the eyes and ears for the Trump campaign.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And this is such a key moment because prosecutors argue this was the first step in this alleged conspiracy. And the fact that they're asking about this specific testimony, it suggests that they're going through the case chronologically. Why? Well, because, obviously, Michael Cohen testified to a lot. David Pecker testified to a lot. But the Trump Tower meeting back in 2015, when prosecutors did their closing, they argued that this is where the conspiracy began. That they all agreed that they were going to try to suppress negative stories. Why? To help Trump win in 2016.And that's really significant for the prosecutor's case because they've charged the eventual falsifying of business records as a felony because they said all of this was done as part of a conspiracy to help Trump win in 2016. So, this request, again, it suggests that the jury probably went in there, took a poll on all the charges, maybe reviewed their instructions, and started at the beginning. That also tells us that we could be here for a few days.",

And the jury can only communicate with the judge via a note, which is also complicates this process. That's why he wasn't clear if they wanted all of the jury instructions read back to them or just part of it. Hopefully they have clarity on that.And I should note, we're waiting any moment now for this to begin underway in court. But another part was about Karen McDougal and a conversation that David Pecker had with Donald Trump but Karen McDougal where called - Trump called to him. He said he was in his office. His assistant transferred the call. And Trump said, I spoke to Michael, referring to Michael Cohen, and he said, I wanted to talk to you about Karen McDougal. And he was asking if there was some group that's out there interested in buying her story for $8 million. David Pecker said he didn't think it was true, but he did tell Trump he thought he should buy her story. Ultimately, of course, David Pecker bought it. But it's interesting that that is also something that the jury is interested in because all of that was talking about really just the efforts all related to the - to the campaign itself.",

But I think as they have this red back, now that we know there are deliberations, I think the prosecutors, the defense team, the reporters, it's just natural. Everyone's going to be watching them.

The - now the jury has sent another note to the court inside this case, just about eight minutes ago. It is 9:32 a.m. Our reporters inside the room said that the judge announced that they had received another note. This note has two requests in it. What remains to be seen is what those requests are from this jury. What else they need a clarification on or what else they would like to have repeated to them. Already they've asked for the judge to reread the jury instructions to them. The jury instructions that he spent about an hour on yesterday. They also wanted to hear key parts of testimony from too critical witnesses in this case, David Pecker, the tabloid king from \"The National Enquirer,\" and also Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer. So, we are waiting to see, Paula and Kristen, what these two requests are. But - but, I mean, if the jury just got back in the room this morning, they already have two requests. Right now Judge Merchan says the jury requests - he reread the jury instructions beginning with how it considers facts and what inferences can be drawn from them. So, that was closer to the end of the jury instructions. Maybe midway through from yesterday, if I remember correctly. And it was essentially, you know, the question is, what is - what's the part of the jury instructions that they're confused by or maybe there's some disagreement and they just wanted to have it repeated so they could all be on the same page.",

And the judge has said that he'll include all the disputed testimony.So, now they're going to go through and he says he's going to read pages six to 35 of the jury instructions. And I'm skipping ahead on the side stream. But that's a considerable amount of what he read yesterday. I mean that's almost half the jury instructions that he's going to have to read back.

I think they're probably debating right now. Look, there's - there's not - if they don't believe Michael Cohen, right, then how - then how do they get there? And they have to get there through circumstantial evidence. And I think that's probably the internal debate going on right now. There are probably some jurors that are saying, I don't think it gets there. There are probably some other saying, yes, it does.And as they continued to deliberate, they're going to want to hear so that - so that one - no matter what camp you're in, in that - in that jury room, you know, they - you're going to - they're going to want to hear, you know, what the judge has to say, what the instructions are as it relates to that circumstantial evidence so that they can try to come to some agreement.",

You can take out the factual piece, I mean what was allegedly falsified, whether it was an invoice or a check, but the elements are what's critical. And if they're asking for the circumstantial evidence and they're - want to know all this readback in terms of the jury instructions, it tells me to - you know, the point that was just made, it doesn't mean that everyone is on one side.
