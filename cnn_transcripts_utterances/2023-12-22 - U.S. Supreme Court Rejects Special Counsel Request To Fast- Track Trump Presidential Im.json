Special counsel rejected, turned down by the U.S. Supreme Court to hear immunity for the former president right now as opposed to later on. The decision as we learn of new evidence of Trump's alleged efforts to try and overturn the 2020 election, a recorded audiotape of him pressuring two election officials in Michigan. Plus, an American hostage killed by Hamas. Seventy-three-year-old Gadi Haggai, the news broke this morning, making at least 54 Americans killed by Hamas since and including October the 7th. Is President Biden doing enough to bring home those Americans still captive? And unprecedented number of immigrants coming across the U.S. border as President Biden makes an urgent call to Mexico to help manage the situation. (MUSIC)",

I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with breaking news that could and, and will have major legal and political implications when it comes to the 2024 presidential race. The U.S. Supreme Court has just rejected a request by the special counsel Jack Smith. Smith wanted to have them urgently decide the matter of whether Donald Trump has immunity for the crimes he allegedly committed while he was still president. Instead, the justices want the issue to play out in the lower courts at least for now. This is a huge win for Donald Trump. It means that federal election subversion trial could be delayed. This ruling comes just hours after a story in \"The Detroit News\" which reviewed recordings that until now we did not know existed of Donald Trump allegedly pressuring local officials in Michigan to not sign the certification of the results of the 2020 election in Wayne County, Michigan. That's the most populous part of the state. We're going to cover every angle of both of these developments starting with CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, walk us through the U.S. Supreme Court's decision here?",

But there are denying, they're saying we're not going to weigh in yet on this issue of presidential immunity, can a former president be immune from going to trial because he's being prosecuted for some things that have happened while he was in office. That's what Trump is saying that he should be immune from trial. Ultimately here, though, the Supreme Court is very likely watching what happens, first of the D.C. Circuit, in just a couple of weeks. The D.C. Circuit, that's the intermediary court between the trial court and the Supreme Court. They're scheduled to have oral arguments already. They're already getting briefs in on this. They're looking at the legal arguments and they're going to make a ruling very, potentially very quickly in that because they're going to be hearing this case on January 9th.

But, look, he'll take what he can get, a little delay here, a little postponement there. That's also the strategy he's been pursuing in Florida with the Mar-a-Lago case as well. Look, the underlying concern or fear is that this gets pushed until after the election, right? That's an issue for two reasons. Number one, it deprives the voters of an opportunity to find out of one of the two leading candidates for office is a criminal, and criminally attempted to steal millions of votes to disenfranchise millions of voters, the words of Jack Smith. And number two, of course, if it is delayed past the election and if Trump wins, he could order the Justice Department to dismiss the case.

And so, that's the question here. This case could get toss. Now, the other thing to remember here, too, is that if the judges decide, or the justices decide that that isn't the case there is a presidential immunity and he goes to trial, or the Supreme Court decides not to weigh in, there's always the possibility that this could be something resolved later on that he could -- he could look -- want to look at later.

He loved playing wind instruments and will be remembered by his family and friends for his sharp intellect. May his memory be a blessing. Meanwhile, after days of delays, the United Nations Security Council finally got the U.S. to be willing to abstain on a vote, instead of veto its Gaza resolution, rather than outright it.

And this case, it's happening against the backdrop of record migration across the western hemisphere, that got worse after the coronavirus pandemic. Then, took, there is transportation networks that will advertise travel to the U.S. southern border and smugglers who spread misinformation.Take all of that together and this amounts to a worsening situation that officials tell me is bringing that U.S.-Mexico border to up breaking point. As you mentioned in December, the seven day average was 9,800 migrants. That's over November where we were at 6,800. And one more point of comparison, in 2019, at the height of the border crisis, encounters only barely rate 6,000. So this is a logistical challenge for the administration, not only because of the numbers, but because it's happening across the U.S. southern border. So, multiple sectors are seeing more and more migrants crossing and that nationalities make it difficult to levy consequences. And so, all of that puts the White House in a very difficult situation to try to manage what is a growing issue on the border.",

He represents Texas' 23rd congressional district which covers a large portion of the border with Mexico, including Eagle Pass where thousands of migrants are still waiting to be processed. Congressman Gonzales, you were in Eagle Pass just the other day, talking with -- dare I say -- desperation about the U.S. going in the wrong direction. When it comes to how this migrant surge is happening and how it's being handled, Congress isn't getting back from the holiday break until January 9th. What are you most worried about, what could happen before January 9th? REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX):  Yeah, we are beyond breaking point. Let me share what's happening on the ground and then let me share what I believe the president should do today to alleviate this problem. On the ground, the people that live along the border are completely exhausted. Imagine if you have an accident, you dial 991 to go to the emergency room, and there is an eight or ten hour wait, or even worst, they tell you, there are no beds, you're going to have to drive an hour away to another town. That's going to frustrate you. When there's large numbers of people that come over, what ends up happening is border control get overwhelmed, and what they end up doing, they have to feed and they have to clothe and house these people. So where do they go? They go to the local grocery store. Just the other day, they brought 1,000 loaves of bread, cheese, food, to feed these people. Well, guess what happens when you go shopping at the grocery store? You don't have groceries. Then the other piece is, these border communities, they are really one community. Half of it's in Mexico, half of it is into United States. Family members go back and forth. It's the holidays. And right now, the bridge in Eagle Pass is down to one lane. There's two bridges. One is closed, the other one is down to one lane. I spoke with a passenger the other day. She told me it took her 15 hours to go through that. I asked her, why would she go through that? She said it's because my daughter -- it is my daughter's birthday. So the frustration is boiling along the border.",

The number one issue is you have to send people back to their country of origin via deportation flights. Right now in the Del Rio sector, there is about 4,000 people come in over a day and zero are getting sent back. In the El Paso sector, which is also in my district, it's about 1,500 people coming over illegally a day, and about 100 getting sent back. So it's a drop in the bucket. You have to turn on these deportation flight. You do them immediately, the numbers go down and to alleviate some stress. Some other things that happen is, long term, is we need to surge immigration judges to the voter. This is America. You get your day in court. And if you do not qualify for asylum, which not out of ten tonight, you get sent back to your country of origin via these repatriation flights.

And what I saw in El Paso, early in the morning, were dozens of people just loitering around.And while many people were fleeing economic persecution, there are also bad actors in this -- in this group. It's just you don't know who they are. And so, what ends up happening is people no longer feels. El Paso was one of the safest cities in the United States and people no longer feel safe. So, I'm done with the rhetoric. What ends up happening is this open border crisis makes it more difficult for us to have a long-term solution to immigration. I've been a proponent of legal immigration, but when you are just letting everyone, and ultimately the people that are trying to do it the right way are the ones getting pushed to the back of the line.
