I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Round-the-clock negotiations are on in Washington as America faces the very real chance of a potentially catastrophic debt default. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy saying today he sees progress, but there are still major sticking points that need to be ironed out on everything from spending caps to work requirements. One top Republican negotiator warning a deal could be reached as soon as today or they could collapse completely. Meanwhile, the national deficit is growing every second, and with no deal in place the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills, which could have a disastrous impact on the economy. The treasury secretary now saying that could happen in just eight days. CNN's Alayna Treene and Priscilla Alvarez are covering all of the angles for us. Alayna, you first.

Another remaining sticking point is on energy permitting reforms. This is something that Republican negotiator Garret Graves really sees as a top priority and so he's pushing that in talks today. And then another remaining issue as ell is on spending cuts for domestic programs. I that know they talked about that last night and are continuing to talk about that today. But we'll see how they're able to settle that dispute. Now, we have heard from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a couple of times today. We caught up with him this morning. He said that he's more confident than he's been on reaching a deal, and that he remains very optimistic. I also asked him whether he thinks he could get the majority of his House Republican members behind him on this deal. Let's listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) REP.

But certainly, yesterday there was optimism about where these talks were headed, with President Biden himself saying that they were, quote, very close to a deal and hoping to have another update around midnight. And of course, this all went into the early morning hours of today. So clearly the urgency is being felt and has been felt over the course of the last several days, but especially as we heard from Treasury Secretary Yellen, that firm June 5th date when they would run out of cash to pay the nation's obligations. Now, one of the sticking points, and a critical one that has gained some frustration from House Democrats is those work requirements for social safety net programs.

That will probably take under 10 minutes right there.But we do have numbers from the TSA about yesterday, the day that they were expecting it to be the busiest. And TSA says that this airport, Hartsfield-Jackson, they processed 98,000 passengers through security checkpoints, making it the third busiest in terms of passenger volume that this airport has ever experienced, Thursday it was 95,000 passengers, so very similar there. I do want to show you an overview of what we're experiencing in the skies right now with FlightAware's misery map, and you can see a lot of green there. Although, total cancellations for today, over 500, delays just over 1,400. That sounds like a lot, but we know with thousands of flights out there by the day, that is a drop in the bucket.

What we heard from New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week say that he believes that the city's shelter system, it's buckling under its own pressure with the sheer number of asylum seekers that continue to arrive here, regardless of what might be happening thousands of miles south of here.So what we're seeing right now is really a couple of things. New York City officials are basically expanding their efforts to try to locate either long-term or temporary shelter for some folks who may still be headed to New York City. And of course, we should mention, they are going to other American cities, but New York City continues to be the north star for so many. But also city officials taking an unusual legal step, petitioning a judge to suspend portions of New York City's right-to-shelter law. For those unfamiliar with it, this is a decades old policy that's been in place basically requiring New York City to provide homeless assistance, specifically shelter, to anybody that needs it. What the city is saying is that it would like some clarity and most importantly perhaps, some flexibility as these buses continue to arrive. And we should point out many of them also, many of these asylum seekers also arriving here on their own. And so what the city wants is for basically the courts to support this kind of flexibility. This is subject to some criticism by many migrant advocates, saying by doing this, this could potentially provide some sort of skirting around the law, and many afraid that this might allow the city to potentially close the door on so many homeless people that could potentially be looking for resources. But again, the city maintains that what they want to do is think two steps ahead, that if they find themselves in a situation where they have asylum seekers, mainly single adults and those traveling without children, where they don't have a place to put them that might adhere to the right-to-shelter policy, then they would like that legal flexibility. So it really is sort of quite the controversy here for New York City officials, as we heard from a top administration official say just this week, Fred, that they say there's no end in sight to the city's migrant crisis.",

Not in Idaho, but in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. By law, a Monroe County grand jury can only review potential crimes that occurred within that county. Bryan Kohberger is charged with murdering four University of Idaho students last November. He's from Pennsylvania where he was arrested late last year.Joining me right now is defense attorney Misty Marris. Misty, great to see you. So what could the grand jury in Pennsylvania be looking for in him, or family members? MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Yes, this is a great question, Fred, because his parents have now been subpoenaed. They tried to get the subpoenas quashed, which means thrown out. They were not able to. So they actually moved forward with their testimony. And it can only be about a crime that occurred in Pennsylvania. The question is, what could that possibly be? So there were reports originally that this is related to a cold case and that they were going to be testifying in connection with that. However, news reports have said now that there is no connection, so that's a bit confusing. So it could be a slew of crimes that may have occurred on Pennsylvania soil, perhaps related to the Idaho case, but not something that occurred in Idaho. So could it be something about the traverse back from Idaho to Pennsylvania? We just don't know. It is a secret proceeding. And again, the one important thing to realize, it's not the grand jury proceeding where you're looking to indict an individual. It's investigatory in nature.

This is an entirely different proceeding that's taking place. As you said, it's factfinding, it's searching, it's talking about what potential crimes could be out there, and it's being used as an investigatory process.Now, an interesting component, though, since his parents did testify, under Pennsylvania law, those transcripts can be shared with other law enforcement agencies if it's relevant to something else.

And the judge determined that this note is relevant and it should be turned over to the Petitos.To your question, Fred, there is the potential that the Laundries could face criminal charges, and it all depends on whether or not they could be an accessory after the fact. Were they part of this crime in any way? So it would be a conspiracy type theory. It's whether or not they were part of the planning, the commission, or the cover-up, and many have opined they actually were helping Laundrie get away, try and leave the country.

But there are pill versions that companies are working on, and in data we saw just this past week, it looks like the efficacy is about similar to what we see with the injectable versions of the drugs.Novo Nordisk, which makes both Ozempic and Wegovy, has a tablet version of the drug where it showed in a trial it could lead to 15 percent weight loss. There are also some drugs in development from Pfizer and Eli Lilly. We saw some Pfizer data this week. These are all in clinical trials right now. They'll have to go through more study. And for the Novo Nordisk, they say they'll potentially file for FDA approval this year. So these could be coming within the next year or two if they are successful. However, we do see that they have a similar side effect profile as the injectable drugs, things like nausea and vomiting. We've heard from doctors that this can be intolerable for about five percent to 10 percent of patients. There is some hope that with pill versions you could change the way that you take the drug. You start at lower doses and you gradually move up over time. If you had a pill, maybe you could modulate that in a way where you could cut back on some of those side effects. So that is a hope. There's also a huge number of drugs in development that aim to improve on the amount of weight loss that we are seeing with the current medicines. Right now there's a drug called Mounjaro that's already on the market for type two diabetes. It's expected to get approval for weight loss by the end of this year or early next year. What is called tirzepatide is the chemical name. It leads to weight loss of about 22 percent that we saw in clinical trials. But there are drugs that are coming along even behind that, one known as triple G because it goes after three different targets that doctors say could lead to 25 percent to 30 percent weight loss. The question, of course, is going to be safety, are these drugs tolerable. And then, of course, can they be paid for? These drugs are quite expensive, more than $1,000 a month.
