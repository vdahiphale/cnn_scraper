According to a North Korean state media, he was expelled after an investigation. U.S. officials say King's release came after intense diplomacy between multiple countries and stressed no concessions were made. King was already facing disciplinary action before his fateful dash into North Korea during a tour of the DMZ's joint security area. And now, further punishment could be imposed. But a U.S. official says it's quite clear King is very happy to be on his way home. That was unexpected release comes with a particular tense moment for both countries. CNN's Will Ripley explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): When U.S. Army Private Travis King made his daring dash across the DMZ in July, many wondered if North Korea would use him as a political pawn like past American prisoners. His speedy release in just over two months, a surprise to many. Even more shocking, it came with no concessions, U.S. officials tell CNN. Calling his quick release, a result of intense diplomacy, after weeks of trying to break down diplomatic barriers and open a direct line of communication with North Korea. The U.S. and North Korea have no formal diplomatic ties. Swedish diplomats in Pyongyang acted as intermediaries, sending word to Washington, the North Koreans were ready to release the soldier. China allowed King to cross the border for a handover into American custody. A senior U.S. official telling CNN, King is in good health and good spirits as he makes his way home.",

Scientists at the University of Bristol, using supercomputer climate models to predict a scenario in 250 million years.

This won't be the cheeriest conversation I'll have had on this program, but really appreciate having you here on this. So first, what exactly leads you to believe that the continents will get glued together like this? ALEXANDER FARNSWORTH, SR. RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL: That's a great question. So, you know, we know from looking at the geological past. These, sort of, supercontinent formations have happened many, many times. You know, it's almost akin to, sort of, in a natural rhythm, the long term geological system, where these tectonic plates are coming together, and then moving apart, coming together, and then moving apart. Sort of, roughly, on around a four to hundred to six hundred million year time scale. So, we definitely know it's certainly happened in the past, so it's also going to happen in the future. And when this happens, you know, they have been very synonymous in the past with lots of mass extinctions as well.

The very first one, if we forget about what the sun is doing, what CO2 is doing in the atmosphere, even today. If we just reassembled all the continents into this sort of supercontinent, what you would end up doing is forming a continent right in the center of the tropics. And, you know, in the tropics, it is also very hot, very humid. Weknow that today. But, when we do this, you know, you increase land surface temperatures alone, just by this assembly, by about three times their sort of normal temperatures you get today. What you then add on top of that, the sort of increase in solar brightness, the amount of energy coming out of the sun. Again, we have a fairly good understanding that you're probably going to increase that by about two and a half percent, by about 250 million years in the future. And then, further to that, on top of that, we also then, because of the tectonic and geophysical reasons, when you get this sort of supercontinent formation you end up putting a lot more volcanism occurring which then puts more CO2 into the atmosphere. And of course, as you know, when CO2 rises into the atmosphere it also increases the amount of heat that stays within our atmosphere, and it has a big effect on the sort of land surface temperatures and of course that stretches out many species, especially mammals.",

So you're going to really increase competition between lots of different species.Some of which might perform better in this type of environment than mammals maybe. But of course, you're still going to have some specialists, you know. There will be some mammals who will be able to survive this, especially some that you can imagine like the Saharan Gerbil today, which is able to live in the Sahara. Those types of, maybe, very few specialists might be able to come out of this quite well. However, for the vast majority of mammals today, you know, the type of heat that's going to occur is well above the, sort of, upper physiological limits, what we call, of survivability for them.

This is just looking at the climate, just the climate, the long term average weather was going to be very bad. If you then put on top the type of climate weather extremes that we've been experiencing almost akin to today with these heat domes, all of these ,sort of, weather processes will also be occurring in this sort of time period.So it's not going to be very nice, and, you know, it kind of begs the question, this Earth that we've kind of evolved through as the human species over the last million years or so, is, quite relatively, a cool time in climate. Now most of the climate in the past has been a lot hotter, and it looks like it will be in the future as well. So we should be making sure that we look after our planet as it is now, not forcing it out of this sort of cooler period that we've really thrived and dominated through. And if the future is as bleak as we might think it might be with this model, it does as you say put more precedence on trying to figure out where it might be more habitable for the human species. But again, when you look for these habitable planets, the James Webb Space Telescope has done some great work at looking at where these sort of so-called habitable zone planets might exist, and there might be oxygen, hydrogen, water vapor, which likely mean oceans on these planets. However, our own planet will still be within our own habitable zone in 250 million years. However, depending where the tectonics, and where the land mass is actually sitting, it can make the difference between a habitable world, as we have these fragmented continents today, versus a uninhabitable world, with a supercontinent in the tropics.",
