The exclusive video is from filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi. She is the daughter of house speaker Nancy Pelosi and was shooting a documentary on the day of the insurrection. The video shows Speaker Pelosi and other congressional leaders as they sheltered at Fort McNair, a military base in the Washington, D.C. area after being rushed away from the Capitol mob. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Safe enough for us to go back but they're even still trying to penetrate the building. And it's not a safe thing because we are trying to figure out how we can get this job done today. We talked to Mitch about it earlier. He is not in the room right now, but he was with us earlier. And he said we want to expedite this and hopefully we can confine it to just one complaint and then we can vote and that would be, you know, then just move forward the rest of the state.

And we'll see if they can get a conviction there. It is relatively unprecedented. There are very few precedents in recent history of a successful conviction for seditious conspiracy. But I do think Trump will face more legal liability when it comes to the documents at Mar-a-Lago. There is a direct tie between him and those documents. It's less murky than January 6th.

You know, The bottom line is you have to live in a society whether you are in a jury room, whether you are in a classroom, no matter where you are, right, where things don't happen that rise to the level of threats, intimidation and criminality. That should not occur.However, in investigating anything you have to consider the context. The distinction between people losing their temper and getting into it, and as you mentioned, a lot of rancor and acrimony and ultimately, right, that's between threatening someone intimidating them to the point where it rises to the level of criminal activity. We have to be really careful. Why? Because we have a system where we ask jurors to deliberate. We ask the jury to state her opinion and meet a (INAUDIBLE) mind and everyone in that room, right, in this fictitious scenario that I'm painting to go at it and say look, this is what I believe, this is where I stand. Now we are going to investigate and say did someone use language that was too harsh towards another? So I think it has to be approached with great care. In the event that someone was threatened and it rises to the level where they felt harm, that their life was in danger, that's one thing. But if people were just cruel and mean to each other, unfortunately, that's part of the process. There should never be intimidation. There should never be threats. But when you are dealing with something as high stakes as this, you could only imagine that there is going to be things that are said that are perhaps distasteful. The issue is it distasteful but is it criminal? Have your investigation if there's harm to be found there then we'll deal with it.

Did it really transcend the notion or issue of a firm opinion, a firm thought or maybe something that was said that perhaps shouldn't have been said, but does it rise to that point where we say, hey it transcends that (INAUDIBLE) to a crime.And so in terms of process, there is a number of people were there. It's not like two people were isolated in a room and it's not like we have surveillance, right? There is no surveillance that monitors what jurors do, for good reason. And so I think people will be spoken to. And at the end of the if there is something to be seen, it will be seen. But we do have to keep in mind, people can yell and scream and get nasty with each other even. That doesn't necessarily make it criminal. We'll see what the investigation reveals as to specifically what occurred in what context and does it ultimately reach the level of criminality. I doubt it.",

They feel that they have the Russian forces pinned down in an area up against the river really so the Russians can't move and can't really resupply their troops in the way they normally would want to.
