We're getting new reaction to the precedent- busting decision. The president of Howard University joins us this hour.Also tonight, new details on a potentially key witness against Donald Trump who was shown a classified map by the former president. We're going to tell you what we're learning from our sources about the special counsel's investigation. Plus, our Russia experts are weighing in on CNN's exclusive new reporting, documents showing a missing top general in Vladimir Putin's military has been a secret member of the mercenary group behind the recent mutiny. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. There's angry backlash tonight after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that race can no longer be a specific basis for college admissions. CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider has our report on the decision and the dissent. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  The Supreme Court stirring up protests with its decision to gutting affirmative action saying colleges and universities can no longer rely on race in the admissions process, but prospective students are still allowed to talk about how race has shaped their experiences in the applications. The 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts will now prohibit students from checking a box indicating their race, specifically saying the practice at Harvard and University of North Carolina cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause. The majority not explicitly saying they're overruling more than four decades of precedent that allowed affirmative action, but the three liberal justices writing, today this court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.",

Jessica Schneider, thank you very much for that report.Let's get some more right now, the impact of the historic ruling with the president of Howard University, Dr. Wayne Frederick. Dr. Frederick, thanks so much for joining us. What does this ruling mean for Howard University and other historically black colleges and universities around the country? DR. WAYNE A.I. FREDERICK, PRESIDENT, HOWARD UNIVERSITY:  Well, it's very concerning. Because our commitment at Howard and the other historically black colleges and universities is one of diversity, one of inclusion, one of social justice and equity. And in our education system, we know that that does not exist currently. And as students come to our higher education institutions, some of them are severely disadvantaged. And by removing affirmative action, you're going to remove an opportunity for them to matriculate into those schools and colleges. In addition, Wolf, I am concerned that historically black colleges and universities, like Howard University, are already carrying an outsized burden in this country in terms of diversifying fields, such as medicine, law and business. I mean, we account for 3 percent of the higher education institutions in this country but we award 25 percent of the bachelor's degrees that go to our African-American citizens. So, we already have an outsized burden, and I think that this may also encourage students to apply to us in larger numbers, but larger numbers that we may not be able to accommodate, which means that less of them, as they get into the other institutions, may start to become a bit disgruntled and a bit dissuaded from even applying.",

The chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, says this won't stop universities from considering applicants' discussion of how race affected his or her life, those are his words. What does that mean practically for admissions offices? FREDERICKNow, interestingly enough, our medical school application, as a supplemental application speaks, to this issue, someone's commitment to an underserved population, speaks to their commitment or their hardships while they have lived such a life, as I believe Justice Roberts was trying to speak to. And, yes, what's interesting about that is that 79 of our 125 students a couple of years ago in the entering class, Howard was the only institution they got into. I think that those things can now be questioned on the basis of this ruling as people continue to push the envelope around how race is used. And I think that that could be very problematic. So, I think this opens a can of worms. I think that path of the opinion, in particular, is very problematic because of how vague it has left the situation.",

What they're doing now is actually putting impediments in front of that journey, to that equality and social justice. And I think it is problematic for the country that we're in today.",

To me, where the current court really starts to look very different from its predecessors, Wolf, is less in the substance of individual decisions, like the affirmative action ruling today, and more in just the general climate of unaccountability, the notion that the court is not and ought not to be beholden to the political branches, beholden to popular public opinion. That has not been the norm for most of our history.And so I think part of what we're seeing with the court, whether it's last term with the abortion and guns decisions, this term, with today's affirmative action rule, we might see more tomorrow on student loans, is that this is a court that is just not remotely afraid of its own shadow and is not remotely afraid of pushback. And, Wolf, that's especially telling in the affirmative action context, because, although public universities are covered by the Equal Protection Clause, private universities are only covered by federal civil rights laws, meaning Congress actually could push back against today's decision if there was a political will power for it. The fact that the court is not remotely worried about that, that it actually blurs those two different threads in today's ruling is, I think, what makes the current court in the president's words, not normal compared to its predecessors.",

Will it create an atmosphere where the public actually sees how these things play out in real-time, and abortion that has meant women with criminalized pregnancies facing charges depending on what prosecutor might have the interest to do so?

She particularly, I'm told, is a fan of Chris Kise, who is one of the attorneys who was actually in the courtroom with Trump when he was arraigned in Miami. He, of course, is the former solicitor general for the state of Florida. She's actually someone who used to have quite close ties to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis until they had a falling out, and now she has aligned herself in Trump's orbit. And so the reason it's notable that she's gone and spoken with the special counsel's team that she has been identified by our sources as the person that Trump showed this classified map relating to a military operation to is because she's around him every single day almost, be dealing with these campaign events that you see him on the road doing. And so we don't know exactly the full scope of what she told investigators or what their questions were for her, but it just adds another complicating factor to this that, of course, his co-defendant is still his body man and now another witness in this, Susie Wiles, is also someone who is running his campaign on a daily basis.",

It also sheds light on his intent, his intent to withhold and retain those materials, and the fact that he is sharing them with people who are not authorized to have access to material, very bad.And I should add, coming from this witness who you can assume will testify at trial, she'll be forced to testify at trial, it will be very impactful for a jury because they'll be hearing this story not from some political person who might be assumed to have an axe to grind against the president but from a very close associate.

Now, on the child neglect charges, the prosecution, the state, they had a difficult time proving that Peterson was a caregiver. That's a designation that's not typically afforded to law enforcement officers. Now, the father of Joaquin Oliver, one of the victims of that massacre, he spoke to CNN after the verdict, he took a great amount exception with some of Peterson's actions inside and outside of the courtroom following the verdict. Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I certainly want to discuss with you today's landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling, and we'll do that in a moment, but, first, as a former organizer for March for Our Lives and as a Floridian for that matter, what's your reaction to this verdict today? REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL):  You know, I wasn't following the case super closely, but what I just saw, what Manuel Oliver said, I think was very true. We had someone who took an oath and who had a job to protect the students of the school, someone who has stood outside of the school for 45 minutes while children were being slaughtered. It doesn't matter if you don't know where it's coming from. His job was to go in there and work to protect the students. And it's not just about his failure to stop the shooting, it's about the fact that he didn't even try. And so when look at (INAUDIBLE) across the country, we have to ask ourselves, we need folks that are actually going to work at keeping our students safe. He did not even attempt to do that. And I think what Manuel Oliver is really said is really sticking home with me, the fact that he said he should have walked out quiet, and that's true. I see this video about him crying, and I think about Manny, Patricia and all the parents who have to think about the fact that their child was mowed down at school by an assault weapon. Those are the families that should be crying, not someone who just got away with not doing his job.",

He wrote today and I'm quoting him now, he wrote: While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and those who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles -- that all men are created equal, are equal citizens and must be treated equally before the law.

And we have to continue to fight against that. This is why elections matter. This is why elections are so important. Because we need to elect working class people who understand that these systems, again, are not here to stifle anybody's opportunity, and here to help our country succeed to its promise. And, Barbara Jordan, she said it right. What the people want is simple, a country as great as its promise. How dare Justice Clarence Thomas use that promise of that justice to take away something that has helped so many people, including himself?",

And that is really what's fueling the anger that you are seeing out there, at this stage. The question is whether this will be a repeat scenario of what we saw in 2005, when it had taken months in the wake of the deaths of two young men, as they fled a police check in a similar neighborhood to this one, a similar age to young Nael.
