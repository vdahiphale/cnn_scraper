We should also note that they did not find that Israel arbitrarily impeded humanitarian assistance from getting in to Gaza. That's noteworthy because of course, the administration has been repeatedly calling on Israel to let more humanitarian assistance in, but they're making this determination that Israel wasn't keeping out that assistance arbitrarily. Now, we should note that the department makes it very clear that it's hard to make determinations, definitive determinations on these specific Israeli strikes because of the fact that Hamas hides in civilian population centers. They hide in buildings that are occupied by civilians. It also raises questions, however, about if Israel is actually using the capabilities it has to drive down civilian deaths as part of this war. I want to read to you that portion saying, quote, \"while Israel has the knowledge experience and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations, the results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases.\" Now, we should note that Senator Van Hollen who has been an advocate for this report is not happy after receiving it, saying it lacks in- depth investigation, then also saying that the administration ducked all the hard questions. So, he of course, will be probing the administration for more information. He says it's not credible that humanitarian organizations would have had more information about these Israeli strikes than the U.S. government. Victor, Amara?",

And of course, the U.N. has been complaining the place that they're being sent to has little or no supplies. One of the areas, Mawasi, where Israelis are telling people to go to, is a tent camp that already has about 400,000 people. It's got a small U.N. clinic, but it's essentially some fields by a beach. There are no water supplies, there's intermittent electricity supplies that have been sort of run from cables from populated areas, and people really have no safe place to go.

But in terms of the humanitarian catastrophe that the U.S. is worried about, we know that there was up to 1.5 million extra people sheltering in Rafah who fled from fighting in the rest of the country. They really can't get back to much of the north because so many of the roads have been blown apart. And somewhere between 150 to 400,000 have already fled and are more -- are preparing to leave Rafah right now. But again, they're headed to places like Mawasi, and a couple of other tent camps that the U.N. and other aid agencies are having trouble supplying. And that also, aren't safe places to go, in that Mawasi has been hit by Israeli bombing a number of times. Maybe it won't be this time, but from the perspective of people fleeing, that's not much of a comfort that maybe they'll be safe there this time.",
