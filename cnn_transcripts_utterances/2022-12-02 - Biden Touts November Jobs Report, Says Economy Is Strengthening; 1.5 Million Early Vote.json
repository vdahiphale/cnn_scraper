Americans are also taking home bigger paychecks, thanks to wage increases. But are these good numbers too hot for the Federal Reserve? Will we see more rate hikes to bring down inflation? With us now, we have CNN reporter Matt Egan, CNN chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly, and white -- Washington Post opinion columnist and CNN Economics and Political commentator, Catherine Rampell.

      "sentences": "Yes, Alisyn and Victor, I think in normal times, this would be great news, right? 263,000 jobs were added last month stronger than expected. Despite all of these layoffs in the tech sector and elsewhere, we really saw across-the-board strength from sectors. I mean, leisure and hospitality added almost 90,000 jobs last month alone, health care, government -- construction all of them up. None of this you know would suggest an imminent recession.And the unemployment rate, look, staying at 3.7 percent. That is just a little bit above the half-century low. Set earlier this year, it's down dramatically from almost 15 percent in the spring of 2020. But you know, this is obviously not a normal time. The economy is not dealing with a problem of too few jobs, it's too much inflation. And so, that is why the Federal Reserve, Wall Street -- and even the White House was hoping for a Goldilocks number here, right? Not too hot that it fans inflation, not too cold that it speaks to a recession. And we didn't get that. I mean, this is -- this is going to be looked at as too hot by the Fed. In particular, wages, wages were supposed to cool off. They didn't. They heated up. 5.1 percent year over year for wages. For context, that's about twice the pre-COVID pace. Now, if you're a worker, I mean, that is good news because your paycheck is getting hammered by inflation and so you're trying to catch up. But the Fed is trying to cool wages off because they're worried about inflation. So, all of this does suggest that the Fed is going to have to continue to slam the brakes on the economy. They're trying to cool things off by raising borrowing costs. This suggests that they're going to have to continue to raise interest rates, not just the meeting coming up later this month, but into next year. And, of course, the worry here is that the longer they have to raise rates, the higher they have to raise them, the greater the risk that they cause the recession.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, what's interesting right now, and I'm -- and I'm not pausing because I don't have a good answer. I'm pausing because there are so many different elements from the White House perspective that they're trying with the full acknowledgment that there is no single silver bullet. The Fed is the institution. The Fed is the place where inflation is going to be reined into some degree. And it may take time. It's certainly taken longer than I think a lot of people expected.And that complicates things for the reasons that Matt and Catherine laid out. The very real possibility that many of the gains that the administration has seen in its first two years could end up being set back significantly if the Fed goes too fast, for too long here. And I think that's kind of one of the concerns you see -- you've heard quietly, at least the White House officials don't talk about. The Fed, it's an independent entity, but in terms of the underlying kind of elements of this jobs report right here. But the other issue here that I think is most interesting, you hear the president talk about. I don't know that I could remember, and Catherine would certainly be able to correct me if I'm wrong on this one but a better week of economic data for this administration overall. Not just on the jobs number top line, but when you're looking at your gas prices that are now at a level that are pre-Russia's invasion of Ukraine, you talk about jobless claims ticking down again, GDP being revised upwards, and most importantly, kind of one of the critical gauges that the Fed uses for an inflation clearly cooling showing moderation, starting to give a trend line that perhaps might be headed in the right direction, until today's job report, so White House officials constantly grappling with an economy that's in a very strange place. The most important thing, though, when you talk to White House officials, obviously inflation, but what didn't happen this week, in large part because of what happened on Capitol Hill, obviously, the ability for the president to call for and get action to avert a rail strike. It didn't have one of the critical elements that obviously the union workers who rejected the initial proposal. This is what the President said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
