Vance in a vice presidential showdown up the street, here in New York.In preparation, Donald Trump is hurling the very personal attacks that Republicans claim they want him to stop using. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think J.D. is going to do great. He's a very smart guy and he's done a great job. People like him a lot. He's going up against a moron -- a total moron. How she picked him is unbelievable. And I think it's a big factor. There's something wrong with that guy. He's sick. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance, they reminded people, is only two years into his political career and still has a lot to learn.But look, this is the moment that they really picked J.D. Vance for. They believe that he is a gifted public speaker -- someone who has been a strong defender of Donald Trump on television, and someone not afraid to go on the offensive as he has made clear time and again on the campaign trail. Take a listen to how he has been sharpening some of his attacks against Gov. Walz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Tim Walz was the guy who let rioters burn down Minneapolis, and then Kamala Harris was the one who bailed the rioters out of jail. So there's an interesting team in that sense. Tim Walz gets on his high horse about mind your own damn business.

I mean, he lies, and you've seen it in his record. He -- during Hurricane Maria, for instance, down in Puerto Rico, he withheld billions of dollars of relief for the island until the very end of his administration. And if you look at what Project 2025, which his supporters are out there supporting and touting, it cuts funds from FEMA. It takes aid to the states away. And it wants to cut NOAA, which is the weather service that helps figure out where the hurricane paths are going to go, which warns people where they should be and where they shouldn't be.

I saw one election expert tell The New York Times, Doug, \"Counties have been preparing for early voting sites that may no longer exist.

They're not receiving mail.Whether or not that affects Republicans or Democrats, Trump or Biden (sic) more, I don't think we know yet because western North Carolina -- and by the way, about 15 election board -- county boards are closed right now -- is largely the most Republican area in the state. But Asheville is Democratic stronghold. And I'll tell you, that Long John Silver's that you showed -- my brother's family lives about three miles from there. I have a cousin, Corey (PH), who I just found out last night -- late last night -- who is in Bryson City is finally OK. We couldn't hear for hours, and this is what -- or days. And this is what families in western North Carolina, parts of eastern Tennessee and Georgia are going through as well. And their lack of services, lack of water, lack of infrastructure -- all of that is going to have a huge impact. And I would say to Donald Trump and his campaign be really careful -- they're not usually careful -- about politicizing this for two reasons. One, you could experience a backlash as we're seeing when Brian Kemp says no, actually, none of that's true. But two, state officials in North Caroline felt shortchanged in the response from the federal government in Hurricane Matthew. That happened under Donald Trump's watch.

And so they're trying to destroy all the launching sites, all the military facilities, and apparently, a significant tunnel network that is in that region. I've been there a couple of times. It's very mountainous. It's very difficult. So they're trying to knock out operationally those military facilities. But they're also trying to pressure Iran internally. They are weak. They have been hit hard. The Russians are -- or the Israelis have shown that they can penetrate the leadership in Iran. And so those folks are very nervous.
