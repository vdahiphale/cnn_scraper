The details around his former relationship with long-term former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, which his legal representatives said broke down in the end as a result of that media intrusion. And, of course, details around his time as a child, as a teenager -- even as a young adult while he was going into military training at Sandhurst. We've seen Prince Harry's life being on the front pages of these tabloids throughout his life. Of course, the details of that may come to light under a harsher light during those cross-examinations in the court. Today, of course, we heard that Prince Harry is amongst more than 100 people -- 100 claimants now taking on Mirror Group Newspapers over allegations that they obtained this information illegally. These are claims that Mirror Group Newspapers' defense have contested. They say that there is simply no evidence that Prince Harry was hacked. They believe that their senior editorial editors were not aware of any wrongdoing at the time. And this, of course, goes back to the early 1990s up until 2011. Now, Prince Harry has already arrived. He's in the courtroom behind me. He will be giving evidence. He may also be giving evidence tomorrow as well. And I have to say there was some frustration even from the judge yesterday that he wasn't present on the first day. Of course, all eyes very much on the courtroom today as he prepared to give evidence -- Christine.",

A Russian court holding a preliminary hearing for jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny this morning. He's facing numerous new criminal charges, including the charge that he's creating an extremist organization. His spokesperson says the court has already denied a request for more time to review the documents related to this case. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us live from London. Clare, Navalny is already serving a nine-year sentence at a maximum security prison for his opposition to the Putin regime. Is this an attempt to keep him incarcerated even longer?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christine, all evidence definitely points to that. First of all, this extremism case at the hearing happening today, we understand is about. That was brought against him in September 2021 when he was already in jail. Secondly, as you say, he was denied the right for more time to study what we believe is thousands of pages of documents related to this case.In addition, he's been kept mostly in solitary confinement in this maximum security prison, mostly without a break -- something he continues to protest. And, as you say, in further evidence of that today, this court hearing was closed. No journalists allowed in either to film or just to listen to it -- something that his spokesperson says shows that they simply have no evidence against him. And the only way to avoid disgracing themselves, she said, was to close the entire thing -- completely hold it all in secret. Add to that the fact that in addition to the nine years he's serving and these extremism charges, which could face a maximum sentence of 30 years, there's another case pending as well on terrorism charges. That could face a maximum sentence of 35 years. So I think you get the picture here. And obviously, for the Russian state, this is not just about silencing Navalny but his supporters, his message. People turned out -- not very many it should be said, but some people turned out in Russia in protest -- individual protests to mark his birthday on Sunday. According to a human rights militant group at least 90 were arrested.",
