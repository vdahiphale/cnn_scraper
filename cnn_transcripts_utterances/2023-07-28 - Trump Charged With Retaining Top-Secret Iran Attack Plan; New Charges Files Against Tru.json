The indictment for the first time now revealing a detailed and at times minute by minute timeline of events, including what allegedly happened right after Trump was told that his surveillance video was being subpoenaed. So according to the indictment, Nauta who was scheduled to travel with Trump's to Illinois the next day, well, he changed his travel schedule and began to make arrangements to go to Palm Beach, Florida instead. Of course, all of this coming as Trump has been bracing for another possible criminal indictment to drop CNN'S Evan Perez leads us up. Evan, a lot has happened over the last 24 hours to listen.",

Over the last 24 hours, we've now learned that the former president and his co-defendants essentially committed new crimes, according to the Justice Department, after the Justice Department asked for surveillance states from Mar-a-Lago.And so here is what prosecutors allege, according to this new superseding indictment that was unsealed yesterday. They say that the former president and two of his employees, Walt Nauta, who was already charged, and a new defendant, a new co-defendant, his name is Carlos de Oliveira, that they -- and the former president essentially discussed a way to delete that surveillance footage because they knew it showed damning evidence of them moving boxes, perhaps hiding some of the classified documents that the government wanted the former president to return. Now, really just a part of what the indictment lays out. It says that Mr. De Oliveira asked Trump's of employee for, how many days a server retained footage? The Trump employee responded that he believed there was about approximately 45 days. De Oliveira said that the boss, again referring to Mr. Trump, wanted the server deleted. He says that Trump -- he told the Trump employee number four, the boss wants the server deleted and asked, what are we going to do? That lays out this new allegation against the former president's three new obstruction related charges against him. There's also a new charge related to a 32nd classified document that the former president is accused of retaining illegally. That is a document, of course, that has been the subject of a lot of our coverage. It's a document that was -- the discussion for some writers who are working on a biography of Mark Meadows and they met in July of 2021 at Bedminster, the former President's Club in New Jersey. And during that discussion, the former president is accused of holding up a document that referred to attack plans related to Iran. And so the prosecutors have now added that document as one of the -- as one of the documents that the former president is alleged to have withheld from the government illegally. Rahel?",

That's a real problem for Donald Trump's defense team at this point in time, because without that document, you know, he had  the -- he had the defense that there was just papers or newspaper clippings and things like that.

So, what you've got here is a continuing an obstruction that involves, now, two other people Nauta and De Oliveira, and asking that this stuff be destroyed. I mean, this goes to consciousness of guilt. It ties in with his whole effort to keep the government from obtaining these documents. And now ties into the government not being -- trying to keep the government from obtaining critical evidence of his guilt. I mean, that couldn't be more powerful evidence. When you put the whole thing together, you've got proof not only beyond a reasonable doubt, but beyond any doubt, and there's really no defense to it. Even though the statements are all made by employees, not made by Trump himself. The circumstantial proof that you put up before with the timing shows that all this happened after Trump was notified of the subpoena.

And, of course, the lesson that people are trying to impart here still keep hydrated, as we've been saying all throughout this morning and all throughout this heatwave that we've experienced. Because really it started yesterday in Philadelphia. It's going to continue into tomorrow night. Now, I want to point out, Rahel, the Philadelphia Inquirer, they said that it's been a little over 10 years since the city of Philadelphia itself has hit 100 degrees. We may not actually hit that mark today, which would be a good thing. But just to demonstrate it. I filled up my CNN water bottle earlier today just with ice. It is not cold water.

So many of them that will be appearing on the stage really pitching themselves to voters here in this critical first state of Iowa.

And so they come to events like this, hoping that this will be that moment. And then former president Trump blows in and really sucks all of the oxygen out in the room. Now, the candidates, the other candidates we'll tell you, listen, that doesn't matter. We're focused on us and we really haven't seen any of them, aside from Chris Christie and ASA Hutchinson really directly go after the former president. Instead, we've seen them kind of talking around it in a way. We saw former -- or Governor Ron DeSantis on the campaign trail. Yesterday, he's on the campaign trail. Again, today here in Iowa on a tour -- on a bus tour of rural Iowa. And the most direct he would come at former president Trump was really when he was asked about it by reporters. He doesn't do it on the stump because he is kind of trying to thread that needle. These are people that I talked to, voters I talked to who supported the former president in the last two elections. So he's trying to convert them to support him. He's making the argument about electability that he's a person that can draw in independent voters like he did in Florida. The question is whether voters are buying that or not. So, Rahel, it's quite a scene that we're going to see tonight, as all of these contenders descend here on Iowa at this -- in this critical state at a critical moment where we're just about six months out from the Iowa caucuses.
