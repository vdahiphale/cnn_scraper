That means we're not going to see Donald Trump showing up next week in the Fulton County courthouse. We won't see him on camera there as many had expected. And now it's a question of what happens next for Donald Trump's case. His attorney has moved to sever his case from other co-defendants saying while there are some who want to move ahead speedily with this trial, move ahead the trial in October of 2023, Donald Trump is not one of them. His attorney says there's no way he's going to be ready for trial by then. It's also possible we could see Donald Trump's team try to move this into federal court. They've not made that attempt yet. But others involved in this case have. Trump's team may be waiting to see how his other co-defendants fare and their arguments before they make their play to move Trump's case to federal court.
