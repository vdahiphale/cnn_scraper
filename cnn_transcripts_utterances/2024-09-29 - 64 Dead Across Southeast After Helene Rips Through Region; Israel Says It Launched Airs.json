I'm Jessica Dean in Washington alongside my colleague Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv.We have breaking news in the Middle East and also here in the US that we are monitoring and that's where we start in the Southeastern United States where the death toll from the devastating storm, Helene is rising this afternoon. Officials now saying at least 64 people were killed across five states, and there are fears that number will likely grow. Scores of people remain unaccounted for especially in parts of Western North Carolina and the damage there is simply catastrophic. Roads and bridges washed out, destroyed; entire towns remain underwater right now and more than two million people are still without power. Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on Thursday, but today, rescue and recovery efforts still remain a challenge. GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Many people are cut off because roads are impassable. They don't have power or communications. Because it is so difficult to get trucks in by land, yesterday, we began airlifting supplies, including food and water into the region. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Rescue and recovery efforts still underway. RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via phone): That's right, Jessica, so much to be done and the major problems remain lack of water and lack of power for many people in Asheville. There are other towns that are also without the service, and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper described what happened here as widespread, catastrophic damage that Hurricane Helene has caused the western part of the state especially. He is issued a major disaster declaration for 25 western North Carolina counties and the eastern bend of Cherokees. This disaster declaration has already been approved by the White House and it will provide funding for the Individual Assistant Program and people are already signing up and that is a good thing because the need here is so great, Jessica. And we've been going to different neighborhoods in the city. We went earlier to a neighborhood called West Asheville, where a resident told us the river overflowed its banks, bringing all kinds of debris and trash to the streets in front of her house.

On top of that, we've heard about the infrastructure problems in terms of getting communication, the fear of not being able to talk with your loved ones. It has been so horrible for so many people, but that is where we come in. We had the good fortune of being able to see this coming on the radar, and thanks to reports like you all were providing, we moved people and resources into these areas in the path of the storm in advance, so that when the all-clear was given, we had a place to welcome people in who needed refuge, to provide the comfort and care for so many who need it.",

A lot of people are going home, if their home is still standing, they are opening the door to a foot of water inside their home or worst- case scenario, their home is no longer there anymore, so were working to provide comfort, care, meals for people and then have someone to listen to them.

There was another strike outside of the southern city of Sidon, which killed 32, wounded 53.In total, it appears that the death toll for today's strikes exceeds 70. What we are not seeing however, is any sort of significant Hezbollah response. Certainly, in the aftermath of Friday's killing of Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and so far we've seen that Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for 11 strikes over the border, but nothing particularly out of the ordinary. Now is that because they are holding their fire for some sort of surprise salvo or is it because as a result of the decimation, well over actually, decimation of its military and political leadership. Today, Hezbollah acknowledged that two of their senior commanders were killed. One is Ali Karaki, who is responsible for the southern front, in other words, the border with Israel. The other is Nabil Kaouk, who was the head of preventative security, and also a member of Hezbollah Executive Council. Now, today, a Lebanese security source told CNN that the body of Hassan Nasrallah has been recovered, although that has not been acknowledged by Hezbollah itself. Now, it is interesting, Jomana Karadsheh, our colleague, was out and about today speaking with people, some of them supporters of Hezbollah, some of them have actually not actually accepted that Nasrallah is dead. They go back to the 2006 war when there was a period of three days during the initial phases of that war, when people thought he was killed and then suddenly he reappeared on television. So there are those who are hoping that, strangely enough, he might still be alive. Now, beyond that Beirut and the rest of Lebanon is suffering from this massive influx of people who have fled the south of Lebanon, the southern suburbs, and the Beqaa Valley as well. Tens of thousands have fled to Syria. And in Beirut, what we are seeing is that people are still desperately looking for some form of shelter. Many of them still camping out in the Central Martyrs' Square in downtown Beirut. Others, just along the Coronation, on beaches -- Jim.",

She is 80 years old, her son was immediately killed on October 7th and her other son was killed later. That is what we need to talk about. But I also have critique, I have my critique about the US administration as well and the US administration has been very open and have been very accessible. We've met Jake Sullivan for about a dozen times. We just met him last week, as well as with the CIA Director Bill Burns, and this is -- they -- it is natural for hostage families to meet officials, but at the end of the day, they also have a responsibility. SCIUTTO: Do you believe -- and there has been an investment of us diplomatic capital first in the Gaza ceasefire hostage deal, and in the attempted ceasefire in Northern Israel. From a US perspective, in terms of the Biden administration, do you believe it is a lack of sufficient effort to get a deal across the finish line or is it a lack of sufficient influence over the Israeli government to make some of the concessions they believe are necessary to do so?

CHEN: We've been talking about that a lot. You know, the initial instinct would be to get on a plane and just disappear someplace, but there are many people here that have been with us throughout this year and we feel that we, as a family, need to be together and there are various events happening on that day that we will kind of pick and choose what feels the best, but where we cannot be is we cannot be together as a family, and that marks the most difficult aspect of it. And we just need somehow to find a way to get this government, Bibi Netanyahu's government, as well as the US government on the same page, to get a comprehensive deal to put it an end to this because it is not just in the interest of the state of Israel, it is also a strategic interest of the United States to deescalate.

That fire breaking out at a company called Biolab. It reportedly handles swimming pool and spa chemicals. At one point, the fire was out. It has now reignited and according to local affiliate, WSB, a shelter-in-place is now in effect for that area.

New polling giving us an insight into how two critical voting groups are leaning ahead of the November election. A new NBC Telemundo, CNBC poll showing Vice President Harris with a 14-point lead over Trump, among likely Latino voters. Harris getting 54 percent in that poll, while Trump has 40 percent. A new CNN poll also shows Harris leading with voters aged 65 and older. She currently has a four four-point edge over Trump with senior voters. If she holds that support through the election, Harris would be the first Democrat to carry voters aged 65 and older since Al Gore in 2000.

As the airstrikes have intensified, now targeted not only to the south of the country, but also towards the suburbs of Beirut, Beqaa Valley and other locations.What we are hearing is fear, chaos, panic, a lot of uncertainty, like several of the roads leading to Beirut from the Beqaa Valley and the south are flooded. People are desperate in fear, and so many shelters are being set up. Anything which can serve as a shelter, mostly schools and other buildings. Last when I checked, the total number of shelters set up across the country is 789, but it is really growing very fast and several of the community members, people, self-organized groups are trying to deliver aid, humanitarians like CARE are also on the ground trying to deliver aid. But what is happening, Jim, actually, the number of people forcibly displaced is very high. The official number is around 233,000 this is the registered number. But in reality, it is probably around a million, and people were forced to be leaving behind everything --",

Tomorrow also, we plan to do some distributions, but we are really struggling because of first, the availability of commodities, the supply chain is disturbed. The roads are flooded and because of the airstrikes, our physical access is restricted and humanitarian personnel are also really going through a lot of mental trauma because what is happening in the last one week, especially the airstrikes on Friday, it has triggered the trauma of the Beirut explosion for many, many people. And I must say, it breaks my heart to say this, but one more time, the price is being paid by the civilians. Women and children are being disproportionately affected.",

And yes, we have heard of some evacuation orders, but what we are hearing, they are not systematic. They do not give people enough notice. And also for large numbers of people, tens and hundreds and thousands of people to move at an hour's or at a notice of certain hours is really not practical.It actually creates a lot of panic and then the roads are flooded. People are going everywhere. There is no clarity where to go. Yes, shelters are being set up. NGOs and community members are doing their very best, but these evacuation orders, they are not sufficient. In my view, they are absolutely unfair. What is happening right now? A complete disregard of international humanitarian law and there has to be focused on protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure. It is not there and it is not acceptable.
