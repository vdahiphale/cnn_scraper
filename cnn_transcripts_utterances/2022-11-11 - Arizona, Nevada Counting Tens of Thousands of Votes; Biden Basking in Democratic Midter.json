It's just magnified this year, because the races are -- you know, the top ones are so competitive and so close. The reason it takes time is that the majority of Arizonans mail in their ballots. Some of them, they drop off at the polls on election day. But they all come in in a sealed green envelope. The ballot's inside of there. And it's not as simple as just opening the envelope and throw in the ballot into a counting machine. Elections officials have to verify that that ballot that came in the green envelope with the signature on the outside matches the signature on the voter registration rolls. That takes some time to do that. Then they might have some problems. And then they'll reach out to the voter. So, when you're dealing with, you know, more than 2 million ballots, you really can't get that done in a day. It does take some time. They do this for the interest of accuracy. And I should note that from the clip you played, it is incorrect. Arizona does start counting early ballots early. They don't wait until election day.",

A senior Biden administration official told reporters on Thursday, there's not going to be a joint statement after this meeting, and they're not expecting any so-called deliverables. And there might not even be significant easing of tensions after this meeting. Now, the reason is quite clear, but Xi insists that this meeting is all about building rapport between the two men and building the floor in this relationship. But the problem here is rapport doesn't seem to be the problem. The two men obviously have known each other for years, spending a lot of time together as vice presidents. And they have talked five times on the phone or via video link since Biden took office. And each time, they always reminisced about the good old times. But the problem here is, really, the fundamental differences between the two governments, how they see themselves, and how they see the other. That's been driving them apart. Now, from Washington's perspective, China under Xi Jinping has grown increasingly authoritarian at home and increasingly assertive and even aggressive abroad. That's why Biden plans to raise the issue of human rights abuses. For example, Beijing's crackdown on the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, but also the issue of Taiwan, of course. But from Beijing's perspective, of course, Biden -- under Biden, the U.S. and its allies increasingly aim to contain China's rise, to contain China's rightful place on the global stage. Biden not only has kept most of the Trump-era U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, he has been ramping up restrictions on technology exports to China, including crucial semiconductors. So, that's why, you know, Xi Jinping has really made no secret of reshaping this world order led by the U.S. And not to mention, both men face a lot of domestic problems, Xi Jinping, you know, under growing pressure on the economy, because of zero-COVID policy, so whipping up nationalism always part of the playbook.

They were prioritizing the economy over abortion access and other issues But in the end, independent voters actually broke slightly for Democratic candidates an either didn't -- those independents either didn't punish Democrats for what they don't like about Joe Biden, or they were uncomfortable voting for Republican candidates. So the surprise was those -- were those toss-up races. And now the fight for their House is not over. There is still a narrow path for the Democrats to maintain control which is not something, I think, really anyone envisioned 6 or 12 months ago. [00:50:0]",

That's what's remarkable about the cycle, is that voters were primed for change. There's uncertainty with the economy or unrest with gas prices or the cost of living.

Dozens of beachfront homes and hotels have been declared unsafe in the wake of the storm. Images from a dorm room at a college in St. Augustine in Florida shows streets flooded after the hurricane hit. Student Cameron Kraft told CNN the water was about waist-deep. Nicole has now weakened to a tropical depression. It's expected to produce significant rainfall as it heads North. Close to a million people across the U.S. are under a winter threat, including blizzard warnings. Some areas could see a foot of snow. The latest now from CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam.
