We believe one more is needed to be in paneled. Let's get straight to CNN anchor and chief legal analyst, Laura Coates. She's outside the court in New York. Laura, it's moving pretty quick. LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: A lot of buzz happening. As my father would say, now we're cooking with gas. Because you're one away from history actually starting on a historic criminal trial. Opening statements would begin probably on Monday if they're able to impanel this full jury today. Remember, so far today, at least six people had been already excused from doing alternate jury duty. But several of them got very emotional, citing stress and anxiety before they were dismissed from the pool. But we know that we are now one away, one alternate juror away who might ultimately sit in this trial at least before deliberations. We have course already had the original 12 selected as of yesterday. I want to bring in an attorney and jury consultant, Renato Stabile. Renato, you have been part of this process known as voir dire or from the, voir dire, many times. What is standing to you about this one? The pace? RENATO STABILE, ATTORNEY &amp; JURY CONSULTANT: Yes, the pace, and especially now with the alternates, keep in mind, collectively, the parties had 24 peremptory strikes available to them to see if these alternates -- they only had 20 for the regular 12 jurors. So you have more peremptories for the six alternates. So it looks like they're not really using a lot of their peremptories. They could really take their pick here. But it is moving very, very quickly.",

History will be made in this moment.Now the number 270 for electoral count votes is not the issue for a candidate who is some 200 days away from a presidential election. Now, the number is 18, who may decide the fate of whether he will be convicted or acquitted in these historic charges. So the question now becomes, will they have enough because a high- profile trial such as this, would six alternates be enough for those to sit and deliberate?",

What do you say? We also were seeing -- an active shooter? An active shooter is in the park outside the courthouse. We have a man who is literally -- he has set fire to himself. A man has emblazoned himself outside of the courthouse just now. Our cameras are turning right now. A man has now lit himself on fire outside of the courthouse in Manhattan where were waiting for history to be made. A full jury panel is gone. We are watching a man who is fully emblazoned in the front of the courthouse today. We're watching multiple fires breaking out around his body and person. We have seen an arm that has been visible that has been engulfed in total flames. There is chaos and it's happening. People who are wondering right now if people are in danger. I'm looking across the -- across the courtyard. There is a man racing to his aid. There's (INAUDIBLE) coming up to try to put out the fire. We have members of security details. NYPD is rushing to the scene. They are trying to come now. Officers are on the scene. A fire extinguisher is right now present, being put on this man to try to put it out. People are climbing over barricades to try to separate the public, to put out the flame on this man. He has lit himself out in fire in front of the courthouse right now. We are watching as the flames -- we can smell the air. I can smell the burning of some sort of a flesh. I can smell the burning of some sort of agent being used as well as an accelerant to put that fire. I smell an actual fire extinguisher, having been displayed. I see a person whose body appears to be on the ground being surrounded by officers. Multiple officers. I've counted about a dozen officers on scene. The fire is still burning. It's now in multiple locations. It continues to -- continues to blaze. We right now have officers who are moving their coats, trying to surround this person. To douse their bodies to prevent them from further going into flames. You can smell --I here with Evan Perez. You can smell burning flesh. You can smell an accelerant. The flames are continuing to engulf his person. I hear shouts that are coming from across the courtyard. I have people running over. Another fire engine being brought out. This person's body continues to be engulfed in flames. A portion of his body is still engulfed in flames. Yellow smoke is billowing from on top of his person as he's engulfed. And the officers who are continuing to try to put out the flames are continuing to move blazon (ph). Now the officers are not visible through the gulf and the cloud of smoke that is happening. This man or this person -- we're unable to identify by the gender of this person. The body has been engulfed in flames for at least now 30 to 40 seconds. They have a third attempt at extinguishing this person's fire around their body. We have no idea who this person is or the why. A minute before we saw this happen, you heard shots happening. You saw a Trump flag that was running from the area as scream rang out. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: We have arms.",

You had Mayor Adams on the scene to talk about the amount of law enforcement presence that would be here. Remember, a former president of United States is inside of the courthouse. Secret Service, law enforcement details all present for the threat of security rises. It has led there to be a lot of congestion behind us in this particular area. It's also making it difficult for the ambulance to get through to the location of where a burning human being is laying on the ground motionless while they have tried to give him some form of health aid and first aid care. You see at least one EMT standing down. They are trying to not -- here is a stretcher coming out. We're about to see this body be lifted off the ground that has been engulfed in flames for over three minutes in time. Although the flames have totally dissipated, the cloud of smoke is still there.

This taking place, causing chaos to unleash here. And, Evan, we are in a place where people expected, because a former president was in this building, that there was a heightened law enforcement presence.

You can still see smoke coming from the ground, an area where this all happened in the middle of the park.

But Trump -- this is something that he clearly wants to do. And his team believes that he can do this successfully. But they want to see how the trial goes. Now during this hearing, they will discuss what he can be asked about on cross-examination. And what's going to be fascinating to watch is this increasing tension between the prosecution and the defense, right? We saw that the prosecution said they won't even share their witness list with the Trump team, assuming things start on Monday. And that's because they don't trust the former president not to tweet about those witnesses because he has done that, possibly in violation of his gag order already.

The statements that he has made, attacking witnesses, like Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, this is the consequence that there is no trust. This is a courtesy that the district attorney's office said they would normally extend, but they're not going to do it here. And not only did the judge agree with them and didn't force them to share it. He suggested that he doesn't believe that they can control their client.
