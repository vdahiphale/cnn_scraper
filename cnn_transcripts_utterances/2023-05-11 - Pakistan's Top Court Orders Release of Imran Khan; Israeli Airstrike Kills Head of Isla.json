Khan was summoned before the supremecourt today, his lawyers had gone and filed an appeal to the supreme court to overturn the ruling by Islamabad's high court, which is a lower court, that the ruling was illegal and that his arrest was illegal. That is exactly what the three-member jury at the supreme court have done. They have issued release orders for Khan. We have been told by his aides that the orders include a series of orders that Khan will now be in the custody of the supreme court. He, will no longer be within the custody of the national accountability bureau (ph), which is an anticorruption watchdog. We've also been told that he is not allowed to go back to his residence. He will have to stay within the police compound in a guest house. He's allowed to have 10 visitors a day. Tomorrow, he'd have to reappear at the Islamabad high court in the capital. So a lot has happened. He is still within the supreme court compound. He hasn't officially left that compound. His supporters have been milling around that compound, which is in the red zone of the city. The red zone, for your understanding, is where all of the embassies are, the diplomatic enclave is, the parliament is. It's a very high security area of the capital so people aren't really allowed to go there on a regular basis anyway. Khan's party had asked for supporters to calm down, to not protest. We also being told that, you know, there is a sense of unease in the country right before (INAUDIBLE) the information minister came out and said, very explicitly, that there is favoritism by the courts in the favor of Khan. She also said that if he is released, then the country will burn (ph). We just have to wait to see what the reaction by the nation, by his supporters will be to his eventual release from the supreme court. We'll just have to know that in the next couple of hours.

They also say he was partially responsible for this barrage of more than 500 rockets in the last couple days and the previous rocket attacks toward Israel in the past. Overall, Israel's saying about a dozen militants from Islamic Jihad have been killed so far since this round of fighting began, about half of those killed, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel also saying that a fifth of all rockets, that Islamic Jihad has fired toward Israel, from the Gaza Strip, have fallen short. As you mentioned in your introduction, with some of, them IDF said they were 100 percent sure that it was Islamic Jihad rockets that fell short and killed those four civilians, including the three children. Islamic Jihad is refuting. Now Egypt was trying to broker a cease-fire. There were hope and rumors swirling last night that a cease-fire was likely to be imminent. That came to naught. The negotiations and attempts to bring about a cease-fire are still ongoing. Again, that is expected to happen at some point and is expected to be very much involving the Egyptians as well. Israel is also keeping the U.S. abreast of developments. Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, he spoke with his counterpart in the United States, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin last night.

So I don't think anyone doubts that there is going to be a cease-fire at some point. The question is, when that will happen. I suppose it will take Israel to decide it's achieved its objectives and Islamic Jihad will try to secure some kind of victory in its eyes in order to agree to a cease-fire as well. But there is no sign of that right now. But these things can change very quickly. But I think at some point, everyone expects a cease-fire brokered by Egypt. But then at some point, there will be another flare-up, that everyone expects at some point in the future. Eleni.",

He called CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins a nasty person when she called him on untruths and pressed him for answers.
