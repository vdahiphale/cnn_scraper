      "sentences": "Six more classified documents have been found at President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, residence.This time, they were found by FBI agents, who were searching President Biden's home with the president's permission, the permission of his legal team, and with the supervision of a personal attorney to the president, as well as a representative of the White House counsel's office. Now all of this was revealed on Saturday night by Bob Bauer, the president's personal attorney, who confirmed that the FBI carried out a nearly 13-hour search of the president's Wilmington residence on Friday, from 9:45 in the morning until around 10:30 at night. And those six documents being found following an exhaustive search of the president's residence, the entire residence, we're told, they were given access to. The statement from Bob Bauer says, quote, \"DOJ had full access to the president's home, including personally handwritten notes, files, papers, binders, memorabilia, to-do lists, schedules and reminders going back decades. \"DOJ took possession of materials it deemed within the scope of its inquiry, including six items with classification markings and surrounding materials, some of which were from the president's service in the Senate, some of which were from his tenure as vice president. \"DOJ also took for further review personally handwritten notes from the vice presidential years.\" And now a source familiar with the matter tells me that this search was not conducted with a search warrant. There was no subpoena that was issued in order to enter the president's home. Instead, this was done with the permission and the cooperation of President Biden's legal team. Nonetheless, this is the fifth time in the last two weeks that we have learned of classified documents being found. Initially, it was, of course, at the president's former office in Washington for the Penn Biden Center. And then, of course, there was the discovery of documents at the president's Wilmington residence and additional documents have since been discovered at that home or revealed since then. That drip, drip, drip, has certainly been problematic for a White House that has been insisting, as the president did just days before this revelation, that there is no \"there\" there, insisting that he was surprised by the revelation of these documents. And certainly a president who's trying to get past all of this, who hopes that the special counsel can do its work quietly and ultimately exonerate him. Now regardless of how politically damaging all of this looks, there's still an open question as to how much legal jeopardy the president is actually in. And on that note, President Biden insisting this week that there is no \"there\" there, saying he will be exonerated once this investigation concludes -- Jeremy Diamond, CNN, New York.

We found a recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that 70 percent of Americans think that this is pretty important.But we're also seeing polls revealing that Americans are aware of the differences that have been highlighted by the media pretty extensively, that Trump had taken hundreds of classified documents and thousands of unclassified documents, that his team had made false statements, defied a subpoena. And that Trump had destroyed some of the documents. That made it look like it was intentional, which is a violation of the Espionage Act. And a poll taken by the Quinnipiac University last summer revealed that 50 percent of Americans thought that Trump should face criminal charges. Now that same Quinnipiac University poll that I was referring to looked at how Americans feel about Biden and 37 percent feel that he should face criminal charges. So that's a fairly stark difference from the way Americans feel Trump and Biden should be dealt with. But still, this is important. This is another error of the Biden administration and does speak to his competence. And it's coming at a time when Democrats were gaining momentum after the midterms. But we're seeing that his approval rating, he can't seem to get it above 50 percent. It's been hovering, if you look at the average of all the polls, around 42 percent. Now this doesn't seem to hurt the Democrats. But he needs to have a string of wins at a time when his administration is going to face House Republicans investigating him. And he's going to have to pivot from being able to try to focus on passing legislation to plain defense.",

The Democrats are trying to turn this into an example of where they are going to comply with the law, because they know that that's important for democracy. The Republicans, of course, are having a field day with this and saying that Trump is being treated far more unfairly than Biden and this is another example of how far the deep state goes in the way the FBI raid was handled.

And I think Americans will start to focus on other issues. I mean, he actually has bigger problems. He needs to ensure that the economy improves. Right now, his approval rating for the economy is around a third and he needs to improve the situation with immigration. Although he has a new plan in place, although his approval rating for his handling of immigration is at 22 percent, he will have to focus on far other different issues that may seem even more important to Americans than the handling of these documents.

And it really does feel as if the momentum is building. That's what these protesters really need. Really, the only options they have for them in terms of opposing this government and opposing these proposed judicial reforms from the government is a public pressure campaign. As you noted, these proposed reforms would make it so the parliament and essentially whatever political party is in power would have the opportunity to overturn high-court decisions.

It's a time in which, for Roe's 50th anniversary, we're giving it a eulogy, essentially.And unfortunately, a few years ago, I had been thinking about this. Even a decade ago, I had been thinking about this. And I had been writing articles and giving lectures about seeing what could lie ahead, not just for Roe but for other reproductive health protections that were eroding, that were slipping away. And I think, for many other people, including people who work within the reproductive health space and reproductive rights movement, they couldn't see it.",

But the repercussions, which you've asked about, were seen immediately following the Dobbs decision, which was issued June of 2022.Almost immediately, the world heard about a case involving a young girl, who had been serially raped and was pregnant at the age of 10. She wanted an abortion. She had to leave a state that had passed a law, a law that went into effect after Dobbs, that would deny her that abortion, that would make her a mother before the age of 11. And she got to the state of Indiana, where she could have that abortion. But since that time, we've learned about cases involving a woman in Louisiana gestating a fetus with no skull, not allowed to terminate that pregnancy. Cases involving women with ectopic pregnancies, who could not get the help that they needed, even though an ectopic pregnancy can cause death. Cases involving doctors who have become so afraid to deliver the health care that by oath they're committed to doing but, by law, which says that they can't, involving cases of patients bleeding for days. So it's been horrific, the outcome so far in the post-Dobbs landscape.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a great question about what comes next, because it could be decades until reproductive rights as we knew them are restored; that is, at a national level. Already, these issues are going to the ballots and states.Basically, what we see is a bit of a wild, wild West in the United States. In one state, there have been lawmakers that say that if librarians help people with search term \"abortion,\" that they can be criminally punished. We see that in the state of Nebraska, there is a mother and daughter that have been criminally charged because it was found out that, on Facebook, the girl talked with her mother about having an abortion. These have become really frightening times for so many women and girls. And I think it's important to note that these are matters of democracy that we're talking about, when we're talking about bodily autonomy or when we're talking about someone's free speech rights. Can they use the term \"abortion\"? Can they help someone search the term \"abortion\"? It's actually a really radical time for our democracy. And I hope that people begin to ask questions in that regard, because that's really where the fight is ahead on other principles in our United States Constitution.",
