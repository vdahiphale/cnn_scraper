Tonight, a major shake-up in leadership in theWest Bank as the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister and government resign. This as ceasefire talks continue today in Doha. Could this reshuffle impact those negotiations? Then, President Zelenskyy speaks to CNN about his country's desperate need for U.S. aid, just as Ukraine suffers another setback on the battlefield. Plus, dramatic scenes in Brussels as 900 tractors descend on the Belgian capital in a fresh wave of European farmers protest, that story and much more just ahead. But first, this evening, a leadership shake-up underway in the West Bank could signal what's being planned for post-war Gaza. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said he is resigning to make way for a national unity government. The U.S. and other countries have been pressuring President Mahmoud Abbas to reform the Palestinian Authority amid efforts to establish a Palestinian state. Israel though is keeping its focus on Gaza and getting its hostages back home. Israeli officials left for Qatar today for indirect negotiations with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says if there is a deal, a ground offensive in Rafah could be delayed, but he insists it will still happen. More than a million Palestinians are seeking refuge there, virtually penned really against the Egyptian border. The IDF has submitted a plan to Israel's war cabinet for evacuating civilians. But we don't know really the details. The U.N. Secretary-General says an offensive must be avoided at all costs. This is what Guterres said. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS: Humanitarian aid is still completely insufficient, Rafah is the core of the humanitarian operation, and UNRWA is the backbone of that effort. And all lot is -- all lot is Israeli offensive on the city would not only be terrifying for more than a million Palestinian civilians sheltering there, it would put the final nail in the coffin of our aid programs.

The question is whether or not that will come, you know, after a deal is actually reached, and once it is implemented or if a deal fails, and the Israeli military chooses to move forward. But the second part of that plan involves the evacuation of civilians, but no details on exactly where they would go.

This as Mr. Zelenskyy says just 30 percent of the million artillery shells that he promised to deliver by March, if you remember, have reached his country. Now, for more, CNN's chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh has the latest developments from Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Almost emphasized the warnings from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his lengthy press conference on Sunday, there is yet more bad news from the frontlines for Ukraine. Lastochkyne, a small village, certainly 3-mile to the northwest of Avdiivka appears now to be in Russian hands after Ukrainian forces announced they had withdrawn from it. Now, as I say, that is not in itself strategically significant, but it marks the fact that the thing we were warned about by both Ukrainian military officials and the Russian military too, that Russia would continue advancing once it took the town of Avdiivka Saturday before last. So, that is indeed happening. Now, there are many who say that Lastochkyne was essentially not worth holding on to, that Ukraine always intended to fall back to deeper positions where it could better defend the terrain. But nonetheless, this marks yet more bad news from the frontlines while pressure continued on multiple other points as well. And indeed, there are some suggestions from pro-Russian sources that in fact, Russia is yet still trying to move on further from Lastochkyne as well. Now, Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave the first official death toll. We've heard of the Ukrainian military of 31,000 on Sunday. That is significantly less than some Western analysts had indeed suggested. But I think it was a bid to try and explain to Ukrainians and to the world outside how urgent and how horrific the sacrifices been over the past two years, and sound the alarm, he's trying to ring out with Western allies to make them fully cognizant of the damage that the absence of that $60 billion indeed will cause. Talking about how millions of Ukrainian lives would likely be lost if they don't get that aid. And so, yet more bad news from the battlefield for Ukraine, not a full-on collapse or a major Russian advance, but a sign that the absence of that Western aid now months as it is late or missing entirely, is changing things in reality on the battlefield.

Budapest was the last NATO member to endorse Sweden's session to the military alliance. The move comes after nearly two years of intense negotiations. Sweden's Prime Minister calls it a historic day. There are stunning new claims today about Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic on the night before his sudden death. An aid close to Alexei Navalny said the opposition leader was part of a proposed prisoner swap. Those negotiations with the Kremlin were reportedly in the final stages before Navalny's mysterious death ten days ago. CNN cannot independently verify those claims. A Kremlin spokesman denies knowing anything about a prisoner exchange. Our Matthew Chance joins me now with more from Moscow.

Today, Navalny's team that said that they're going to be holding a farewell ceremony, which we assume means his funeral towards the end of the working week. So, Friday or possibly Thursday, they're still looking for a venue that will hold that kind of event. It's potentially a very contentious political event though, because in life, Alexei Navalny was able to bring tens of thousands of people out into the streets, and I think probably the concern of the authorities is that in death as well, people may rally to that cause and come out and voice their opposition to the Kremlin.

It is no secret the E.U. has remained steadfastly pro-Ukraine in this conflict, but with the looming E.U. elections in June, I asked the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, if he's worried that long-term support for Ukraine is waning.

It's also a question of our own interest, for the stability, for the security. It's very clear that Ukraine cannot lose this war. If it would be the case, then the European continent would be more in danger. The pressure would be huge. And it's also a fundamental element. It would be the message to the rest of the world that the authoritarian regime, the dictatorship, even when a country is a member of the Security Council in possession of the nuclear weapon, they would be allowed to invade a country with 40 million inhabitants. This is not acceptable. And for my children, for our children, for our common future, I think the democracies across the world and the United States, the E.U., the G7 countries and many other fronts across the world, we know that our interest into -- is to make sure that we promote our common values by supporting Ukraine as much as we can and for as long as it is. If not, it's a signal that we are weak. It is a signal that the dictatorships and the authoritarian regimes, they are allowed to act that way.
