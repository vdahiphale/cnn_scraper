      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Just a few days now remain before the first in the nation primary happening in New Hampshire and candidates are sprinting to the finish line. The last three Republicans in the race are fanning out across the Granite State. Former president Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis all holding events there today. But as they make their final pitches, we're getting a new view of how Tuesday's primary might shake out. A new CNN/University of New Hampshire poll out today shows Trump with 50 percent support among likely Republican primary voters, outpacing his nearest competitor, former South Carolina governor Nikki winning Haley by 11 points. CNN's Kylie Atwood is tracking the latest on the campaign trail. Nikki Haley is holding multiple events today, right. I mean what's her closing message right now to narrow that gap or perhaps even take the lead?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Nikki Haley is really barnstorming the state, Fred. She has at least eight events today. There were six events yesterday. I mean she is really going forth with retail politicking, trying to get in front of as many New Hampshire voters as she can.And as she does that, she's sharpening her attacks against former president Trump. We've seen her in the past say that he was the right president at the right time, be critical of him on policy matters. But she's doing more than that now. She questioned his mental fitness after he confused her with former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at a rally on Friday night. And this morning in an interview with CBS, she doubled down on that critique and essentially said that that wasn't an isolated incident where he has gotten confused and made errors. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you look recently, there have been multiple things. I mean, he claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I'm assuming he meant World War III. He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. Don't be surprised if you have someone that's 80 in office. Their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That's just human nature. This is different. I mean we're seeing -- he's just not at the same level he was at 2016. I think we're seeing some of that decline. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, this comes as obviously there's some urgency in her campaign. As you guys said, that new CNN poll shows her 11 points behind former president Trump here in New Hampshire. But it might be a message, this increased critique of former president Trump. It might be a message that's better met with the Independent voters here in New Hampshire than perhaps it would have been met in Iowa where there were fewer Independent voters. Independent voters couldn't partake in the caucus. Here in the primary, they can partake on Tuesday night in the voting. So that is an area, a group here that she's doing quite well with. It might be a group that she feels that this critique will pull in even more strongly to her side on Tuesday. But she is really across this state today, trying to make the case that she is as she's been making throughout the entirety of her campaign, the next generational leader.",

Jazmine, you first. I mean Haley is out all over, you know, in the state of New Hampshire today holding eight events, but she's also hurling direct attacks now at former president Trump challenging his mental acuity in these final days before the primary. But the CNN poll out today, let's examine it further, shows her still 11 points behind. Is that strategy offering some real promise at this point of her campaign? JAZMINE ULLOA, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes, so we have been seeing some of her most energized crowds yet. Voters seem to be really connecting with her. You know, they say she's the sharpest she's ever been. She's making this really sharp case against President Trump that she hasn't made before, and she just seems more relaxed on the trail. She looks like she's actually having fun, which is a very different Haley than we've seen -- than we saw in Iowa. But I definitely picked up on some concerns from Independents, you know, Independents were very worried about the future of democracy, about turning the page on this nation -- on this era of divisive politics, whether it's just a little bit too little, too late, and concerned about that grip that President Trump still maintains on the Republican party. They really see her as the last -- the last best chance, at least this cycle to move the party away from him.",

Last night in New Hampshire, they brought out a lot of top South Carolina endorsers, which of course, the state is having its primary next month. And so what they're trying to do is they're trying to say, look. Trump's ahead by almost -- between 10 and 15 points now according to polling in New Hampshire, and so if he wins there, and he goes on and wins in Nevada as he's favored to do, it's going to create a steamrolling effect in which primary voters and other top Republicans are just going to get on that bandwagon.",

I wrote, you know, I signed some of the most -- the toughest immigration voter ID, abortion laws in the state, you know.She even rejected claims that she's a -- the characterization that she is a moderate. And so she's been -- she's pre-emptively taking on these attacks already looking to make it a showdown between herself and Trump in her home state. And again, she's also dismissing the mounting stack of endorsements against Trump saying that because she rode on the Tea Party, this anti-establishment wave, she doesn't have many friends in the legislature. She told us in a gaggle just yesterday, you know, I don't get any love. There's no love for me from the South Carolina legislature because I pushed for reforms in the state.

They're taking your jobs.That's something that really taps into how Trump's base feels, and it really is part of his connection to them. And so as Trump has been campaigning here in New Hampshire all week, he's been talking about border issues, and he's been getting quite the reception from it. So you can bet that as the race heads down to the final 48 hours, he's going to continue talking about it.",

So I'm not sure that one will necessarily solve the problem for the other.Again, these being allegations that are made and we don't know whether they're true or not. And that continues to need to play out. With respect to the criminal case in the election overall, that case should in theory be able to continue because prosecutions should not be dependent on individual prosecutors is the office of the D.A. She has other prosecutors who are working on this case. She even has said that she has appointed two others as people who have been appointed to assist in the case from outside the office. So it does sound like there is an additional team, but clearly, Ms. Willis has been deeply engaged in the case itself. And so, it is a question whether or not it would really retain the leadership that it needs given the historic nature and the importance of the case.",

The latest forecast right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [14:45:28] WHITFIELD: All right. Welcome back. The arctic blast that brought frigid cold temperatures across the majority of the country is finally on its way out this week. But now, millions of Americans are under threat of flash flooding and heavy rains along the Gulf Coast and parts of the southeast. Joining me right now is CNN meteorologist Elisa Raffa. Elisa, so when will we get a break from this arctic blast this week? I'm looking forward to that.",

But right now, that cold is important because you could feel some ice going into tomorrow morning.Temperatures right now are below freezing from Cincinnati to Nashville, still St. Louis, 37 degrees in Charlotte and Atlanta. So, that chill making it pretty far south. Now, we have pretty widespread winter weather advisories in effect for most of Missouri back into Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas. You see that brighter pink, that's an ice storm warning. We're looking at up to a half an inch of ice that could cause some problems on power lines and some roads as we start out tomorrow morning, and you can see that pink really flourish there once you roll it into the future, that future radar. Some of that rain continues to stretch as north as the Great Lakes, some snow can mix in there and then we continue to pump some of that heavy rain along the Gulf Coast and that could set up a flooding risk as well. Here's a look at that ice accumulation again, a huge what would at least a quarter of an inch of ice and then some in northwest Arkansas up to a half an inch and that could really cause some problems. Then, on the warm wet side of this, we've got three days of that slight heavy rain risk where we're looking at several inches of rain and some localized flooding from seeing some of that tropical moisture just continue anyway to dump on the same spot, and you can see that rain forecast where were seeing low over four inches of rain for some spots, locally higher amounts possible over the south as we wrap up the week. So this is the storm system that's going to bring the warmer temperatures, will be above five degrees warmer by Tuesday, by the middle the week. But then by Thursday, Friday, we're looking at temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average, some 70s from Charlotte to Atlanta, 80s in Florida. And you can see the warm up here thawing out into the 40s in D.C. We're in the 60s in Atlanta. And when I find crazy about this is even the overnight lows could get into the 60s for places like Orlando, New Orleans, than Atlanta. Some records could fall. There for record, warm overnight temperatures.",
