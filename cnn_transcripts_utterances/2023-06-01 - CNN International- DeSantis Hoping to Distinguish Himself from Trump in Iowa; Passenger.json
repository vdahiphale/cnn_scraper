If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.The Biden/McCarthy debt limit deal is heading to the U.S. Senate after a victorious vote in the House late on Wednesday night. President Biden is urging the Senate to pass the bill so he can sign it into law. And sources tell CNN, federal prosecutors have an audio of former President Donald Trump acknowledging to having a classified document from the Pentagon in his hand after he left the White House. This would mean Trump's comments on declassifying everything may not be true. The recording could serve as a key piece of evidence in the special counsel's classified documents investigation. Now the field of the Republican candidates for next year's U.S. presidential election is already getting quite large. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is trying to position himself as the one who can topple the frontrunner, Donald Trump. CNN's Jeff Zeleny reports from Iowa where DeSantis just wrapped up a campaign stop. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

DESANTIS: I am going to counterpunch. I'm going to fight back on it. I'm going to focus my fire on Biden, and I think he should do the same. He gives Biden a free pass. I'm focusing on Biden. ZELENY (voice-over): But long before DeSantis can confront President Biden, he must first get through a Republican primary, in a growing field of challengers. Including former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who are poised to enter the race next week. But Trump still looms largest over the race. He arrives here to offer something of a rebuttal to DeSantis.

Organizers say about 1,000 employees staged a walkout to push back against the requirement to be in the office at least three days a week. The group behind the move also wants Amazon to focus more on its impact on the climate. The company says about 300 employees joined the walkout and it happened after Amazon laid off tens of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, Amazon has agreed to pay more than $30 million to settle two federal lawsuits over violations of customers' privacy. U.S. regulators accused the company of keeping ring doorbell videos and Alexa voice recordings for years, along with geolocation info and often did so without consent. And in some cases unauthorized parties were able to access that data due to what the government called Amazon's lacks policies. Despite the settlement Amazon denies violating the law. And Facebook's parent company Meta is asking a federal court to stop the U.S. government from imposing tougher rules after its landmark privacy settlement three years ago. Meta said the Federal Trade Commission does not have the power to reopen the matter or unilaterally impose sweeping new regulations and that its $5 billion settlement over the Cambridge Analytica fiasco was finalized.

Four people were killed, including two Italian intelligence officers and a retired Israeli defense official, when a chartered house boat sank in a sudden storm on Lake Maggiore Sunday. The captain said a waterspout appeared in a sudden storm. The Italian captain's Russia girlfriend also died. The Gooduria boat was listed on a boat-chartering website for 2,000 euros a day, with an advertised maximum capacity of 15 passengers. But on the fatal Sunday, there were 21 passengers, plus two crew members on board. All passengers, in some way tied to Italian and Israeli intelligence work, the prosecutor's office said. The survivors said they were celebrating a birthday. Italians Tiziana Barnobi and Claudio Alonzi were active secret service agents, the Italian government confirmed. The Israeli citizen Erez Shimoni was retired. Israel's prime minister's office called him a dear friend to the country's security forces. The Italian prosecutor said passengers are not under investigation and would not comment on what they might have been doing on the boat. The captain is under investigation for culpable manslaughter. Efforts to salvage the boat are being closely watched by Italian security officials and should provide more clues to the mysterious Sunday outing turned deadly. (END VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (on camera): And you know, what's really important I think to note here, is that we may never know what those 21 people, who are not related to each other, all connected to intelligence services, were doing that day.

This is NASA's time to come on board with all of that, with this committee they put together that's going to have a report out this summer basically saying, here's what we think is going on up there. Now, they're not going to answer a lot of things because they -- they will say some things can be explained as balloons or flights of birds or maybe aircraft that people didn't know were up there. Some of it they'd say they can't explain. But more importantly what they're saying is they're trying to put together a roadmap going forward. A way to combine actual scientific observation of these things with the anecdotal observation you have. Because the problem is they have too much of that right now. There are too many people with iPhones and saying I saw something and maybe it looked like this. Did they come up with a general idea of what these things look like based upon what they have heard anecdotally? Yes, they say generally the characteristics of these unidentified anomalous phenomenon -- as they call them now -- are they're round and small, white, silver or translucent, around 10,000 to 30,000 feet, stationary to Mach 2, twice the speed of sound, and there's no thermal exhaust. But that is nothing but an average of a lot of people saying, well, I think I saw this. And what NASA is trying to say is, it's easy to say what you think you saw. If we really want to get to the bottom of what's going on here, we need to quantify this. We need to be able to say exactly what was happening. Where was it? How fast it was traveling? They think by doing that, they will get rid of a lot of the noise and get down to the few items that they really don't know. Are they advanced weapons systems? Are they surveillance systems from other countries or even the NASA people say, or are they from somewhere else, some other place out in the galaxy? They don't think it's that. They don't think it's that. And even though many skeptics say even if they knew, they would never tell us, the NASA people at the end of all of this said, look, many of us spend our lives wondering if we can find life out there. If we can find it, we'd sure like to. We'll see what their report says later this summer. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
