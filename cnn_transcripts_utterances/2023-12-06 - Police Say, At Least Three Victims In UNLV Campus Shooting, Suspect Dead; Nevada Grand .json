We will update you when we know more.We also know, based on that press conference that law enforcement has been going through each of the buildings on this expansive campus, each building, floor by floor, making sure to clear out all the floors, making sure to find anyone else who may be injured. And on top of it, you have all these people on campus who were sheltering in place. They want to make sure that they get them out safely as well and they have set up a reunification point at the convention center there in Las Vegas to get people off of campus. And they're going to -- slowly they're transporting them there so that they can be put back together with their loved ones as well. All of this, still having the area still blocked off, it was a sizable response with a SWAT Team. Also we saw some armored vehicles responding to the scene. We don't have a lot of information, but we do know that there have been patients that have been taken to area hospitals. What we also understand is that this was happening near Beam Hall, which is where the Lee Business School is. It has classrooms, laboratories, and also computer labs there. There were also some reports that there may have been shots fired at the student union, which was very close to Beam Hall. So, unclear yet if there are two separate locations for this, but law enforcement officials do believe that it was just one individual and that one person has been neutralized. But a very terrifying day for these students who were in the middle of their study period, getting ready for final examinations before their winter holiday and being on campus and having this come through and come forward. We know school has been canceled for the rest of today throughout all of the higher education institutions throughout Nevada, but still a terrifying day here but they're saying now that the threat is over, Wolf.",

It's not as simple as just these folks signed these documents, they were false, therefore, it's a crime. You have to be able to prove as a prosecutor specific, guilty knowledge and intent as to each individual person.And if we want proof of that, there were seven states that submitted false slates of electors. Only three now, including Nevada, have brought any criminal charges against the fake electors. And if we look at Georgia, they charged their case extremely aggressively. They had 16 fake electors, but only chose to charge 3 of the 16 with the crime. And I think that reflects the fact that you need that specific proof of fraudulent intent. I think we can presuppose that Nevada has that here. They wouldn't have brought these charges. And perhaps that came from Kenneth Cheseboro, who pled guilty in Georgia, and we know was involved in the broader scheme here.

On the one hand, on the bad side for prosecutors, Mike Pence was very slow to disavow these election fraud claims. He wrote an article in March of 2021, two months after January 6th, saying he still had concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election. That's not going to be good for prosecutors. On the other hand, he's a firsthand witness. He was the person who Donald Trump pressured. He was the person who resisted that pressure and refused to throw the election.

Republican James Langford said this is not the end. And Republicans are planning to send over a counterproposal on the border, but very unclear if it's going to break the impasse. One of the key sticking points has been on asylum laws. That's something that Democrats have signaled some openness to in terms of enforcing some stricter provisions there. But Republicans have been pushing for much stricter hard-line crackdowns on asylum laws and that is seen as a nonstarter with Democrats. So, we'll see where they go from here. But even if they can agree on something in the Senate, it's far from certain they'll be able to agree in the House. Over there, Speaker Mike Johnson doesn't want to include Israel and Ukraine in a package together. He wants to keep those two issues separate. And he's also been pushing for a very strict partisan House GOP security bill to be part of the deal. And that has been a non-starter with Democrats as well.

Republicans just sent a very clear message that the bill isn't going anywhere without very serious border reform. Do Democrats need to make more significant compromises, as President Biden put it, to get this over the finish line? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): The decision that the Republicans have made is dangerous. It's reckless. Listen, there's lots of extraneous policy that I want passed as well. I support changes in our gun laws to make sure that we don't have any more mass shootings, like we just saw at UNLV. But I'm not demanding that my list of proposals on guns be enacted into law in order to save Europe from Vladimir Putin. That fight is too important. And yet Republicans are essentially holding hostage support for both Israel and for Ukraine based upon their extreme demands about changing border policy. Yes. I've been in the room for three weeks trying to deal with this Republican hostage taking exercise. So far, they have not put on the table any proposals that could win Democratic votes. Maybe we will get back to that negotiating table tomorrow after this unfortunate failed vote today. But Republicans have to understand that we are not going to shut down the border completely. We need to at least have the ability for people fleeing terror and torture to come to the United States and shutting down the legal pathways in the United States. All that does is just encourage people to come here illegally, to sneak into the country, making a bigger mess than we have today.

They also blocked legislation to ban assault weapons in this country, and then three hours later, another tragic mass shooting. I'm heartbroken by this, but I'm buoyed by the fact that last year we finally broke the logjam. We beat the NRA last summer. We passed the first major anti-gun violence legislation in 30 years. And though the mass shootings have not declined, overall gun violence rates have declined by as much as 10 to 12 percent in some of our biggest cities. So, we have seen what happens when you pass legislation tightening our gun laws, less people die. And, hopefully, we can get back to that work very quickly.",
