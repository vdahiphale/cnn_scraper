      "sentences": "Welcome back to our special coverage of this major legal drama playing out in Trump's hush money trial. Hope Hicks just excused from the stand, but not before the former first lady, Melania Trump, came up in testimony. Hicks was asked about whether Trump was concerned about how the McDougal story, the story about former playmate Karen McDougal, would affect things at home.She answered, quote: President Trump really values Mrs. Trump's opinion, and she doesn't weigh in all the time, but when she does, it's really meaningful to him. And, you know, he really, really respects what she has to say. I think she was just concerned about what the perception of this would be. I know that was weighing on him. Let's talk to Paula Reed a little bit about this moment. Paula, this, it was interesting to see on cross-examination where Trump's attorney went here.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well done here by the defense attorneys. They really took their opportunity to drive home one of the key points of their defense, which is that the money that was paid to Stormy Daniels was meant to keep her quiet about the affair, though not to help Trump's chances in the election, but instead to protect his family. And here, Hope Hicks helping them with that defense, saying, yes, then-candidate Trump, he was concerned about how things would play with these stories in terms of his wife.He was concerned when the McDougal story came out. He didn't want newspapers being delivered to his residence. He didn't want his wife to see it. So this helps the defense amplify their argument that the reason that all of these hush money deals were brokered was to protect his family, not to protect his chances of winning the White House. So Hope Hicks was able to help the defense there. They also asked a lot about Michael Cohen. And like pretty much all the other witnesses in this case, Brianna, Hope Hicks doesn't have a lot of very nice things to say about Cohen, sort of suggesting that he didn't have a role in the campaign, but he tended to meddle. Yes, he was known as a fixer, but it's usually because he had broken something. So, again, not a flattering statement about Cohen, who is, of course, someone who will take the stand, will be a very complicated witness for prosecutors. It seems the one thing that all sides of this case agree on is that nobody has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen.",

      "sentences": "So here's what I think. And it's interesting that the prosecution did not take the opportunity. They could have redirect examined her and chose not to.There's a couple of reasons why. The two big sort of blows to the prosecution that came up were number one, this money was, these payouts were made not just for the campaign, but to, you know, hide from Donald Trump's family, personal reasons, one. And two, Michael Cohen had a practice of going rogue and acting independently of Donald Trump. I guess that the prosecution felt that neither of those things are that revolutionary in terms of the case. Those are the main arguments the defense has been raising all along and will raise. They raised in their opening statement. They will raise in their closing. It's not worth going back and questioning a witness that's already crying to try to patch up stuff that is sort of at the heart of the defense's case. It was fine to leave it be.",

That with prosecutors saying, look, this is what it is. Defensing, this is what it is. And I don't want to go so far as to say that Hope Hicks was damaging for one versus the other, because the fact still remains that Cohen was a go- to phone call for Trump.And at the end of the day, this is a case. The defendant is Trump. It's not actually Michael Cohen. And so it'll be interesting how this conversation plays out the next couple of days with the witnesses as we get closer to Cohen himself. But he's not on trial, right? And fundamentally, just because he wasn't part of the campaign, it doesn't mean that Trump himself didn't go to him when he had concerns. But of course, it's sort of fascinating to see the inner workings of this, right? Someone being dismissive of a person in the inner circle and seeing those dynamics play out.",

Her response, quote: It was Mr. Trump's opinion that it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election. For some more perspective now, we're joined by presidential historian Jeffrey Engel to talk a little bit more about this.

They talk about appeals. They talk about jury selection. But the truth of the matter is this case is exactly what the people who wrote the Constitution would have worried about for a person who wanted to become president.Because whether or not Donald Trump is convicted by this trial, he still would meet the standard that they use for impeachment, which was high crime and misdemeanors, which is to say something which is an offense against the people, an offense against the nature of the state. So by essentially misleading voters, he's doing exactly what the people who wrote the Constitution worried about. And in fact, they pointed out that a man who would mislead the voters once is more than likely to do it again and again.",

The reason why prosecutors did not question her a second time was that there was little to be gained and little new ground to be trod because these were all arguments that I think prosecution ought to have been ready for, namely that Michael Cohen went rogue, Michael Cohen's got credibility issues, and, you know, it's generally not fatal. So she made the central point that the prosecution's attempting to prove, which is that number one, she knows that Donald Trump and Michael Cohen met. And number two, they were mindful of the impact of these stories on the campaign. That's what the prosecution sought to get. The defense could have their way with her.
