Five-thirty here on the East Coast.Nikki Haley, the last remaining Republican challenger to frontrunner Donald Trump -- she's promising to stay in the race for the long haul, and she's also been sharpening her attacks against the former president in the final days ahead of Saturday's South Carolina primary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I promise you this. On Sunday, I'm headed to Michigan, and then we're going to Super Tuesday states, and we're going to keep on going.

She spent $6 million in a flurry of ads. And she's been attacking Trump on his military record, on foreign policy, and on his fitness for office. But it's unclear if any of those attacks are going to be enough to save her on Saturday. Let's bring in someone who is in South Carolina right now, Meg Kinnard. She's national politics reporter at the Associated Press. Meg, good morning. It's always wonderful to see you. You, of course, live in South Carolina. You've been covering the lead- up to these events -- to this primary on Saturday. What do you -- how did it feel at these events? I mean, does this actually feel like a fight or does it feel like a foregone conclusion? MEG KINNARD, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS (via Webex by Cisco):  Hey, Kasie. Good morning. It's always good to be with you. There is a mix of both I think. At these Haley events, there are a lot of people who are excited to see her, some of whom remember her from her time as governor and some of whom are new to the state and are just getting to know her. But from a lot of the voters I talk to, they do feel that their vote, while they're excited to cast it for her, is just kind of a symbol at this point. They feel certain that Donald Trump is going to be victorious here and they wish that weren't the case. But they feel that it's their duty and their obligation to at least do what she's doing now in her campaign, which is stand up to him. So it's not necessarily, even for some of her most fervent supporters, about defeating Donald Trump on Saturday. It's just standing up and saying well, at least I cast my vote for somebody who wasn't Donald Trump.",

That seems unlikely based on the polling. I mean, the New Hampshire electorate -- there's a lot of undeclared voters, Independents -- even people who have previously voted Democratic who switched to be able to vote in that primary. She was above 40 percent there. The polls show that she's below that in South Carolina. Do you think she's going to stick to that, or do you get the sense she is going to follow through on her current claims, which are that she's going to Michigan and Super Tuesday?",

But it doesn't seem likely at this point that she's going to be shrinking that margin between her votes and Donald Trump's votes.I asked her that last week and said what does victory here for you actually look like, and she continues to talk about getting that margin closer and closer to Donald Trump. But when you look at the math and you think about the voters who represent -- who is likely to show up on Saturday in South Carolina's primary, it really doesn't seem that she's going to be able to close that gap even further than she did in New Hampshire. You rightly point out New Hampshire is full of different kinds of voters that are here in South Carolina. Yes, it's an open primary. Yes, people who didn't vote in the Democratic primary a few weeks ago can vote on Saturday if they so choose. That's a line that we've also heard her testing out in front of crowds -- not directly saying hey, Democrats, come vote for me, but just reminding people that they are available to vote if they didn't a couple of weeks ago. It just doesn't seem likely at this point that those numbers between her votes and Donald Trump's votes are going to be smaller than they were last time.",

But I'm not hearing voters bring up to me a lot of those lines that she is consistently referencing about Trump's connections to Vladimir Putin and concerns about what he might do if he gets back in office when it comes to Russia. Nikki Haley talks about that all the time but it doesn't really seem to be breaking through to the voters who are coming out to hear her and may really like her.

That may have already happened. Option number four, she doesn't know what she wants. I find most people who have come this far on the national stage typically do know what they want.

So my unpopular opinion, maybe she's got her eyes on that. I don't know. But she's definitely raised her name I.D. to the point and reminded herself to South Carolina voters hey, remember me? You voted for me a lot. I could be coming soon to a ballot near you in several years. So we'll see, but I think that could certainly be an option, particularly if Tim Scott -- since he's on that VP list, too -- is perhaps exploring his own options here when it comes to what he's going to be doing next.",

He can't make decisions given his newness to leadership, one, but also I think that he just doesn't know how to handle this very, very divided conference. They've been upset about the way he's handled passing short-term government funding bills to avoid government shutdowns. How he's yanked bills off the House floor prior to expected votes, like what just happened last week with the FISA bill. So there's a lot of frustration right now and I think that House conservatives are very much seeing Johnson as less of the ally that they thought he was going to be.",

But this idea that Congress could get together -- Republicans, Democrats -- to force a vote on Ukraine aid. Possible? Not possible? SOELLNER:  You know, I think that -- I guess I won't rule anything out. Anything's possible. I know that there's now a bipartisan solution coming out of the House. But right now, I would say that it's really, really challenging with the state that the House is in right now. I think that there's a growing faction of the House Republicans that are against Ukraine and against giving more aid in general on foreign policy. And I am going to add that these members are not only just against providing aid to U.S. allies, but they're against the U.S. even being in these global organizations like NATO. And this all really started -- I think it's been brewing for a long time, but I think it really became public with the rise of Trump and how a lot of these members have really followed this kind of America First policy or a movement, I should say, when it comes to how the U.S. should lead on the foreign stage.",
