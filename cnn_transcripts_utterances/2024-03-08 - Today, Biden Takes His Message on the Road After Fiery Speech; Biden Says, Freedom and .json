But the president also really used this as a chance to draw that contrast with Trump, even as he did not name his predecessor directly by name, simply referring to him as my predecessor at least 13 times in this speech, really trying to set up those contrast arguments when it comes to democracy, freedoms and reproductive rights.

He attacked Biden heavily. He went after him on his positions on Ukraine and Social Security, but his attacks also grew increasingly personal. We know that House Speaker Mike Johnson warned Republicans to maintain decorum yesterday in the chamber, but that was advice that did not reach Donald Trump. He very much attacked Biden. He mocked his appearance. He mocked his hair and his walk and also claimed that he was, quote, so angry and crazy. Now, Donald Trump also responded on Truth Social with some video, taped video messages in response to Biden's speech, one of which really trying to turn the tables on Joe Biden's argument that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, as we have seen Donald Trump do in the past. He claimed that Biden is the true threat. Take a listen.

So, I think he had to mention it. That can't be the only message he delivers because there are progressives in the Democratic coalition who want to hear much more and he gave them more about Gaza last night and he also wants everybody wants a vision for the future.

That's what you're looking at with the State of the Union and looking at this speech in the historical context.

The question is how did this wheel come off? Probably not a Boeing issue because this airplane was 22 years old so not recently in the factory. Was it a maintenance-induced issue? This plane may have been in maintenance, although we're just speculating now, because it came in from Paris. There's a maintenance base at San Francisco International Airport. And also, was this just something that simply broke? These wheels take a lot of punishment, Sara. They have to support this airplane that's 300 tons. That's why there were 14 of them on a 77. But imagine getting the call that your car was just destroyed by a tire that fell from the air. Of course, United Airlines says it's helping out those people who had their cars damaged.
