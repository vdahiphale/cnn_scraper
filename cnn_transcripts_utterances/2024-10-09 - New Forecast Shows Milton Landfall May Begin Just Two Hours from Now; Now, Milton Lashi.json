A new forecast warns landfall may begin only two hours from now.Conditions in the hurricane strike zone are growing much more dangerous by the minute as Milton unleashes ferocious winds, torrential rains, and a slew of destructive tornadoes. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're following every angle of the major breaking news in Florida right now, Hurricane Milton taking aim at the Tampa Bay region, and now on a faster track toward a devastating landfall. This monster storm is posing grave and urgent danger. And residents who haven't escaped Milton's path are being warned it's now too late to get out. CNN teams are fanned out all along Florida's Gulf Coast in areas bracing for the worst of this storm. Our Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir is on the scene in St. Petersburg, Florida. Bill, what's the latest from where you are?",

We've been watching them get increasingly violent over the last several hours now. And this is the main event arriving on the west coast of Florida.Just for perspective, the last time a major storm hit the Tampa-St. Pete area in 1921. Since then, there's an extra 3 million people living here. And thanks to climate change and global warming, the oceans are a foot higher than they were a century ago. And on top of this storm surge worry that so many people have been talking about leading up to this, these tornadoes that have been kicking up around the state, monster wedge-shaped tornadoes, one in Fort Pierce. And so, sadly, a lot of the folks who evacuated from the coasts are in those inland areas where these tornadoes are going off right now. So, it seems like at the moment, where is the safe place in Florida? This storm is going to stretch across the entire peninsula. It's going to affect lives for months and maybe years to come here. In addition to the storm surge, you can't even see downtown St. Pete anymore because the bands have come in. But there are four big 30, 40- storey tower construction cranes that we were watching move like windsocks in 45-mile-an-hour gusts. Right now, we're probably hitting gusts around 60 or so. It could get up to obviously over 100 miles an hour. And the city actually put out a warning specific to those towers, if you're downtown, being cognizant of those as well. But this is just the beginning. We're going to watch this water. We're going to keep an eye on the infrastructure here, Wolf. But this is next level. We've covered a lot of these. The fact that this is coming less than two weeks after Helene, the fact that there are mountains of debris uncollected that are now turning into floating and flying projectiles in this monster Category 3 blender, we're buckling down and really just hoping for the best.

It's not going to weaken below hurricane strength as it crosses the Florida Peninsula. So, even once it emerges out on the Western Atlantic, it's still going to be a hurricane.

It feels like pellets bouncing off of your skin. The wind also is very, very strong. We're looking at very powerful winds coming off of Tampa Bay. It has knocked down tree branches. There's also all kinds of debris left over from Hurricane Helene that we are concerned about in this area. There's wood and metal from a pier that was badly damaged during that last hurricane that set records for storm surge just about two weeks ago. Those records are set to be shattered because of Hurricane Milton.You're looking at a 15-foot storm surge potentially in Sarasota, which is only a few miles south of here. Here in Tampa Bay, you're looking at 8 to 12 feet of storm surge, and it is incredibly powerful to witness what Mother Nature can do. When we first got here this afternoon, this is Tampa Bay behind me, the water had receded significantly, especially during low tide. Those easterly winds had dragged the water out from the bay. Now that water is coming back, and it is coming back strong. There are very powerful waves smacking into the seawall here. Usually, you can see the urban skyline of Tampa behind me. Right now, it is a mass of gray. Aside from that, Wolf, there are serious concerns about tornadoes and not just in this western region of the state of Florida, but all across the state. Today, there have been at least 90 tornado warnings across Florida. That is a record in a single day, 90 tornado warnings, including some as far as about 200 miles from where this storm is set to make landfall. Earlier today, we got a confirmed tornado touching down in Broward County. As you know, Wolf, that is in the southeastern part of Florida, nowhere near this central western region of the Sunshine State. As Hurricane Milton barrels down, the other concern for officials is the fact that this storm is moving a bit faster than expected. It is getting closer to Florida quicker than they thought. Initially, landfall later, later this evening. Now, within the next hour, hour- and-a-half to two hours, we're at about 8:00 P.M., we're looking at landfall from Hurricane Milton as a Category 3 storm. It is going to be insanely powerful. Wolf, officials have made clear that folks that are staying and riding the storm out should not go outside for any reason. We've already seen Emergency Management Services get shut down in some of the barrier islands, including Anna Maria Island. It is simply too strong a storm for emergency officials to go out. So, even if you call out for an emergency, it is likely that there is not a helping hand coming. Wolf?",

As of the last few forecasts, the storm has shifted somewhat south, so it's likely Tampa Bay will not get a direct hit with the eye of Milton, but it is still an extremely powerful storm. We're talking about rainfall of up to a foot on top of that 8 to 12-foot storm surge for this area.

Tampa -- I just spoke with the mayor and I asked her when they would be suspending first responder services, when those police officers will no longer, because of their safety and concerns about that, be able to go out and help people in need. And she thought it wouldn't take that much longer anymore. They're around wind speeds, right, when it starts to getting to 40, 45 miles per hour, that is when they call it quits and don't allow their officers to go out there, again, out of concerns for their safety. Now, something interesting, Wolf, is going to be happening here to the Tampa Bay in terms of the water, we're going to see a wild swing from low to high water levels, even a reverse surge, as these easterly winds actually pulls the water out of the bay and into the ocean. And then by the time the storm passes, we're going to see a change of the wind direction. And then we could be seeing, according to NOAA, water levels projected to rise six feet in six hours by Thursday morning. Now, the good news in all of this, if you could call it that, is that we're not seeing the worst projections that we had seen earlier on of 10 to 15-foot storm surge for the Tampa Bay. So, that was going to be something incredibly unprecedented, even in comparison to Helene two weeks ago. The sheriff, I spoke with Sheriff Chad Chronister of Hillsborough County, he says what is keeping him up at night is not just the water, but all of this debris, he says the contractors drop the ball in clearing out the debris before Milton, Helene debris.

But let me take Hurricane Helene and its significant impact as an example.At its height, there were 5.1 million people without power, and we've reduced that by 4.9 million people. There were approximately 3.4 million people without communications, and we've reduced that by 3.2 million. And so working with the private sector, working across the federal government, working with our state and local officials, we have been able to deliver the resources for people. There are still people in remote areas adversely impacted, but our work continues. And as President Biden and Vice President Harris have said, we will be there for the long haul. We will not be there just for a moment in time,",

These are monsters, but this is just the beginning. We've just got gusts above 50 miles an hour, so Manatee County, that means they've stopped responding to 911 calls. Oh, I don't know if you can see the pelicans out there fighting against these gale force winds, nature, something to behold in these storms.But just for perspective, the last time a major hurricane hit Tampa- St. Pete, they've been so lucky for so long, over a century ago, 1921. And since then, over 3 million people have moved into this area. And thanks to climate change and a warmer planet melting the poles. The sea is a foot higher than it was in 1921. The tide is also working with this storm. Helene was against the tide for a little bit, but the tide hits high about 6:00 A.M. tomorrow morning, just as this storm surge is really going to be start to felt along the stretch of coast right here. Of course, we're worried about all of the debris that's still left over from Helene that's turning into floating and flying projectiles. But this storm is also kicking up a really extraordinary amount of tornadoes in Fort Pierce. One was spotted there as well. And there's never a good time to lose your house to a tornado, but the absolute worst time is a few hours before a hurricane like this comes. So, we were talking, Angela Fritz, our great climate editor at CNN, was saying we got to talk about how there's no place to evacuate to in Florida as a result of this super storm, supercharged Hurricane Milton. But we're going to be here, watch the waves come in. And if they breach and we start to see that surge into downtown St. Petersburg, we'll fall back to that and keep you posted. But for right now, we'll send it back to you.",
