New details on were reportedly said.I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan. Sara Sidner is in Israel. This is CNN News Central. A speaker of the House, it might be imminent. This could be happening for real this time, maybe, possibly. We are standing by for a full House floor vote on Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson, after the Republican House Conference said he was their man overnight. Now, if you're following this at home, this last three weeks, they booted Kevin McCarthy from the speaker's chair. They then picked on Steve Scalise, picked Steve Scalise, but he dropped out before a House vote. Then it was Jim Jordan's turn. They voted on him. He lost several House floor votes. Yesterday, they selected Tom Emmer. He lasted four hours before dropping out before a House floor vote. And then they settled on Mike Johnson late last night. Now, Emmer, gone too. Now, Mike Johnson, as far as he is concerned, they held a ballot to see how Republicans would vote today on the House floor. Three Republicans voted present, which is to say they withheld their support for Johnson. 22 were absent during that. If any 4 of any of these 25 against Johnson, that would be enough to spike his efforts. But we are getting new reporting on where some of these 25 are now headed. Let's get right to CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju on Capitol Hill for the very latest. Manu, what are you hearing? MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. After weeks of infighting and complete GOP disarray that has left the chamber completely paralyzed, unable to act on the nation's business, there are clear signs this morning that, finally, Republicans could put this ugly episode behind them. There is momentum behind Mike Johnson's bid to become speaker of the House there. At the moment, none of those members that you indicated there have indicated they will vote no on the House floor, which is good news for Johnson, who had been working behind the scenes overnight and into this morning to ensure that he does not have more than four Republican defections on the House. And the expectation at the moment is that he will now. Now, there is talking to a number of the Republicans over the last days. Some of them, even some of the more moderate members from swing districts, they say they're simply to move on. That is something that Congressman Mike Lawler told me last night, and also some of the more hard line members are falling in line behind him given Johnson's very conservative politics, indicating that perhaps this time they'll get the votes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  You know, obviously, I did not support the removal of Kevin McCarthy. I think it was arguably the stupidest move ever made in politics, but we have to move forward. And so we're going to rally around Mike Johnson and elect him as speaker tomorrow and get back to work. REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA):  It's a different situation now. There was a trust factor with leadership last time.",

They do not believe that Israel has the right to exist and that, therefore, that they are not asking for peace, not asking to try to figure out a solution. They're saying that Israel should not be.And then if you look at the actions that Hamas took, the chopping off of heads of babies and raping of women and taking of hostages and killing people, just innocent women and children in the streets, that's not the act of a group that is trying to liberate or anything of that nature.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Aid is slowly trickling into Gaza, but in U.N. camps, families desperate for food and water say they're getting bars of soap. This so-called aid provides nothing. We are dying a slow death, this man says. You don't hear the people screams at night when they fight over a piece of bread. There's not even water to drink. So far, the total amount of aid delivered is less than 1 percent of what the enclave would receive on a daily basis prior to this conflict. And a crucial lifeline is missing, fuel. Without it, UNRWA, the main U.N. agency on the ground, says it will be forced to halt operations by Wednesday night. The international community is begging for help.",

If the hospital is not provided with the necessary fuel for the generators, we are issuing a death sentence, this doctor says. The execution is in the hands of the free world. Everyone is guilty. Water pumps will soon stop working, too, making it even more difficult to get clean drinking water. Bakeries are closing, aid deliveries are more difficult, and more than 2 million people, half of them children, already under bombardment and under siege could face starvation. The clock is ticking. (END VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (on camera):  Now, there are intense, diplomatic efforts under way to try to get that fuel in before that deadline of Wednesday night, but there seems no indication, no sign that that's going to take place.
