And the disappearance of this binder was so alarming to intelligenceofficials that, according to our sources, they briefed Senate Intelligence Committee leadership about the situation last year. Now, we are told by one U.S. official familiar with the matter that this was not among the classified items that were found in last year's search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and it wasn't why the FBI searched Trump's residence.
