      "sentences": "John, the short answer to your first question is, not all that much. Senior administration officials insist the U.S. didn't give anything up to secure Private Travis King's release from North Korea. And North Korea didn't give a clear explanation as to their reasoning behind this. They simply said he was expelled and that an investigation into King had been completed.But what that investigation was based on, what they were looking for or what they found, well, North Korean state media hasn't put that sort of information out there. We know that the U.S. worked with Sweden as sort of an intermediary between the U.S. and North Korea to get him out of there, bring him to the Friendship Bridge on the Chinese border. From there he went into U.S. military custody with the U.S. defense attache to China. Was then flown from China to South Korea and landed at Joint Base San Antonio just a few hours ago. We had learned that he spoke with his family after he exited North Korea shortly after leaving the country there. And now he will go to Brook Army Medical Center, which is where detainees are taken to help them reacclimate to life outside of detention and in the United States. So, expect a medical evaluation. Perhaps a psychiatric evaluation. One of the key questions now is, will he face charges under the uniform code of military justice? Remember, he was AWOL, absent without leave. And officials here said that he went willfully and purposefully into North Korea of his own choice there, into an adversary state. So he could face charges. When that will happen, what those charges will be or if the army wants to go down that road, at least as of right now, those answers aren't clear.",

Now, these are the same Democrats that a majority of them have now publicly called on Menendez to resign from the Senate, to resign his seat. He pleaded not guilty yesterday in federal court. Federal investigators say that he and his wife took hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars and bribes from three businessmen to help them and also to help the Egyptian government. Remember, Menendez has been the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Menendez has said he will be fully exonerated. He has said he is innocent of these serious charges against him. But that has not stopped, as I mentioned, his colleagues, some of whom have served with him for decades, from saying that it's time for him to go. At least 30 of them so far. Joining us now for more on this is one of his former Democratic colleagues, former Democratic senator from Alabama, Doug Jones. Senator, thank you for coming in. You have said that you believe that Menendez should resign now. He was asked this week why he has not resigned. And he bristled at that. He said, because I'm innocent. Do you think it hurts Democrats in the Senate, in Congress, writ large, if he continues to hold out? DOUG JONES (D), FORMER U.S. SENATOR: I think it hurts the Senate. I don't necessarily think it hurts Democrats. I think it hurts the institution of the Senate and I do think it hurts Congress. I mean right now, you know, Congress, the Senate, the House are in low esteem in the American public's eye. They have been for some time. And it's because of so much of the dysfunction and there are a lot of reasons for that. But I think that, you know, there is an element of public trust here, which is different than, I think, than whether or not someone is guilty or not guilty of a criminal violation. And so I think it hurts the institution. I don't think it will hurt Democrats electorally, but I do think it hurts the institution of the Senate.",

And, you know, the way the Senate is set these days, you know, Democrats spend more time with other Democrats than they do Republicans. And you've got caucus luncheons and you've got other policy meetings and there's about three days where you really meet and you confer at committees. You do all of those things mainly with your colleagues on - in the Democratic caucus. And so you develop these friendships, you develop the respect, you develop things that I think are -- make it very difficult for those 30-some senators to come forward this weekend to say, I think there's a violation of the public trust here. I don't expect there to be a lot of minds changed on this. But I thinkit's good that they can do this. I don't expect Senator Menendez to really outline a defense. I think that that would be a mistake for his criminal case to do that. But I think he will outline why he believes he can and should continue to serve. We'll see if it changes anybody's minds one way or another, including whether or not the reactions from his colleagues change his mind.",

This was - it really was I don't think becoming of the Republican Party. I don't think it was becoming of the presidency.Some of the just silly lines, I think, that came out of this, and what folks are focused on. It's time that the people just start looking at all of the policies that folks are going to do and compare that with what Joe Biden's done on this economy and how we've improved this economy over the years, and focus on how, you know, the - Joe Biden has brought the world back together to fight for democracy. You don't hear any of that, and you don't hear any criticism of the real problems that Donald Trump presents to this country, calling for the potential execution of Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, calling for violence, calling for, you know, political persecution of enemies. Nobody talks about those things. Nobody talked about Tommy Tuberville's hold on the military promotions last night. It - so, we really didn't learn very much except they like to quibble.",

And people need to believe Donald Trump when he says he will do these things to strip -- to give the federal government more power with people that believe in persecuting political rivals, those kinds of things. He needs to -- I think it's a very appropriate thing.You know, Look, Joe Biden, for years, this is - this is a theme he has come back to his entire career. So, I think it complements what he's done for the American people, what he's doing for American labor and the working men and women of this country. It is not a substitute, it is just a compliment.
