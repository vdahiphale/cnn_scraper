Namely, a remote operated vehicle or a deepwater drone that is down there now, mapping out that - the remains of the Titan. There are five large pieces they found in two different debris fields, about 1,600 feet in front of the Titanic. And they - they're hoping to glean some information about the implosion and an explosion of that vessel and what exactly happened. They may end up bringing or try to bring up some pieces of it, but that will be a much more complicated process to do. But - so - all of this now becoming a very official process with the Canadian Transportation Safety Board announcing that they will open an investigation, a deepwater drone down there now mapping that out and trying to understand the vector and what happened as that sub descended to just above, not too far from the Titanic and then imploded, what sort of force and how could it have destroyed it in the way that it did.

And you can get two or three times multiple of what you could get out of steel or aluminum for that type of pressure bottle.But for something that's seeing external pressure, all of the advantages of composite materials go away and all the disadvantages come into play. We always understood that this was the wrong material for submersible hauls, because with each pressure cycle, you can have progressive damage. So it's quite insidious, because you may have a number of successful dives, which is what happened here, and then have it fail later. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They said, as the development and the testing was happening at the Titan, they were receiving a lot of pushback from the submersible community because these materials and the design choices were considered experimental and highly controversial.In fact that - I believe this letter that James Cameron was referring to was from the Marine Technology Society, we have a copy of that. It was from 2018. And they express these concerns very explicitly. One of the concerns saying that OceanGate's marketing materials were advertising that the Titan was exceeding or meeting industry safety standards, and they argued that OceanGate was not following the safety rules, saying, \"Your representation is, at minimum, misleading to the public and breaches an industry-wide professional code of conduct we all endeavor to uphold.\" Now, this morning our Anderson Cooper also spoke with the former co- founder of OceanGate who did leave the company back in 2013. But he came to Stockton Rush's defense this morning and talked about the fact that he believed Rush to be a very strong risk manager, the late-CEO Stockton Rush. Here's what else you have to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUILLERMO SOHNLEIN, CO-FOUNDER, OCEANGATE: I had absolutely full confidence in Stockton in the design of the sub and his ability to engineer it and most importantly to take it through a rigorous test program. So I had absolutely no qualms with it. What I do have qualms with is the fact that so many of us in a rush to get answers to our questions are starting to speculate without waiting for all of the data. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Impeachment number two had to do with Donald Trump's role on January 6th. He was accused, of course, of inciting the insurrection here in this building on that day, but in a key announcement just moments ago, in that same press gaggle, Kevin McCarthy told the group of us, he does support this effort to expunge those Trump impeachments.
