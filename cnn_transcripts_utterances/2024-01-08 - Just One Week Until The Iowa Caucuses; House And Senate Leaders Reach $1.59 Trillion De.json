That's really what you're seeing and it's giving sort of a permission structure to Republicans who may want to vote for Trump again or who are undecided when you have Republicans in leadership saying there's nothing to see here. He didn't do anything wrong. It's Democrats who tried to manipulate the election. So she talked about a number of things, sort of asserting that there were problems in Pennsylvania. There were not.

He still holds a majority of support of African American voters -- clear majorities -- but not with the same intensity as in 2020, according to the polls. That's very troubling.

And Austin trying to make clear within the last couple of days that was his decision and his screw-up; not the White House's. So I think we're starting to see more details emerge from the Pentagon -- a slightly clearer picture but still a lot of questions about what was the medical procedure he was going in for. Why wasn't anyone notified then, much less a week later when he became ill with pain? Much less, days after that? And so, there are questions inside the administration among Democrats and certainly among Republicans who are going to try to -- once Lloyd Austin is back in better health -- perhaps haul him up to Capitol Hill or compel him to answer some of those -- some of those questions. It is a longstanding practice and expectation in a civilian role like that, especially this close to the top of the chain and in the middle of so much military tension not just in Ukraine because of Russia but in the Middle East right now -- concerns around China -- to have the head of the Defense Department out for several days. Even leadership inside his own ranks not really necessarily understanding where he is. So a lot of questions to answer.

And already, Johnson is facing pushback from far-right House Republicans who wanted steeper cuts. The Freedom Caucus is calling the agreement a quote \"total failure.\"So let's bring in Farnoush Amiri, congressional reporter for the Associated Press. Great to see you. So let's start out with what is actually in this deal. What did they agree to here? FARNOUSH AMIRI, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS (via Webex by Cisco):  The majority of it we saw last summer when then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden were negotiating on the Hill to come up with a top line number. It is -- it is -- it continues with that but it's $16 billion in addition to that. And I think more importantly, what it isn't is what many -- $30 billion short of what the Senate wanted, which includes Senate Republicans and defense spending.

And since then, the leader of that committee, Mark Green, has released a report where they've called -- they've said Mayorkas has -- you know, has committed a dereliction of duty. That he is directly responsible for the surge in migrant crossings at the southern border and that he, in their words, has committed high crimes and misdemeanors and deserves an impeachment proceeding. So that's going to begin in earnest this Wednesday with the first hearing.

(Audio difficulty) We've got a lot of sports as we -- we're going to get back to Coy in just a moment. But let's start with the Bills and Dolphins. It was the final game of the regular season. The Bills were down seven early in the fourth quarter. The winner takes the division. And let's go Buffalo. Deonte Harty, hero of western New York this morning, taking the punt all the way for the score -- 96 yards, leaving the fastest team in the league in his dust. And this game tied at 14. You could see the reaction there on the sideline. Then, Josh Allen caps off the comeback finding Dawson Knox for the go- ahead touchdown as Buffalo rallies 21-14, clinching the division and a home game next Sunday against the Steelers. Meanwhile, the Eagles are literally and figuratively limping into the postseason on top of losing five of their six last games. Star wide receiver A.J. Brown left the game in the first quarter with a knee injury, as you can see there, while Jalen Hurts suffered a dislocated finger early in the second, though he did come back in. Now, keep an eye on both of them as Philly tries to regroup as they head to Tampa to play the Bucks on Monday. So here's the full bracket. 49ers and Ravens get the first-round byes. Also, a couple of great reunions. Rams QB Matt Stafford returns to Detroit to play the Lions. And Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill heads back to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs. All right, today is Black Monday, when NFL teams part ways with coaches. Bill Belichick's 24-year run with the Patriots might be over. After winning six Super Bowls and amassing the most postseason wins in history, the Patriots have had a losing record three of the last four years. And then, my team, the Falcons. Atlanta's Arthur Smith was furious at Saints coach Dennis Allen when his team scored with just seconds left to go, up 48-17. Smith has had a losing record in each of his three seasons in Atlanta.
