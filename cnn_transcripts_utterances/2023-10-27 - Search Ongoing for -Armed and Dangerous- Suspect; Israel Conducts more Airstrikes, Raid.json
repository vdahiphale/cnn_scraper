Robert Card is considered armed and dangerous. Officials say they found the Army Reservist phone and a note he left behind. But the note doesn't explain a motive. Meanwhile, the search is expanding. Authorities say they found the suspect's vehicle and a gun near a boat launch. That raises the possibility he may have escaped by water.

And that suggests, you know, he had a powerboat registered to him. At one point, there was a Jet Ski involved. They provided some details in terms of divers that are going to go into the river.

And now, you know, that's what they're looking for. Certainly, that's one of the things they're looking for. But their interest, I'm sure is broader than that. If he had as Evan has explained a plan of escape. It's no coincidence that he went to that boat launch, right? Maybe he had another vehicle stashed there, maybe he had a boat stash there and it was some sort of a relay point. If that's the case, it's just as likely that he may have disposed of things in that water. He may have thrown the gun in the water, he could have like, changed his clothes and taken the clothes that he wore was obviously filmed at the shooting, wearing and throwing those into the water. So those are just two examples of the things that investigators might be looking for. They typically do this with either boats, man operated boats, or remotely operated watercraft that includes some sort of sonar detection. And so they'll put that watercraft in that area, and they'll conduct a grid search going back and forth, essentially looking for things that are anomalous. Things that don't, you know, shapes that you don't get a perfect picture, but you get shapes and sizes of things that maybe shouldn't be in that area and maybe cause raise a question for further investigation, every time they see one of those things where they get a reading like that off the sonar. They then actually have to send divers in to investigate to see what those things are up close. I don't know what the water condition is there. But in smaller bodies of water, this can be really tedious because they're, you know, when the water is murky, hard to see in its very tough circumstances for the divers, you always end to end at a time. There are all kinds of safety requirements that slow that process down. So I think we should expect to see that activity taking place. But it probably could go on for some time.

We've talked a lot about survival in the woods. But how that may play into this? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Kasie, you know, there are a lot of different factors here. But he seems to be the quintessential outdoorsman, in some ways in data. He's probably proficient in land navigation. And it sounds like he's also proficient in using boats. You know, being able to navigate the rivers in the area, he may have had some dive experience. I'm not sure about that. I don't think we've really heard whether or not he's very, you know get that kind of a certification. But regardless, he, you know, has probably had at the very least land navigation training. And that does include crossing bodies of water in the military, especially when the army trains for this kind of thing. The ranger training, for example, does include that kind of training. So those are the kinds of things that the police need to look at, that he has those skills, he could have used, you know, the water as a means of escape. And he may very well have gone somewhere. That's why the Coast Guard is involved in the search as well. So this could be something that would be part of that.",

So I mean, provisionally agree with Juliette's read on the press, not just the recent press conferences, but really the ones thatwe've seen all along there clear sense of reticence about sharing additional information with the public, I totally understand that I've been on the other side of managing and giving these press conferences. We've seen every flavor of this, right? Over the course of crises, and many, many mass shootings, we've seen big, very sophisticated, police agencies handle this burden. And we've seen the smallest kind of out of the way places does it as well. And everybody has a different style. This group seems to really reluctant to even acknowledge facts that are perfectly obvious to the public. And I think repeatedly doing that you get what you have what Juliette referred to, as these people start to lose faith in the agency's ability to work the case to find the culprit, to build the case to prosecute someone if that's appropriate. And that's really critical for the police department. So I think kind of being a little more upfront about this would help them. However, in terms of the lock downs, you know, they really need to lay out some sort of an expectation for the public, even if it's just to say, look, as long as we have leads to follow up here in this area. We're going to ask that you locked down that could take a day that could take a week or more. But police like work with us, once they get to the point where they've exhausted every local lead, and they really think or they have good reason to believe that he is outside the area, then at that point, there's no reason to maintain the lockdown. And so if you could at least set that out for the public to understand like, OK, I get it. They really believe he's here. We're going to keep really hunkering down until they exhaust that.

And kind of the way it created this confrontation between him and this ministry it amidst a very combustible conflict. And we have seen the President sometimes make these comments when he's been briefed by things. Sometimes we have to follow up and say, hey, did you really mean that? Here we see Kirby saying, yes, he did. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: He didn't mean it. And oftentimes, we've, you know, over the years wondered if the President was misspeaking or just stating the truth that his advisors didn't necessarily want to just say, and this was an example of that. But look, I think with I mean, it's something we've known, obviously, that Hamas is in control of the Health Ministry, and it's having John Kirby sort of refreshed that statement from the White House podium is important because this has become such a politically inflamed issue, at least domestically speaking about the hospital, about the various of fact checks and things. So this is something that the President has been pretty consistent and clear on here.

Dean Phillip is not going to beat Joe Biden. So the best he can hope for is weaken Joe Biden, but his argument is not on issues. He doesn't think Biden's been wrong about jobs or health care. He simply just thinks he's too weak. And so he's going to weaken him more. To me, it doesn't make any sense. But I bet you the Biden people are pretty darn angry.",

He's just going to a New Hampshire where the Democratic primary really isn't even happening this year. So yes, he's going to go on to South Carolina, we're told and Michigan.

So you have that on the one hand, you know, they're really kind of twisting a knife there at Phillips and getting, you know, South Carolina, obviously sent Biden to the White House.

I cannot think of a time in all of American history that an incumbent president was defeated for re nomination in his own party. Teddy Roosevelt couldn't do it against William Howard Taft. Ronald Reagan couldn't be Gerald Ford. Pat Buchanan, not exactly in Reagan's class couldn't be George H.W. Bush, so it's not going to happen. But in all three of those cases, the challenger within the party weakened the incumbent president enough that the other party took the White House.

I mean, the fundamental reality remains that no Republican has managed to really put a dent in Donald Trump's you know, trip toward the Republican nomination, even though he's been, you know, he's facing four trials essentially. Governor DeSantis is trying very hard all of a sudden to do it. He did not do this at the beginning of his campaign. But there was you know, a couple days ago, I noticed a tweet from the DeSantis war room. They said breaking; today we were unveiled unveiling the Trump accident tracker, a way of recording how long the former president can go without a workplace accident on the campaign trail. Why is this needed? We'll explain. Basically, they're tracking Donald Trump's gaffes. In many ways it's as though they're trying to compare him to the current President Joe Biden, who Republicans obviously are eagerly, you know, they're very excited to point out when President Biden makes a verbal gaffe or a misstep.

In March, if you think back to that period before the indictment started, there were some real questions and concerns about the health and future of the Trump candidacy. Of course, he has rallied the Republican base, and his rivals have largely watched all this happen with the exception of Asa Hutchinson and Chris Christie. But now, several of them are firing back because time is running out. So for the Florida governor now he basically has put virtually all of his eggs in the Iowa basket, if you will. This is someone who started with a campaign he was going to go across the country. He had the super PAC, which is largely supporting his campaign was doing a field work in California of all places and several states. Now it's all to Iowa. So basically that is what has happened. So over the next two and a half months, their voters still do have open minds when we travel to Iowa and talk to voters, so some are looking for a change.
