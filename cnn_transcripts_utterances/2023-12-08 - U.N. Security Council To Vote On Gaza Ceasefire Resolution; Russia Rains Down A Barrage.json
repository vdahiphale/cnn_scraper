That's according to Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military. He also says that they have been disrobed in order to make sure that they do not have an explosive vest on them. The response from Hamas and Palestinians has been very different, of course. A member of Hamas' Political office Izzat al-Risq says that this is quote, \"kidnapping, invasive searches, and disrobing.\" And he says that these are a quote, \"group of displaced Palestinians calling this a reprehensible crime.\" What is clear though, is that the images speak for themselves in terms of what you can see here, which is dozens of Palestinian men, blindfolded, stripped of their clothes, sitting in the streets or sitting in the backs of military vehicles. And in what, the Israeli military conducted here is clearly a mass detention. Some of these men may very well be Hamas fighters, but what we do know is that some of them certainly are not. And that's because relatives of some of these individuals, as well as the employers of some of these individuals, have already spoken out and identified some of these men. One of the men already has been identified as a correspondent for \"Al-Arabi Al-Jadid,\" a Palestinian news outlet. There is also another man whose relative said is not involved with fighting, not involved with Hamas, who simply exited his home after there was a mass call by the Israeli military in the streets for all fighting-age men to come out of their homes. And when he did so, he was eventually detained. Now, the Israeli military says that it investigates and checks who has ties to Hamas and who does not. But for now, at least, it appears that at least some of these men are not Hamas fighters and were detained. Some of them, of course, very well could be.",

All of this was expected to be resolved with a plea deal over thesummer, where Hunter Biden would have pleaded to two misdemeanors to resolve this investigation. But after that plea deal fell apart, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney David Weiss, who has been investigating Hunter Biden's finances and other matters going back as far as 2018, he was appointed a special counsel. And since then, he has brought two criminal cases against the president's son. Now, just last night, these charges include, as you said, these are nine tax offenses, three felonies, and six misdemeanors, quite a contrast to that plea deal with just two misdemeanors. And he'd previously filed gun charges, three charges in Delaware against Hunter Biden. Now, according to the special counsel's team, Hunter Biden engaged in a four-year scheme not to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. And this indictment, it's quite voluminous. I was actually quite surprised last night, having followed this case pretty quickly, pretty closely rather, they include a lot of embarrassing details about what else he spent his money on instead of paying his taxes. Prosecutors say, quote, \"He used it to pay for drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing and other items of a personal nature, in short, anything but his taxes.\" Now, we'll note that eventually, Hunter Biden did repay these taxes, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and penalties. And in a statement, one of his attorneys, Abby Lowell, said that Hunter Biden's last name was anything other than Biden, that he would not be facing these criminal cases in Delaware and now California. They insist that the special counsel has sort of folded to political pressure from Republicans. Now, he faces the possibility, a maximum sentence of 17 years, if he is convicted. But his lawyers have said that they're pretty confident that they can beat these charges both in Delaware and in California in court. And of course, most people don't get the maximum sentence, but certainly a very grave situation for the president's son.",

They've seen trucks go on Columbia and Harvard that were doxing them, saying they should never be employed.

But they should also underscore what a university is supposed to do and how they're going to protect their students not from hearing hateful things, but understanding it and getting the tools to speak back against it better using the tools of the faculty.

CNN's Vedika Sud has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): The world's two most populous nations are deepening their reliance on fossil fuels. Governments in India and in China, home to almost 3 billion people combined, want to satisfy a growing need for energy by burning more coal. Both are pledging greater coal-fired power capacity and putting their net- zero ambitions in doubt. There will be no compromise on power needed for growth, India's Minister for Power, R.P. Singh said last month, even if it means addition of coal- based capacity. In November, the United Nations production gap report revealed that if all the coal projects currently planned around the world materialize, we will burn 460 percent more coal in 2030 than water be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.",

Grief is a powerful, complex emotion that never fully goes away. But too often, it's faced alone. CNN's Anderson Cooper continues his own deeply personal journey. And in the second season of his podcast, he lost and eventually finding purpose beyond pain. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON COOPER, HOST, \"ALL THERE IS WITH ANDERSON COOPER\" PODCAST (voice- over): A few days before I spoke with President Biden, I was going through a box of stuff in my basement that belonged to my brother Carter. He died by suicide when he was 23. I don't have a lot of pictures of my brother on display in my house. His death is still so painful to me that I find it hard to see his photos. These two pictures really stunned me. They were taken shortly before Carter graduated from Princeton in 1987. He looked so young and happy. There's no hint that 15 months after this picture was taken, he'd kill himself in front of our mom. Looking at these photos, I don't recognize my brother. And I realized I don't think I ever really knew him. I didn't allow myself to, and I didn't allow him to know me. When our dad died, Carter was 12 and I was 10, and it slapped us both into silence. We never spoke about my dad with each other or with anyone. I think my brother would be alive if we had. Why is it so hard to talk about loss and grief? We all go through it, so why do we keep it hidden away, cry in private, speak the names of our loved ones in hushed whispers only we can hear? That's why I wanted to talk with President Biden. He's been more public about grief than any American president in history, and this is his most personal interview yet.",

And I think the thing that I've learned the most about grief is that no matter how much you try to compartmentalize it, no matter how much you try to hide it, it really does change you. It changes everything. It changes the entire trajectory of your life. It changes your personality. So in terms of how grief has changed you, how does the Anderson Cooper I'm speaking to right now, how does the Anderson Cooper I'm interviewing right now, compare to the person you were meant to become had you not experienced so much loss?",

Your dad died in 1988, which was this year, same year that my brother died.And I know you were, I think, five years old when you died. You know, I think the person, for me, my dad died when I was 10 years old. The person I was before that is a completely different person or a very different person than I was after that. And that death is sort of, I mark time as before, you know, when he was alive and when he was after and there was a me before and there's a me after. I think the compartmentalizing of grief that you spoke about, you know, is something I did. I buried my grief very strongly as a child. I just couldn't deal with it was too overwhelming. I pushed it all down. I did the same thing when my brother died 10 years later by suicide. And it's only now I'm 56 that I've suddenly realized I've never really grieved. And I'm now, just now kind of going through a lot of this buried pain that I pushed away for so long. And so certainly I think the compartmentalizing is a problem and it's a solution to an immediate problem of feeling overwhelmed by grief, particularly when you're a child, but it has ripple effects for the rest of your life. And it's something that it doesn't go away. It doesn't stay buried forever. And at some point you have to make a turn and face it.
