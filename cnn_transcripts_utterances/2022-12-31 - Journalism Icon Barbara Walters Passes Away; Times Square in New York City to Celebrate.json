Barbie makes a great point about the simplicity that he tried to convey on a regular basis, I think he very much brought to the table. He was widely seen as a traditionalist, no question, a conservative here in the United States for sure, and a bridge to the next generation after John Paul II's long tenure. In your view, how did he stand out during his time in the papacy?REV. THOMAS REESE, SENIOR ANALYST, RELIGION NEWS SERVICE: Well, I think that Pope Benedict saw himself as a teacher. After all, he was a German professor prior to becoming a bishop. And he was very clear in his writings. He published a book on Christianity that was very popular in Germany. He was a much better writer than, say, Pope John Paul II whose prose was often very dense. But also, like a German professor, if you didn't give the right answers, you flunked. And so he was very firm on upholding what he considered church teaching, and those priests and theologians who didn't follow his directions lost their jobs and that sort of thing. So his legacy will be mixed in that sense.",

But a lot of people came here to pay their respects to him. This isn't particularly surprising. He was 95. He resigned 10 years ago because he didn't feel that he had the stamina to be able to continue to lead the Catholic Church. So while it's sad, it's not really seen as a tragic event.But a lot of people really still consider him to be their Pope. A lot of the more traditional conservative Catholics are mourning this in a different way. He has been declining in health. As we heard this week, Pope Francis calling for prayers for him after seeing him.

He didn't try an upstage or contradict Pope Francis. I think he was very supportive of him. Benedict was a humble man.

Others were air defenses in action.Now, according to the Ukrainian military, the Russians fired from land and from sea, the Black Sea, 20 missiles. They say 12 of them were intercepted here in Kyiv. Whether there were direct hits or debris that fell to the ground, it's not all together clear, but it left one person dead and 16 people injured, among them, a Japanese journalist. Some of those debris or rockets, and as I said, we don't know for sure what hit, hotels, residential areas, and shops as well. The Ukrainians have also turned off 30 percent of the electricity here in Kyiv as a sort of an emergency measure in the event there are more strikes. But it appears these strikes today were really intended just to send a very nasty message to the Ukrainians on this New Year's Eve. And it wasn't just Kyiv that got hit. The city of Mykolaiv in the south got hit. Six people were injured there as well as Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and elsewhere where there were injuries. Now, this is something that President Zelenskyy warned of several days ago, that perhaps the Russians would do exactly that. So this doesn't come as too much of a surprise. And because of the anticipation of such an attack, I'm looking out into the streets. There are very few people out. Most have probably gone home, either for safety reasons or to join their loved ones for what is probably going to be a very muted New Year's Eve celebration. Phil?",

Bryan Kohberger has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths, and felony burglary. The sources say an FBI surveillance team had tracked him for several days before arresting him in his home state of Pennsylvania, 2,500 miles away from where the murders occurred. Kohberger is a graduate student in criminology at Washington State University. CNN's Jean Casarez is in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, where this arrest was made. Jean, we were talking about this yesterday on air. What was the big case, the big break that you saw or that you picked up in this case?",

      "sentences": "Well, what we are hearing is it was the DNA. And a source that is familiar with the investigation did confirm with me last night that, in fact, it was genetic genealogy, that science that was used to lead them to this suspect. And genetic genealogy is relatively new, but it has solved major crimes in this -- in the last few years.Of course, Kohberger is innocent until proven guilty, but how genetic genealogy works is that when they are canvassing a crime scene and they find unknown DNA, and they think it's significant, they will put that unknown DNA through the CODIS database to see if there is a hit, a match. If there isn't, it remains unknown DNA. And that's when they take it to the public DNA databases, the ones that do allow law enforcement to go there. They run it. And if there are any familial hits -- and it can be distant relatives -- that gives them a working knowledge right there to narrow it down to look and try to find that potential suspect. If they find someone they believe is a credible potential suspect, they then have to get the actual DNA from that person to match with the unknown DNA before there can be any type of arrest. And another CNN source is telling our network that it was that genetic genealogy, that DNA, that actually was used to get the arrest warrant along with that white car that we heard about. And that is when Pennsylvania authorities, Pennsylvania state police moved in yesterday morning at 1:30 a.m. to arrest him, and he is now housed right here in Monroe County, northeastern Pennsylvania, waiting for his next hearing, which will be on Tuesday.",

According to Idaho law it's under seal until the extradition. So we're still putting a lot of the pieces together here. But there's a lot of criticism of law enforcement about how they handled this case, the lack of information, some of the conflicting statements here.

Now, at the very beginning, did they provide more information than they should have? For an example, this was a targeted attack. People in the community need not worry about anything. Then they had to walk that back. They actually put too much information out in the early stages as opposed to the other way around.Bad guys watch the news, too. And so you have to really be careful when you are putting information out publicly. And I know people want to know, but in order to solve the case, and that's the focus of law enforcement, is to get the person responsible for it, not just put out information. Then you have to hold certain information close to the vest, because in the era we're in now with social media 24-hour news cycles, sometimes in these investigations you find yourself in competition with that as much as anything else, trying to keep information from being public. And so I think they did a tremendous job. And my hat's off to the Moscow police department, Idaho state police, FBI, everyone who participated.

They have lawyers. They have people that are preparing for the investigations into, say, Hunter Biden, into the -- sorry, excuse me, Mayorkas, the DHS secretary. There are preparations being made. And that is the job of the Republican majority in ways, because they can't legislate in a lot of ways, right, because their priorities are not going to get past the Senate.

An example to me, I know I am going to the Senate side, is when the first infrastructure bill got 19 Republican votes in the Senate and passed very breezily before Democrats had to really fight tooth and nail to get the rest of the budget done.The other thing that I think is going to be important is to see whether Congressman McCarthy, probably soon to be Speaker McCarthy winds up trying to hold up budget deals with government shutdowns or the like as we get a little bit further into the Congress. That's not going to, obviously, come up right away because some bills were passed at the end of this Congress.

That's pretty incredible. Obviously, Michigan is favored. Their offense is, like Coy said, ground and pound. Their quarterback, J.J.
