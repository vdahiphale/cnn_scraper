Congressman-elect, welcome back to the program. I see you're up on Capitol Hill getting started there, but I do want to get your reaction to Russia saying Ukraine has fired these ATACMS missiles, your sense of how this could change the direction of the war.REP.-ELECT EUGENE VINDMAN (D-VA):  Well, look, first of all, Jim, thanks for having me on. It's great to be up here on Capitol Hill. We've got a lot of work to do. Look, the Ukrainians' use of ATACMS has long been necessary for the battlefield. And it's not an escalation, especially if you look at it in the context of the fact that the North Koreans have sent 11,000, 10,000 or so troops. The Russians are the ones that have been escalating this conflict repeatedly. The Ukrainians are responding. And, you know, they're fighting an existential war. So, they need to have their hands untied so they can fight it and defend their territory. And, Congressman-elect, what about our reporting that Russia is updating its nuclear doctrine after saying Ukraine fired U.S. weapons into the country, into Russia, Russia essentially saying that now the U.S. is involved?",

It's the Russians, frankly, that have not had a great deal of pressure on them. So, this war ends only when the Russians feel pressured. Right now, they feel like they have the initiative on the battlefield. They feel like they may have initiative in the geopolitical sense and the way some of the elections have turned out, in the U.S. election, in some ways, especially with some of the appointments or the nominations from this next administration. But it only ends when the Russians feel pressure.And so I think the president has said he's going to end this war in 24 hours. I would love that. I think the Ukrainians would love that as well. But it's got to be on terms that are acceptable to the Europeans, the Ukrainians, the west. And that only happens if the Russians have pressure on them.

And yesterday, Trump did confirm that he will declare a national emergency and use the military to carry out mass deportations. You obviously served in the military. What's your response to that?

He hosted a show on Fox Business.The thing I hear behind the scenes is that Donald Trump, and it kind of reminds me of what he did in the lead up to his vice presidential pick, is he was watching these people that he is choosing for these top roles on television.

But one of the most interesting is what's happening, I think, with treasury right now. We know that Donald Trump had many ideas in mind for who he wanted. Potentially Howard Lutnick, potentially Steve Bassett (ph). Now, those two not looking as likely. He wanted to make a decision earlier on, but now there's kind of been this contentious play behind the scenes for this. He's going to be interviewing more people for this, this week.

So to your first question, I think this is going to feel like an interrogation by Republican lawmakers of the FEMA administrator, because they are arguing that what we're seeing in this story is evidence of a culture problem at FEMA that they have been refusing to help Republicans, Republican victims of storms in these hard-hit areas for years. But as you mentioned, there is some additional context here that I think is really important.So, you may remember that after Hurricane Helene hit in September, what we saw was Donald Trump on the campaign trail spreading a lot of rumors about FEMA that really felt baseless. One of the big ones was that the agency was not helping Republicans in these hard-hit areas. Now, after that, we started to see these really alarming incidents of FEMA workers on the frontlines who are being harassed and threatened by people in these communities and FEMA officials even started to quietly raise red flags saying our crews really just don't feel safe in the field, and it is right after that, just a couple weeks later that we see this supervisor, Marni Washington, who sends this guidance to her team. It's a very small group of aid workers in one part of Florida saying today your guidance is to avoid homes that advertise Trump. That means they put out things like flags and signs. When this story leaked, FEMA immediately fired Washington. They said, this does not hold up with their values, and it will not be tolerated, but I have since talked to Marni Washington. She says she's being scapegoated here, that she was getting orders from above at FEMA. The thing is, she says it wasn't political. It was about safety in those moments, that there was this growing concern about the threats they were receiving because of the rumors. I want to play a quick clip from Marni Washington. Here's a bit of what she told our CNN team last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I asked her last night, would you do the same thing again? She said, hell, yes, because that's what it took to keep our crews safe.But there is this bigger question, Jim, of does this violate federal law, The Hatch Act, the state of Florida, we know, is now suing both Marni Washington and FEMA's administrator. They claim, like a lot of prominent Republicans, this is a conspiracy from the top down. The question is, what evidence do Republicans actually have of a big conspiracy as opposed to a one-off, a miscommunication, we will see as these hearings get underway.",

But what Marni Washington, and I guess what we might hear from Deanne Criswell up on Capitol, we don't know what she's going to testify, is that there was some guidance to be careful of certain areas because of these threats that were happening earlier on in the process after these storms hit.
