The president-elect picks his man at Treasury. He's a hedge fund manager who might not see eye-to-eye with his boss on a key campaign promise. Also, the president-elect passes on a potential pick to lead the FBI, as new reporting reveals Trump's pick to lead the intel community was put on a TSA watch list. And body cam footage shows a mom being put in handcuffs for what the law says is neglect, but what she says is just parenting. Live at the table, Chuck Rocha, Mike Broomhead, Nayyera Haq, and David Urban. Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. As always, let's get right to what America is talking about. What retribution looks like? Tonight, a flurry of Trump's second term picks. We'll talk about who he plans to hire in just a few minutes, but, first, who he plans to fire. The president-elect's plan to get rid of Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted Trump, is coming into fuller view. New reporting in The Washington Post indicates that it's not just Smith that Trump wants to fire, but the dozens of attorneys, FBI agents, support staff across the Justice Department who work on those teams. The Post is also reporting that Trump wants to cobble together a team to investigate something that has already been investigated, and on which there is already a final word, the nonexistent election fraud in 2020. Now, this looks and sounds a lot like the retribution that Trump promised, retribution that Trump's allies told us would never actually happen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARA TRUMP, CO-CHAIR, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Anyone who is afraid right now, you should not be afraid. He is not hell bent on revenge or retribution of any variety. He actually himself said, my revenge will be success. I can assure you that whether you voted for him or not, he will be working for you.",
