The leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, asking President-elect Donald Trump for a pardon today, four years to the day after the violent insurrection on Capitol Hill, that members of the Proud Boys and other Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Tarrio right now is serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy and leading a plot to prevent the transfer of power. His attorney is speaking to one person now and one person only to plea Trump, writing: Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio was portrayed throughout the governments case as a right wing extremist that promoted a neo fascist militant organization. Henry is nothing more than a proud American that believes in true conservative values. Just to be clear, this is what Tarrio said on tape just days before January 6th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ENRIQUE TARRIO, FORMER PROUD BOYS CHAIRMA: There's ways that you could enact change. You could get armed and go to the Capitol. As crazy as that sounds like, yeah, I think that's the way that you make the biggest noise. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's one of over 1,500 people who've been charged with crimes related to January 6th. You'll know that over 600 of those were charged with assaulting police officers and other crimes related to the violence that day. And of course, as you know, the Proud Boys were at the center of a lot of the most extreme violence we saw that day. Just that evening, you know, you had law enforcement trying to regain control of the, of the Capitol so that you can certify the vote. And the Proud Boys were the ones that were leading that resistance. So certainly, if -- if Donald Trump decides to give Enrique Tarrio a pardon, it would certainly send a strong message about what else he plans to do with the rest of these people charged that day.",

And one of the things that did happen in that first year of the investigation in 2021, Erin, we had, you know, information about a possible meeting between Donald Trump and members of the Proud Boys. That was one of the things that the Justice Department, with these prosecutors really bore in on, tried to figure out whether that actually happened.They also spent time looking into that, that that Willard room, that Willard Hotel room, as well as the financial ties with some of the rioters who did come to the Capitol. In the end, as you know, that one year ended up really finding no direct ties to Trump. And so, one of the things you hear from people who were involved in the investigation, we talked to about a dozen people. One of the things that they said was, you know, we could have probably brought this case a lot earlier. I'll read you just a part of one thing they said. One person we talked to, they wasted time. They were not strategic. And they said in the end they ended up helping Trump with the primary and dividing the country. And I guess, you know, certainly in the end of this, Erin, there's a lot of regrets there at the Justice Department.

So, Ryan, just to start with these pardons, you've looked extensively at these January 6th defendants. You've gone through every single one with extensive analysis on \"Just Security\". Enrique Tarrio, specifically, when you look at pardons, do you think Trump will help him? RYAN GOODMAN, CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, JUST SECURITY: So I think he's probably one of the last in line. And he served the 22-year-sentence because it's the longest sentence that's been given because of how responsible he is for the attack on the Capitol. He's not just under the category that Lindsey Graham identified of somebody who's responsible for assaults on law enforcement officers that day, he might have been caught up in the mayhem.

But they're not going to do anything about that. And it'll be news for a couple of days. So I actually expect at least maybe commuting the sentence. I expect Donald Trump is going to go pretty far on this stuff. And, you know, it's not going to be great for justice.

And, Governor, I appreciate your time. Let me just start here with, you know, you've been very blunt about your feelings about Trump. You have said, using your words, that he has a, quote, narcissistic personality disorder and that he, quote, doesn't care about human beings. So, like I said, you don't mince words. You've said what you believe. He won. He's talking about having a mandate and people not fighting him anymore. What's your reaction to that? GOV.

Some of his nominees are not the right choices. Today, I'm here to talk about RFK, Jr. Now, the challenge there is this gentleman has no experience as a public health official whatsoever, no training. He's not a health care provider. And we crossed paths in the past over a tragedy that occurred in Samoa near my state of Hawaii. So any president, President Trump or President Biden, anyone has to look out for the people. If you put directors in, the secretary of health and human services is a critical position, and it results in our people getting harmed, then you haven't done the right thing by the people. And RFK, Jr. has really given me pause about what he might do. He could actually damage the health of our nation terribly if he behaves like he did in Samoa.",

Two nurses made a mistake with the reagents around the vaccine. And when RFK, Jr. got to Samoa, he went and through what's called the Children's Defense Fund, which is a nonprofit that he essentially founded and pushes. He used misinformation to scare all of the people of Samoa away from being vaccinated.He did not share what actually happened. He torpedoed their vaccination program. He met with the prime minister and the minister of health. I met with the same people. He basically scared them away from vaccinations. Vaccinations then dropped for measles, mumps and rubella down to 31 percent for their country. And if you get anywhere lower than, say, 90 to 95 percent, you get huge outbreaks of these diseases. So suddenly, because of the misinformation that he was sharing, no one got vaccinated. Then there was a huge explosion of measles. Over 5000 cases we could account for, and 83 people died, most of them children. When I spoke to the minister of health, she asked if we could bring a medical mission team. We of course agreed and we brought over 70 people, health care providers, myself included. We worked with their health department and we vaccinated the 37,000 people and measles stopped. But we would go from village to village where they would tie a red sash or ribbon on a tree, or a post saying that they wanted to be vaccinated. It's much like you see in the Old Testament, actually, where people want the angel of death to pass over. And what we saw was the angel of death had not passed over. In fact, it had taken the live right in front of our very eyes of an infant girl. And she was still warm. You could see the terrible rash on her. This was the worst cases I've ever seen, and I've been a health care provider for decades now with the National Health Service and so on. We saw that she had just passed away. Her face and body were still warm. She was not breathing. I put my stethoscope to her heart and her lungs. The family immediately went into mourning. We quickly held a ceremony and then we vaccinated their entire family, the siblings, the community, and we moved on. And it happened over and over and over again. And if RFK, Jr. were to be confirmed, and I humbly ask the Republicans in the Senate, the Democrats in the Senate to not confirm him if that happens and he spreads doubt about vaccinations, communities all across the country will see their vaccination rates dip to a dangerous spot, and you'll see outbreaks. Measles will kill kids. A lot of people have immune deficiency. They will not be able to be protected. You will see things like polio surge once again. These are not the things that president-elect Trump should want. These are not the things that anyone in the Senate should want. It's not -- believe me -- partisan, I'm just a physician in this case. We should choose perhaps a conservative Republican, fine, but who has public health experience. That's the kind of person that should run HHS.
