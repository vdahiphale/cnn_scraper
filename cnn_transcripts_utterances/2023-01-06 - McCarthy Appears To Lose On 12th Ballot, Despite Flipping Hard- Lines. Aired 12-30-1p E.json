The McCarthy team views him as perhaps the biggest obstacle right now. He is essentially trying to rile up maybe up to 10 Republican no votes. That's what he believes he can keep on his side. The McCarthy team is trying to isolate him. In fact, when Gaetz was on the floor just now, nominating Jim Jordan to be the speaker of the House and McCarthy staff instructed members of the conference to walk out of the chamber. Kevin McCarthy himself was not in the chamber at the time.But this really speaks to the strategy that they're trying to peel back support, pick off support of those 20 no votes, which they've been successful so far in picking off five of them, they're going block by block from the various conservatives who are concerned or who are trying to oppose speakership so far, they spent the last two days in deep negotiations with several of those members. The ones who supported them today, including Byron Donalds, who was part of those negotiations, he, of course, was nominated for speaker of the House, but now is backing McCarthy ceded to a number of their demands to give them more leverage and more say in the legislative process. That is only one block of lawmakers. Then they're going to have to go to a different block. People have raised different concerns, and that is the hope of members of Congress here.

Yesterday, they gave him the day to figure out if they can get a deal, get some of these members on board.But today they needed to show some progress, and that will almost ensure that he won't lose any other defectors here, a moment of positive news for McCarthy, even if he's not there yet.",

But the problem, too, is several of those supporters of McCarthy have already have to leave town or leaving town. So if McCarthy told me that on the way in, they're going to have some absence of today, so it's still going to extend out for some time and they still have some work to do. Despite the pickups, there's still some concern, still some opponents, and not enough for 218. But he's getting closer, Anderson.",
