Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israel's assault on Rafah is intensifying, but the U.S. president, Joe Biden, is not changing tack. The White House asserts it hasn't yet seen a major ground operation there. But that's done nothing to temper global outrage after an Israeli airstrike killed more than 45 people in a displacement camp in Southern Gaza on Sunday. A CNN analysis has found that U.S.-made munitions were used in that attack. And now, the head of Israel's National Security Council says he expects another seven months of war in Gaza. Meanwhile, as humanitarian concerns abound, satellite images show a much- touted U.S. peer intended to deliver aid has been almost completely broken up in rough seas over the weekend. Now, as pressure mounts on Israel to halt its attacks on Rafah, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham in Israel today told Prime Minister Netanyahu that his country will never have to worry about American support. Here to discuss is Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. He's been a vocal critic of Israel's conduct in Gaza, repeatedly calling for more humanitarian aid to get in Senator Van Hollen, welcome to the program. SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  Christiane, it's good to be with you.",

      "sentences": "So, can we just start with trying to figure out where the U.S. stands? Are you satisfied with the administration description of this notviolating their red lines? I mean, you know, recently to CNN, President Biden said, if there is an attack inside Rafah, then he won't provide any more of these weapons. And now, they're saying, well, no, it doesn't measure up to our -- you know, our red line, so to speak. What do you think?",

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden issued that red line for a couple of reasons. Number one, he knew if we saw a major military operation Gaza,we'd see a dramatic reduction in the delivery of humanitarian assistance. And that's what we've seen. He knew we'd see a big spike in civilian casualties. And that's what we've seen. And he knew it would make it harder to get the hostages back safely. And that is also true. So, all the things that President Biden was worried about have come to pass. So, you know, it's my view, Christiane, that the United States needs to get a full and clear commitment from the Netanyahu government on their plans going forward before we continue to shovel more offensive military assistance to the Netanyahu government. And we need to use other levers of our influence to support a partner but make sure it's a two-way street when we do that.",

I mean, after all, Benny Gantz said he's going to leave the war cabinet shortly if he doesn't see a post-war plan for governing Gaza. So, you would think that the United States could take the position that, you know, we're not going to continue to provide a blank check until we see a post-war plan that meets our concerns and meets the interests that the president has announced. Instead, we see Prime Minister Netanyahu publicly and repeatedly rebuffing the president of the United States, whether it's on having the P.A. having a governance role in Gaza, whether it's for a two-state solution, to provide some light at the end of the tunnel as part of the normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia and others. Time and again, we see Prime Minister Netanyahu rebuffing the position and requests of the United States. And so, yes, we should be doing more to exercise our influence.",

In fact, the national security adviser has come out and said that he expects this war to go on for the next seven months to the end of this year. I mean, that's in direct opposition to what you just said.",

For example, we should not continue justto send offensive weapons, you know, without any understanding of what the future looks like. We should make sure that when we take action at the U.N. Security Council, it aligns with U.S. interests. The U.S. will shortly be facing another resolution, I believe, Algeria plans to bring with respect to the Rafah situation. So, the United States can no longer just be a blank check for the Netanyahu government. The United States has to make sure that our interests and our values are reflected in these decisions. After all United States taxpayers have funded. Billions of dollars in weapons that have gone to the Netanyahu government. So, it is time for the Biden administration to exercise more leverage to achieve the president's own stated goals.",

Hetold Prime Minister Netanyahu, and I'll quote it again, \"that Israel will never have to worry about America's support.\" I mean, yes. But can two things exist at the same time? America continues its historic support for Israel while also using the kind of leverage you've just described to stop the killing, which obviously is in retaliation for the slaughter of October 7th, but also to stop what Senator Schumer has said, a real risk that Israel finds itself less and less secure in the world because it becomes more and more isolated?",

But if you look at the prosecutor's own statements, he drew no equivalence between the awful October 7th attacks on Israel and the wanted murder and sexual violence. And his charges with respect to Prime Minister Netanyahu restricting the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance. So, I think the bigger point right now is whether people agree or disagree with the actions of the prosecutor. We should not -- we the United States should not be suggesting or taking action to sanction the officers of the court, of the ICC. That would undercut, in my view, our overall standing and would send a very, very bad message. In other words, people can disagree with the charges and the approach, but we should not be in the business of going about sanctioning members of the court.",

But be that as it may, what I would like to ask you also, is it right and proper that a group of Republican senators, actually before even this happened, sent this letter to Karim Khan, which was a warning and he read it as a threat, \"Target Israel and we will target you. If you move forward with the measures indicated in the report, we will move to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States. You have been warned.\" Do you -- what's your reaction to that?",

They wanted then to get her to drop investigations that were potentially underway then. And we know that President Trump actually did sanction Fatou Bensouda, which then President Biden rescinded.

The VINE system was formed. Victim Information Notification Every Day. I mean, there were so many wonderful programs that came into place after Nicole's murder.

I feel like some just do it better than others. I feel like the rights has a narrative that they stick to and they don't care about anything else you're talking about. If they can get one thing that, you know helps push whatever narrative it is, and right now, you know, for the last few months, it's been black people are not really in love with President Biden, you know, the numbers for Donald Trump are starting to rise in regard to the black voter, which I think is a little bit overstated, but anything that can help with that narrative, they'll go on with. So, if Charlamagne says, Joe Biden is uninspiring candidate with no main character energy, that's the headline. Forget you all saying Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, or Donald Trump tried to -- you know, he said we should suspend the constitution, or, you know, overthrow the results of an election, forget all of that. We're going to stick to our narrative. That's what, you know, the right does. The left, all they do is pay attention to the narrative that the right puts out there. So, they never ever create their own narrative. So, like, you know, I can go on a show like the view and they'll ask me why I don't want to endorse. And I can say all of these things about Trump and literally say, there's only two choices. So, I'm clearly going to vote for the person who I think can preserve democracy. Instead of them simply saying, who that individual is, it'll just keep pushing me, pushing me, pushing me to say it myself. And I just think that's very strange. But what gives me hope is the people over this past week, I've done all of this diverse press, but I've also been at these book signings, talking to people. And that's who I always get my information from. My information only comes from the people. The people who call into the radio station every morning. The people who I, you know, meet in the street, from South Carolina to New Jersey to L.A., I talk to, people. And when people tell me, they understand exactly what I'm saying. And not only do they understand, they feel what I'm saying, because if you look at the polls, it's a quarter of the country feel the way that I do. They have unfavorable views about both candidates.

Like, what is the broader issue that we can discuss? I feel like that's usually the case with any celebrity story. Like, you can focus on the individual if you want. But there's always an issue that I started to say underlined, but really, it's not underlined. Like right now, when you look at a situation like, well, what's happening with the Diddy and Cassie? Everybody wants to focus on the celebrity of it all and, you know, talk about, you know, who's going to still be playing Diddy's music and what company is not working with Diddy no more. But the issue should be domestic violence. The issue should be, you know, men really doing that real internal work on themselves so they deal with whatever hurt and pain and trauma they got in them and stop projecting that onto our women. The issue should be talking about the patriarchy. Because as long as men are in these positions where they're at the top and women are supposedly underneath them, you're going to always have these situations where men, you know, like I said, project that pain and hurt on something they think they own, but they don't. But those are the conversations we should be having because long after Diddy and Cassidy is no longer in the news cycle, there's going to be women all over this world, you know, being victims of the patriarchy. There's going to be women all over this world being victims of some man who ain't dealt with his hurt, and he's projecting that onto somebody else. So, to me, that should be the conversation.

I think it was in the middle of the street and shoot somebody in the head and nobody would care. And everybody was like, oh, my God. See, the problem is everybody was too busy focused on what he actually said, and they were taking it literal as opposed to the -- to what he was trying to say overall, the metaphor he was using, so to speak, was that ain't nobody tripping off none of that no more, you know. So, if you've ever seen a great movie, which I love, \"Bulworth,\" starring Warren Beatty, that's -- Democrats need a Bulworth. Conservatives have their Bulworth in the name of Donald J. Trump. The difference with the conservatives and liberals is conservatives are more sincere about their lives and Democrats are about their truth. Democrats have truth that they could tell. They have real wins that, you know, they've put on the board over the last four years, but they're just not able to communicate them. And when they do, they do it with their voice shaking.
