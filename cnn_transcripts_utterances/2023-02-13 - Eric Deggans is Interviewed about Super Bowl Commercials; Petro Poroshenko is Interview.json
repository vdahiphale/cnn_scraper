She grows up, the puppy grows up with her. And by the time she has her first child, the dog is right there and she promises to love the dog always. And that sums up how dog owners feel about, you know, their puppy, children, and it's sentimental and it tells a story and you don't have to spend a bunch of money for celebrities or special effects to tell a story that is embedded in the heart of your product and that makes people feel good.",

You may have heard them called \"emphasis patrols in your neighborhood. This is when there have been repeated calls for service, criminal activity, and so police officers will target a certain area to try to tamper down those calls or those potential crimes. In this video you can see the police officers approach the car of Darryl Williams. And they say they saw an open container of alcohol and marijuana plainly out in his car, and that is what caused them to try to arrest him. They say that was their probable cause. At some point during this police interaction, Williams is asking the police officers over and over, what's this about? Why are you doing this? And then he runs from police. That is when he is then tased multiple times by multiple police officers. And I want you the hear one of these incidents, or part of this interaction, where he was tased two times within just less than a minute. Take a listen and watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Among the many issues that they would cover would, most importantly, allow the Israeli parliament with a simple majority to overturn Supreme Court decision. And that's why tens of thousands, potentially even 100,000, according to some estimates, turned out in the streets here in Jerusalem on a Monday, on a work day, in order to protest, because today was the day that the bill first came in front of the justice committee. It did pass that committee, but that's why the people came out to the street here. They were hoping that their voices would be heard within the halls of the parliament. And for many of the protesters here today, they see this - these reforms as ruining the independence of the judiciary, as you noted potentially helping Benjamin Netanyahu in his corruption trial, something, I should say, he denies. And for many people here, they believe this could be the beginning of the end of Israeli democracy. I should note that President Biden even interestingly weighing in yesterday in a statement to \"The New York Times\" calling for consensus to be built, saying that's the best way forward in order to - to avoid divisions.Jim.",
