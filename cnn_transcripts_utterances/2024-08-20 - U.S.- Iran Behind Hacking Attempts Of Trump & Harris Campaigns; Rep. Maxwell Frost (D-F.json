Investigators say the hackers targeted both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns in recent months.

Evan, what are investigators saying about all of this?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is now the official confirmation from the U.S. government. You know, there's whole procedure that the FBI and the intelligence community goes through to determine the attribution of these types of attacks.And in this case, they've now taken a few weeks to look at the evidence and they have concluded that the Iranians were behind both of these targetings of the Trump campaign and the Harris campaign or what at the time was the Biden-Harris campaign. Now we've previously reported that one of the ways they got into this was, first, they targeted a number of people. They managed to get into Roger Stone's email. He's a former associate of the former president, is still kind of an adviser, loosely advising the former president. And they used that to refine their targets and used essentially his contact list to be able to get to the people that they want to inside the campaign, the people associated with the campaign. And that's where you see now there has been some documents that news organizations have reported receiving, which came from inside the campaign. Here's part of what the intelligence community said in this joint statement yesterday. They said, \"The intelligence community is confident that the Iranians have, through social engineering and other efforts, sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential camp -- presidential campaigns of both political parties. \"Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process.\" Now, you know, the playbook that the Iranians are going for is what happened in 2016. The Russians successfully breached the DNC. They used some of that information that they got, the documents and so on, emails, and they used it to disrupt the Hillary Clinton campaign. And to some -- to some extent, they, there we're successful, right? That's the same playbook that the Iranians are going for. A little more complicated with the Iranians because they're also looking to assassinate members of the former Trump administration, too. So they're working all of these different angles to try to -- again, to influence the election and to carry out other intelligence purposes in the United States.",

You know, for so many young people, they didn't really grow up under that Obama era. I mean, I remember it and I'm the oldest member of Gen Z. And I was pretty young at that time, too. And so I think it's going to be amazing for a lot of young Americans across this country to hear him speak. And for a lot of them, it's going to be almost for the first time, right? And hearing that message from him I think it's going to be very helpful in bringing people together here. I mean, he was really one of the last candidates we had that I would describe as a movement candidate, which, not just the campaign. It's a movement that brought people together.

And the vice president and President Biden made history by passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the most amount of money and resources to combating this not just in our country's history, but in the world's history. So I think really putting that fourth for people. But we can't just talk about the record. I like to say that's what people got with their last vote.

But what we're seeing now is these bolts that are fusing these more closely together. Because what we saw demonstrators do yesterday was they kind of got underneath this and wiggled it out of its spot here and then hoisted it over. And that's how they were able to breach the perimeter of the DNC. These are about eight feet. In addition to this size, new panels have gone up. So there are some areas here where the fence is much taller. And then further, Brianna, there's an entirely new line of fencing. Before, there we're there were two layers. Now they've added a third layer a few yards in. And, Brianna, this is a good example of what law enforcement has said they plan to do for months, which is have many layers of redundancies. Yesterday, that redundancy was law enforcement coming upon those protesters quickly as they breached the fence. Now, you're seeing this additional physical redundancy. This is not the start that Chicago police or the Secret Service were looking for, but it's certainly one that they anticipated. And what the Chicago police department had made very clear from the outset was that they we're not going to tolerate any criminal activity. Here's Superintendent Larry Snelling earlier today.
