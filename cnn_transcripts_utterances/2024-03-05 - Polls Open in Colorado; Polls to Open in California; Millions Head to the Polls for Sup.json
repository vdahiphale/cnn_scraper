And it is on Hamas to make decisions about whether it is prepared to engage in that ceasefire. But throughout, including the original ceasefire that we were able to achieve last year that brought hostages home and created a weeks quiet, humanitarian assistance doubling during that time, Qatar played along Egypt the critical role in getting us to that point. And it continues to do so now. And I'm grateful for that on behalf of the United States.It's also urgent irrespective of the ceasefire to dramatically increase the humanitarian assistance that's getting to people inside of Gaza. The situation for children, for women, for men, who are caught in this crossfire Hamas is making inside of Gaza is unacceptable and unsustainable. Israel has to maximize every possible means, every possible method of getting assistance to people who need it. The United States will continue to strongly support those efforts, along with many other countries around the world, but it requires more crossings, it requires more aid getting in. And once that aid is in, it requires making sure it can get to the people who need it. So, we will continue to press that every single day because the situation as it stands is simply unacceptable. We have a lot to talk about. But, again, I just want to emphasize that for the United States, Qatar has been an exceptional partner. We're grateful for that partnership and for the vital work that were doing together every single day. My friend. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is an annual meeting between the Qataris and the U.S. in which they discuss a whole range of issues.But, of course, there is no bigger topic of conversation between these countries than the ongoing war in Gaza. The U.S. and Qatar have been at the very center of the conversations about how to get to a ceasefire. And there in those comments by Blinken you could hear the two main things that they are going to be discussing today when it comes to Gaza, the ceasefire, the efforts to get those discussions across the finish line, and then independent of that, even if a ceasefire doesn't work, the dire need to get more aid into Gaza. The U.S. has been stepping up its arguments and its criticism, frankly, of Israel, that not enough aid is being allowed to get in, not enough aid is getting to where it needs to be. We saw that horrible incident last week, Sara, in which more than one 100 Palestinians were killed as they mobbed that aid convoy. And that is just evidence of the fact that there isn't enough aid in Gaza and it's not getting to where it needs to be. So that's what those two men are really going to be discussing today among several other issues. There is a ticking clock of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, that is set to start next week. U.S. officials and others have said that a ceasefire needs to be in place by then. And the goals of a ceasefire, of course, would be to get those Israeli hostages released who have been held for the past five months, to get Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli prisons, to get a break in the fighting for those two plus million Gazans who so desperately needed it, and for that aid to get into the Gaza Strip. They have been making progress, but clearly the mediators, and foremost among them the Qataris and the Americans, are still struggling to get that deal across the finish line. Sara.",

So, Hamas, which has been going to Cairo, they were there, the U.S., the Qataris, and, of course, the Egyptians. The Israeli said, we're not going because Hamas has not yet given us a list of the hostages who they have, who are alive, and who is dead.Now, the U.S. has said that Israel has essentially agreed to the framework of a deal. So, what we've seen in the past few days are these conversations that Egyptian state TV said today are still facing difficulties. So they are still trying to get that ceasefire done. It is not yet a done deal. Sara.",
