We're following the major breaking news out of Israel this hour. Israel declaring it is at war -- war with Hamas. It follows an unprecedented attack on Israeli soil by Hamas. At least 70 Israelis are now confirmed dead, more than 900 wounded. Numbers that are clearly expected to rise in the coming hours. The attack catching Israel clearly by surprise. At sunrise, the Palestinian militant group launched their offensive by air, sea and land. Hamas fighters infiltrating Israeli towns launching more than 3,000 rockets into Israel. Scenes of urban warfare, as gunfights unfolded featuring Israeli and Palestinian militants. And just a short time ago, I spoke with the Israeli military spokesman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: When we target someone on their side, we go for a military target. These terrorists came in this morning, they didn't go only for military targets. They went into communities. They abducted grandmas. They abducted families. They killed children. A very, very severe morning. And we are going to respond. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is on the Israeli side of things.Palestinians are reporting 198 killed and more than 1,600 wounded. But some of those fatalities are said to actually be within Israel. These would be militants who had entered Israel being killed in firefights. This is a very, very quickly unfolding situation that is continuing and moving very quickly. The Israeli military is calling up tens of thousands of reservists not only, of course, for these air strikes that we're seeing going on targeting Hamas targets in Gaza, but to reinforce Israeli communities around Israel especially in the south as they continue to contend with these militants because as we speak, firefights are ongoing in some of these towns around Gaza Sderot, which is the town most -- many people are familiar with that sits right near the border between Gaza and Israel. Literally as we speak, fire fights continue. We are now entering hour 12. We've heard harrowing (ph) accounts from Israeli civilians essentially trapped in their homes as they hear gunfire going on right outside of their homes, calling for help, asking for help. You see these Israeli families on air trying, pleading, trying to find their family members because there was a festival -- a nature and music festival going on not far from the border that militants attacked. And so there is a fear of a number of wounded and dead as a result of that as well. This is the situation that will likely go on for some time. Israeli military, the Israeli prime minister calling it a state of war. The response will likely continue in intensity over the next few hours, over the next few days. Hamas is calling this the Al-Aqsa Storm, connecting it directly to tensions that have been rising at Al- Aqsa. What's been interesting Wolf, is that there wasn't a specific trigger point. There wasn't a major raid at the Al-Aqsa compound. There wasn't a major clash. There wasn't a major capture of a militant of some sort that would have triggered this, that you might have expected. And it is so clear that Israel was caught by surprise. But the parallels to 50 years ago to the day to the Yom Kippur War 1973, when Israel was also caught by surprise. Attacks also on a Jewish holiday. Today also happens to be a Jewish holiday, Simchat Torah. The parallels here are stunning, Wolf.",

MICHAEL HERZOG, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES (via telephone): So Israel is under attack. This is unprovoked war on a holiday in the Jewish calendar. And Hamas earlier in the day launched thousands of rockets and they sent in dozens of militants, breaching the border fence with paragliders and other means and they are now -- there's fighting going on as we speak in Israeli villages across the border.

A very substantial use of rockets, causing Israelis to be at least temporarily on the back foot. Now inevitably, that means that Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, Wolf, has essentially declared a state of war with Hamas. There's mass mobilization of Israeli troop. But the conundrum for the Israelis now is how do they go in and stop this? How do they go in and rescue these hostages? And how do they go in and break the back of Hamas, which they've tried and failed to do in the past. Essentially, this is a trap that Hamas has laid for Israelis. Hamas will know that they want to send in grounds troops into Gaza, and if the Israelis do do that, no doubt, Hamas has got all kinds of operational activity planned for that. Now, of course, the Israelis have good intelligence, normally speaking, about what is going on in Gaza, and are currently hitting a number of Hamas, at least 17 Hamas or alleged Hamas locations inside the Gaza strip.

A common theme that we have heard across all of the messages coming out from the United States. Now, we also have learned that the secretary of state is at the White House right now attending meetings and calling his foreign counterparts about the situation in Israel.

Now, importantly, the secretary of defense said that the Department of Defense is over the coming days going to work to ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and protect civilians, Wolf, from these indiscriminate -- this indiscriminate violence and terrorism. Now that raises questions about whether the U.S. Is going to allow Israel to tap into the U.S. stockpiles that exist in Israel to potentially replenish their supplies and equipment, if this war does continue and if it escalates even further.

Once you have a hostage situation where militants are barricaded with Israeli citizens, civilians, not just some of the troops that have reportedly been taken, it becomes very difficult for the Israeli defense forces.They've got to move slowly, and precisely. They're already facing a massive blowback of anger from the Israeli people for missing this and for not responding quickly enough to the attacks in the south. That's what I was hearing from some former Israeli and U.S. officials that it is not just bad that they -- bad level of -- you know, almost horrific that they missed signs of this potential complex attack, but that when it started happening, they didn't respond fast enough to catch the militants faster and to keep them from infiltrating some of these communities. I think that's why you've seen the Israeli prime minister call up more reservists, because they're going to have to do something pretty dramatic to respond to this, and to find all of the conspirators and how this was plotted and carried out. And that likely means a ground incursion into Gaza. That means bringing a lot of active-duty forces to that theater to attack there, which means they'll need reservist troops to back-fill them and keep the rest of the country secure.",

That is going to be a really, really tough thing for the Israelis to do.They have done it before. But this is urban warfare. And Gaza is the most crowded place I think now on the face of the earth in terms of dense population per square mile, and given that fact, there are a lot of different things that they will have to consider. They want to go after the military targets, in essence the Hamas targets, but there are going to be situations where there will probably be collateral damage, in other words civilian casualties. And that's going to make it really tough on the Israelis, not only from a military standpoint, but also from a public relations standpoint. The other thing of course, that they're going to do is they're going to use air power to go after these areas. There's already been some of that that we've seen around Gaza, but I think the bombing attacks are going to be more intense and they're also going to try to cut off any more Hamas fighters from coming into Israel itself. So that I think is what things will look like, at least for the next 24 or so hours.",
