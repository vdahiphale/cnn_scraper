And the latest on a manhunt underway right now for this escaped inmate doing life in this country for one murder and wanted overseas for another. John Berman here in for Anderson and tonight, we know whose name will not be called next Wednesday in Atlanta's Fulton County Courthouse. The former president today waived arraignment pleading not guilty to 13 counts including a RICO charge connected to his effort to overturn his defeat in that state.   His attorney has also filed a motion to sever the case from Kenneth Chesebro and others being tried, at least for now, in October under Georgia's speedy trial provision. Also today, Fani Willis got a reprieve from the state's Republican Governor Brian Kemp, who squelched a special legislative session aimed at removing her. Governor Kemp said he has not seen any evidence warranting it, adding he will follow the Constitution \"regardless of who it helps politically.\" As for co-defendant, Mark Meadows, we learned today that a ruling on moving the case to federal court could come at any time now that all briefs from both sides had been filed, and whichever way that goes, the Fulton County judge who has got the case said today that all proceedings in his courtroom, all of them will be live streamed and allowed to be televised. As for this guy, one of the thousands of Americans who turned the former president's words into action on January 6, he received one of the longest prison sentences yet, 17 years for Joe Biggs, a top member of the so-called Proud Boys, another member of the group's Philadelphia chapter, got 15 years. It is a busy night. CNN's Sara Murray starts us off. And Sara, now that Trump has pleaded not guilty and will not appear in court next week, what's next for him in this case in Georgia?",

There is also an open question about where Trump is going to want to go to trial?

The district attorney's office argued, look, we're accusing Mark Meadows of participating in a conspiracy that is not part of his efforts at being White House chief-of-staff, and so even if you may have found one act that he committed that was maybe related to those duties, it's not enough to move this case to federal court.

There is a precedent in the Fulton superior court of having TVs in the courtroom. We've watched murder trials, and they've been published to a YouTube channel. And so, you know, this is nothing new and not really unexpected. I think the reality though, is if Trump stays in this Fulton County superior court, you're just running a campaign ad for most of the time that the trial is in progress. So they'll, you know, that's just the reality of where we are. I don't know that I expect him to stay there, I do expect he'll try to move his case to federal court, depending on what Judge Jones does. He'll look at the order and make a decision about that. But we do have -- we do have the ability to watch trials on television in Fulton County.

I just want to make sure, and you have to tell them that and they have to say on the record that they understand for their speedy trial. I think any of the other defendants wouldn't -- would say I don't give up those rights if forced to go to trial, a speedy trial that they don't want those. Say, I don't give that up, I want time to prepare and I want time to have noticed of certain experts and call witnesses and all of that.

Which argument, and they had to both file briefs on it, basically, the briefs had to make the case if he did one thing that was for a campaign, should it be in state court, or if he did one thing as a federal employee, it should be in federal court.

And I think knowing that he could be overruled, that could delay this case, I think he will ultimately, or potentially remove it. I think he could, that's my gut.But from a legal analysis standpoint, there are three elements that Mark Meadows has to meet, one, that he is a federal officer; one that he was acting, doing his job; and third, that he has a federal defense. In these motions that were filed today, Meadows did make a good argument that the act, right, that the actions he was doing were for his job.

There is a question -- medical experts raised questions about all of this, but it does point to the concussion Senator McConnell endured when he fell, hit his head at a Washington hotel back in March.

And then there are unbelievable scenes like this, a home pretty much torn apart by the wind, no longer a roof covering it. Yet somehow the bed in this upstairs room looks virtually untouched. Meanwhile, North Carolina, seeing severe flooding today in places like Columbus County. South Carolina has already experienced inland coastal flooding and powerful winds, tearing down trees and power poles. And in Georgia, crews work to continue to restore power and clear roads.

They want to show Russians that a price is being paid for the war that's carrying on for the most part in their territory in Ukraine. And so that's having some success, I think. But I think that the primary reason for this change of tactics and this upsurge in the drone strikes is that the Ukrainians want to really disrupt as much as possible. The supply of troops, the supply of logistics, the supply lines to the front lines for the Russians to make it as complex as possible for them to really complicate their defense of those areas that the Ukrainians are pushing against. They're still engaged in that summer offensive. It's not made a lot of progress, although it's making a bit more recently, and this is complicating things even further. For a Russian military, that is also stretched when it comes to its capacity in defending those very long front lines in Ukraine.",

Law enforcement officials, they're not saying at this moment, but they're really trying to emphasize the message that you began with that this suspect, this inmate is extremely dangerous. They're encouraging residents to stay inside, to be on high alert as this multi-agency manhunt continues. But, John, I want to get back to what we do know about when this all started. Law enforcement officials say this started around 8It's about 30 miles west of where we are in Philadelphia right now. Now, he was seen though at 9:40 a.m. in the area around the prison, and he was wearing a white t-shirt, gray shorts, and white sneakers. And John, that's important because law enforcement officials, they believe that he was able to change out of his prison garb after he ultimately escaped. Now, why this strong language? Well, this gentleman, this inmate, was convicted just in the past two weeks of first degree murder. He was sentenced to life without parole just last week. And again, as you said, it was for fatally stabbing his former girlfriend 38 times in front of her children. And John, the motive, according to prosecutors, for that murder that he was convicted of is because the girlfriend discovered he was actually wanted for another murder in Brazil. That's why prosecutors said he ultimately killed his girlfriend because the girlfriend was threatening to expose him. So again, that's why law enforcement is -- are saying that he is extremely dangerous. Take a listen to how the district attorney of Chester County characterized him earlier today.

In terms of the specific whereabouts, law enforcement haven't been specific in terms of their details. They have said that they are searching generally in the 6- mile radius around that county prison. And I will say that law enforcement mentioned he does have family in the area, but they are in contact with him. And just for a little perspective, John, for the murder that this inmate was accused and convicted of, the man here in question actually fled to Virginia. That's where law enforcement agencies, or agents rather, were able to pick him up. Police, of course, hoping that they can find him here after escaping from prison in Chester County in the close area. John?",

They were able to sneak out of their cell, use a lookout, climb over two sets of barbed wire fence, and literally have an Uber, not kidding now, an Uber waiting for them, called in by a fellow gang member. They were also captured. So, what you're seeing here is prisons under pressure because of staffing levels, funding levels, guards having to work overtime, system breakdowns, but each one of these has to be looked at and say -- and examine, you know, how -- you can't have murderers walking out of prison.

He is extremely dangerous. We -- he was convicted of one homicide, probably committed another homicide. And so he has absolutely nothing to lose. And so he is a threat to the public, no question about that. But as John said, the U.S. Marshal Service is very skilled in this. The state police are as well. They will eventually catch this guy. The hope is that he can't hurt anyone else before he is brought into custody. They'll also be looking to see if he had any help. I mean, apparently before he had friends that were there to help him. He wants to leave the country apparently. So you, obviously, have to be aware of that and make the proper notifications. So they'll do everything they possibly can to kind of zero in on this guy and catch him again before he has a chance to hurt anyone else. But one last thing, John, nobody should escape from a detention facility, period. And I know staffing's an issue, all this stuff. But listen, you got to have the right protocols in place. There's no point in arresting people and putting them in jail if you're just going to let them escape. And so something is wrong in Pennsylvania with all these escape prisoners taking place.",
