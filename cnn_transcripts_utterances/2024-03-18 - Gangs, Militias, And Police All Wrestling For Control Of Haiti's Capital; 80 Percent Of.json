Gangs, militias, and the police all wrestling for control of Haiti's capital. David Culver is live from Port-au-Prince. The IDF releasing new and unverified images of their current military operation in Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital. It comes as President Biden speaks to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for the first time in over a month. And Former President Donald Trump is unable to secure a massive bond in his civil fraud case. According to his lawyers, the question is what now? All that and more coming up. But first, to the violence engulfing Haiti's capital. Gangs continue to unleash attacks as militias and what's left of the police try to block their advance. Haitians in some of Port-au-Prince's wealthiest neighborhoods have now been targeted too, with at least 10 people killed in the chaos. The United Nations estimates around 80 percent of the capital is now controlled by gangs. David Culver is there, as I mentioned, and visited a police station that's under constant threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, police stations like this one here in Port-au-Prince are main targets for gangs. They feel like as soon as they can get hold of a station like this, they can then take siege and take control of much of the community. And they've tried coming after this one many of times. Reinforcements have been built up not only because of the police, but because of the community. They've built barricades all around here. For the police station to function properly, they need to rely on the community and to have these almost vigilantes building a lot of the barricades to keep out any gang members. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And to your point, the folks who are feeling the brunt of this are everyday people who live in this city and who have now been forced to move, at times, from home to home to home, campsite to shelter. And we caught up with some who are now in the hospital, because as you pointed out, they end up in the midst of the crossfire. And it's interesting, having gone into one hospital that's run with -- by Doctors Without Borders, and to talk to the patients there, it was tough to find somebody who was not in there because of a gang violent related injury. A vast majority are gunshot victims. And one of the women was an 86-year- old who we met with. She was going to the market. Was out there and shot right in the leg and ended up being local journalist who brought her to that hospital. Now, what's even more tragic is she's not quite sure how she's going to get back home or even if she has a home to go back to or if that's been taken over by gangs. She also says her loved ones really aren't comfortable coming to visit. And that's because that hospital is located in a really precarious area. It's essentially nestled between rival gang territories and, at times, police were able to take hold of it. But the vast majority of the time it becomes just a battleground. And so, for even the medical staff to have to go in there every single day, it's a challenge to the point, Julia, where they even will have some who are able to sleep on site and may not even get back to their own families. But it shows you just the level of dedication needed and it's -- the desperation that's playing out here, Julia.",

And yet, they too were dealing with this attack and onslaught by gangs at 5:00 in the morning. And they were terrified. And you don't have the comfort and ability to pick up the phone and call police because police are so stretched and resources, and even sometimes don't even have the fuel to get to those emergencies. So, you turn to those who live next door to you. And a lot of them have created these almost self-defense brigade like systems where some are armed, others are just manning different barricades at every entry and exit to their community and they rely on each other so as to protect one another. And even to keep those staff 24/7, you have to think about how you get food to those individuals who are on the front line, so to speak. Well, it's the community that will create their own sort of tax collection like system, and they'll go door to door, and they'll try to get anything from a few dollars to some soda, whatever it takes to bring some sustenance to those who are actually trying to block the gangs from spreading their reach and encroaching on everyday life here in Port-au-Prince. It is an incredible struggle. And yet, you also have these refugees, Julia, who have found themselves refugees within their own cities. And they've had to go to these different sites and we even met some who were in the midst of a school that has now turned into a makeshift campsite. And you have about a dozen classrooms in that school, but more than 1,500 people who have just crammed in to make it their temporary home. And what's a struggle for them is not only do they face the gang violence being there, but they also face now confrontations from the locals who live around that area and who say, we don't want more people coming in because it will attract more gangs to come into our area. So, they're feeling it from all sides and it becomes for them an increasingly dire situation, especially, Julia, when you consider getting food and medical supplies to those locations is an incredible challenge right now. You've got the U.N. trying with the air bridge. It's up and going. But as soon as it comes into Port-au-Prince, how do you get it through the gang territories, past the barricades, and to those who really need it most?",

One White House spokesperson saying it was \"neither free nor fair.\" Matthew Chance reports from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As he basks in the glory of a fifth term, President Putin is lashing out at U.S. criticism that his carefully choreographed reelection was neither free nor fair, instead, taking a swing at the U.S. political system, suggesting court cases involving Donald Trump were politically motivated. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Can it be considered democratic to use administrative resources to attack one of the candidates for president of the United States? The use of the judicial system, this has become simply ridiculous and a disgrace in front of the whole world. CHANCE (voice-over): Officially, the Kremlin says it has no preference who's the next U.S. president. And amid a costly war in Ukraine, Donald Trump's claims he would end the fighting quickly if elected may play into the Kremlin's hands, pressuring Ukraine into a peace deal favoring Moscow. The idea the U.S. and the West should back off military support for Ukraine to prevent escalation is also a theme Putin is pushing after his recent election win. PUTIN (through translator): The conflict between Russia and NATO will be just one step away from a full-scale World War III. (MUSIC PLAYING) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I will prevent and very easily World War III, very easily. CHANCE (voice-over): That overlapping rhetoric is now fueling concerns among western officials of repeats of the damaging Trump-Putin relationship of Trump's first term, in which then-President Trump backed Putin over his own intelligence services on the issue of Russian election interference. More recently, instead of criticizing Putin for the recent death in an Arctic penal colony of Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, Trump compared it to his own legal battles. The sudden death of Alexei Navalny has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our country, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. And this was Putin after his election win on Sunday night, mentioning Navalny by name for the first time. PUTIN (through translator): As for Mr. Navalny, yes, he passed away. It is always a sad event. And there were other cases when people in prisons passed away. Didn't this happen in the United States? CHANCE (voice-over): In a country shocked by the death and after an election condemned by independent monitors as unfair, it's one comparison with the United States the Kremlin is happy to make.

Really very close to Centre Island was the landfall. But a wind gust of 170 kilometers per hour, that was the highest gust. And it is still raining. Look at Centre Island, 586 millimeters of rainfall so far in three days. That is 24 basic inches of rainfall in 72 hours, and it's still going to rain. Because it isn't really raining itself or dying, we are still going to see 250 to almost 500 millimeters of rain across the Northern NT. This is going to be a flood maker, I'm afraid. Down to the south, cold front comes through, make some rain for you, Melbourne, but this is really not going to be a major event other than about a 10-degree cool down. We'll take that because it has been so ridiculously hot still for this time of year. But how about 17 for Wednesday? I don't feel a lot cooler than the 37 you had last weekend. Sydney, you're down to 21 for the end of this week. Back up to the north here, we'll see a little bit of cooler air come into parts of Japan again, just a couple of degrees. But what you'll notice on this map, still the snow coming across parts of North Korea, into Vladivostok, and also into the western prefectures here of Japan. It seems like I've been talking about the snow now, the same areas getting snow for months, and it has been months. This is like a lake effect snow event in the U.S., but it is a sea. This is a much bigger area of water than Lake Erie or Lake Ontario or Lake Superior that we have here in the States. It's 12 degrees though. And Osaka's temperature is still going to be well above Tokyo's freezing point. So, yes, the snow will be Nagano where the Olympics were in those higher elevations, above 2,000 to 3,000 meters, that's where the heaviest snow will be over the next couple of days.

So, I think it does draw a line, but I think there's, there is more that the palace needs to do. I think, essentially, we see a difference here between the Princess of Wales and the king. Now, the king is head of state. We do have to have more updates, but their strategy of doing a few pictures of him with some thank you cards that Camilla said a few things about him, that really worked to make it clear that everyone thought that the king was what he said he was doing, recovering from his cancer. But with Kate, because it was silent, everyone just panicked, and the internet went wild. And when William didn't attend the funeral of his godfather, King Constantine of Greece, it just went totally crazy. And what's happened is that Kate herself, I think, was very distressed by all this. She was hoping to have a quiet recovery, and it was all this just very distressing. She felt that -- you know, she felt very bad about this whole photo. I don't believe that she did doctor it. I think she took the fall for someone else, but she felt very bad about that. And then, you know, it all made everything worse. So, really, I think that this does stop some of it, but they do need to do something a bit more formal than a visit to a Windsor farm shop. They do, I think, need to have a bit more of a formal photograph. But, you know, the - - just the -- things have changed. Whatever photograph they put out has got to be very careful, they've got to be very careful that it is totally trustworthy, not a single bit have changed, not a single bit of even a red eye, because there is this now distrust there's been after that Mother's Day photo, which just caused total chaos.

We also succeeded in reaching an agreement that 28 of our members, who are the poorest, the least developed countries, have been negotiating with others for 10 years, and that is to give them additional time when they graduate out of least developed country status, to benefit from all the concessions that the poorest countries benefit from at the WTO. We were happy to see that closed. I think for developing countries, it was a very good out tick (ph).",

Reaching some kindof consensus and agreement surely gets more difficult if we have a President Trump in the White House who, for want of a better word, has been pretty rude about the WTO and is threatening now 60 percent tariffs on China. Does it get more difficult generally, whether it's on the economics or on the agreements that the WTO in that scenario in your mind? OKONJO-IWEALA: Well, Julia, the way I look at it is this. Regardless of who wins the election, I try to focus on the issue of what are the reforms that the WTO needs to do and to accomplish to remain relevant in the 21st century? And I think that's what we should worry about and do the work we need to do anyway.",

Do you think there is a way to accept and adopt a new global consensus, though, on trade that does put more emphasis on the worker, perhaps even puts more emphasis on national security too? Because we are seeing that all over the world, whether it's the United States, whether it's China and beyond, and these are some of the biggest players in the world. Whether that can be established without bringing back the barriers to trade that, you know, the WTO spent three decades trying to reduce and successfully doing so?

Of course, the WTO agreements spell out under what circumstances members can invoke national security concerns. Those are quite clear. But I always insist that countries know their national security concerns best, but invoking those concerns should not mean that they have to be a result of protectionist measures. Again, I do not see the two as, you know, tradeoffs with each other. I think you can protect your national security and do so in a manner that does not result in anti-competitive behavior.",
