But on the economy and on the climate change front in particular, Jim, here is what the president is facing.On the economy, 63 percent of Americans disapproving of his handling of the economy, 37 percent approving. And then you have on climate change, 57 percent of Americans disapproving of his handling of that issue. And what's really notable about that climate change number is that if you dig into the poll there, what it shows is that Americans really haven't heard much about the Inflation Reduction Act, or they don't know much about its climate change provisions. And so, that is ultimately the fundamental challenge that the White House faces, is to try and make Americans aware of this. To then prove to them it is helping the economy, helping these climate change fighting efforts, and that kind of the broader challenge for this White House. So what they believe is as Americans see these pieces of legislation being implemented, start to feel the effects of that cooling inflation that we have been witnessing over the last several months, they believe that those numbers are going to turn around in the coming months and over the next year as we head into the presidential election.",

Brooks, closing the rant by saying character matters.We have CNN political director David Chalian with us now.

Does character matter? You know, and I think that that's a question that still hangs over this race for the voters to answer as we proceed.But clearly, Trump and Pence obviously have had the famous or infamous rift since the 6th of January, Brianna, in 2021. It's only getting more volatile now. I mean, Donald Trump just lashed out at his former vice president this weekend because he now sees him perhaps as a pretty critical witness for the prosecution in the case against him.",

It's just possible for any of these storms, if they're all out by themselves, they could rotate and they could put down a tornado. These are not your summer type thunderstorms. These will produce significant wind because they are moving so fast. And with them moving so fast, it means you're not going to have time to get noticed. Make sure that you already have your notice.

There's a possibility of a Niger confrontation between West Africa countries that insist that President Bazoum is returned to power. And this military junta that maintains they will stay in power. So a really bad situation there. Niger is an important part of the Western strategy for security in a region called a Sahel. It's been a peaceful part of a dangerous neighborhood. There's been coups in this region -- two in Mali, two in Burkina Faso, in Guinea, in Chad, in Sudan -- and that is why, for instance, there's 1,100 U.S. troops in this country involved in counter-terrorism operations. Because its efforts from the jihadist insurgency, huge attacks from armed groups affiliated to Islamic State and to Al Qaeda there.

Thank you -- Jim. SCIUTTO: This just into CNN. News in the Fulton County district attorney's 2020 election interference investigation of the former president, former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan, Republican, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury there this month -- that according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. We should note, Duncan is also a CNN political commentator. This comes as it is considered possible that an indictment could come in this case at any moment. CNN political correspondent Sara Murray joining us now. And Sara, we know that several other witnesses to the president's attempt to overturn the results in Georgia have already been called by the Fulton County district attorney. In addition -- including people who were on that famous -- infamous rather -- phone call where the president asked to fine the votes necessary to overturn. Why would Jeff Duncan be significant now as a witness?",

We talked to him extensively for a documentary we did. And he said that he was really embarrassed for instance to see Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former attorney as well as this other band of Trump acolytes show up in Georgia before the Georgia State Senate and give this presentation to the lawmakers. And at the time the lieutenant governor was also the president of the Georgia State Senate.He also told CNN he didn't sanction those meetings ahead of time. So he may have more to provide the grand jury just about how this wasn't in line with what the rest of the government was thinking. How he had never signed off on these kinds of presentations that were playing out before Georgia state lawmakers. And obviously, he lends a voice in this that is in line with what the Fulton County district attorney would want to be presenting. He's a pretty sympathetic witness as far as the DAs office with the concern. But as you pointed out, he's just one of a number of people we've heard from who have been subpoenaed. Another former Georgia Democratic State Senator, an independent journalist in the state, it's pretty clear that District Attorney Fani Willis's team is lining up their potential grand jury presentation, putting these folks on notice for when they do want to call them and put them before a grand jury. Which is a pretty clear sign that she's going to be seeking indictments in this case -- Jim.",
