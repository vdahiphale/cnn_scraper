Just ahead, Germany is under growing pressure from the U.S. and Western allies to allow the shipment of tanks to Ukraine. I'll speak to the Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister on Kyiv's plead for more weapons.First Jacinda Ardern says she'll step down as New Zealand's Prime Minister before the next election. She says she has no longer enough energy to do the job justice. The thousands of workers across France staged a walkout over the government's plan to rise the retirement age and it could be one of President Emmanuel Macron's biggest challenges. U.S. set to finalize one of the largest military aid packages for Ukraine since Russia's invasion nearly a year ago. Sources tell CNN it's valued around 2.5 billion dollars and will include Stryker combat vehicles for the first time. What is likely not contained, however, are the tanks or long range missiles Kyiv has repeatedly asked for? Meanwhile the U.S. Defense Secretary is in Berlin where he met with his new German counterpart and delivered a message of unity as Germany faces increased pressure to send tanks to Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Germany has remained a true friend of the United States and astonished defender of our allies and values. So we'll continue to support Ukrainian people as they resist Russian aggression and defend their sovereign territory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks for joining us, Alex. So Ukraine wants the tanks America won't send them, but America wants Germany to send them? ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENTInstead, what the U.S. and many European countries are hoping is that Germany will give permission to send the leopard 2 tanks, that many believe are much better suited to that fight. Not only that Germany itself would send its tanks but that the other European countries that have hundreds of these leopard 2 tanks themselves would be given permission by the Germans to send these tanks. Germany having made this tank manufacturing this tank has to give their permission. Now a Senior Defense Official who is traveling with Lloyd Austin to Germany says that they're very optimistic that they can get to that point by the end of the week with the Germans. The U.S. side saying that they're putting a lot of pressure on Germany as you just mentioned, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, he has meetings with several top German officials today. Tomorrow in Ramstein, Germany, the U.S. is hosting a meeting of the Ukraine contact group with more than 50 countries and organizations that get together to talk about military aid for Ukraine. But we are hearing from sources here in the U.S. Max, that the U.S. is getting close to finalizing a $2.5 billion aid package or this will be one of the biggest yet what is notable is not only what is not in the package, including long range ATACMS missiles that the Ukraine has desperately been asking for. But really what is new in this package, and that is the Stryker combat vehicles. This is an armored vehicle that would allow Ukrainian troops to be carried across the battlefield it would really give Ukraine a new mechanized capability, particularly when combined with the Bradley fighting vehicle that the U.S. has just committed to Ukraine in the last aid package, over $3 billion, which is the biggest to date. So the Bradley's and the strikers together really do give the Ukrainians a significant new mechanized offensive capability that will allow them to try to take back territory from the Russians, Max.",

They have a long standing policy of not supplying weapons to conflict or crisis zones or even allowing the re-export of them. So I think this is the stance that Germany has taken since the beginning and they are, you know, having trouble getting over it.They also have the concerns that other countries have, which is that this could be interpreted by Russia as an escalation. And I think it's clear that it will be we're hearing from the Kremlin today, the discussions about supplying Ukraine with weapons that can reach Russian territory, obviously, that doesn't just apply to tanks, but long range artillery, things like that. They call extremely dangerous, the Kremlin spokesman saying it will mean bringing the conflict to a new qualitative level, a level that will not bode well. For European security, they have been very clear they will see Western weapons as a target and I mean, while increasing their own military posture, investing heavily in the military, increasing its size, things like that. So I think that's one of the considerations, not just for Germany, but for all countries who participated in this. Having said that, they Max we are seeing new pledges come through, based on Ukraine's increased request, Estonia and Sweden both announcing their own new military practice of Ukraine today.",

And it stunned members of her own party because she is the Leader of the party and the most popular person that they have to try to win an election. Big question is who would take over the Prime Minister seat after she steps down? She set this deadline of February 7. There's going to be a meeting on Sunday, where labor parliament members are going to try to choose somebody at least two thirds would have to choose that individual or then this process would get more drawn out and there's a lot of speculation who would want this position next.

And she's urging and New Zealanders to reflect on this and to think about this, but one of the facts that her government and her party was bumping up against were some of these kind of post COVID challenges of inflation, a housing shortage, soaring housing prices, all of this contributed to perhaps to the decline in her popularity. Ardern said in her statement today that she looks forward to taking her daughter to school she gave birth to a child in the Prime Minister's seat that was very unusual and attracted international headlines.

But still, we have a positive development and what is at stake is our survival as a nation as a stage for Ukraine. And therefore, we hope that our German friends would understand the necessity of those new deliveries of main battle tanks, and much more. We would also need some warships, we would need to submarines. We would need to ballistic rockets like outer comes from the U.S. and from other European allies, in order to ensure that our army would be capable to start and counter offensive in the coming months, they should be prepared well. But without that military equipment, we would not be capable and able to do that. Therefore, our hopes are there, we praise, the help that we have received. But still, it is unfortunately not enough, as my President just mentioned, and therefore the dimension is huge. We should compare that maybe with the Lend-Lease Act of the United States 1941. And I just like to remind the U.N. remarks and you're the audience at that time, the States have sent to the Soviet Union to defeat Nazi Germany over 14,000 jets over 8000 tanks and much more. So that is the dimension that you would expect totally about 50 billion U.S. dollar in prices of 41, now it maybe 700 billion U.S. dollar. So that's the dimension that we would expect our partners to understand. And without help that we have been receiving, it would not have been possible to free our lands now in the Kherson and Kharkiv region, but this year shall be crucial for us. We would like to end this war in this year and only with the help of our key allies, United States has been playing a key role but also hopefully Germans will join this alliance. We've seen that our friends in the U.K. have decided to send challenger main battle tanks Estonia, small Estonia declared today that they will send weapons for like 1 percent of the GDP. And if you compare it to Germany, if Germany would follow that example, we would have like 40 Billion U.S. dollar of help.",
