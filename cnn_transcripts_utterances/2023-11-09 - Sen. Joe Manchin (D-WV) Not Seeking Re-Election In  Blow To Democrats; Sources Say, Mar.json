Democrats were waiting on pins and needles to see what Joe Manchin was going to do, and that is because West Virginia is going to be one of the toughest seats for Democrats to defend next year in addition to Ohio and Montana.West Virginia is a deep red state. Donald Trump won the state by double digit points. And without an incumbent there, it is going to be a lot easier for Republicans to flip that seat. But even Manchin was likely going to face a tough time winning re- election. Jim Justice, the popular Republican governor, is running on the GOP side. He is also endorsed by Donald Trump. And so Republicans are feeling quite confident. In a statement, the head of the Senate GOP campaign arm said, we like our odds in West Virginia. And meanwhile, in an equally telling statement, the Senate campaign arm put out a statement saying they're going to start focusing on trying to flip seats in Texas and in Florida. But those are going to be equally difficult for Democrats. And remember, Republicans only need to flip two seats in order to win back the majority, Wolf.",

So, it's significant that he is not running. It doesn't mean Dems can't still hold the Senate. I mean, we have races.

There have been at least 41 times that U.S. and coalition forces have either been attacked by a runaway drone or by a rocket attack as well. And it comes as President Biden had just told reporters earlier today, he had ordered the strikes and he decided to make these strikes, conduct the strikes, because they had hit us. Now, the president had also said he believes it's working, because they're reaching the targets they're reaching -- or have reached so afar.
