Just ahead, U.S. President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter, breaking a long-held campaign promise. Why the president says he changed his mind.Plus, Syria and Russia stepping up air strikes against opposition forces inside Syria after a rebel offensive that took Damascus by surprise. And going home to an uncertain future. CNN visits a once bustling city in Southern Lebanon as residents return home after months of war. Joe Biden says he decided to issue a sweeping pardon for his son because he believed Hunter was singled out for prosecution and that raw politics had infected the process. On Sunday, just weeks before he leaves office, Mr. Biden used his presidential power to issue what he called a full and unconditional pardon. They may recall for month's President Biden had been asked and had repeatedly said he would not pardon his son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The unilateral power to issue pardons on federal crimes. Other presidents have done it before, giving pardons to family members, but this one is particularly close to Joe Biden as he leaves office.His son, Hunter convicted both by a jury and then pleading guilty to gun charges and tax charges, so two different felony sets of convictions. He was set to be sentenced on those in December. But Erica, as you mentioned, there is a lot of politics around this. Joe Biden, in his statement announcing this full and unconditional pardon last night, really highlighted that he believed Hunter was being treated differently than others who may be facing the criminal justice system that the case against Hunter was brought to attack him oppose his election, that Republicans really wanted to try and hurt Hunter Biden, a recovering drug addict. And that this was something that came together with Biden spending time with his family with Hunter in Nantucket over the Thanksgiving holiday, making that decision this weekend. Erica, of course, this is something that has also drawn a lot of ire from the right, saying he said he wasn't going to do this, and now he has, but it is within his power as the president.",

He is not going to be a felon on those anymore. He will not be sentenced for those crimes as he was set to be, and any possibility that he would have faced jail time, prison time, extensive prison time, even it's off the table.He's not going to prison. And then, in addition to that, the pardon does say that Hunter Biden is pardoned for anything he may have done that would have been a federal crime from a period of 2014 through 2024, so a whole decade, primarily when he was doing business abroad, those foreign business dealings have been at the root a lot of what Republicans wanted to investigate around the Bidens. And so, this offers a level of protection for Hunter Biden, not just as he was going to be going before a judge on these felony convictions, but also additional protection because of what Joe Biden says was an unfair attack of his family.",

And I will say Erica, Donald Trump moved swiftly to capitalize on this moment in a comment that's really going to raise expectations for what he will do about his vow to pardon January 6th people who were convicted on January 6th for their crimes in the Capitol Hill attack that day.I want to read for you what Donald Trump said in the moments after it was announced that Hunter Biden, or excuse me, Joe Biden, was pardoning his son Hunter. He wrote quote, does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 hostages who have now been imprisoned for years, such an abuse and miscarriage of justice. Now Erica, to be clear, Donald Trump campaigned repeatedly throughout the last several months now on his pledge, really to pardon these January 6th rioters. And one thing that has been clear is that, you know, there were questions about how many people he will do that for a lot of Donald Trump's supporters and allies have been expecting him to grant maximum clemency, even to those who are the most violent offenders, which has raised some eyebrows from others. But I will say, ever since Election Day, we haven't heard Donald Trump mention that pledge once, or even talk about the January 6th rioters or any sort of pardons. And so, there's been questions about when or if he will move forward with that? But this was the first time we really heard him address that since winning on November 5th. Now I will also say that we've seen many Republicans, including those working with Donald Trump, trying to seize on this as an example of what they're arguing is that the Justice Department has been weaponized against many people, specifically Republicans, and arguing that it's actually President, Joe Biden, the current and sitting president, who has been the one weaponizing the Department of Justice. I want to read to you what Stephen Chung, a Donald Trump's Spokesman, said about this as well in the aftermath of that pardon. He said, quote, the failed witch hunts against President Trump have proven that the Democrat controlled DOJ and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system. That system of justice must be fixed and due process must be restored for all Americans. And he went on to say that that is something that Donald Trump will do. Now, I will argue as well what I find also interesting about this is that this could really give the president-elect an opening with some of his picks, particularly what he announced over the weekend in naming Kash Patel to be his next FBI Director. There's been a lot of controversy surrounding Patel, specifically around some of the things that he says he wants to do with the FBI, including getting rid of all of the FBI's leadership, shutting down its Washington Bureau. This, though, could be an opening for them, just for people to argue that perhaps reforming the FBI in the massive way that Donald Trump has planned is justified, and that's what we're starting to see many people close to Donald Trump argue in the hours after this pardon was announced.",

This was a couple months before that last minute, 11th hour flurry of pardons before he left office, but he had pardoned Charles Kushner, one of his in-laws, the father-in-law of Ivanka Trump. And then just this weekend as well we actually saw Donald Trump announce that he is naming Charles Kushner to be his Ambassador to France. So, Donald Trump has also pardoned someone within the family, not one of his own children.

These are the largest territorial gains that we've seen for the rebels in eight years. It had been largely quiet in Syria.There had been a sort of de facto, no war, no peace, and that's because, in a sense, Bashar Al Assad was able to quash the opposition. He did that not through the strength of his own military or military rule, but through various very powerful backers, the Russians, the Iranians, Hezbollah. If you look at where we are now in this moment, Iran very distracted by the losses on the battlefield of its various proxies, also facing strikes from Israel. Hezbollah clearly battered by Israel and Russia, very much distracted and preoccupied with the war in Ukraine. You can get a feel or a sense for why the rebels felt that now was perhaps the moment to try to strike while there is this vacuum of sorts, and while it is so unclear who would be able to step in and fill the void and give Bashar Al Assad the support that he would need to once again quash this rebellion. Though, at this stage, as you said, the momentum does seem to be on the rebel side. They have full control of Idlib Province now. They have full control of the central city of Aleppo, or the central parts of Aleppo making gains in Aleppo countryside, also at the doorstep of the central city of Hama. So, it remains to be seen how exactly Assad's backers are going to save him once again.

And when they really double down with an incredibly cruel but very effective mass bombardment of civilian areas across rebel held territory, it is clear that the Russians can make that decisive difference once again. The question that remains, though is whether they have the appetite to do that in this moment, or whether they are trying to conserve their energy and their resources for the ongoing battle in Ukraine.I will say that after sort of a couple of days of incredibly fast momentum on behalf of the rebels today, it does feel like some of those gains are slowing down a bit. There had been many, many rumors about the possibility of certain factions of the Syrian army potentially defecting. We haven't yet been able to get a clear sense of whether that really is happening and what the impact of it would be if so? At this stage, not clear yet whether Bashar Al Assad can survive this, although I will say, having covered Syria for many, many years Erica, that there have been a number of occasions in the past where people assumed that he could not survive, and he went on to prove them wrong Erica.",

Among those killed, 40 members of a single family killed, in one of those strikes and one of the buildings so a hugely devastating scene, we've been hearing from the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital about the situation on the ground. The hospital continues to be deeply overrun with casualties, as it has been for weeks, if not months, now, unable to deal with the influx of casualties coming in. And also, we've seen further airstrikes in other parts of the Gaza Strip as well. In Nuseirat in Central Gaza, for example, yet another round of airstrikes earlier today as well. So, it is a devastating situation, of course, the humanitarian situation for those that have been displaced, attempting to evacuate and flee from these airstrikes, is also hugely desperate. We've been hearing from the World Health Organization who have said that last year, the vast majority of Palestinians who have been displaced were taking shelter in actual fixed structures, so UN-run schools in buildings that have been really changed into these shelters. Now, around 90 percent of those displaced are sheltering in tents, many of them in the coastal area. And of course, it's simply insufficient against the challenges that come forward with the harsh winter weather. Many of them, of course, have already had to move their tents because of being too close to the coastline. So, a hugely difficult situation for so many in Gaza.",

Of course, that has been a huge issue for some time, and the looting of humanitarian food supplies. And so, we've been hearing from the UN agency saying that it's simply not secure at this stage. But what they are calling for is for the Israeli authorities to open more land crossings. That is the key they have said. We've been hearing from the Head of the Humanitarian Coordination Project for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, saying, this is a desperate situation, and it was a difficult decision to take, but a necessary decision. They have said that Israel, as an occupying power, has the responsibility to ensure the safe transfer of aid the safety and protection of humanitarian aid workers as well. Of course, we have seen other aid organizations trying to get in aid through various means. The Jordanian authorities recently, last week, carried out an airdrop in Northern Gaza, as I mentioned, an area where we have really seen limited aid getting into those who remain there, the hundreds of thousands who remain there. But it is simply not enough. Of course, the key here, as we have heard, repeated by many humanitarian organizations, by the United Nations and UN agencies, is the need for a ceasefire, for a cessation in hostilities, to allow for the situation to be secure enough for humanitarian organizations to adequately fulfill their roles, to be able to carry out their operations as intended.

Now President Biden says he made this decision from the perspective of a father, but he also feels that his son was maligned by Republicans and that these charges were politically motivated.

In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me, and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.

China has invested billions of dollars into infrastructure projects through its Belt and Road Initiative, really leaving the U.S. and others to catch up to their moves. One thing that President Biden will be promoting while he is here, is the U.S. and EU investment in something called the Lobito Corridor, that will be an 800-mile railway project from interior countries in Africa that would take critical minerals to the Western ports for exporting. The U.S. Believes that this helps not just the African people, but also the U.S. as they can try to get critical minerals from this continent at a key time. So, for President Biden, this is coming at the tail end of his presidency. He's trying to show that the U.S. remains committed to Africa. Of course, big questions about whether that actually resonates with people here, or if it's simply a lot of platitudes coming from the American President.",
