There was a lot of spec -- there was a ton of skepticism, not just at the White House, I think throughout all of Washington that they could get anything passed. What is also true is he's going to need Democrats to be able to get anything over the finish line, and there's been no demonstration whatsoever that anything he's put on the table up to this point or as negotiators have could get Democratic support nor has there been an indication he's willing to put anything on the table that would get Democratic support because of what that would mean for his conference. When you talk to White House officials, they believe when they put out their proposal, which had a freeze at current levels, that that was a concession. They didn't think that was going to be the end game, but they at least thought that would signal that they are willing to put things on the table right now. What they got back signaled that they weren't going to get any concessions at all. I think that's been from the White House perspective -- the thing that's been most perplexing to them is you are not putting anything for us to work with here. How are we supposed to move forward?

He spent years agitating against leadership, trying to undermine leadership, including Kevin McCarthy. And we have found that over the last year, even though he has faded from the public spotlight, he's very much working behind the scenes to try to wield influence in Washington, especially now that Republicans have control of the House. The Speaker's race was another example. He was actually advising the Freedom Caucus about what specific demands to make, gaming out how McCarthy would act, advising about how use their leverage. And now, he's doing the same thing in the debt ceiling fight and I mean, it matters for a couple reasons. Number one, obviously, it could impact how these negotiations play out when you have the hard right trying to influence and exert their leverage. But number two, it's interesting because Mark Meadows is arguably one of the most important witnesses when it comes to January 6 and Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And there are signs that the special investigation is concluding and so there's a lot of anticipation and speculation about whether Mark Meadows is cooperating.",

Wade decision was overturned restricting abortion access. Our panel is back with us. And let's start, let's just leave the map up. We're going to get to the politics in a second, but first is the policy. And if you look at the map right there, North Carolina has a new law that's about to take effect. The South Carolina, which is 20 or 22 weeks right now, will go to six weeks. Florida is at 15 weeks right now; it will go to six weeks. If you look at that map across the southeast, states like North Carolina, even South Carolina or Florida, where if you had more restrictions like in Georgia, Alabama Or Mississippi, that's where women sometimes often went.

We had some reporting in the past that he may have some kind of an exclusivity arrangement with the Truth Social platform. But you know, it might be very well likely that we may see him decide to tweet today. Maybe he doesn't want to cede that turf, his turf for so long, Twitter, to DeSantis. This all comes, you know, amid a broader picture of what Musk is trying to do at Twitter, which is to try to get these people back on the platform and really making it a place where content is not only shared but it is created.
