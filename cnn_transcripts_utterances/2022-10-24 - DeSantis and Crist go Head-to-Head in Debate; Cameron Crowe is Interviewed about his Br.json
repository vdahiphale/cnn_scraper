Not only is he down in the polls, not only is tonight the last debate, not only does early voting begin today, but he doesn't have a lot of money left over for these final few week, and he has reserved very little air time for after this debate. So, this might be one of his last chances to speak directly to Florida voters.He has signaled he is going to focus quite a bit on abortion. This is a state where it is now illegal to get abortion after 15 weeks after Governor DeSantis signed that into law this year. DeSantis himself said he would do more to, quote, protect life if he is re-elected. But he hasn't really said what he means by that. He's been kinds of coy. And I think Charlie Crist is going to try to pin him down on that. For Governor DeSantis, you know, he probably could play it safe, but he is trying to build more momentum for a potential presidential campaign, make that case that he can make the jump from Florida to this national level. And, you know, he is also not one to have - to back down from a fight. And him and Charlie Crist have not spared to many nice word for each other in this race. So, Brianna, I think you're going to see them mix it up quite a bit.",

But if you love your dog, it -- you certainly understand the loss that that can be.She felt, though, what - what surprised her about this, the death of this fox terrier, Lolabelle, was that she felt this overwhelming joy upon her death. Not joy that she was gone, but, again, that sort of - that she felt this like release of love. And she felt this sense of happiness. And that -- that didn't go away. She expected to be crying and people saying to her, well, look, you'll never get another dog, but she actually did get another dog and she -- that sense of joy did not go away. And I found that kind of extraordinary. It's not something I'm familiar with, but, wow, how amazing that -- would that be to be able to feel that.",
