      "sentences": "Well, it's a stunning and emotional story that has left an entire family completely overwhelmed. Back in August of 1971 Melissa Highsmith was picked up at her apartment complex where she lived with her mother at the time. She's 22 months old. The mom needed a babysitter because she had to work. The babysitter shows up and then disappears. They never get another call, they never hear another word about her.This goes on for more than five decades, 51 years, until a few weeks ago the parents had submitted a DNA sampling and the family members submitted that as well, and it came back as a match with Melissa Highsmith, who is now 53 years old and has children of her own. The DNA came back matching one of her children, and so they were able to reconnect through that. At first Melissa Highsmith said when the family reached out, she thought it was some sort of hoax, a prank, and then it all started unraveling. She questioned the woman she believed to be her mother and then the story started to unravel there, culminating this weekend, over the last few days, Melissa Highsmith has reunited with her biological parents and as well learned that she has three sisters and a brother. Incredibly emotional. You can hear a little bit from the parents and Melissa here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Victor, there's one thing that pretty much everyone here agrees on, they do not like the current Iranian regime. There are signs saying, \"Ayatollah Out.\" There's the old Iranian flag from back in the days of the Shah. There are posters in support of Mahsa Amini, that young woman whose death a few months ago sparked the current wave of protests in the country.And everybody agrees they're happy to talk to us, but without a camera. They are scared. They have friends and family back home in Iran and they don't want to be seen on film saying bad things about the regime. Now, it was very interesting when Christian Pulisic slammed in that goal to see who rose to cheer here and who didn't. More people got up cheering than I thought. There are pretty much wall-to-wall dual Iranian/American citizens here, and some people say they just can't support this team because the regime uses the team for propaganda. Right over here there was one man who leapt up in support of the U.S., the ladies behind him, you know, slapped him in the back. She was joking. And I said to her, is that your husband? She said, no, if it was, we would be divorced. She says you've got to support this team no matter what. In terms of the food on offer, I will say that they have moved on from the pastries and tea. The cooker action is still going on. We've had lamb, bread, omelet, everything for lunch. I'll tell you, I'm used to a deep fried sausage and half-filled pint. This is much, much better. But, you know, on a more serious note, one chap did tell me, one man did tell me that the U.S., if you beat us, you are supporting us. If you beat us, the Iranian regime can no longer use this team for propaganda. We've got what, ten and a bit minutes left. Iran just needs one goal. They only need to draw, remember. The U.S. needs to win. So, it's getting a little bit tense around here -- guys.",
