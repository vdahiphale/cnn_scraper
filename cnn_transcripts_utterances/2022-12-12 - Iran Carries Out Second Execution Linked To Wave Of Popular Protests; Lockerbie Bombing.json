The alleged bombmaker and the attack on Pam Am Flight 103 is now in U.S. custody after more than three decades. What does it mean for families still waiting for justice? And fear arising COVID cases in China has some residents choosing to quarantine at home instead of reporting their positive results how those choices are affecting cities trying to reopen. Hello and welcome. I'm Eleni Giokos in Dubai, and standing in for Becky Anderson. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. Right, a gruesome early morning a public hanging in Iran is the second known protest related execution in the past week. Right, we have a live report coming up for you in just a moment. Now, the male protester, Majidreza Rahnavard was convicted of waging war against God for allegedly killing two members of the Basij parliamentary force and injuring four others as well during protests on November 17. Now, it comes just four days after the first known protest related execution took place. According to Amnesty International, Iran ranks number two in the world for executions after China. 314 people were executed in Iran in 2021. And the number of executions this year reportedly has far surpassed that. Amnesty International says it has identified at least 17 other people who are at risk of execution in connection to the protests. Let's go now live to Salma Abdelaziz, she's standing by for us in London. Salma, this execution, this latest execution underscores the speed at which Iran is now carrying out death sentences to protesters. Could you take us through the past week, and we've seen two deaths and the message this is sending out to protesters.",

Look, make no mistake about this, Eleni. This is a movement that absolutely challenges the authorities in Iran. It is presents a challenge that really they haven't faced since the inception of the Islamic Republic in 1979. You are talking about months of demonstrations that have spread to every single province in Iran, 160 cities, activists say rocked by constant protests. And the crackdown has been brutal, Eleni. Rights groups say over 480 people have killed, have been killed, have died in these protests. Thousands have been arrested. Now it's important to remember that CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. We have not been given media access on the ground. But this is according to rights groups and activists who are tracking these protests. And most importantly, they ballooned into something so much grander and so much bigger than the initial call, which was of course around the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, a woman who was accused of not wearing her hijab properly, and then died in the custody of the morality police, but it's gone way beyond the hijab laws. Those on the streets today are demanding the overthrow of the government. They are demanding the entire Islamic system of the country be scrapped. These are absolutely lofty and huge and ambitious inspirations that threaten again the Islamic Republic, that threaten the seat of power in Teheran. What you've seen throughout this protest movement is an Iranian government willing to do almost anything activists say to try to crush that dissent, whether that be putting out security forces on the street, arrest, these executions now by sham trial according to activists, but time and time again, all that does is feed the passion and the anger that's fueling these demonstrations.

Salma Abdelaziz, thank you so much for updating us.Now, a man accused of making the bomb that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland nearly 34 years ago is set to appear in the U.S. Federal Court later today. American authorities announced Sunday that the suspect Abu Agila Mohammad Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi was in their custody and he was initially charged back in 2020, and had been held in Libya for years. 270 people died that day in 1988, 259 on the plane and 11 on the ground, and the ton of Lockerbie. It remains the deadliest terror attack in British history. Right. Let's bring in now, international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, who has covered this story. In fact, Nic from the very start, from what I understand you were literally in the newsroom as this happened. It's taken decades to get this man into custody.

The U.S. is saying that they don't believe that this was ever a serious inquiry that the Russians made or anything that the U.S. could actually follow through on. But we're talking about a man named Vadim Krasikov. He's known here in Germany as the Tiergarten killer. He assassinated a man not far from where I am right now in central Berlin in 2019. This was a person, a Georgian national, who had fought against the Russian military in Chechnya, in the 1990s. And the court -- after Mr. Krasikov was apprehended, ruled that this killing was put in place by the Russian government, that it was instigated by the Russian government, ordered by the Russian government and aided by Russian security and intelligence services. Now, of course, all this caused a big rout between Germany and Russia. The Germans expelled two Russian diplomats, the Russians for their parts said that they had nothing to do with it, and called all this politically motivated. But we do know, Eleni, from earlier this year that there was indeed an inquiry on the part of the United States towards the Germans about Vadim Krasikov. The Germans say that they never really took that seriously, or didn't take that as a serious idea from the United States. And it certainly was never discussed on the top levels of the German government. So right now, the U.S. also seems to have come to the conclusion that it's highly unlikely that a three-way swap, if you will, like that would work out. Certainly, it's very difficult to see what would be in it for the Germans in all of these. So right now, the U.S. obviously, says that it's still doing everything it can to try and get Paul Whelan released.
