As we enter a busy late May news fray lotsto get to in the show today including a debt deal delay, we could call it Groundhog Day, too, a last weekend in Washington, with debt ceiling negotiators reporting no major progress. High level talks set to get underway again at the White House in just a few hours' time all the details coming up. Plus, Greek investors speak Greek stocks and bonds saw after a strong showing for the country's market friendly ruling party. The country's main stock index, in fact, at its highest level in decade, amid hopes Athens can regain its investment grade status. We've got analysis just ahead and chips chopped, shares Micron technologies falling more than 4 percent pre market after China's moved to restrict purchases citing security risks. It's actually China's first big move against U.S. chip makers. Other chip firms with Chinese exposure think Qualcomm and Intel are also software pre market today too. And the move actually coming just as U.S. President Joe Biden promise that relations between the two nations the United States and China will soon improve and Beijing then blasted what it perceived as an anti-China G7 summit was an example U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, saying at the G7 that China quote poses the biggest challenge of our age to global security and prosperity. We've got a G7 summit wrap up just ahead for you too. What's required, perhaps to counter that challenge is great cooperation from other large tech nations. And perhaps we saw some of that overnight, IBM and Google today announcing a combined $150 million investment to develop a quantum centric supercomputer. Stay with me working with Universities of Chicago and Tokyo. We speak to the IBM CEO Arvind Krishna later in the show. For now no quantum leaps on U.S. stock markets a flat relatively unchanged U.S. open on tap. Europe as you can see a touch softer. I think the debt ceiling uncertainties not yet really hitting stock investor sentiment in any major way, wait for it. Facebook parents in the meantime, Meta losing ground after receiving a $1.3 billion fine from the EU tied to data privacy, but fresh gains in Asia with the red hot NIKKEI in Japan rising almost 1 percent. Asian chipmakers perhaps as you might expect, who could benefit from China's move to ban Microns technologies were big winners overnight too. Now more on the Micron mess in just a moment. But first just 10 days to go before Janet Yellen's debt ceiling X date and the deal to raise the U.S. borrowing limit still nowhere in sight. Though there are high level talks, as I've mentioned in Washington today. Lauren Fox has the latest from Capitol Hill.",

And it comes after there was a series of fits and starts in those negotiations over the weekend between White House negotiators and Republican negotiators up here on Capitol Hill. There were several moments over the weekend where it seemed like these talks were starting to break down. I am told that they are still tens of billions of dollars apart when it comes to imagining what next year and the years after spending should look like for this country. This is all part of the broader negotiation over increasing the country's borrowing limit. But they are starting to run up against the clock that is because we are just 10 days away from that June 1 deadline. That is when the Treasury Department says they may not be able to pay all of their bills. So the big question, how long is this going to take on Capitol Hill to get a deal and then once they get a deal in hand, it's going to take probably about three days in the House of Representatives to move and advance that legislation in the Senate. It could take up to about a week that doesn't leave lawmakers much time, which is why getting a deal or at least getting on track to get a deal is so essential out of this meeting today between the President and the House Speaker, Julia.",

It's the largest fine ever handed out under the EU's landmark data privacy law. Meta says it will appeal the ruling. Melissa Bell joins us now on this. I think it's the largest ever find that we've seen under the European GDPR, the privacy rules, Meta's a big fish to catch in this EU net.

That allows essentially, American spy agencies pretty unfettered access to a bunch of that data and European laws. You mentioned the GDPR goes back to 2016, 2018 when it was implemented. We're just coming up, Julia, the five year anniversary. And as you say, there have been big fines up levied on American companies in the past. Amazon saw a huge one just a few years ago, nearly $800 million. Some of Meta's platforms have seen fines in the past, the size of this one applied to Meta as a whole I think is really an indication in fact, when you look at the press release from the European regulators. It's a real measure of the frustration that there is here about what they describe as systematic, repeated continuous breaches of essentially the European rights, the right of European citizens, which is a really well protected since the GDPR came into force of knowing what happens to their data and not finding it on American servers, where then falls under a completely different set of laws that are themselves in opposition to what the Europeans do and do not allow.

China's increasing aggression and Russia's war in Ukraine was very much top of the agenda of the group of seven. Let me read to you some of the statement released by China's Foreign Ministry last night following Japan's dressing down. It said Japan as the host of the G7, collaborated with relevant countries to smear and attack China in a series of activities and in the joint communique. It went on to say that such activities have grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, violated the basic principles of international law and the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan. At the G7 summit, the leaders of the world's richest democracies were united in a growing concern over China, stressing the need to cooperate with the world's second largest economy, but also to counter its malign practices and coercion. The U.S. views China as the most serious, long term challenge to the international order. This was backed up by the British Prime Minister at the G7, who said China post \"The greatest challenge of our age in regards to global prosperity and security\". The leaders of the G7 also pledged new measures targeting Russia to choke off its ability to finance and fuel its war on Ukraine. A surprise visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cemented leaders resolve and commitment. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged ongoing support saying we have Ukraine's back. Russia and China both hit back. Russia's Foreign Minister slammed the group of seven for indulging in their own greatness with an agenda that aim to deter Russia and China. Well, China's Foreign Minister accused G7 leaders of hindering international peace, and said the group needed to reflect on its behavior and change course. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong.",

Quantum computing, I think that while normal computing has served us wonderfully, 70 years of incredible innovation driven by computers, there are limits to what it can do. If we want to help solve climate change, we want to help solve food, food shortages, which means fertilizers, and we want to work on electrification. Quantum computing holds an incredible promise of being able to solve these problems from the physical world by really helping simulate the quantum mechanical properties of those processes, so the ability to then make progress. So I step back and say, quantum computing is now jumping from science to engineering. But that means we need to make a lot of progress. And the incredible talent that both these universities bring will help us on our commitment to get 100,000 qubit quantum computers done. And Julia before you even asked me, what does that mean.

But I think cyber security actually is one of the aspects that people talk about with quantum computing and the idea that perhaps, with the sheer speed and scale that these computers can work, any form of encryption can be sort of unlocked. And perhaps that's one of the benefits, but also one of the huge dangers. Can you just talk about that example and how far ahead we're talking because I know this deal is over 10 years? And that's the sort of timeframe but how quickly actually, could we be seeing this kind of simulations or sensing as it's called as well being utilized in the real world?",

So how far away is that? Five years, seven years, definitely within a decade at the most and I would call that as both a dark side. But there's a positive, there's quantum safe encryption, which was not going to get broken by quantum computers. And that is already in a semi standard going forward. There are a number of algorithms blessed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology, NIST in the United States. And I would highly encourage people that for the data that don't want broken five or seven years from now, start using quantum safe encryption. So I agree with the possible threat. But that's the nature of all technology, technology moves forward. But as long as mitigations are in place, then the risk is not really a real risk. Also, Julia, going back to the use cases, while it's a year-long deal, I will tell you that I expect commercial advantages to start occurring in the first half, so meaning in five years.",

In thepast 24 hours, we've seen President Biden suggesting ties with China might improve. At the same time, China's now restricting its companies from buying technologies from Micron, a U.S. company because they're saying they're concerned. This sort of tit for tat in technology continues. Do you see yourself and it sort of ties to the point that you made at the beginning about the blessing from Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden on this in strategic competition, particularly with things like generative AI and quantum technologies with China?",

My preference would always be that we remain in a system of global trade and global cooperation, because increased trade, I think, if I remember the number, right 10 percent of increased trade causes 1 percent increase in GDP growth rates. And the difference between 1 percent and a 3 percent GDP growth rate is incredible. If you do the compounding that is what has led to the advances we've seen in quality of life and in quality of people's incomes over the last century. So that's sort of a macro. Now under that, am I worried? No, I'm not actually worried. I think that the advances that the Western world has made. And when I say Western, I'm sitting in East Asia, but I'm counting that as part of the ecosystem, all the way from the quad countries to Western Europe, to South America. \"So it's a bit more than\". But there's a lot of talent, and there is a lot of ability for us all to compete. And so whether I look at generative AI, or quantum or AI in general, or computing in general, I'm confident of our ability to compete. That said, the larger the underlying GDP of the nations, the better for that to be the aggregate marketplace.",

But sometimes its microns founder the last 24 hours, you're in the firing line, whether you choose to be or not. What about regulating all of this, Arvind? I mean, there was some suggestion from Sam Altman of open AI last week, as far as generative AI is concerned, a specific AI federal agency is required to regulate this specific technology. And I'm not sure IBM agrees. We've long talked about not sort of restricting technologies or strangling technological development with regulation or the innovation that's required. What do you think is required with things like quantum and AI specific or the current agencies have the powers?",
