Then, how trade and economic ties are key to resetting U.S.-China relations. Walter Isaacson speaks to Ambassador Katherine Tai who is breaking ground as the first Asian-American to serve as U.S. trade representative. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we begin with chaos in Pakistan where police say nearly 1,000 people have been arrested this week in the Punjab Province. Across the country, mass protests have descended into violent clashes. The spark the lit this fire, the country's former prime minister and cricket star, Imran Khan, dramatically bundled into a vehicle and driven away by security forces earlier, then arrested and indicted on corruption charges, all of which he denies. And today, the Supreme Court ordered Khan's release, saying the arrest was illegal. The incident brings to a head the yearlong political standoff with the country's powerful military since Khan was ousted as leader last April. And all of this comes amid a major economic crisis, rising terrorism, and less than a year after the devastating floods that engulfed the country. Strategically placed between Afghanistan, China, and India, a key ally of the United States and a nuclear power, how does Pakistan emerge from all of this? I put that question to the former Pakistani ambassador to the U.S., Husain Haqqani. We spoke just before news of Khan's release. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "From my point of view, nobody in Pakistan who has been treated this way among the political class deserved to be arrested. But this isunfortunately the way of Pakistan. Imran Khan cheered on when Benazir Bhutto was arrested, he cheered on when Nawaz Sharif was arrested. And now, it's his turn apparently. The reason why he had to be arrested was because he wasn't playing by the unwritten rule of Pakistani politics. When the military wants you out, you step down and you wait your turn for the next election. He didn't want to do that. He was attacking military officers by name. He was also telling his young supporters, of which there are many, to actually engage in violence, and that violence has manifested immediately after his arrest. So, all of these factors are contributed to the decision. Lastly, there is a long tradition in Pakistan of charging former prime ministers with corruption because they are often the -- because there's often is some corruption. And in this particular case, there are some valid cases. Any other politician would have accepted that, gone to prison for a few days, gone to court and got out. Imran Khan decided that he wanted a revolution. Now, we will find out if he really can be Pakistan's Khamenei.",

Look at every video that he has ever released since he was removed from office, he has used voices from theQuran, he has gone to the extent of implying that it is a battle not between two political groups, but it is a battle between right and wrong, it is a battle between good and evil. And those who do not support him will be punished by God, both in this world and the hereafter. Look, I do not agree. You know that I have a 30-year history of opposing military intervention in Pakistan's politics and demanding civilian supremacy and democracy. But in case of Imran Khan, I must qualify by saying that he has opposed democracy by supporting the military in the past, he rose to power with the support of the military and his real alliance with the military is that the military did not support him when the vote of no confidence was brought against him in parliament. And so, he is rallying his troops in the name of religion and of course, it's not going to be a Khamenei like revolution because there won't be a revolution. We will soon find out whether the Pakistani military can assert itself more likely scenario if the chaos really increases, is Pakistan going Egypt's way, where everything falls apart for a little while and then, the pieces have to be picked up by the one institution that has kept Pakistan together all of these years even though its meddling is what has made things worse in the past.",

      "sentences": "Well, the only way to break out of that would be national reconciliation among the politicians. When Benazir Bhutto came back toPakistan in 2007, she came with the message of national reconciliation. She reconciled with her main rival, Nawaz Sharif. The two of them agreed, we will always come to power only through elections. We will respect each other. We will not try to undermine each other midterm and we will not work with the intelligence services to undermine each other. The one person who remained out of that arrangement was Imran Khan who said, this is an agreement between two groups of crooks. Well, guess what? Now, Imran Khan, unfortunately, is being called a crook and his followers are not accepting that because Benazir Bhutto's followers never thought she was crooked. Nawaz Sharif's followers never believe that the cases against him were legitimate. And now, we are seeing this. But the twist is that Imran Khan's supporters were supporters of General Musharraf before. They have usually been used, the military supporting their man. And this time, they are very annoyed and they have engaged in a kind of violence that we never saw in support of the other major political parties now. Right now, Imran Khan is popular, but the question is, does that popularity reach the point where he and his supporters can overwhelm everybody else and not play by any rules?",

And now, it's all coming back to bite him and he is, as you say, a victim of the perennial political games and tactics that have played out in your country.

      "sentences": "Pakistan's real problem is neither China nor the United States, it's India. The entire Pakistani elite, of which Imran Khan is a part,believes that the real threat to Pakistan comes from India. So, in that context, because the United States has drawn closer to India, most Pakistanis think that they would be better off with China, which has its own problems with India. In the end, Pakistan's biggest export market is the United States. United States is where Pakistan's high-quality, high-end military equipment comes from. And the United States has been Pakistan's traditional partner. The Pakistani military would like good relations with the United States, so would most Pakistani politicians. Imran Khan is slightly a bit of an outlier. Although, recently, he has backed away from his claims about an American conspiracy against him and has started saying that maybe the conspiracy was indigenous and maybe the Americans were just fooled into accepting it, which is a half deposition, and he has also started a major lobbying effort in Washington D.C. through hiring of several lobbyist on behalf of his party. So, he has been changing that position. In the end, Pakistan needs both the United States and China and needs to have their support instead of going into anyone's camp. Imran Khan, because of his personality -- look, he's a celebrity, and most celebrity politicians, whether Donald Trump or somebody else, they have a problem of not being able to make a distinction between what they say publicly to get applause and what should be policy, even on corruption. Patronage is an integral part of democracy, it's not ideal thing, but patronage politics takes place everywhere, and that is what has got Imran Khan into trouble. He engaged in pictured in patronage politics, he created a foundation that benefit his wife and her best friend and he did so by driving resources from the state towards that -- through a real estate magnate. And that is what, in the past, has been the reason for disqualification from politics, of Nawaz Sharif of others. And therefore, Imran Khan's rhetoric and his actions are not going to be able to match. Even on the United States, he may say that he wants Pakistan to be completely independent of the United States, but Pakistan has compulsions which brought Pakistan close to the U.S. and those compulsions remain.",

But what we discovered was so much of what we needed has been concentrated in one economy, and that is the Chinese economy. And the Chinese economy was the first one to lockdown because of COVID. So, they were not going to the factories to manufacture, and very little was coming in -- coming out of -- or being produced there. I was working for the U.S. Congress at the time. Members of Congress and their staffs went from being the representatives in Washington to being their supply chain representatives to try to find whatever supply there might be around the world and to procure it and obtained it for their constituents back at home.

So, every single one of our free trade agreements does create benefits for what we would call free riders, other countries not a part of that agreement.

At the same time, we see this as a framework that is going to endure overtime. This is not a one and done. If you look at a lot of the trade agreements that have been done, certainly ones we've done, and have been done around the world, you invest all of this political capital to get this one agreement done and then you move on, and you don't look back. Trade agreements take too long to negotiate. They are not participatory enough.

And I would argue that our failure to innovate the way that we trade and the way the negotiate is more dangerous to our ability to survive and to thrive than the web of what they call the noodle bowl of trade agreements that have been existing in the Asia-Pacific for a very long time.",

There's been similar legislation in Texas, and even something introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. What do you say to that?",

Russia, according to one recent estimate, has lost up to half its operational tank fleet in this war. Now, western officials say Russia is dusting of much older models to replace them.",
