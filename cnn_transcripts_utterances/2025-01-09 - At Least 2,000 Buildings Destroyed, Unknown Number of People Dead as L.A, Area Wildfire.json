Entire communities already in ruins. According to the latest update, the two most destructive fires, the Eaton and the Palisades fires, are 0% contained. Together, they have torched nearly 28,000 acres. They've destroyed thousands of structures.Look at these homes here. Aerial footage showing just an apocalyptic scene. Entire neighborhoods wiped out. Homes, schools, grocery stores, gas stations, all gone. The L. A Fire chief calling the Palisades -- pardon me, fire, quote, \"One of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles\". At least five People are dead, but the sheriff warns that number could grow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Whipping up to 80 miles an hour. These gusts then fuel embers and absolutely devour an entire neighborhood in Topanga Canyon in just about three hours. We have CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers joining us now. And Chad, the National Weather Service just said that strong gusts of wind will soon be picking up again. What are you seeing in the forecast?",

Yes, better than 80, better than 90 or 100 like we had during the true firestorm. But there will be gusty winds today making it difficult for those air drops to actually hit the location that they're trying to drop.Here's what we're talking about the first this afternoon. This is about two hours from now. LA proper around 34 mile per hour gusts, not sustained, but gusts. And I don't believe that they'll be high enough that they have to ground the helicopters altogether. They'll still be making drops, but when you see the water come out of the bottom of the helicopter, it just turns to mist. It's not this big dump of water like they really like. Now, tomorrow's a much better day, without a doubt. Especially tomorrow night. We'll be down into the single digits when it comes to wind speed. But here's how all of this happens. High pressure up near Utah, low pressure down near Baja. And because they're so close together, the winds funnel. The wind is caused by the difference in pressure between one location and another. And those winds funneled through the valleys, over the mountains and down, fanning the blaze. Now, there was also something else that was going on to get this many fires in this many places. There's been a drought, a significant drought in Southern California. For the water year, they should have about four inches of rainfall at this point in time. They've had none. The last time they had an inch of rain was in March of 2024. When you get that type of drought in this type of wind and you get a spark, you're going to get wildfires. Normally we get them in between the wildland urban interface, which there's a house here and there that they can protect. This wasn't a house by house. This was rows and rows of homes right next to each other, each setting each other on fire. So, yes, the wind dies down tomorrow and humidity comes back a little bit. That's helpful. Doesn't seem helpful, but it is. And because the wind's going to be dying off, we lose the inversion, we're going to lose some of this bad air quality as well. Some of it will mix out and the air will be better to breathe tomorrow as well. Boris.",

One drop of those -- from those is equivalent to a dozen drops from an S-2.So 9,400 gallons of retardant dropped in a path 300ft wide over the course of a mile. The rub there is it takes some time to refill those plants. Aerial firefighting crews from Quebec and British Columbia and Canada have been on the front lines. This is some of the new video and some have asked why, with water shortages in L. A, don't firefighters use water from the Pacific Ocean? And these crews actually are. They've been landing their CL-415 sea planes on the ocean, scooping up water, making a drop, and then doing it all over again.

Each one of these plots is a home and these are some of the larger homes in Altadena. My knowledge of this place comes because I live close to here. Five minute drive. What you have here are some of the bigger homes, four or five bedroom homes. But this is a neighborhood that's generally middle class. A lot of teachers live here because it's slightly more affordable. A lot of people who bought here many years ago, many retired and older folks. But this is what they have to deal with now. If you sweep across, I'm going to have Lionel Mendez (ph) just take a sweep across this area. It is completely gone. There are entire sections of Altadena that look like a bomb was dropped on it. That fire that you're looking at, it's what you saw last hour, Boris. It's still smoldering. That was started by an ember. So that homeowner thought, hey, their house made it out. It simply went up in flames today. What we're seeing is firefighters who are exhausted, who have been working this line for hours upon hours. They are still having to deal with active fire. So here in Altadena, this fire is 10,000 acres -- in between 10,000 to 11,000 acres, it is still burning out of control, 0% containment. The fire really has pushed into those hills over there. But they're also in this community once, and if they can get through to access their homes, they're dealing with. And I'm sorry, Lionel (ph), to make you do this, but you can see the sun over there. You see how hazy it is. The air quality here is horrendous. It is everything that went up that you're seeing that is now just rubble, all of that, you know, a lot of older homes, asbestos, the chemicals, the plaster that is plastic that is burning unabated in this area. So it's also an air quality emergency. So this entire area is being touched in some way, whether it's a homeowner not having any place to live to, you know, people trying to figure out what to do with this air. Boris.",
