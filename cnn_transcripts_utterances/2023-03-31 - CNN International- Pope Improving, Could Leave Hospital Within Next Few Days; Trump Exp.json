Sources tell CNNthat the former U.S. president faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud. He's expected to appear in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday. Evan Gershkovich, an American reporter for the \"Wall Street Journal,\" is detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage. The \"Wall Street Journal\" categorically rejects the allegations. And the Vatican says that Pope Francis' health is improving, and he could be released in the next few days. The 86-year-old pontiff is receiving antibiotics for a bronchitis infection. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to surrender next Tuesday in New York City after he was indicted on what sources say are more than 30 counts related to business fraud. A few dozen supporters gathered outside Trump's Florida home after the news broke late Thursday. Details of the charges remain sealed. For the latest. Here's CNN's Alayna Treene in Washington.

      "sentences": "So, Trump's team is scrambling. They were totally caught off guard on Thursday, even though they had been expecting a potential indictment for some time, they didn't think it was going to come this soon. Now one of Trump's advisers told me shortly after the indictment that they were, quote, blindsided by the timing. They believed, like much of the media have been reporting on Wednesday, that the grand jury would be breaking for the religious holidays and potential indictment wouldn't come until mid April.But in recent days, I would argue that the Trump team had increasingly began to question whether the Manhattan district attorney's case was falling apart. We saw Donald Trump himself right on Truth Social just hours before the indictment, that he is, quote, gained such respect for the New York grand jury and believed that they were perhaps reconsidering an indictment, which obviously was not the case. And just to take a step back, as much as we've seen Donald Trump lean into his own defense and try to project confidence that he'll come out on top at the end of this, including in the statement that he released shortly after learning of the indictment. This is really a jarring moment for him. He now has to go through the process of getting arrested and getting fingerprinted. And while Trump himself and his team believe that indictment will ultimately help him politically, he doesn't want to be indicted. This is a point that his advisers have acknowledged to me over the past several weeks over and over again. It also reminds me of reporting I did on Donald Trump during impeachment. He did not want to have impeached president on his resume, regardless of how much it may have routed his face behind him, and regardless of whether his advisors and others thought that it would benefit him politically in the long run. Now what he's facing, though, is not an impeachment. It's a criminal indictment, and he's virtually no control over how this legal process will play out. Elena Treene, CNN Washington.

But before he's even presented in front of a judge, he has to go to the arrest process. Which means that he has to be fingerprinted and a photograph known as a mug shot has to be taken from him. Also he will be given a New York State identification number, because now he is a person has gone through the arrest process. Once he goes before a judge, a judge would notify him of what his charges are. The official indictment will be unsealed. So, he will know whether he's facing just misdemeanor charges or misdemeanor and felony charges. The charges will be read out loud to him if he chooses to, and from there, he has an opportunity to either plead guilty or not guilty. And then the judge has the ultimate determination of whether to release him on his own recognizance, which is probably highly likely because it's a crime that is non-violent. So after that, we'll get another court date. Actually a few court days to determine whether they'll be hearings and motions. But this is the first step in a long, drawn-out legal process, criminal legal process for the former president.",

Because, of course, Donald Trump's camp and the defense attorneys need to preserve the record and say that the unnecessary publicity may be able to determine in terms of make it highly unlikely that he'll get a fair trial in New York. But the reality is that he is the former president, so it's going to be highly unlikely that anyone will be able to sit on a jury and have not heard about this case. But aside from that, it's going to be a quick proceeding, normal than five or 10 minutes. It is very quite common. Hundreds of arrangements take place in New York on a daily basis.",
