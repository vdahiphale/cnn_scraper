      "sentences": "Well, Erica and Victor, the subpoena is demanding that the former president produce documents by November 4, this is everything related to his effort to overturn the 2020 election results. They're asking also for him to appear for a deposition on November 14, and to provide testimony to the committee. That could go beyond just that single day, according to the committee. And then in addition to that, they sent a letter to the former president explaining what they have found in as part of their investigation, and why they'd taken this extraordinary step.I'll read you just a part of that letter signed by Bennie Thompson and the committee -- who is the chairman of the committee. He says, in part. As demonstrated in our hearings, we have assembled overwhelming evidence, including from dozens of your former appointees and staff that you personally orchestrated and oversaw a multipart effort to overturn the 2020 election and to obstruct the peaceful transition of power. They point out, Victor and Erica, that former presidents have, of course, throughout history have appeared and provided testimony to Congress, despite the fact obviously, that there is -- this is a highly unusual move. They point out and they say, in short, you are at the center of the first and only effort by any U.S. president to overturn an election and to obstruct a peaceful transition of power, ultimately culminating in a -- in a bloody attack on our Capitol and on the Congress itself. They point -- they point to a number of findings that the committee has found as part of its months-long investigation, including from testimony, former administration officials, people inside the White House, and this is what they say. They accused the former president of purposely and maliciously disseminating false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 election attempting to corrupt the Justice Department, including by soliciting and enlisting Department officials to make false statements, and again, also pressuring state officials and legislators. Of course, we have seen video and we've heard audio of the former president telling officials in Georgia that he wanted them to find exactly the number of votes that would have been delivered to him in that state, which of course, Joe Biden won and of course, would have helped them remain in power, Erica and Victor.",

Elie, let me start with you. And there are 10 bullet points that they lay out here, the president's action and as I said, inaction, in the subpoena, summoning tens of thousands of supporters in Washington and knowing they were angry, and some were armed, sending them to the Capitol, they go on. Your view of how they lay out the case as they send the subpoena.ELIE HONIG, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST; Well, Victor, this is an accusatory subpoena, to be clear. It actually reads quite like a prosecutorial closing argument. They use those bullet points, to sum up, the arguments that they've been making -- the committee has been making over the past several months through the hearings. They basically get to the bottom line of this was all about you, people acted on your behalf, you lied to the American public, you lied to the courts, you spurred this on. One interesting detail that I noted in this letter, the committee actually goes a bit farther than they did even in the hearings. They say that while the January 6 attack was happening, when Donald Trump sent his infamous tweet at 2:24 p.m. attacking Vice President Mike Pence verbally, the committee says you incited violence with that tweet. That's more than doing nothing. So this is an accusatory subpoena. They're trying to establish the record. And, Victor, I think it's a preview of what we will see in the ultimate report that will come out of the committee.",

They cite two specific conversations he had. They cite two specific pieces of witness testimony. The committee lists out certain people who they're very interested in getting communications between Donald Trump and those people, which reads essentially, like a roll call of co-conspirators, according to the committee from Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark, on down the line. So yes, I think they're definitely anticipating probably, correctly, some pushback from Donald Trump here.",

And they talk about President Roosevelt and how he had to testify. And they quote Roosevelt in it, saying an ex- president is merely a citizen of the United States, like any other citizen, and it is his plain duty to try to help this committee or respond to its invitation.So -- and then they listed a number of other former presidents who testified either in office or out of office because they know that Donald Trump is going to come back and say they're singling me out, I'm a victim here, you know, and then the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago when they had no reason to search Mar-a-Lago, and on and on and on. So it is anticipatory. But it is also very direct about what they want. One other thing I noticed here is that they specifically talk about communications, as they usually do, sent or received, but they mentioned Signal or other means. And then, following the list of people starting with Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn, Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, etcetera. So it sort of makes me wonder whether they're saying, oh, maybe some of these people were communicating with the president through Signal. We don't know. Maybe they do.",

Now, we have known certainly the president to fight everything on either personal or executive privilege, but he's just hired, as we reported yesterday on this show, Harmeet Dhillon, this conservative trial lawyer, in anticipation of this subpoena, and we know in the document case, as well from DOJ that they've suggested, maybe this supervised search of Mar-a-Lago again, so we'll have to see if they ignore or fight on lines of this privilege log option of this subpoena.",

      "timeStamp": "14:10:06",
      "speaker": "MURRAY",
      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, I think that one of the things that we have learned from the Steve Bannon case today is probably just flat-out ignoring a subpoena is not the way that you want to go, it's probably good that the former president has, you know, their attorneys that he has tapped to look this over. I mean, a privilege log allows you to sort of go through and say here all these documents that we don't think we should be allowed to hand over to you because of executive privilege, because of some other kind of privilege, you know. We don't think you should have access to those.By doing that you're at least showing some kind of engagement with the committee. You're saying, we have looked over your subpoena, we are beginning to look through the documents that might be responsive to this, and we're saying, you know, you do not get to access a number of these. So that's also the kind of thing that, you know, if you do decide to fight a subpoena like this in court, you can show to a judge and say, look, we made an effort, we started to look through these documents, and frankly, we don't think that the committee should have access to them, for X Y &amp; Z reasons. And again, we're talking about a subpoena that is pretty broad. The last item in this schedule that they're looking for is information to identify any telephone or communications device Trump may have used from November of 2020 to January of 2021. So not only do they want all this information from these communication devices, potentially from people he was asking to, you know, make calls or send documents on his behalf, but they also want to know exactly what electronics were you using during this timeframe. PEREZ: Hey, guys, what -- real quick. One thing I wanted to just quickly add to what Sara just said. Donald Trump is known -- you know he's infamous for not using any e-mail, not keeping any records. He tore up, you know, any things he wrote notes on. So one of the things that I think is interesting about this is that I believe, certainly because the committee has talked to dozens of witnesses and they've got -- they've gathered documents from all of these other people, they probably have a lot of the records that they're -- that they're talking about, in this letter to Donald Trump. What they're really after is obviously the testimony and they want to make an effort to try to get his testimony and get his side and to see if there's anything that they have missed as part of their months-long investigation. They probably know a very, very -- they probably have a very, very good picture of all of these communications already based on again, months and thousands and -- hundreds of thousands of pages of documents that they've gotten for -- as part of other subpoenas to other witnesses.",

He can turn over all the requested documents by November 4. He can show up to testify on November 14. But important to know, what the committee is saying here is you are commanded to show up for a deposition, behind closed doors, which will be done by our staff and our members. And they do make a point of noting several of whom are former federal prosecutors, wink-wink. Now that's option one. Unlikely Donald Trump fully complies.Option two is Donald Trump's team can try to negotiate with the committee and say, well, he'll testify about these topics, but not these other topics. He'll give you some documents. In the real world, that happens quite frequently. We'll see if they're able to find some agreement here.

And we were talking before the break about how much information is actually in this letter here. There's a note -- specifically, we were talking about privilege before the break, but it specifically talks about the validity of the asserted privilege thing. We recognize the Supreme Court has ruled former presidents retain the limited ability to assert executive privilege going on to say that's qualified.

And basically, they said, as a former president, you have a very limited if any interest in invoking executive privilege.And so the committee's reminding Donald Trump, if you want to try to invoke executive privilege here, go ahead, you have to let us know soon, and we intend to take it to court.

And we've reported, you know, months ago, that it was also Donald Trump's habit very often, to turn to an aide and say, give me your phone or call so and so, and use that person's phone add to have the phone conversation.Whether those conversations were on Signal not on Signal, you know, whether they were just over the Transom, we don't know. So my guess is -- as Evan was saying is that they do know what a lot of these conversations were. They do know what was being said, but not from the president himself.
