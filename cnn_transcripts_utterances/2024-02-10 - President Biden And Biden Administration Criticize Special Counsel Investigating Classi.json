And they represented that all year long throughout the football season, because they were going to cancel the season, but all our officials and administrative staff were able to salvage the season. We were able to participate in the season, and also end up making it to the state championships. So that in itself was an added bonus to our kids.But again, a lot of them went through a life-changing event, and the sheer determination to continue playing was their choice, their parents' choice, and the community's choice. And their actions on the field and after the fire, in the aftermath of the fire really united the entire community and bringing everybody together and kind of served as a rallying point and sort of a beacon of hope that as long as we are able to work together in a unified manner with positive energy, we're going to get through this tragic event and hopefully come out of it a lot better. So it just speaks for the entire community's resilience, and that's what these kids are here to represent. And again, we're just thankful that the NFL is supporting our efforts in the long journey in this recovery, ongoing recovery.",

Coach Dean Rickard, thank you so much. Mahalo, and the best to you all tomorrow. Very exciting.Hello, and thanks again for joining me this weekend. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. The White House is grappling with the fallout of that damaging special counsel report with its characterizations of President Biden. Democrats are hailing the decision not to bring any charges against the president for willfully retaining classified documents, but they are stunned Special Agent Robert Hur characterized Biden as elderly and that his memory is quote-unquote, poor. Biden and his allies are blasting Hur's assertions. Vice President Kamala Harris calling them gratuitous, inaccurate, and inappropriate. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington for us. So Priscilla, how is the White House positioning itself this weekend to dispel Hur's characterizations?",

But all of this, again, happening as we go into this heated election season where senior campaign officials have said that President Biden is on the trail, that he is partaking in these traditional retail politics stops, and those are the moments where voters can engage with him and decide for themselves whether he should hold office again as all of this brings up a sensitive issue for the campaign and the White House, which is, again, the president's age.",

But some of them were the seaborne, like speedboat packed full of explosive, unmanned surface vehicles that the Houthis have been using for a number of years now but now targeting the U.S. Navy and commercial shipping in the Red Sea with them.And what we know is that following on from those heavy strikes a week ago, there has been a lot of surveillance of what the Houthis are doing. So when they bring out some of their munitions, like these four missiles cruise missiles that were targeted as well and the mobile launcher for cruise missile, when they're brought out of hide hiding, the strikes are placed on them. And this is intended, again, to continue to send a signal to Houthis that they must stop targeting commercial shipping going through the Red Sea. It has a huge detrimental impact on many shipping companies, and many companies in Europe and other parts of the world are struggling because ships have to be re-routed a much longer way. So this is all part of that campaign. But as we've seen and continue to see, the Houthis are not stopping. They're continuing to try to get these shots off.",

That's more than half the population in the Gaza Strip, the military must find a way to evacuate them.His narrative, the prime minister's narrative is that there are four battalions of Hamas there. They have to be routed out, that if you stop now then all the soldier's lives lost in the battle against Hamas so far will be lost in vain. So this is very powerful and emotive language that the prime minister is using. Is he using this language and setting us this scenario at the moment who he can put pressure on Hamas to cave on their demands for prisoner release and other things in the hostage deal that is still in the works, it appears? Is it that, or are troops really going to go in? There isn't an order for it yet, but of course, this is the expectation.",

But you had the president, then you had Secretary of State Blinken in Tel Aviv, saying what's happened to the hostages was dehumanizing, but it's not an excuse to dehumanize the Palestinians inside Gaza. That was taken as a sharp rebuke.You also had National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby say that for Israel to try to take Rafah right now without finding some way to relocate the million plus Palestinians who are sheltering there would be the wrong thing to do. He had some really choice words. And there's been a real reaction inside Israel to that. The mood has changed, so Netanyahu's back is against the wall. At the same time, you don't see him changing the policy publicly. You do see him saying they'll find a way to relocate those Palestinians. But the track record hasn't been good in the past. The Israeli military has come up with plans to move people, has shared those instructions with Palestinians on the ground. And either the Palestinians simply haven't believed the Israelis, or in some cases it's been reported by multiple international news agencies, Palestinians have been blocked from movement by Hamas. So I think you're still going to see a lot of Palestinians stuck in the way when Israel moves in.",

Let's look at the facts from Thursday night, because it was right in this heart of Times Square, where the hustle and bustle and the tourists and people just walking on a Thursday evening around 7:00. It was at JD, it's a footwear store, athletic clothing store. There were three teenagers there, two 15 year-olds, one 16-year-old, and they were shoplifting. They were getting the clothes, they were getting shoes. [14:20:06] And when the 16-year-old approached the exit, the loss prevention officer had seen all of this, asked them for the clothes back, the shoes back. He steps back a little bit, takes out a .45 caliber gun, and shoots. Witnesses say that she ducked, but then it hit a tourist, a lady in her late 30s from Brazil. It hit her in the leg. But she's rushed to Bellevue Hospital. He flees the store. Police officers are running after him. He turns around, fires two shots at the police officers. They didn't fire back because there were so many people there. But I want you to listen to the chief of patrol, John Chell, as he talks about these issues but also how we need to look at them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN CHELL, NYPD'S CHIEF OF PATROL: We saw the moped robberies and snatches. We see pockets being picked in Times Square and on the subway. You see some groups go into stores, Macy's, Kings Plaza, Glass Hut, and stealing property. So yes, we have seen it, it's a trend. But I want to be clear here, again, right. We don't care.

That's all on the ground.In the air there will also be a national security temporary flight restriction instituted about one hour before kickoff. That will be enforced by military fighter jets. One area that law enforcement is particularly focused on pertains to drones. We know that drone technology is obviously very cheap, bad actors could cause a number of different ways of harm using a drone. And so the FBI and other law enforcement agencies brought this counter-drone technology. And I've seen still stuff up close. It's really impressive. They can technically take over a drone, take control of it, move it to an area that's away from the crowd for investigation. Law enforcement says that anyone caught flying a drone around that stadium faces potential criminal prosecution, over $30,000 in fines. It's worth pointing out that right now all this is precautionary. Authorities say that they haven't identified any type of threat that gives them a particular concern, but they say they're ready.

It encouraged people to reach out to one another and to help one another.But as he learned the truth about his situation, as he puts it, that he was not adopted, the inaccuracies of the movie ate at him. And he goes through describing even when he was drafted into the NFL, a lot of teams assumed he was stupid, because the movie actually depicts him that way. And he feels like it hurt his draft stock. Even though he was a first round draft choice, he actually slipped down later into the first round that he was projected to. And he attributes that to the depiction of him in the film. And it's something that's always eaten at him. And then to later learn that he wasn't adopted the way he thought he was, that was something that just really hurt him psychologically. Both the Tuohys and Michael Oher, the requests were out, but they declined to be interviewed for this film. But we did hear from so many people who have been close to Michael Oher through his life, foster brothers, friends, teammates, other families that he lived with before he actually met the Tuohys.
