And that is just the beginning of this storm as it continues to move north.Trees knocked down, a fire station blown apart. I'll speak to a lifelong Floridian who rode out the storm from his house boat. Plus, Senator -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell freezing mid- sentence for a second time in a matter of weeks. What his team is saying tonight about his health. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news. A destructive storm now making its way up the coast. Idalia now hitting the Carolinas. This after nearly half a million customers were left without power between Florida and Georgia. The rain and wind already leaving a trail of destruction across a swath of Florida and, again, now into Georgia and the Carolinas. We are beginning to get new images here into OUTFRONT, including a home in Pasco County on fire, you see it there, amid the floodwaters. Another one on fire in that same county. Officials there say some 600 homes were destroyed. Meantime in Cedar Key, there was so much concern and conversation, you may recall last night about Cedar Key. Water levels reaching a record high for the area. You see these waves coming right on land, water battering this condo complex. Property just demolished here. The doors literally blown off. Street after street in Cedar Key completely flooded. We're going to speak with the man who shot this video, AccuWeather network extreme meteorologist Reed Timmer, he's with us just ahead, one of very few people who've been able to access that area. The floodwaters, again, just up to the windows of these homes there in Cedar Key. You can see everything that's out there, the debris, things that were once, of course, in people's backyards, just floating around. Near Perry, Florida, hurricane winds knocking the roof off of a gas station. You can really get a sense of the sheer force, right? You see it there knocking the roof off. Even as you see that water being blown, the structure, the debris in the path. And in Keaton Beach, take a look at this picture. The walls just completely ripped off this home. It almost looks like a doll house where you would see that wall split off the bed, possessions just tossed around. Let's show you St. Petersburg where officials say more than 75 people had to be rescued. Floodwaters midway up a car door there, tarpon springs, water flooding the streets really as far as the eye can see. And outside of Charleston, South Carolina, now, a brief tornado spawned by the storm actually flipped this car on a highway. Police tell us the two people suffered remarkably just minor injuries. OUTFRONT now is Pasco County's fire chief, Tony Perez. He's in Wesley Chapel, Florida, right now. Chief, good to have you with us. So, we have a picture from Hudson, Florida. I know that's in your county where we see this home in flames, multiple homes, as I understand it, the emergency director telling CNN it actually caught fire because of this hurricane, some 6,000 homes he said inundated with water. What is the situation tonight on the ground there?",

You know, I heard one lady say, well, I don't have any money, I don't have a place to go, so I am just going to ride it out.Other people, I heard another family discussing their belongings. You know, they worked years and years, collections of their memories of their families, and they didn't want to leave that behind. They would rather stay home, ride it out. And, you know, in lieu of the storm passing by and not having any flooding. But, as you can see, that was not the case in this one. And we were able to do a good assessment and a survey after we had rescued all of the residents. And we went back through the neighborhoods. And we were extremely blessed because even though we had major flooding, anywhere from 3 to 5-foot surges where people could not evacuate themselves, they needed us to help them. You know, if we were hit directly with a category 4, it would've been a lot worse. We would have been -- unfortunately, that area would've been decimated, and we would probably be talking about body recovery, and we would still be in there working. So, hopefully the residents see this, they take this warning seriously when we ask them to evacuate and please take higher ground, please take the advice of our emergency management along with our 911 system and fire and police. You know, the sheriff as well was advocating to get that information out. We were out there advocating to please evacuate.

And, in part, that is because you heard Carlos talking about that king tide. Well, you can see that behind me. The ocean looking really nasty, churning as the remnants of Idalia start coming in, that tropical storm. But they say it's this right here. Speaking to the town manager in Carolina beach, these dunes on either side of me, that's what he anticipates is going to protect most of the town from what he calls moderate flooding. The emergency manager of New Hanover County said there are some trouble spots downtown, Wilmington here and Carolina Beach, that they think may experience some flooding.

Hurricane Hermine, which was a category 1 hurricane, caused about 6feet of water to happen there. But the storm surge is like a tsunami- like feature that comes in off the Gulf of Mexico right when those onshore winds start to increase in speed. And it comes in very abruptly, and it's associated with debris and it has waves on top of it as well.

The water was still relatively high at the time.But about 5 to 6 feet of water remained throughout almost into the early afternoon hours. And that's because of the persistent westerly flow in there. But honestly the boardwalk fared pretty well. And that's because it's designed to kind of channel the storm surge in between the different buildings, and a lot of those buildings are up on stilts.

It's complacency that folks have with a lot of that center. And we had a lot of towns on the way down west central Florida that I tried to visit, you know, and document, and they were blocked off. U.S. 19 Highway Patrol, every town was blocked off for miles from the coast because of flooding. And I was talking to locals, and they were seeing floodwaters literally miles inland, and longtime residents telling me they've never seen flooding like this. And then I decided to go back to Crystal River last night, and it was about two miles from the coast. They were blocking traffic. And it was seen -- I just -- I was in shock, as were the residents. They were walking around. I saw two air boats rescuing people and a helicopter flying around.

The shock on people walking around, kids -- I saw a dad carrying a box and the mom carrying a newborn. I was touched to feel those feelings of having to evacuate unexpectedly.

The senator has had a really precipitous decline in his health over the last several months. And it's playing out very publicly. So, my heart goes out to him. What I see basically is the senator becoming perhaps a little bit confused and he stares off to the side, sort of to the upper side and is unable to speak for about ten seconds. That looks like he's having a type of seizure called an absence seizure. The senator had a really traumatic brain injury in March when he fell. And about 10 percent of people who have a big enough injury to be hospitalized after a head injury like that will subsequently have things like a seizure. And that's what it looks like to me.
