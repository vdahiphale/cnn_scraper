This is an accounting professor from NYU.And he has given the Trump side their strongest and clearest defense so far from an expert witness. What he is testifying to today is that he said he examined these financial statements that are at the heart of this case, the accusation that they inflated the value of properties on them, and then used that to get better terms on loans and insurance. Well, he testified unequivocally that there is no evidence whatsoever of accounting fraud. He said: \"My analysis shows the financial statements for all of the years were not materially misstated.\" And the judge intervened here and asked him: \"Are you saying that the attorney general's complaint has no merit?\" He said: \"That is absolutely my opinion.\" He went on to say that there are some errors in the report, in the financial statements, but he said that those are not necessarily fraud. And he said that that is common when there are these unaudited financial statements that are used by sophisticated lenders, so really giving the Trump side their strongest defense. And we heard from the former president when he was leaving at one of the breaks and he praised that expert accountant. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is a highly respected man. I don't know him. But he's an expert witness. And he found no fraud whatsoever. He found no accounting fraud whatsoever. And like everyone else, he said, what are we doing here? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The appeals court in New York is agreeing to a continuous stay. That is, they're not going to allow the dissolution of Trump's businesses until this trial and the appeal is wrapped up. So that went in favor of Trump today. Now, the attorney general's office doubling down on their statements, their commitment that Trump has committed fraud. In a response to Trump's comments, the New York attorney general, Letitia James, tweeted that they have already proven a massive scale of fraud that Trump has committed. And this case, as you say, will continue with Trump being on the stand next week as the final witness in their defense -- Boris, Brianna.",

The state courts have now turned that gag order back on. And, today, Trump was brought to heel. He had a press availability before the court, no attacks on judicial staff. He had one after he appeared in court again, no attacks, and no attacks in court. So it shows that he can be controlled. He is a rational actor. And will that hold? Will he make a strategic choice to politically inflame his base by violating the gag order and having some drama? He may do it. But if he does it, today's compliance shows that will be intentional.
