The IDF has identified the three Israeli civilians it killed in northern Gaza. All three were kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7th terror attacks. The White House says the deaths of three Israeli hostages during a combat mission are, quote, \"heartbreaking.\" The U.S. National Security Council spokesperson explains what officials might be able to glean from the incident about where the hostages are being held in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Hamas is probably holding them in various groups, not all together, certainly putting them in harm's way, willingly putting them in harm's way and potentially in crossfire. Again without speaking specifically this event, Hamas absolutely wants to hide behind innocent humans, including hostages. So it is a reminder. It underscores the very difficult challenge that the Israeli Defense Forces have before them, as they go after these leaders of Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All three had been kidnapped from kibbutzes on October 7th. Now the IDF says that it is taking extra precautionary steps whenever it encounters civilians on the streets of Gaza. A huge tragedy for Israel, especially at a time when these families have watched other hostages get released during that humanitarian pause. They were waiting for the men.

Rather than the bombings that we have seen since the start of the war, in the aftermath of October 7. This will certainly add to pressure on the Israeli government, that the nature of their strikes is different. The caution with which they go into the Gaza Strip changes and ratchets it up a notch. Certainly this is a reminder, of just how delicate of a balance they are trying to strike. Going in with an iron fist and trying to get to Hamas forcefully as they are, with all of the dangers that involves. Not the least to the danger of the lives of the hostages themselves.",

LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR: Forty-six-year-old Eduardo Casado, a mason in Buenos Aires, he, like many other working-class Argentinians, is feeling the impact of the struggling economy. EDUARDO CASADO, ARGENTINE MASON (through translator): If the prices go up -- and I want to believe there will be a plateau and that they will stagnate at some point -- but at the rate that all of this is happening, I do not know if they will stagnate or not. I bought two kilos of potatoes last week at 800 pesos. This week it's almost 1,200. I don't know if next week we'll be able to buy them. ROMO (voice-over): Argentina's economic minister recently announced that the peso will be devalued by more than 50 percent to help the country dig out of its worst economic crisis in decades. The move comes just days into president Javier Milei's term in office. On the campaign trail, he promised to eliminate the peso and replace it with the U.S. dollar. The peso has been artificially supported since 2019 by strict capital controls. Its value has plunged 52 percent this year against the U.S. dollar. The government's new economic policy also includes deep cuts to public spending, in hopes of slowing short term inflation and reducing debt. The president warned that things will get worse before they get better. JAVIER MILEI, ARGENTINE PRESIDENT (through translator): We are going to be worse off than before for a few months, particularly in terms of inflation. I say that because, as the president says, it is better to tell an uncomfortable truth, than a comfortable lie. ROMO (voice-over): That is no consolation for many who are already struggling with the poverty rate at roughly 40 percent and rising. Some fear the measures will be devastating for most of the population. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I see prices rising almost every day. It is worse. How long can we take it? If wages are low and prices are rising, we will not have enough to eat. ROMO (voice-over): While the government tries to reassure the citizens that things will get better, with inflation nearing 150 percent, Argentines are rushing out to find the best prices everything they need just to survive -- Rafael Romo, CNN.
