Should you take the deal? Tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE. Well, they certainly rolled out the red carpet, the celebrities and the cash for President Biden in New York City. We saw three presidents with -- who were united with one mission, raise as much money as possible to help defeat Donald Trump. The venue, Radio City Music Hall. The crowd, oh, it was sold out. The stars, well, let's just say, there were a lot of them from Stephen Colbert to Mindy Kaling to Ben Platt to Lizzo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's in one night. The campaign tells us that's the biggest single fundraiser for them so far this year. And well, more than Trump raised in the entire month of February. Trump, he's apparently unbothered, saying, you ain't seen nothing yet. Of course, his campaign is hoping to beat that number at a Florida event just coming up next week. We'll see. But to me, it's not really about how much they raise, it's why so much money is needed. The reality is that this is a razor-tight race. Our CNN poll of polls has it, 47 percent Trump, 44 percent Biden. And if it wasn't so close, would tonight's fundraiser have even happened? And the fact that it's such a tight race is precisely maybe why President Obama is helping out. It's why Obama is \"worried,\" according to an aide. And it's why you're going to see a lot more of him as this campaign unfolds. Trump's allies are suggesting that this fundraiser and the celebrities that came out to support shows one thing, that Biden is an elitist who's out of touch with the everyday person. Now, who do you think they think is the man of the people? Donald Trump. Because while Biden was, they think, hobnobbing with Tinseltown, Trump was attending a wake for a fallen NYPD officer.

But I mean, it's a good night for Biden. Although, I would say I think that money is far less important in presidential campaigns in terms of what the money actually does. It's more important in terms of what it represents in terms of enthusiasm for Biden. Listen, I'm the guy that spent three quarters of the budget in a presidential campaign and thought we wasted most of it. So, the dollars are not that significant. Both of these candidates are going to have plenty of money to run. The more important point is that people are enthusiastic and they're giving money to Biden campaign. They're not enthusiastic -- they're not giving money to Trump. And by the way, Biden has both presidents -- previous presidents with him.

I mean, I want to just, you know, tip my hat to Joe Lieberman, who was the chairman of No Labels who passed this week, was just a giant of a human being and a great, hard, huge soul. And he helped chair the organization, and he just had a vision that many others did that helped start it and are part of it, which is that there's too much partisanship in the country. We want trying to heal the partisan breach and bring people together.And hey, by the way, in greatest democracy in world, shouldn't we have more than two choices, especially in a situation where up to two- thirds or beyond are unhappy with having a couple of 80-year-olds as their nominees. If the system produces two 80-year-olds, maybe the systems needs some reform. The problem is you can't just wake up in May of this year and decide you're going to do that. You have to pave the runway because the way the system is rigged for the parties, you have to spend, what No Labels have spent upwards of $50 million, just getting the ballot access in case somebody could step up and be an appropriate candidate. Now, the thing that Joe Lieberman said from the very beginning, unequivocally, is that whatever they would do, they wanted to make certain -- the whole point of the exercise was to ensure that Donald Trump was not reelected. And a long time -- a year ago, others like me said, well, what happens when we get to now and Joe Biden's down and maybe down by a lot to Trump? What's the plan B? So, that the idea was just to have an option. Now, as you pointed out, there haven't been any obvious people stepping up, and that says a lot about the system. And I think that people are afraid of a reality, which that Chris Christie did. I mean, he tested it himself, and he determined that he could draw more votes away from Biden than he could from Trump. So, good for Chris Christie. And -- but that's what the organization itself said, we're not going to do anything that would help Trump in any way. So, it may, in the end, turn out that there's no candidates. And by the way, I think that part of the reason for that is that was a lot of disinformation about No Label's objective, that they were people selling the notion that they weren't intentionally trying to help Trump, which clearly they never were. Joe Lieberman is a biblical man of his word, and when he said, unequivocally again, that we're not going to do anything to helped Trump, I believed him and I'm certain that's going be the case going forward. Although, I will say, there are some other options, Laura, that I talked to Lieberman about, which is that even if they don't have the unity ticket that they talked about running, there's some possibility. I mean, they can put No Labels candidates on in certain states that would draw votes. They could put popular Republicans on, say Paul Ryan in Wisconsin or something like that, or the former governor of North Carolina that was a No Labels co-chair and draw votes away from Trump. And in the end do what Joe Lieberman said --",

That's what we need to talk about. That's what we need to focus on. No, I don't give Donald Trump any credit for attending the wake because he did it all for himself.

He could sell the stock, he could borrow against it, or he could do something a little dodgier that I'm going to call self-dealing.So, let's look at what those are. Selling, that sounds probably pretty straightforward. The idea that he's got these stocks, he can just sell them on the open market, except it isn't. Generally, there's some sort of lockup period. If you're an insider in a company that's recently IPO'd, you have to wait a little while, unless he gets permission from the board. Well, who's on the board? Lots of friendly faces. You've got Bob Lighthizer, who ran trade for Trump in the Trump administration, Kash Patel, who did a whole bunch of national security-related jobs, Linda McMahon, small business administration, Devin Nunes, former congressman, who was a very big Trumper. And then, of course, there's this guy, Don Jr., who we all recognize. He's probably not going to go against his pops. But it's not only the board that matters here, it's also his investors, because if Trump dumps that stock, it could potentially cause the price of that stock to plummet. We have seen this before, for example, with other meme stocks. Big investor in Bed Bath&amp; Beyond dumped his shares, caused the price to plummet, fall in about half in a couple of days. Regulators looked into it, and in that case, the investors were also pretty ticked off, and they weren't even asked to vote for that guy. In this case, we're talking about Trump's investors who are also his followers who may not be too keen on losing their life savings. So, he could borrow against the value of the stock. However, that requires getting banks to play ball, right? Banks and Trump, not on the best of terms these days, beyond that, the collateral here is not super attractive. We're talking about the stocks themselves, the shares that Trump owns being held as collateral in these loans, well, they look super overvalued right now. If you look at the price of the stock relative to the expected income stream, to how many subscribers Truth Social has, it doesn't look like the safest bet, may not be able to get money out that way. Then there's potentially self-dealing, related party transactions. It's just a fancy term for Trump owns a bunch of different companies, and he can use them to sell things from one to the other. He could sell Mar-a-Lago. He could sell Trump Tower at whatever evaluation he wanted to this new publicly traded company and get the cash out that way. Again, regulators may not look super favorably on that either. Same deal with licensing fees. So, we've heard of Trump Stakes. We've heard of Trump Vodka, Trump Sneakers. Trump can say, hey, my name is on that company, I think I should get some licensing fees. That might be a way to get some cash out, too.",
