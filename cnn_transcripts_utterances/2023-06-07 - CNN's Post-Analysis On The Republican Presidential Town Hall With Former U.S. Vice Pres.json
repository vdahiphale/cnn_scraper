So it's interesting the line that the Vice President Pence tried to walk when it comes to this news. No one is above the law, and yet I hope they don't indict Donald Trump because that would be divisive. ABBY PHILIP, CNN SR. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, I mean, I think that Mike Pence probably is going as far as he wants to go in terms of criticizing Trump when he has, I think pretty forcefully today and in the last couple of days, really condemned Trump, not just for his actions on January 6th, but also for what it says about his fidelity to the Constitution. But that's about as far as he's willing to go. And that's probably his view of where the Republican Party is. He does not think that Republican voters really care the merits of some of these cases, whether it's the New York indictment over the hush money payments or perhaps this document case. However, the devil will be in the details. I think he can say this now because we do not know what the facts of the case are yet, but it will be interesting to see whether his tune changes if the facts of this case become more serious and more detailed, especially as it relates to national security and those classified documents.",

But I think what we saw from former Vice President Pence tonight was once again this balancing act that we've seen for a long time.Even though he was blunt about January 6 and the Constitution, he knows that Donald Trump owns the base right now. He is by far the front runner. And some GOP voters who are with Trump see Pence as a traitor, and GOP voters who aren't with Trump aren't very attracted to Mike Pence.

The target letter means that this is an individual, that the investigation is targeting, is directed at him as an individual, not just the people around him, that his conduct is potentially the charged conduct. And I think it does correlate to the meeting that took place recently where his lawyers went in. Sometimes the target letter can come out before the lawyers go in and sort of make their last case in front of the Justice Department prosecutors trying to dissuade them from even issuing the target letter. In this case, they had the meeting and then the target letter appears to be coming out after. But it does indicate that they are seriously considering charges.",

He said, I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, taking him on for refusing to call Putin a war criminal. He talked about meeting with Vladimir Putin. I was there when he did, indirectly confronting him about election interference.But the problem was Trump loomed large over the entire night. It was hard to look at what a future-looking, you know, Mike Pence presidency would look like because it kept coming back to, rightly so, January 6th, pardoning the former president. This is what he's going to have to deal with on the campaign trail. I'm not sure I have strong advice on how you avoid it because the two are so inextricably tied. And I think for voters, the key thing he needs to do is draw a clear line and stick to it. He's never going to win over the super MAGA base. might as well appeal to the many of us who think that defending somebody who may soon be indicted, defending somebody who was behind January 6th is an unacceptable position. He's got to draw that clean line or he's going to always be playing clean up.",

They'll, as Scott said earlier, that Biden, they'll say Biden is getting different treatment and so on, which is absurd in many ways. But he did not want to wade in those waters.

And so I'm going to call it a lie again now that Mike Pence is saying it. It is just not true. Here is the reality. There was no blanket policy of family separation under President Barack Obama.Rather, under Obama, children were separated from their parents at the border in rare and exceptional cases, like where the parent was being prosecuted for carrying drugs across the border, where human trafficking was suspected, where the authorities couldn't confirm the connection between the child and the adult they were with. So, rare and exceptional. What Trump and Pence did was way different. They created a whole new policy that made separation routine rather than rare. In spring 2018, their AG, Jeff Sessions, announced it as a whole new separation policy. It was called zero tolerance. And it said that in a major change from the Obama days. all of the adults caught crossing the border illegally would be criminally prosecuted. That resulted in those adults going to jail, their children were taken to other facilities. And so as a result of this new Trump-Pence policy, there was regular routine separation that absolutely did not exist under Barack Obama. In short, Anderson, Mike Pence here is dishonestly distancing himself from this policy, just like Donald Trump did.",

It's a terrible message around the world.I think there are a lot of people who have questions about whether or not they want to see a former president, even one who they think has committed a crime behind bars. But it's a hard -- just as a matter of logic, it is a pretty hard one to square. What struck me tonight, Jake, about Pence's performance was the fact that he really does face some tremendous structural problems. In the latest CNN poll, 6% of Republicans, Republican-leaning voters nationally say they support Pence, 45% say that there is no circumstance under which they would ever support Pence. What struck me is that on a number of issues, Ukraine and the fact that he feels that we should be committed to it and cannot allow Russia to win, entitlement reform, social security reform and Medicare reform, he is very much and he talked repeatedly about being a Reagan Republican and signing on during the Reagan revolution. The question, of course, is whether this is Ronald Reagan's party anymore. It seems to be more of Donald Trump's party, even if you don't end up for voting for Donald Trump, which you see Republicans saying there is no reform of entitlements, social security or Medicare, and also, an increasing number of them pulling back in terms of a kind of a blank check of support for Ukraine. So, you know, I think he would be a very attractive candidate in the 80s with Reagan and Bush 41. Whether he's an attractive candidate in 2024, even for those who are looking for an alternative to Donald Trump, I am not so sure.",

To have this smoke this far south inundating a city like New York, even farther south, Philly, Washington D.C., all suffering the effects of this as well, just incredible.In New York, major league baseball games have been postponed. A WNBA game and Broadway shows being postponed. There was an actor who was in the middle of (INAUDIBLE) who had to stop today because she was unable to go on. So, health professionals are saying the best thing that you can do -- the air quality has improved, it is much, much better right now than it was earlier today, but it will be with us for the next 24 or maybe 48 hours where we will have this smoke. It may actually move farther west, to Pittsburgh and other cities in the west. But health officials say that the best thing you can do now is stay indoors.

These are crowds that genuinely seem to really like him. We also saw them being very receptive, when we saw the former vice president talk about issues like faith. It really underscores the percentage of evangelicals among Iowa Republicans. We also saw them with him when he talked about issues like abortion, a lot of support there. And something else that we really notice in the crowd, after the rally, during the commercial break here at the town hall, is Mike Pence going into the crowd and shaking hands and spending real time talking one-on-one with people. He could've sat down during the commercial break and got water. Instead, we saw him take many commercial breaks by engaging. And that is something that this campaign has been telling since the get-go will be a strength. That's what they want to get him out to all 99 counties.

I think the best illustration of that is Mike Pence's own case.

I covered the Trump administration when they were trying to pass this, and Republicans by and large were really never fully on board with this. This was always something that the likes of Senator Tom Cotton had been vocally against. The attorney general, Bill Barr, at the time was privately against it, publicly very lukewarm on it. But it is sad because I think some of the cases that they cite are actually quite rare. The First Step Act was supposed to speak to more broadly the need for the criminal justice system to be responsive to people turning their lives around, to people getting sentences that were disproportionate to the crime or not even proportionate to other people of different races who committed the same crimes. But that's not the kind of nuanced conversation we're going to have in this cycle. I also think it represents a huge turnaround. Trump wanted to do that because they thought they could make inroads with Black voters and with voters of color. This cycle, I think we're going to see kind of an equal and opposite force.
