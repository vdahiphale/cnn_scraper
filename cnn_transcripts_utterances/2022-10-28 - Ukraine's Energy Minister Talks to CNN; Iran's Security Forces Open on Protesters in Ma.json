Well sources say Musk immediately fired three top executives on Thursday, including Twitter CEO.

He has been very public and criticizing Twitter saying that they have banned people too often for things and he said he's not a fan of the permanent ban. So I think when you're talking about former President Donald Trump and some of these other people who have been booted from the platform, you can expect that they'll probably be allowed on and sometime in the future. And then also, Twitter has implemented a lot of rules in the last few years to curb hate speech to curb misinformation. And so I think you can also expect to see that those rules are eroded a little bit rolled back. What that means for the platform, of course, is still it's still not known.
