That said, you don't have to prove -- as a prosecutor you don't have to prove that the person was a leader in order to be a member of the conspiracy. We used to argue to juries essentially everyone who's in the movie is in the cast, whether they're the leading player, a supporting player, or a bit player. Same thing for a conspiracy. Everyone who was in on the agreement, leader, bit player, is part of the conspiracy.The other thing that prosecutors are going to have to prove here is that the agreement involved the use of force. That's required for seditious conspiracy. And in the first trial, the prosecutors convinced the jury that two of the five defendants were in on that plan to use force and so that's going to be a key question in this one as well.",

They might have to give themselves more time.Now, that's a lot of reading the tea leaves at a moment when there's still a lot of uncertainty up here on Capitol Hill on this government funding. But here's what's happening today. The rules committee will have a meeting today. The House will be prepared to vote expeditiously on this short-term spending bill tomorrow. Then it will move over to the Senate. The Senate week usually ends late Thursday afternoon, so that might give you a little bit of indication of how quickly this could move in the U.S. Senate. At that point, they will have another week to continue these negotiations. But we should note, they still have not agreed on how much money to spend next year to fund the government. The fact that that simple outstanding fact is still to be determined tells you that they still have a long ways to go. Jim and Erica.",

ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Yes, we are in the midst of a tornado warning here at -- on the western side of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. We are at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport where essentially everything has come to a halt here as this really strong line of severe storms is starting to make its way through north Texas. And this is a storm system that has already spawned several tornadoes from Texas and Oklahoma. Behind me you can hear the alarms and the alerts that are going off here throughout the airport and in the terminal area. Airport employees have been escorting people to stay away from the windows as we await this strong line of severe storms that has a serious threat and possibility of creating tornadoes as it moves from Fort Worth into the mid cities and into the Dallas area as well.

Speaking to dozens of world leaders at a conference focused on providing immediate support to Ukraine, Zelenskyy warned that the price tag was less than the cost of a blackout as Russian strikes have left millions of Ukrainian civilians without electricity amid sub-zero temperatures.Here with me now is Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton. He just returned from a trip to Ukraine as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation. Congressman, thanks for taking the time this morning. REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Good to see you, Jim. SCIUTTO: First of all, to the suffering there right now, this is a deliberate campaign by Russia to really make the Ukrainian people suffer by taking away their electricity here.

The second thing that we can do, which we are doing, and we're doing it, I think, as best we can, is get them the repair parts to fix their electrical grid. Of course, it's a race against time and it's a race against how many missiles the Russians still have to throw at this problem because we can repair a transformer and then they can take it out again the next night.
