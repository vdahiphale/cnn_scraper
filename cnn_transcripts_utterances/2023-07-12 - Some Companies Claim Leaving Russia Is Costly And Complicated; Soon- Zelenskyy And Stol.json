A pistol, by the way, is something the Ukrainian side -- the Ukrainian defense intelligence, which came out with a lot of details on this case, said was used in the murder. So this is really murky. Right now, we don't know why he was targeted. His family say he may not have been involved in the special military operation at all. So we await more on this.

It comes amid accusations that the FBI prevented a more thorough investigation of Hunter Biden. The actors' union SAG-AFTRA and Hollywood studios have agreed to bring in a federal mediator to try to iron out their contract differences. The strike deadline is set for tonight. And President Biden and President Zelenskyy set to meet on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Lithuania in a short time. Zelenskyy has been notably frustrated over NATO's decision to provide guidance but not a specific timeline on when the alliance will be ready to grant Ukraine membership. And days after Russia invaded Ukraine, more than 1,000 companies pledged to stop doing business in Russia. But today, a group of researchers is now naming and shaming some well-known firms that say that they have violated that pledge. CNN's Tom Foreman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  When Russia marched into Ukraine, hundreds of companies from other nations announced plans to march out of Moscow, hitting Vladimir Putin's government in the pocketbook and hobbling his war effort. But one year, 4 1/2 months after the invasion, some others are still doing brisk business in Russia, according to Yale Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.",

It's wartime profiteering and it is actually aiding, sadly -- helping to fuel Putin's war machine.FOREMAN (voice-over):  This research finds although many companies followed through on their pledges, taking millions of dollars out of Russia, some big players did not. Among them, Heineken. Sonnenfeld's researchers say the Dutch company has seven facilities in Russia, 1,800 employees, and is still launching new brands there. Heineken calls the war a terrible human tragedy and says the company remains committed to leaving but, so far, has not secured Russian regulatory approval to sell its assets. Also on the list, Mondelez, the company that makes Oreos among other things. With 3,000 employees and products still moving in Russian markets, the company is being boycotted by some Europeans, even as it said in a statement last month it is scaling back in Russia. And there are more. Unilever has called the war brutal and senseless. Philip Morris has said the situation is complex. Nestle, last year, pledged to sell only essential items but Yale researchers say non- essential items are still being sold. And all of those companies continue doing business with the Russians. Many suggest divesting themselves from Russia is more costly and complicated than outsiders might imagine, and they don't want to hurt their Russian employees. Sonnenfeld's response --",

And last minute's 93rd -- last night, excuse me, 93rd edition of the Midsummer Classic -- no exception to that. This one had absolutely everything in Seattle -- defensive plays, catching, clutch-hitting. You name it, it had it. Rockies catcher Elias Diaz had never been in an All-Star Game at 32 years old, after nine seasons in the Majors, but that didn't phase him at all. He erupted in a big way in the eighth inning, down by one, facing one of the best relievers in the game, Felix Bautista of the Orioles. And he crushes the ball deep into left field into the stands for the two-run shot. And that we enough to earn him MVP honors and the National League its first All-Star Game win since 2012. And after the game he got a little bit emotional talking about his mother being there to see it all happen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIAS DIAZ, 2023 ALL-STAR GAME MVP (through translator):  That was incredibly special for me, you know, to have her here. A lot of emotions. With everything that we've been through and all the sacrifices that she made for me, it was really special to have her here for me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
