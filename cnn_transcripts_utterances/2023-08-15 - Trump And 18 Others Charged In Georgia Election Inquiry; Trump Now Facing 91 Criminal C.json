Look, this is happening in Georgia, all their other states are implicated here. Tia, Georgia is unique for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that you've got Republicans who were really in the crosshairs essentially of the wrath of Donald Trump, and also those who were solicited specifically. This is not me -- this is Brian Kemp. This is Brad Roethlisberger. This is Gabriel Sterling, to name a few. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Yes, and it's interesting. I actually started out the day in Atlanta. The first person I saw when I got to the courthouse was Gabriel Sterling arriving for his interview with the grand jury today. We don't think Raffensperger was called for the grand jury. But it's likely if this thing goes to trial. Raffensperger could be called, of course, we know Jeff Duncan, the former Lieutenant Governor went to the grand jury today, he's likely to be called, it could even go up to Brian Kemp. And there are when you read through the indictment, there are a lot of Republican state senators that are also mentioned, as people who were pressured to either take action that the district attorney believes was illegal or --",

Martin, which says an officer who acts out of any personal interest, check, malice, check, actual criminal intent, check, or for any other reason that to do his duty, no removal.

By the time that call is made, the former president and his alliesknow full well, that they have no support for their fraud claims. As a matter of fact, they're exchanging emails, and there's a lot of things that she cites here that the DA cites in here, that shows they were fully aware that there was no fraud, or at least not the fraud to support this. Right. And very importantly, I think, just you know, in the past year, you know, David O. Carter, the judge, who really pierced the veil of all of this, ruled that that that somewhat John Eastman was doing with Trump was violating, you know, basically by virtue of the fact that they were in a criminal conspiracy meant that they, you know, that you could access all of his attorney client product.

And as you said, we've been tracking this story for the better part of almost two years now, this breaching Coffee County, Georgia, which about 200 miles south where we are right now in downtown Atlanta.But four of the co-defendants named alongside Trump in this indictment are linked to the Coffee County breach and several charges that they face are for their alleged involvement in what took place on January 7, 2021 and in the weeks after. The evidence, really details some topics that we've covered previously, some text messages, surveillance video that were first emerged several months ago and really continued to come to light since then, as part of this long running civil lawsuit here in Atlanta that was filed by a group of election security advocates, but they really deserve a lot of credit because this evidence does underpin a lot of the criminal charges that these four co-defendants that were involved in the Coffee County for each face. Now there's also several the unnamed co-conspirators, unindicted co- conspirators, who are also mentioned in reference to Coffee County, Georgia. And what we reported yesterday was really a continuation of the storyline. We've been tracking for the last few years that these text messages, these communications, these emails, draw a direct line from these on the ground operatives who gained unauthorized access to the elections office in Coffee County, all the way up to some of Trump's personal attorneys at the times when the members of his legal team like Sidney Powell. The indictment specifically talks about how Sidney Powell contracted this cyber forensics firm to examine voting systems that they had in Coffee County that they had no authorization to have access to. That really is the crux of the broader sort of conspiracy that they lay out in the indictment. And it really does is it through line throughout the entire charging document itself.",

But in the broader scheme, there were a lot more states that were in play, and they had people on the ground in those states doing the fake electoral scheme and other things to try to overturn the election.So, there are a lot of people here who have to act, right in order to make these things happen. And, you know, all the way down to the bail bondsman. I mean, the indictment is so, so detailed. And that's the thing that really strikes me so granular in the details in here about what everybody did. And, you know, it's not quite as easy to read as much of a narrative as the January 6 indictment is, but if you do read through it, it just gives you so much detail. And it goes in pretty much chronological order, the acts of the RICO charge. And so you can just go through and it says, you know, in Coffee County on this date, they picked the guy up from the airport, they took him to the -- where the voting machines were. And then the next paragraph talks about the next action, and these are the overt acts. And so it's not quite as narrative as it could be.

TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE: The what stands out is what the tools that we didn't have at our disposal. One thing we didn't have was the power to charge. And I think here, you look at the extensive number of defendants, these are folks who presumably either chose not to cooperate or were asked or were not asked to cooperate. So I think that's one thing that we didn't have in our investigation. The second thing is time. I mean, we really were under the gun with the select committee. And here, we've they've had the opportunity in Fulton County to take two and a half years to truly develop this to get into this kind of granular detail that's now reflected in the indictment. So I think while the subcommittee I think we did a, you know, frankly, an amazing job. I think we put forward a thorough case to the American people.

There's not a Republican in America that can beat Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, which tells you how in disarray, the Republicans are.I do want to talk about just some magnificent figures again, in this indictment. I mean, I just think back to 2001, when Rudy Giuliani was America's mayor, and their people who worked with Rudy Giuliani, John Avlon was a speechwriter very close to Rudy Giuliani, you know, Rudy Giuliani could have had a statute erected for him in about 2002 or 2003, in the center of Times Square. I mean, that's how popular he was. And now he's being indicted in Atlanta, Georgia. You have lawyers who are involved in this. You have bail bondsman who are involved in this. And at the top of this game, you have the president of the United States. I know we have writer's strikes and everything going on in Hollywood, you could not jump the shark like this with this indictment. And when you look at how detailed this is, when you look at some of the things they went out of their way to do, to abuse people to torment people, when you look at the fact that they were breaking into facilities that they were going into voting booths, when they have text messages and emails that back all of this up. So this isn't something and I, you know, I don't like when people say that Fani, respectfully to my friend, Scott. They say that Fani is partisan, because this isn't partisan when you read it. I mean, if you take Democrat and Republican, off anybody's label when you read this indictment, you see just an unjust. You see accountability and you see law breaking. And then you get to the political aspect of it, where all my Republican friends Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, all of them are running on law and order. Well, what you see in this is an abuse of law and order. That's what this is.

By analogy, a sort of analogy that has prevailed in other cases, this group of people fighting to give the election unlawfully to Donald Trump was a criminal enterprise, the whole thing is like one rotten business with a business goal -- a criminal goal of getting the election to Trump. That is RICO. Here is even a step removed, because it is section C of RICO -- conspiring to do it. So what she is saying is, the people agreed to try and to get the election swayed to Trump, committed 161 overt acts of which they have to prove, stick around two -- two overt acts in order to make RICO stick. So it is first and foremost a way to get so much activity in under an umbrella, but the idea of it at least is basically everything he was doing from November 3rd to January 6th, indeed the indictment goes to September of 2022 when there were lies, was all one big criminal enterprise.

I mean it is a sweeping indictment.What is the impact it has on the 2024 race that we are currently in the middle of? To the Republican nomination? Our CNN political analyst Ron Brownstein joins us now. Ron, I mean, I just wonder, when you are reading through this, what you're thinking -- everyone who just a few days ago was hanging on in Iowa, what they are thinking, I guess and what it means to them. RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. You know look, in the context -- I think you have to separate what all of this means for a Republican primary, nomination play and what it might mean if he wins that fight and advances on to a general election. In the context of the Republican primary, Donald Trump will see it through his (INAUDIBLE), he is foot -- he has folded in these indictments into one of the most powerful strains of the thought that hold together the modern Republican coalition. And that is the belief that conservatives are the real victim of bias in a diversifying society. You know, that bias against whites is now the biggest problem as bias against minorities, Christianity and America's under assault, that men are punished just for being like him. 70 percent or more of Republicans in polls say they agree with all of those propositions, and what Trump has done from the beginning is -- braid all of these criminal indictments into, you know, an advancing of that argument. I mean, he calls the prosecutors, the African American prosecutors leading cases against him racists, you know. And he basically says they are going after me because they really want to silence you. No question that that argument has proven very powerful, and I think in the Republican primary because it reinforces what is already an existing belief among most GOP voters. In a general election it is a whole different question. I think, you know, we saw that in the \"New York Times\"/Siena poll that over 55 percent of voters think he is -- Independent voters that he has committed a serious federal crime. Nearly 60 percent even before this indictment said that what he did after the election threatened American democracy. And we also know from multiple Marist polls for NPR and CBS -- that three-quarters of Independents say he should not be president again if he is convicted of a crime. By the way, 60 percent of Republicans say he should even if he is. So again, right now, clearly strengthening him in a Republican context. What this might mean in a general election, particularly if one of these trials is actually going in much less if he's convicted, that is a whole other issue.",

      "sentences": "Right, highly unlikely. I mean the die is cast in the Republican primary. Now whether, you know, there are still some Republicans who hold out, the Republicans critical with Trump or who do simply believe that can't win again, they hold out hope that actual trials might be the straw that finally breaks the camels' back, it is not likely.As we are saying, that anything is going to convince Republican voters that this makes him, any of these actions make him unfit to be president. I think a big part of that is because so few Republicans who believe that have been willing to take the chance of trying to tell their voters that. But again you know, Americans are very reluctant to give Joe Biden another term, no question about it, you know, The majority of the public says he is too old, concerned about whether he's too old to serve four more years. They continue to be negative on the economy. But when you look at how general election voters are responding to these indictments, even before you get to the issue of trials and possible convictions, there are real yellow warning lights on the dashboard for Republicans here. As I said, I mean we have seen pollings -- multiple polls, significant majorities of Independents say he should not be president again if he is convicted of a crime. Now will we get there before the election? I do not know. But Donald Trump is the one, if he's the nominee has increased his votes from last time. He lost by 7 million votes. He's got to expand his coalition. It's hard to see what is in here, you know, in all of these indictments, that are going to cause people who did not vote for Trump in 2020 to go oh, yes now I think he's right plus you have the added issue of abortion in those states as we saw in Ohio this week. So again, for Republicans, you know, they are the ones who are questioning whether Trump can win again, they have ammunition in that argument, but you don't see the other candidates making that very strongly. And as a result it really isn't yet part of the dialogue. Maybe that will change in the debate and thereafter, you know. The prospect of hanging concentrates the mind as they say and all the Republican candidates, I mean you have to acknowledge that whatever they're doing so far is not working given the magnitude of his lead..",
