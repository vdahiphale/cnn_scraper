Fani Willis is prosecuting the former president and several co-defendants. She may be required to testify about her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade regarding misconduct allegations.Now, Trump and his co-defendants not only want Willis removed from the case, they want the case dismissed entirely. Trump's team claims Willis had an improper relationship with Wade, and the question of whether she benefited financially from it remains at the center of things.

The results could narrow the Republican's already very slim majority in the House. It will also give some semblance of a signal to which party's messaging on issues like immigration, the economy, is resonating more with suburban voters as we head into November. CNN's Athena Jones is live at a polling place - polling location in Glen Cove, New York. Athena, to start, I'm hoping this means I won't have to see 7,000 commercials a day related to this race on my television screen, underscoring just how much money has been spent.

And on the Republican side, many of the ads, all of the ads aired by Mazi Pilip's campaign focused on the migrant crisis. So much as we've seen in other races, this race here, this local race, is very much nationalize with the issues facing Americans across the country. And so we'll have to see which message wins out here.Suozzi has said that he has not really embraced Joe Biden and his willingness for him to come out and campaign for him. Mazi Pilip took a long time before she even responded to who she voted for. So, neither of these candidates has really embraced the standard bearer of their party, and both of them are expected to keep running in November for the general election. So, this is just the first test and a way to hopefully provide clues as to which party is going to win out the day in terms of messaging here. Phil. Poppy.",

Well, we also want to give you an update on what we were talking about at the start of the show. The breaking news, the U.S. Senate has now passed that $95 billion emergency aid package. It includes more than $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion in emergency defense assistance for Israel, and about $4 billion for the Indo-Pacific as well. The final vote was 72-29, actually ticking up a couple more than I expected. A major bipartisan vote. Most of the opposition, with the exception of a couple -- one Democrat, one independent, were Republicans. Now it faces a very uncertain future in the House. Obviously it's a very big bipartisan vote. It's what the president has been asking for, for several months. The speaker, Mike Johnson, has made it clear, this is still dead on arrival in the House. What the options are going forward is an open question. It's worth noting that if they put this very bill on the House floor it would easily pass.",

It's - it's destabilizing. There's these conflicts. This didn't happen when I was there. This is helpful to him to keep these things going and to not have - and he does also oppose foreign aid.

Now, asthma is one of the most chronic health conditions in the United States. Nearly 25 million Americans suffer from asthma.Joining us now to discuss, Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. When you first see this, you say, swapping with the generic, that happens all the time. Maybe that actually is a better alternative. But it's not here. Why? DR. EDITH BRACHO-SANCHEZ, ASSISTANT PEDIATRICS PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER: The details around this will make your head spin, but let's just walk through them very quickly. GSK is the company that makes Flovent. Earlier last year they announced they were taking it off the shelves, replacing it with a generic. Now, experts who follow this have told us that the switch was made right as the company was going to incur penalties from Medicaid for having gone up on the price of Flovent over a number of years. Now, the company has not addressed this directly, but, downstream, the effects are the same, right? So, what we're talking about is insurance companies have not added the generic that they introduced to their formulary list, which is a list of preferred medications. When the medication, that generic medication, is not on the preferred list, we, as physicians, cannot prescribe it without getting a special approval. And patients cannot get it. So, here we are scrambling to get this medication.",

BRACHO-SANCHEZ: Thats exactly right. And we don't know if it's going to change. So, the company, GSK, has said the price of the generic is potentially lower, but the net price, the actually negotiated price on the ground, is actually higher for some payers. And because of this, it is not on the preferred medication lists. A number of issues with this when it comes to children. And I really encourage people to read the piece that we're publishing on cnn.com because the details are fascinating. But a number of issues. The alternatives that they're listing are not always appropriate for small children.
