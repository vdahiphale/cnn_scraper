Right now, the focus is going to be the central portion of the U.S. where we've got the heavy rain and even the potential for some severe thunderstorms down along the Gulf Coast.Out to the West, you've got a lot of snow showers making their way through the intermountain west. But you've got delays, we're talking today places like Dallas, Houston, Memphis, Atlanta, Kansas City, even Denver. Even if they're not happening right now, this is the forecast through the day. So, you're likely going to see some of those delays ticking up as we go through the morning and the afternoon hours. Here's a look at the radar. Right now, those heavy showers are pushing into Dallas, areas of Houston starting to make their way up towards Shreveport and Oklahoma City as well. You've got the colder air in place behind this system. So, you've got a lot of that snow coming down right there along the Texas-New Mexico border. Because a lot of this is heavy rainfall, we also have the potential for some flash flooding, so this is going to cause some big problems on the roadways, especially: Houston, Shreveport Little Rock stretching down to New Orleans all the way over towards Pensacola, where you can have that potential for that standing water on the roadways. This system, as we make our way through the day, though, begins to push up into areas of the Midwest and the Southeast. So, later today, and even tonight, you're going to start to see those shower chances increase for cities like Atlanta, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Chicago. And then by the time we get to Sunday, this is where you start hitting all the big cities in the Northeast: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., all looking at the potential to have the rain showers tomorrow. So, that's why, tomorrow, Sunday, specifically, notice a lot of the oranges and the yellows in terms of flight delays that we expect to happen tomorrow, just because of that system making its way up there. But also, some delays in the Pacific Northwest because we have another system coming in here. So, Seattle, Portland, also likely looking at some delays as well. So, please make sure, Sara mentioned it, but I will emphasize it, pack your patience and maybe also the poncho as well.",

In fact, if you look at retail sales today, relative to when the pandemic began, they're way above trend even after you adjust for inflation. And I think that's for a few reasons. One of which, of course, is that for a while, people were cooped up, and there were limited things that they could spend money on, they were reluctant to go out to restaurants travel, that sort of thing. So, they spent their money on physical stuff, goods, to refurbish their home or get a new wardrobe or what have you.And then, of course, the government also gave American families a lot of money during COVID, during the, the initial shutdown, and then for the next couple of years, things like stimulus checks, Child Tax Credit, unemployment insurance, you know, was, was more generous than it had been in previous recessions, et cetera. So, consumers amassed a lot of savings, had limited places to spend that savings than they really wanted to. So, the result was they went to retail stores or, or often shopped online.

So, what that means is, mortgage rates are higher, credit card rates are higher, car loans -- basically, any kind of financing has gotten more expensive. And again, the goal was to cool down demand a little bit because supply chains are still tangled.And so, you wanted to discourage people from spending quite as much. Now, they're still spending, as we've just discussed, they're still spending quite a lot. And that's partly because they have all of these savings accumulated. What happens going forward is, is an interesting question. Because if consumers continue to spend a lot, you're going to see inflation continue. It's moderated somewhat, but it's still way higher than the Fed wants it to be, than really any of us want it to be. And you might see as a result, that the Fed will need to keep raising interest rates for a while, which will in turn, make that spending more expensive, right, at least if you're buying on credit cards.

And the house prices themselves haven't come down a ton. They've come down a little bit in some markets, but, but not enough to offset how much more expensive it is to borrow, if that makes sense. You know, like if you have budgeted 2000 bucks a month, to, you know, to spend on your, your monthly mortgage payment. That buys you a lot less house today than it did a year ago, just because interest rates have gone up so much.So, I don't know. I mean, my usual advice to people on home buying is if you have to move, if you need a house, then obviously you have to move and buy a house. But it seems likely that house prices will continue to come down a little bit going forward. So, it's very hard to time the market of course, but now may not be the best time given that interest rates are quite high. Like you said, they've come down bit, but they are still quite high and, and sales prices haven't quite adjusted to that reality yet.",

Because there were, there's a law that says for general elections, you can't have early voting within two days of a holiday. We had Thanksgiving. There's also that state holiday that used to be named after Robert E. Lee, which is the day after Thanksgiving. But ultimately, the courts sided with the Democrats. It was appealed. The appeals court also sided with the Democrats in Warnock's campaign, and then the Supreme Court some the state did not appeal to the Supreme Court, but the Republican Party did.

But he's already facing controversy over some of the guests he hosted at his private Mar-a-Lago club this week. We learned from Kanye West's twitter feed that the rapper had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and that he was accompanied by white nationalist and Holocaust denier, Nick Fuentes. West became engulfed in controversy as you guys know in October, after repeating anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and making other offensive claims during an appearance on a podcast. Those anti-Semitic remarks by West cause companies that he was affiliated with, including Adidas to sever their relationships with him. But more recently, he's been spending time with Nick Fuentes, who the Anti-Defamation League has identified as a white supremacist. Fuentes has also been banned from most major social media platforms for his white nationalist rhetoric. In the video that West posted to Twitter on Thursday -- he claimed that Trump is really impressed with Fuentes. But a source familiar with the dinner told our Kristen Holmes that Fuentes was a guest of Kanye's and was not invited by the former president. And I just want to read to you the former president's statement on this on Truth Social. He said, \"This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.\" So, the former president clearly trying to distance himself here from Fuentes. But he did not ask him to leave the club, which would have, of course, been his right. And we've seen Trump use this pattern of behavior before when he has been associated with controversial figures.

That's going to be a problem with the executive branch because it's an executive privilege. He's going to have a hard time to claim executive privilege against the executive branch. And so, I think ultimately, he loses on that legally. But, of course, delays the big problem.
