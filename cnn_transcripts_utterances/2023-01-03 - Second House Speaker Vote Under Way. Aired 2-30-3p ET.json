It's a long shot but there's a level of orchestration here that I actually think the Freedom Caucus deserves credit for that makes me think they have another play at hand. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: They have more than that of McCarthy. Someone voting for McCarthy said as long as it takes, McCarthy. Which isn't really a plan, right?
