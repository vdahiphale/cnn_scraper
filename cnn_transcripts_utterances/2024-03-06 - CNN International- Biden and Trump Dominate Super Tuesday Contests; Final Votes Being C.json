No sign of that changing at all, and we hear from Ukrainian fighters on the front line here that it's simply a matter of life and death until that changes.

And it is, you know, what we heard over and over from voters at this polling location in El Paso, Texas. It's immigration and the economy very much top of mind. But Trump's commanding performance on this election day really kind of speaks to just how much the Texas Republican Party has changed in recent years. Of course, this was home to George Bush, senior and junior. They were the ones that kind of dominated the political landscape here in the state for so long, and Nikki Haley kind of represented that wing of the Republican Party here. But it is clearly a Republican Party that has changed dramatically. Donald Trump really influencing much of what has happened here in the state with a dominating performance tonight with a victory over Nikki Haley. Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They're counting and sorting all of these ballots, which will be counted starting tomorrow.Earlier in the day, this room was also very busy, as they were counting all of the vote by mail ballots, because on average, 88 percent of Californians vote by mail, and so a lot of that was happening here today. Now, we did see some voters who did come to the polls. There was not a whole lot that came in person, but those that we did speak to really talked about the economy as being the most important thing right now. No surprise, as here in the state of California, it has one of the nation's highest living costs, and many people also spoke to us about the presidential race being incredibly important. One man saying he cannot fathom, you know, a future where the former President Donald Trump is reelected, so he wanted to make his voice heard by voting for President Biden today. Back to you.

It's been taking hard-right positions, ensuring that the right-wing is energized. So the extent to which he's able to attack toward the center is going to be a little bit more challenging for Joe Biden.

In an election that's going to be determined in a handful of swing states by a few percentage points, any lack of enthusiasm on the part of the base has to be a concern.I don't think that this is the key issue, though, Bianca. Because if you look at Biden's poll numbers, they have stayed more or less flat going back all the way to October 7th. You also see some others in his party, like John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who have taken a very hardline position in favor of Israel, and his poll numbers have never been higher.

So there are some big foreign policy challenges. Domestically, of course, there are some issues on immigration, on abortion, on health care and education. But I really think, Max, that this election is going to come down to personalities. You basically have two candidates who are running as de facto incumbents.

President Xi Jinping is now a step forward and he's calling for China to unleash what he calls new quality productive forces.And on top of that, just a few hours ago, we heard from China's top economic leaders at a press conference in Beijing at the National People's Congress. They are speaking out to try to restore confidence. Now at the Congress, China set this ambitious growth target of around 5 percent this year, but no major stimulus was announced. So analysts have been fearing that China, yes, it may have a target, but does it have a plan to get there? Now, one analyst at UBS says this, let's bring up the quote for you. Quote: The growth target is OK, but the missing part is how they want to achieve that. What sort of stimulus is unclear for now? Unquote. Now, this afternoon, we heard from China's top economic leaders and they address concerns about China's economic health. We heard from China's National Development and Reform Commission Chairman Zheng Shanjie. We have the quote for you. And this is what he said, sounding quite bullish. He said, quote: It -- referring to the 5 percent growth target -- is a goal that can be achieved with a positive attitude and hard work. Unquote. We also heard from China's central bank governor, and he added that China still has rich monetary policy tools at its disposal. So that was a strong suggestion that China might continue to cut rates. During the Congress, Xi Jinping spoke to a delegation from Jiangsu province, and he used again this new catchphrase, his mantra, saying this. Words from Xi Jinping up on the screen. He says: Developing new quality productive forces does not mean neglecting or abandoning traditional industries. He goes on to say: It is necessary to prevent a headlong rush into projects and the formation of industry bubbles. Now, that term, new productive forces, that was coined by Xi Jinping late last year when he highlighted the need for a new growth model, new growth model based on science, technology and innovation. But Xi Jinping, he may be putting the focus on future growth. But China today is facing a number of challenges that we continue to report on here on your news program. Talking about the property crisis, the demographic crisis with the low birth rate, weak spending, deflation, high youth unemployment, et cetera, et cetera.
