And then tensions ratcheted up in the West Bank after a raid by Israeli forces leaves at least ten Palestinians dead. Plus, the United Nations is warning that it only has half the money it needs to help the world's most vulnerable. I speak to the UNAID chief about how his organization is coping with these dueling crises. But first, this evening, as the war in Ukraine rages and tensions threaten to expand outside Ukraine's borders, the U.S. and Russia are working to fortify their relationships with allies. Russian President Vladimir Putin is drawing closer to Beijing. Earlier, he met with China's top diplomat in Moscow, saying the country's relationship is reaching, quote, \"new milestones\". Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator):  International relations today are complex. They have not improved after the collapse of the bipolar system. On the contrary, they have become more tense and in this regard, cooperation between Russia and the Chinese People's Republic, on the international arena, are very important for the stabilization of the international situations, as we have said many times.

It's about the -- you know, the challenge to the rule-based international order, and the fact that Putin thinks he has some right to declare some countries his spheres of interest, although those countries do not intend to be his spheres of interest, and want to be their own, want to decide their own destiny. So definitely, it is important both politically, but also practically. Because in Madrid Summit last year, it was decided, it was agreed that Russia is a threat. We all know that Putin's invasion, as a matter of fact, reinvented or reinvigorated NATO because there was a debate on how we should treat Russia and the countries on the eastern flank were insisting on the understanding that this is a threat. So, now, there is no question. And now, we only need to proceed and to decide how we strengthen the eastern flank further.

Because for so many years, so many countries were not even close to what this NATO standard of 2 percent of GDP. Countries in this region, of course, have changed their attitudes of having increased their spending on defense and security significantly, since Crimea invasion and are continuing to do so in the recent years, because our defense spending will be somewhere between 2.5 percent, 3 percent of GDP this year.

And I think it's simply shown in the fact that Vladimir Putin, you know, being the head of state, Russia, took the time to meet with China's top diplomat. And Vladimir Putin said that he believes that the relations between the two countries are going to new milestones as he put it. So obviously, as he thinks in a very good way. For Russia-China has become extremely important with all the sanctions that have been placed on the Russians, but also, of course, as the war progresses as well. The U.S., of course, certainly thinking that the Chinese might be thinking about providing lethal aid to the Russians. That, of course, was a huge point of tension between the U.S. and China just a couple of days ago. And we heard from the two men today when they had their meeting, Vladimir Putin talking about the relations, but Wang Yi also speaking, it seems, as though about some of that criticism that has been coming from the United States. He said the relations between Russia and China were very good. He also said that they are not subject to interference from third countries. And to many, that seemed as though he was probably talking about some of the things that the U.S. has been saying about China. But you know, it's hard to overstate just how much Russia is banking on China for its economic prosperity. Less so maybe in the way of military. But if you look at just the amount of Chinese products that are in shops here now, the amount of Chinese cars that are on the streets, just in the last year, you can see that China is certainly making an entry here into the market, in a big way, and it's becoming ever more important for the Russians.",

And it would also expose Chinese companies to economic sanctions, at a time when China has its own economic problems, and, of course, it is using its growing economic might in its pursuit of global superpower status. So, China, I think, sees the Ukraine war and the opportunities it brings to its own prism of its adversarial relationship, increasingly so, with the United States. But there are things it could do, buying more gas and oil as it already has been doing, sending dual use technologies, sending non- lethal aid to the Russians and helping them out that way. I think China, in some ways, has an interest in this war going on much longer, having the U.S. and Europe bogged down, sending their ammunition. We've heard about declining stocks in the West into the war. Those can't be used in -- for example, for the -- for example, for U.S. forces in the Pacific or the whole thing may slow down and the delivery of U.S. weapons to Taiwan. So, China has a lot of interest here. The idea that it would just throw in its lot completely with Russia, though, still seems a little questionable.",

It has nointerest as President Biden said during his trip in damaging Russia, specifically or hurting the Russian people. Biden, of course, said that, you know, if Putin gave the order today, the war could end if he left Ukraine. So, the U.S. doesn't have an interest necessarily in fighting a proxy war against Russia, as much as Russia would like to frame the conflict as that kind of situation. Again, I don't think the Chinese necessarily want to engage in a proxy war in Europe. Their interest is in the Pacific. But we're going through a period in which there are increasing links between the Russians and the Chinese. The world seems to be dividing itself a little bit into a contest between democracies, autocracies, and a bunch of non-aligned nations. And of course, it's long been, for decades, a fear of the United States that the Russians and the Chinese could tie up more formally in anti-U.S. alliance. That is a question going back all the way to the cold war, and was one of the reasons, in fact, why Richard Nixon took part in the opening of China back in the 1970s. But I don't think we're at that point yet, but it's clear that the U.S., after spending a year basically downplaying the Chinese influence in the war, have some reason to believe that things could be changing. This big meeting and the Kremlin today between Putin and Wang Yi, plays into those concerns, and it's really part of the massive diplomatic symbolism that we've seen this week, during President Biden's trip to Europe.",

This is a rule that would essentially limit access to asylum in the U.S., marking a departure from decades-long protocol. And it would be different because currently, U.S. law allows migrants on U.S. soil the right to request asylum. So, this is already faced fierce criticism from immigrant advocates and democratic lawmakers, who say this is essentially reminiscent of Trump-era policies, which also tried to dramatically curtail asylum. Now, administration officials reject that comparison, saying that this is not a categorical ban on asylum and rather, they really want migrants to instead apply for legal pathways to the United States from where they are, instead of journeying to the U.S.-Mexico border. But they also concede, it wasn't their first choice, with one administration official telling reporters, quote, \"this was not our first preference or even our second.\" Now, this will not take effect right away. It still has to go through a public comment period. But the timeline here would essentially have it go into effect in May, when a Trump-era COVID border restriction known as Title 42, will end. That has allowed authorities so far to turn away certain migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. UNDERSECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS:  Sure and thank you for having me on the program, Isa. The first thing to say is that it's probably going to get worse, in terms of needs, because in both Syria and Turkiye, the engineers are going through all the buildings that haven't collapsed, to assess how many of them are safe for reoccupation. We are going to see thousands of buildings which will need to be brought down, probably, because of being unsafe.

But the schools want to open again this week. So people are going to be moved out to temporary shelters. Buying, acquiring tents in the market is extremely difficult because, of course, they're all being used. So we're asking generous donors to airlift tents and other bulk items like that into Syria, into Gaziantep, on the border in Turkiye and Syria. It's going to get worse, I think, in terms of shelter. But Isa, if I could just add one thing.",

I want to show you how difficult it is to do this. This is one of the creeks right in the middle of East Palestine. These booms that you see, these little white booms, those lay over the top of the water, as it stirred up any toxins in it. They are captured in that. They are getting ready to lay new ones out. They've been replacing them all day long. And then you have these generators here that suck water out of the stream and pump it back in at a very high volume so you can see how it disturbs the water. So anything flowing along the bottom or in the water is pushed to the top and it is captured by these things. It is dirty work, it is hard work and it's taking them a long time to do this. But now not only the railroad, Norfolk Southern, but the federal government and the states of both Ohio and Pennsylvania, which is right next door, now all saying they are here for the long term, years until all of this is cleaned up.",
