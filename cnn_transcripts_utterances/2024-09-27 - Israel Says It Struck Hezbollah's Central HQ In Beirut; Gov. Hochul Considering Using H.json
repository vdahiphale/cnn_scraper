Israel says, it has struck Hezbollah's central headquarters in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is now here with us from Beirut. Jomana, what are you seeing and hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, a short while ago, we were here on the roof, and we heard massive blasts that shook our hotel as well as the rest of Beirut. And then we could see the thick plume of smoke rising from the direction of Beirut's southern suburbs.That is an area, one of the most densely populated areas of the country, where you have a Hezbollah presence, where their leadership has been known to have been based in the past, where we have seen multiple Israeli strikes in recent days. But this certainly was the largest blast that anyone here has witnessed since the start of this escalation. According to Lebanese colleagues, they say that this is the biggest Israeli strike that has taken place since the 2006 Israel, Hezbollah war. We have heard from the Israeli military saying that they struck Hezbollah's central headquarters in Beirut with a precise strike, they say, and that this headquarters served as the epicenter, they say, of Hezbollah's terror. And they say that it was underneath a residential building, again, accusing Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields, something that the Lebanese government, we have heard say is baseless. They say that these are excuses. This is something we've heard in recent days from the Lebanese government, a minister we spoke to yesterday, saying it is the same excuses that we have heard in Gaza for nearly a year. Accusing Israeli military of indiscriminate attacks here, they say, not only going after Hezbollah, but saying that it is women and children and civilians in this country who are bearing the brunt of this. Now Dana, we still don't have information from Lebanese authorities on casualty figures, but that was huge explosions. And when you hear the Israeli military laying, really the groundwork for what seems to have been a huge strike that they carried out, saying that it was under residential buildings, saying that it was a headquarters. And based on what we heard, you would expect that large munitions were used in this strike, and almost certainly. When you consider how densely populated that area is, it is likely going to have a high casualty toll. And we will bring you that as we get that information from these Lebanese authorities.",

And much of it has been stopped by the Iron Dome, but some have been killed, and there are tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from with in their own country. Kind of refugees in their own country have moved south because of what has been happening.So, this has kind of been a slow burn, as you know, far better than I between the two -- between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel at its northern border. Before I let you go, I know it's early, and forgive me, because this might not be something that's answerable. But is there any indication that Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, was in the headquarters that we believe was the target here?",

As you said, and we want to underscore, it is very early in and what we just saw as this really major strike by the Israelis inside Beirut at what they say is Hezbollah headquarters. Thank you so much. We'll come back to you if and when you get more information.Now we want to come back here to the United States, to New York, where we have even more breaking news. Mayor Eric Adams is inside a federal courthouse, set to be formally arraigned any minute. Like any other, criminal defendant, he will be in the custody of -- he already is in the custody of U.S. marshals. He is being fingerprinted and photographed. An unsealed indictment alleged Adams' pocketed cash and gifts from foreign powers, and that he and his aides routinely deleted messages to hide their alleged crimes. This morning, sources tell CNN that New York's Governor Kathy Hochul is weighing whether to use her authority to remove the mayor from office. I want to get straight to CNN's Gloria Pazmino in New York. Gloria?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana. The judge has taken the bench. Eric Adams is inside that courtroom and the arraignment of the mayor of the City of New York for the first time in the city's history is now underway.He is facing multiple charges, bribery, corruption, soliciting and accepting illegal donations and specifically defrauding the city's matching fund system, a taxpayer funded system meant to make elections easier for people who run for office. Making them not have to raise money from high powered individuals in order to finance their campaigns. But that's exactly what the U.S. attorney says that Eric Adams did, and that he started doing this long before he became mayor. And that once he took office, he used his power, his authority to grant special favors to those donors. Now I just want to take a moment to highlight what's happening here because the mayor is inside that courtroom. My colleagues, Mark Morales and Kara Scannell are in there. They say that he is staring right ahead, looking at the judge's bench. He has also taken a look at the jury box, which right now is filled by members of the press, and he's taken a look at the sketch artists. They're going to be the ones who give us the only images that come out of this. It's federal court, so no cameras allowed inside. You said, he has been processed just like any other defendant. They have taken his mug shot. They have taken his fingerprints. They have put him through the federal system. We will not be seeing that mug shot. New York has a policy of not releasing those photos. But the enormity of this moment, and as you said, the political fallout, the political implications of all of this are significant. The governor taking a serious look at the legal language that grants her the power to remove the mayor. Now that is not an easy thing to do. It is not a politically easy thing to accomplish. But sources close to the governor and those who are familiar with what she is thinking about right now, say that she is keeping her options open. Now I do want to just highlight that that is not going to be an easy task, right. Here you have the first woman mayor who would be using her powers to remove the city's second black mayor who has yet to be convicted of any charges. There are other high profile lawmakers who have called for his resignation, including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velazquez here in New York, along with several other city and state members who say that the mayor cannot run the city effectively and that he should step down. The mayor so far showing no signs that he has plans to do so. He says, he will fight the charges, and that New Yorkers should give him a chance to defend himself. Dana?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana. So typically, when you put an indictment together as a prosecutor, you're going to put a lot of your evidence in there, but certainly not all of it. But looking at this indictment in the broader sense, it strikes me that the prosecution's evidence here is solid.I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's a complete slam dunk, overwhelming case. But the strongest parts of the case appear to be, first of all, the text. You just highlighted one. There's another, for example, where Eric Adams is basically telling one of his staffers to get a donation from a foreign donor to make it work. We don't want to waste that opportunity. And then the other thing that comes through to me from the indictment is that they clearly -- prosecutors clearly have flipped people on the inside of Eric Adams' office and campaign, those can be really powerful witnesses. And I just have to say, Dana, having practiced in the very courthouse that we just saw Eric Adams walking into 500 Pearl Street, it is surreal. It's just surreal to see the sitting mayor walking into those doors right now, which are a couple hundred yards away from his office. And now he's sitting at a table as a criminal defendant in federal court.",

First of all, Eric Adams has absolute top shelf defense attorneys. I think what we're going to see is a defense like the one that we saw in the first trial of Senator Robert Menendez, not the one that just concluded with the conviction.But the one a few years ago where Senator Menendez beat those charges. Essentially, what he argued is, look, if I took travel and benefits from people, they were friends of mine. If I did things to try to help them, that's constituent service. That's what we do and that's not bribery. There are some Supreme Court rulings that actually lend some support to that theory that say, it's not enough. If you're just sort of setting up meetings and making phone calls for people, you have to show something more specific than that. But the problem for Adams is the funneling of foreign money through straw donors. I think that's going to be a big problem for him here.",

The water has receded like in Steinhatchee. The storm brought complete disrepair, turning roads into muddy trails.And then there's this, what is both the scariest and sole satisfying moment of the day. The coast guard saved a man and his dog who were stranded 25 miles off Sanibel Island. You can see the pair clutching each other, desperately holding on as the rescue team finds them before hoisting them into a helicopter.

And in fact, the National Guard is at this hour coordinating the recovery and safety efforts out here, in large part because you can't walk too far without seeing some of the damage out here.This sailboat behind me is one of about nearly half a dozen that came crashing ashore in yesterday's storm. Again, you really cannot get too far without seeing just how much of this storm impacted this part of Gulfport and Pinellas County. This right here used to be a part of a floating dock that you can see clearly, broke free of its pylon -- its concrete pylon, out in the bay out there, and came to a stop right here. This part of Pinellas County, where we were yesterday, got anywhere between four to six feet of a storm surge. And so, when all of that water came from the bay, it pushed all of this back inland. You can see that other sailboat that sits over there. There's a boat right in front of it. And then earlier today, that's where the National Guard was stationed, we're told again. They're the ones that are deciding exactly just how and when some of this debris is going to be moved. I can tell you that some of these businesses have already started, trying to clean up as much as they can. The folks there have taken down some of their pylons and some of their boarded-up windows, although it appears that the damage there is extensive. One final note from me. Five people were killed in Pinellas County yesterday, a number that is considerably high when you take into account the fact that this hurricane passed us to the north, right? It ended up to the north of us, and it was well over 100 miles out to the west. Dana?",

We had over 10 foot of storm surge in the Big Bend in some of these areas where like Taylor County periods. We had 10 foot of storm surge. That's massive amounts of water.So, what -- you know, the National Hurricane Center is doing unbelievable work, trying to educate people that don't just think about the wind, think about the water. In Florida now, most of what you die from is water, not from wind. So, what's happening is, is that -- it's a water coming in and just floods in and that sucks everything out, including you, if you stayed around. Let's think about Sanibel two years ago. So, you're right. Something it, you know, who -- you know, who knows what the reason is. But something is changing, massive storms, massive storm surge. So, we've got to figure this out, but -- and we -- but here's the positive. We're going to do it. We're going to build more resiliently. We're going to come back.
