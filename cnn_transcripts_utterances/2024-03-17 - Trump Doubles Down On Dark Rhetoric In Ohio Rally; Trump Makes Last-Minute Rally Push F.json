I'm Manu Raju. As we head into a new phase in the presidential race, that Trump campaign is scrambling to catch up to the Biden team's fundraising machine. Just this morning, Biden's camp announced bringing in an eye-popping $53 million in February alone, with a staggering $155 million in the bank. They say that's the most of any Democratic presidential campaign at this stage of the election cycle. Plus, the Biden team says an additional $10 million was brought in in the aftermath of the president's State of the Union Address earlier this month. Now, meantime, Trump is purging the RNC in trying to rebuild the organization, all as he faces mounting legal bills. Now, yesterday, Trump was back on the campaign trail in Ohio, where he was throwing red meat to his base, including some dark rhetoric about migrants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Instead, he was here to stomp for his endorsed candidate in the Ohio Senate primary, and that's a businessman, Bernie Moreno.But his trip was very -- his speech was very much a general election campaign speech and he went heavily after Joe Biden. And as you mentioned, Manu, we heard a lot of dark rhetoric from the former president as he tried to paint a doomsday picture of what the country would look like if he were to lose the election at one point while talking about the auto industry, he warned that there would be in a bloodbath if he did not win and reclaim the White House come November.

That's what -- that's what our colleagues are reporting. It's almost -- it's almost giving him an opening to bring back January 6. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Cue one of the defining themes of the Biden campaign, which is talking about protecting democracy. This is what he launched his reelection to bid on, and what he keeps bringing up in rallies. I've been to some of the presidents rallies across the country and he often kicks off his remarks, talking about January 6 and democracy and part of the strategy there is to remind voters who former President Donald Trump is, what happened in those four years. That's the concern among campaign officials, that people forgot what happened over those years. They forgot what happened institutions, what happened with the president's -- the former president's policies. And so this all plays into what President Biden is trying to do on the trail. And these moments, like the former -- like Trump's rally yesterday really crystallizes the general election for them. There -- he's essentially doing the work for them by using terms like bloodbath by talking about January 6, which then leads the Biden campaign to do their rapid response and to point to that as here are the dangers, if you were to reelect him again. It's not easy. This is going to be a tight race, but that's what they're banking on.",

We've also seen the younger base that typically turns out for Democrats. Biden has to work with them. And it is true and it's something that obviously the campaign and the White House, and we're seeing in Biden's remarks, people even something that I noticed during the midterm election, a lot of voters, though, they agreed with Republican policies when it came to the questions of January 6th, Trump's own rhetoric, that turned off a lot of people, really did give them pause to vote Republican.",

Now, but Trump's not the only one hoping for a Moreno victory on Tuesday, so are Democratic leaders who were betting his candidacy could give their incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown a much better chance at hanging onto his seat and help their party cling to power in the Senate. Now, one senior Senate Republican told me this was a, quote, bizarre situation in which a J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, and Chuck Schumer are all on the same side. My panel is back. So, I mean, Marianna, Trump had last cycle, didn't have the batch track or occurred, it endorsing candidates, you list of the candidates there on the street and several of them did not win, like Dr. Oz, Blake Masters, Herschel Walker. JD Vance, Ted Budd, they did in those states, but didn't take the Senate, which is obviously a big problem for the GOP. You know, there have been cycles past year where bad candidates, lackluster candidates, won in the primaries, then they collapse in the general election. Just a handful of them are on your screen there. I've been hearing about concerns that Moreno could be the same from some of those top Republicans, that same Republican that I mentioned in the intro said it is illustrative of some of the problems we've had in recent years with Trump dictating the nominations -- referring specifically to Moreno.

You know, one of the things I'm -- back to Ohio is as you're mentioning, Democrats trying to prop up Bernie Moreno. This is different. Republican leaders had stayed neutral in this primary.

Sitting Republicans are activelycampaigning to take out their own colleagues in primaries -- a major breach of protocol but one that underscores the bad blood within the House GOP conference. Now in at least four primary elections, Republican lawmakers are maneuvering to defeat their own colleagues and Speaker Johnson has had enough. He told my colleague Melanie Zanona at this past week's GOP retreat that he's told his members to cool it. It's not productive and causes division for obvious reasons. But as my new reporting with Melanie reveals, Johnson's warnings haven't changed the tide yet, especially with Florida firebrand, Matt Gaetz, who led the charge to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership in the fall. He skipped the retreat this past week and instead flew to Texas to rally (INAUDIBLE) candidate challenging incumbent Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales. It's the second primary that Gaetz has tried to meddle with in this past year. My panel is back. So I've talked to -- you know, Gaetz is not the only one. There are several others that are trying to knock other colleagues. I did talk to Gaetz about why he's doing this and why is targeting Congressman Gonzales? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
