In fact, we have a letter from the Marine Technology Society that was written back in 2018 and sent to OceanGate which expressed these very concerns very explicitly.They were concerned that OceanGates' marketing about the Titan advertise that the design met or exceeded industry standards when they said, in fact, OceanGate was not following the safety rules, saying. \"Your representation is at minimum, misleading to the public, and breaches an industry-wide professional code of conduct that we all endeavor to uphold.\" Now, this morning, Anderson Cooper spoke with the former co-founder of OceanGate, who although he did lead the company back in 2013, spoke very highly of the late CEO Stockton Rush and said that his risk -- he was a strong risk manager and believed in his ability to innovate. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUILLERMO SOHNLEIN, CO-FOUNDER, OCEANGATE: I had absolutely full confidence in Stockton in the design of the sub and his ability to engineer it. And most importantly, to take it through a rigorous test program. So, I had absolutely no qualms with it. What I do have qualms with is the fact that so many of us in a rush to get answers to our questions are starting to speculate without waiting for all of the data. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Wanting to come to the United States to get a good -- a better paying job is not a reason for asylum. And so what Joe Biden should be doing is talking about how do you streamline legal immigration. Why is he not going to do that? Because he -- like he says himself, he's the greatest you know proponent of organized labor in history. And big labor does not want to see a guest worker program in the United States. So, the court case doesn't have any impact on the fact that Joe Biden has policies that are actually encouraging illegal immigration. And that's the -- that's what we should be talking about, and articulating what we would be doing differently in this -- in this -- in this -- to deal with this crisis. And guess what? It's not -- it's no longer a Southern border problem. We're having a Northern border problem. And this is something where you look at the number of people that have come into the country that are on one of these terrorist watch lists, there are hundreds that have come through and been found coming through our Northern border, and you have fentanyl and it's coming to the Northern border.
