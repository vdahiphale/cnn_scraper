Many called for the war to end and some expressed confidence that Ukraine would win. With Russia constantly threatening to erase Ukraine's historic identity, many Ukrainians are embracing their heritage as a precious thing which must be protected more than ever.

Russia's Wagner mercenaries say they've captured a village near Bakhmut but Kyiv is not confirming that.Meanwhile, Ukraine's military got a boost from its allies, receiving the first batch of Leopard tanks from Poland. Sweden and Germany also promising more tanks. So as Ukraine marks the anniversary, its allies are turning up the pressure on those who support Russia's war effort. On Friday, the European Union slapped its 10th round of economic sanctions on Moscow. They're targeting people and entities who, among other things, deliver military drones to Russia and spread Russian propaganda. The U.S. announced new sanctions on more than 200 people and entities worldwide and targets who helped Moscow evade existing sanctions, especially related to arms trafficking and illicit finance. Russia's financial sector and military supply chain will also take a hit. The U.S. also says it seized about $0.5 billion  in assets from Kremlin supporters who helped Russia dodge sanctions. They include yachts, planes and properties all seized over the last year. For more on this, we're joined by Tom Keatinge. He leads the Center for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute. He's speaking to us from London. Thank you so much for being here with us.

So I think we're going to have to pay a careful diplomatic game with China. On other countries such as Iran, for example, frankly, I think we can expect to see the West go much harder on sanctions on countries like that, that continue to support Russia; on countries that are offering financial services, like the United Arab Emirates. We, I think, can expect to see more pressure from the West on those countries. So I really think that, as we enter the second year of this war,  we will enter a new phase in the sanctions war.

Friday, the number of lives lost rose over 50,000 for both countries. Nearly 6,000 were in northern Syria; the vast majority, 44,000, were in Turkiye. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from Turkiye.Nada, where are they now in the timeline of that massive rebuilding effort?",

The union of Turkish engineers and architects say it's simply too soon. There needs to be further geological investigation and preparation to assess the risks in the area, particularly because this area lies on a huge faultline. And there are concerns about further earthquakes and aftershocks. Some places online have been centered around the potential for strong aftershocks. We already saw one, 6.3 magnitude on Monday. In fact Turkiye has continued to see these aftershocks at a lower scale for the last three weeks now. There is a significant amount of concern here. But of course, with elections looming, President Erdogan's government is also under mounting pressure to find a long-term solution for this disaster. There are some 900,000 people currently living in tents. We visited some of those camps; many of the families that we spoke to still haven't been given a tent. They are still waiting to have that temporary accommodation. Some families sleeping on the street. And I have to say it gets quite cold at night. Many of them with young children. Others have been put up in other temporary accommodation, including a cruise ship, which is now taking in people that have been displaced by the earthquake. These are all short term solutions. And it will take months, if not years, for the Turkish government to be able to rebuild this area, despite that pledge to have it rebuilt within a year. You can imagine the concern that is growing for the potential for the construction work not to be suitable for a zone that has clearly experienced earthquakes in the past. And it could still for experience further earthquakes. For those that are in camps, they want a long-term solution but for the homeless, all they want right now is a tent. Kim.",

There are 18 people running but realistically, according to the opinion polls, there's only three men who could be the next president of Nigeria. People with their bikes; I guess they are on the way to cycling and just want to make sure they vote before that happens. This goes all the way back to see the number of people excited about voting for one of these three men, who are most likely to be president of Nigeria. But I want to hear from some of the people who are voting in this election, because one of the major issues has been about insecurity. That is the top issue for many voters in this election, has been followed by one Lagos-based company. They said people worry about that. The economy is going through a rough patch right now, almost on the verge of collapse. There's been in recent weeks a cash shortage and a fuel shortage, which makes it difficult for people to get basic necessities. There have been chaotic scenes at banks and at gas stations. So that's in the back of the minds of people that come to vote in this election. I want to hear from Wandu (ph). Good morning, how are you? Did you vote already?

But we hope that one of them at least, we know who we all want to be on the podium and take us where we need to get to. MADOWO:  What does the next leader of Nigeria need to do? We've been talking to CNN about how many people are (INAUDIBLE), leaving the country, escaping to better pastures in North America and Europe. What can the next leader of Nigeria do to turn that around? WANDU (PH):  It's the economy. You need to make it for the private sector. The private sector needs to have a larger hold on what's going on. That's the only way you're going to get investments. People, their numbers in relation to our population, is still small. There are lot of people and opportunities. We have human capital that can do so much. But we just need the government to give the platform for the private sector to work and revive the economy.

That's the more than the registered voters in the next 14 West African countries combined. So the independent national electoral commission points out that every time Nigeria goes to vote, instead of organizing an election for all of West Africa and parts of central Africa. This is only one of 140,000 polling units across the nation. Polls are open for six hours and after that they begin the collection exercise. We don't know when we will know the winner of the presidential election but the electoral commission say they will do it speedily. Speedily could mean a couple days, a couple more days, we don't know. We'll have to wait and see, Kim.",
