      "sentences": "Well, she is very much trying to regain the initiative on the issue of the economy, that issue you were just talking about, that is at top of mind for so many voters. And what you'll see her doing today, she is going to a brewery outside of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, really trying to focus on the issues of small businesses and entrepreneurship. And what she'll announce is a proposal that would increase by tenfold the small business tax deduction, businesses able to deduct $50,000 in startup expenses, and her goal is to really dramatically increase the number of small business applications under her administration, her prospective administration.She is also planning to propose cutting various red tapes and regulatory burdens, really in the hopes of demonstrating that she is pro-business, specifically pro-small business. And of course, this comes after she unveiled the first part of her economic plan a few weeks ago, focused on price gouging, bringing down costs for Americans. That came under some intensive criticism from Republicans, who said it amounted to price fixing, said it was overly populist. And I think, taken together, today's proposals and the proposals from a few weeks ago give you sort of a fuller sense of the type of economy that a President Harris would try and oversee. And so, what you'll see her to do today is to try and really sort of focus on that. I think it is something of an open question of why she is doing this in New Hampshire. That's not traditionally one of the battleground states that we're talking about. It's voted for the Democratic nominee for President for the past 20 years. It had been slipping somewhat when Joe Biden was atop the Democratic ticket. Polls show it's somewhat firmer now. I do think it demonstrates that she is not taking any electoral votes for granted heading into November.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, I think the big part of this and the big picture to keep in mind is that, at this point, when I talk to Donald Trump's advisors, they believe that the race is finally setting -- settling, and that, of course, comes after several weeks, about two months of a very tumultuous period, particularly for the Trump campaign, when Biden had ended his campaign and Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee and then officially the Democratic nominee at the convention last month.They have recognized and have been frustrated with the enthusiasm and the surge kind of around Kamala Harris ever since she became the person at the top of the ticket. They have noted that she had a lot of momentum behind her. But now, they're arguing that that has changed, that her quote, unquote \"honeymoon phase\", as the Trump campaign refers to it, is over, and now it really is go time for these two candidates. I do want to read you some of what they said. This memo was written by Donald Trump's co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. They wrote, quote, \"The state of the race is clear. With just nine weeks until the most consequential election in American history, the Trump-Vance campaign has the momentum.\" It went on to say, \"Do the Democrats and voters realize this? Or does the mainstream media, in its attempt to manage public opinion and continue the quote 'Harris honeymoon' report a version of reality that is at odds with the facts? So, not only are they trying to argue that they have the momentum here, but that also they believe that the media isn't doing right by Donald Trump. Of course, a frequent gripe that we hear from the Trump campaign. But, really, I think when you pair it all back, their argument is really that they are -- this election is very close, and that Donald Trump has a lot of momentum behind him too. And for his part, I mean, you walk through all the polling at the top of this hour, this race is very close, yes, but also it is pretty stunning how Donald Trump has been able to sustain and endure his support throughout this entire election cycle, particularly when you saw that change from Biden no longer being his opponent, and a lot of that momentum going behind Harris. So, they laid that all out in his memo, and I think you'll see some of that. He is going to have a town hall later tonight in Pennsylvania. You'll hear Trump talk about that, and you will also see that on the debate stage next week.",

She is a Senior Political Correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, and Tyler Pager, White House Reporter for The Washington Post. Good to see you both. Molly, let me start with you, because one of the things that I thought was so surprising by this new polling is the number and the percentage of likely voters who are still undecided, about 15 percent. Molly, what do you think that tells us about the candidates and just how Americans are still feeling right now?",

On the one hand, Trump has been a known political quantity for a decade, a celebrity even longer. It's Harris who is relatively newer. Are these voters that she perhaps is uniquely situated to capture because she is newer, and perhaps voters still don't really know a lot about her?",

      "sentences": "I think both campaigns see these voters as an opportunity and the opportunity to win this election. They are the ones that are going to decide this. Both campaigns have made it clear this election is going to be very close. It was close last time, and the same sort of voters in states are going to ultimately decide this election, likely by smaller margins than we saw in 2020.And so, I think Trump, the campaign, his aides and allies, see this as an opportunity to define Kamala Harris, as Molly was just talking about. They see this as their project for the next several weeks, to focus on Kamala Harris' record in California, paint her, in their view, as a part of the left wing of the party, whereas Harris and her team see this as an opportunity to define her using some of the popular elements of Joe Biden's accomplishments and legacy and reposition her as the heir to Biden's administration and policies that are overwhelmingly popular in many of these states. And so, I think both campaigns are trying to sort of navigate this very unique moment that we're in, whereas Molly said, there has been this monumental change at the top of the ticket, that is, changing the way that voters think about this election. But, I also think part a lot of these voters fall into the category that pollsters use to describe them as double haters. These were the voters that did not like Joe Biden and did not like Donald Trump, and they were trying to look for an alternative or maybe sit this election out. Now that there has been this shakeup, this is an opportunity to recalculate and recalibrate their view of the election heading into the next final few weeks of the campaign.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the campaigns have a different theory of the case about who and how these independent voters are, and how they can reach them. The Trump campaign has clearly made a bet that there are a lot of younger male voters sitting on the sidelines, and you saw a lot of the messaging at the Republican Convention aimed at that type of voter, hoping that someone like the Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance has an ability to speak to those voters, hoping that this sort of testosterone-fueled display that we saw with Hulk Hogan at the RNC does something to arouse those voters.There is -- we do have some data indicating, though, that a lot of these undecided voters are younger and female, and they may be down on the Biden administration for its handling of the economy, but they may also tend more toward the Democrats' position on abortion rights. That's certainly the theory of the Harris campaign that is working very hard to make the abortion issue as salient as possible, launching a reproductive freedom bus tour this week, for example, hoping that some of those undecided voters will come off the sidelines if they see that there is one campaign that is working very hard to protect abortion rights. SOLOMON: Tyler, let me let you have the last word here, and talk to me a little bit about the -- what appear to be these differing strategies from the campaign. So, you had James Carville, the famed Democratic strategist, who said in The New York Times yesterday that Harris can win if she does three things, and among them is let Trump be Trump, and casts -- continue to cast his insults at same old tired playbook, obviously her words, and that if she can convince voters that she is the breath of fresh air, she might be able to win. Trump has said he thinks he actually needs to fight back. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The sources say that the Justice Department will announce actions in response to the alleged Russian operation. In the past, Russia has denied similar allegations of election meddling.All right. We want to get to some breaking news just into CNN. Official U.S. sources say that an American service member has been detained in Venezuela since last week. They add that the American was not on official travel or approved leave in Venezuela. The U.S. State Department does warn against traveling to Venezuela because there is a high risk of wrongful detention. I want to get to Stefano Pozzebon, who is in Bogota, Colombia.

So, really a few days ago. And of course, what is caused most concern for U.S. administrators and officials who spoke with us is that he is an active duty. Like we have in the past, there are several cases of U.S. citizens detained in Venezuela. Two of them were, for example, former Green Beret. But, this is the first time at least in the last few years that an active duty member of the U.S. military has been detained in Caracas. And we know that they're going to try to do all they can to bring him home as quickly as possible.This, of course, is happening in the meantime -- amid growing confrontation between Maduro and -- the Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, and the White House. Just this week, the U.S. seized Maduro's personal plane in the Dominican Republic as a measure of retaliation for the crimes that Maduro has allegedly committed, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Clearly, the fact that Maduro now holds in his power a U.S. service member, makes everything more and more complicated. But, this is a story that we're trying -- we got confirmed both from here in Bogota and in Washington, D.C., and there is visual (ph) in front of our eyes, and we'll come back to you, Rahel, as soon as we hear more from our sources.",

There is new reporting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu effectively put an end to a draft hostage and ceasefire deal in late July. A document obtained by an Israeli newspaper shows that the Israeli Prime Minister introduced new 11th hour demands. The document now confirming what CNN has reported that those demands included Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor. That is still a key sticking point in the negotiations. A diplomatic source said Wednesday that there will be no deal as long as Israel and Hamas do not settle the dispute.Meantime, the U.S. Justice Department has filed criminal charges against six high-level Hamas officials over the October 7th attacks. Now, the charges were originally filed in February. However, they were kept under seal in case the U.S. had an opportunity to arrest any of the six. An official said that with half of the Hamas leaders charged now dead, it was no longer necessary to wait. Let me bring in CNN's Nic Robertson, who is live for us in Tel Aviv.

But look, Yahya Sinwar, who is on that list, the head of Hamas, the guy who came up with the October 7th plot -- plan and execution, he is in a tunnel in Gaza. So, this doesn't reach him. Khaled Meshaal is a very senior figure. He was a sort of international spokesman -- well, international leader, if you will, of Hamas for many years. I've interviewed him many times, and he is pretty much domiciled in Qatar. He has been looking at Turkey as an option. And the other person listed who is alive is based in Beirut for Hamas.What this potentially does is shut down senior leadership figures of Hamas having free movement and possibly bank accounts that are associated with them. But, it -- what it does is it prevents Hamas having its ability to project its voice internationally by having people based outside of Gaza, and this was something that was discussed behind the scenes and very early after October 7, a way of sort of neutralizing a neutering Hamas by telling them that they could no longer live in these cities like Doha, in Qatar, and Beirut and other places. That was actively being worked on. But, of course, as many parts of deals fell apart, that didn't happen.",

More than 50 percent of the personnel in the cabinet was going to be replaced, the leadership of this country has said. Dmytro Kuleba, of course, by far the most prominent so far to have tendered his resignation.But, if we look at in total what's been going on just over the past, I would say, 24 to 48 hours, there has been three government ministers who have set in -- who have put in their resignation, two deputy Prime Ministers as well, and the head of the property fund of Ukraine. Now, one of the things that is still going to happen, Rahel, is that the Parliament of Ukraine is going to decide on the actual resignations. There has already been two of these ministers where it's been denied for them to resign. On the Foreign Minister, no decision has yet been made, but essentially, what Volodymyr Zelenskyy is saying that he is trying to do is strengthen the team around him for what he believes are going to be key weeks and months ahead.

The mayor of Lviv coming out and saying that 70 houses and apartments had been damaged by these missiles.But, of course, the fact that Russia is also striking in the west of Ukraine is definitely something that has NATO, of course, watching very closely. The Poles in the past have scrambled fighter jets when there were strikes in the western part of the country. Recently, there was a drone that somehow appeared to have gotten lost on a Polish territory, of course, also very concerning for that country as well. The Romanians in the past have said that Russian missiles have actually traversed parts of their territory, as has Moldova. And so, definitely, this is something that is seen as being quite dangerous because, of course, it is so close to NATO's eastern flank, but definitely also something that rattles the population on the ground there, and certainly the Ukrainians say, make it even more obvious that they need more and better air defense weapons, Rahel.",

But, we think about what Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said recently, to paraphrase, that further cooling of the job market is not welcomed. That's exactly what we got in the JOLTS report, not only with the shortfall with respect to expectations in job openings, but also a downward revision in the previous month.Now, we should also sort of level set here that we're really talking about a data that is fresh as of the end of July.

And so, to your question, what we're expecting, essentially, is a slight improvement in the unemployment rate, back down to 4.2 percent. Remember, we rose two tenths of one percent to 4.3 percent, and we had a significant shortfall in the number of jobs added, with just 114,000 jobs added to payrolls in that reading. And so, the consensus, along with what I just mentioned with the unemployment rate, is that we get a bit of a bounce back with respect to payroll gains, probably something on the order, at least in terms of the expectation, about 150,000 to 175,000 jobs added. But, of course, the average so far this year has been slightly abovethat. And we also think about the fact that we had the benchmark downward revision with the number of jobs added over a 12-month period recently where we paired 800,000 jobs out of what had earlier been reported. So, all of this does mark further, I would say, normalization of the U.S. economy. We have to acknowledge the enormous disruptions and distortions that occurred, leaving the health and aspects related to lives from the COVID pandemic. There was the shutdown of the U.S. economy that took the nation's unemployment rate up to close to 15 percent in April of 2020 and then we had the unemployment rate fall to 3.4 percent in April of last year. So, this does mark further balancing of supply and demand of labor. But, of course, workers want to have the strongest hand possible. And so, for those that are thinking about job security, for those who are looking for work, there is reason for a concern here, because we are seeing further cooling in the job market.",

We hadn't asked that question before. So, we don't have a benchmark to sort of align that with, but that feels high to me, and it was a majority of members of Generation Z as well as millennials who indicated they plan to look for a new job in the next 12 months. Will the jobs be there for them to take? We will see. I doubt that we'll be able to have every person who would like to have a new job find one, even if we just sort of hold the line on where the unemployment rate is right now. And that might be optimistic.I think it's all reflective of the historically high inflation we experience, which essentially stole buying power out of workers' pockets. Rahel, you probably, I think, reported on the fact that wage gains over the last 15 months have actually exceeded the recent rate of inflation. So, we are sort of recapturing some of that buying power, but the damage was done. And so, that improvement is obviously a welcome and will take some time to fully restore, if it does.",

But, for any individual who is unemployed or underemployed, they're not focused on what the macro picture is. They're focused on their own personal finances. And so, that's incredibly relevant and important. I think more broadly, it's quite clear that the narrative we're hearing from Corporate America is that consumers are pulling back from where they can. When it's a situation where the likes of both Starbucks and McDonald's are talking about seeing lower sales, lower foot traffic, that's pretty instructive with respect to the overall health of the consumer.But, it's very much a K-shaped economy, and that really speaks to the division of wealth and income, and that continues to be the case. But, even luxury has begun to show some signs of not throwing in the towel, but cooling. And of course, at the same time, we have incredible gains in the assets that are associated with home ownership. The stock market, yes, going through some ups and downs lately, but the major averages are still near record highs. And so, we are adding a lot to assets, but that assumes that people have those assets to begin with, and not everybody does. Not everybody has the savings account to draw from.",

But, what it sounds like to me is sort of trying to find this balance between cooling versus distress, whether you're talking about consumer spending, whether you're talking about the labor market, and the Fed, of course, trying to just get it just right, just right, not distress, but perhaps a little bit cooler from the red hot labor market we saw, and obviously prices.Mark Hamrick, great to see you.

J. BROWN: Exactly. We had no idea the conversations we build. HUEBNER-BROWN: Like what's the blue dots? And then -- and that's the important part, because as soon as you start the conversation, you have a full conversation. ZELENY (voice-over): Ruth Huebner-Brown and her husband, Jason, are suddenly having more conversations about the blue dot, symbolizing a Democratic island in a sea of Nebraska red and the state's unique way of dividing electoral votes. J. BROWN: It's plausible that we could have a tie, and that whole notion of, oh, my vote doesn't matter, kind of gets really tossed out the window, because this could be it. This could be the deciding factor. ZELENY (voice-over): For all of the pathways for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to reach the White House, the race for 270 electoral votes could come down to Nebraska's sprawling Second District. And here is why. If Harris carries the three blue wall battleground states and Trump wins the swing states across the Sun Belt, a single electoral vote surrounding Omaha could keep the race from becoming a 269-269 tie, decided by the House of Representatives. GOVERNOR TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, hello, Nebraska. ZELENY (voice-over): A not so secret weapon for Democrats could be Tim Walz, who was born and raised here before moving two states away to Minnesota. Tony Vargas believes the Harris-Walz ticket will also help Democrats win control of Congress, starting with his race here, which is among the country's most competitive.",

That's about 40 miles from Atlanta. Local media showing students assembling on the football field, as we see here, and at least one person being put into a helicopter on a stretcher. Now, a source at a local hospital tells CNN that they are receiving patients with gunshot wounds related to the incident. But again, at this point, state police only telling us that they are actively at the scene, as we learn just how large the police presence there is, and it looks like students on the football field there joining hands in a circle, perhaps, comforting one another, perhaps, in this moment.Let me now bring in from Los Angeles, Steve Moore. He is the CNN Law Enforcement Contributor and retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent. Steve, good to have you. Just walk me through some of your initial questions. Obviously, there are many, because there is a lot that we still don't know. STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR, &amp; RETIRED SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT, FBI: Right. Law enforcement and FBI agent responding, police officer responding, is going to want to know where the shooting took place, if it took place in a -- an office, say, or a teacher's room, something like that, as opposed to a classroom. The targeting of the location is important. What I want to know right this second is, do they have the shooter in custody? I would make the assumption that they do, because they wouldn't have students milling about on the field if somebody was out there with a firearm that they didn't know the location of.
