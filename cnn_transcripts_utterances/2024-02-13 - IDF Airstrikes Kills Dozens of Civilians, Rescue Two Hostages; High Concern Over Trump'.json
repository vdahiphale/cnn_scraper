I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, Israeli officials show no sign of changing course on their planned ground offensive into Rafah, even as international pressure mounts. Plus, NATO hits back after Donald Trump's threat to abandon the alliance. And a CNN exclusive how Russia is recruiting thousands of men from Nepal to fight on the front lines of the war in Ukraine. Thanks for joining us. Israel's prime minister is calling the rescue of two hostages from the southern Gaza city of Rafah a perfect operation. But the deadly airstrikes that came at the same time are adding to concerns about a potential ground incursion there. The IDF has released this video showing the hostages with Israeli troops after they were freed and before they boarded a helicopter to take them back to Israel after more than four months in Hamas's captivity. Benjamin Netanyahu is praising the soldiers involved in that rescue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translation):  A perfect operation, a perfect execution. And I want to tell you how proud I am of you. I'm proud of you, of the Shin Bet, the IDF. You work together like an oiled machine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The problem that Israel faces, and they know it very well, is that the Hamas forces are basically interspersed among the civilian population, for one.For the other part, they are also in essence sharing the same living spaces and working spaces as the civilian population to a large extent. Of course, in addition to what's already built around Rafah and what's still standing, you have all these tent cities that have been set up by the people that have come, the refugees that have come from the north and the center of Gaza to Rafah in an effort to escape the fighting.",

Arguments that have already been rejected by four federal judges arguing that their client has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution. But we know in addition to the legal arguments, the strategy here is really delay. Try to use anything they possibly can to get this trial pushed until after the 2024 presidential race. And here they're asking the Supreme Court to pause that appeals court ruling while they exercise some of their options. They said they'd like to go to the Supreme Court formally and ask for an appeal. They might go back down to the appeals court, seek a full panel review down there, anything they can do to push this back a few days, a few weeks in the hopes that Jack Smith will not be able to bring this case before the presidential contest because if former President Trump is reelected, he, through his attorney general, could fire Jack Smith and make this case, as well as the Mar-a-Lago classified documents prosecution, go away. Now, what happens next? Well, the Supreme Court could do pretty much anything they want. They have a lot of options here, but it's widely expected that the chief justice will set out a schedule allowing both sides to weigh in. The special counsel expects it to weigh in pretty quickly because they're trying to move this along. But legal experts' sources in and around the Trump legal team say they would be surprised if the Supreme Court were to actually take up this case. They're already contemplating a historic case covering ballot eligibility and whether Trump can appear on the ballot. They say they'd be surprised if they took up this case too. This is also expected not to be as strong for the former president, not as likely to succeed at the high court. So as is the mantra for 2024, all eyes on the Supreme Court, not just for how they handle this, but for how quickly they weigh in and move this along. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.",

At least, directly, it seems that it doesn't have any major implication in that sense. That being said, of course, it's part of an alarming trend, where, if Donald Trump, as the presumptive nominee, of course, as the president of the United States, makes those kinds of comments that are essentially incentivizing those kinds of coercive threats from the Russian president, then that's certainly not good for anybody. It makes it more likely that the Russians might actually try to test that threat and result in a clash or even basically a form of coercion that leads to war fatigue and less support for the Ukrainians.

But even though he did go for that meeting, we did see a divide between what the two leaders wanted to see.We heard from President Biden just then saying that he was concerned about an operation in Rafah and wanted to make sure that there was a credible plan to try and evacuate civilians who have already been evacuated a number of times from other areas of Gaza to a less dangerous area. But what we heard from King Abdullah went a lot further, saying that he wants countries to be continuing to give money to the U.N. body in Gaza, which is helping humanitarian aid, and also he wants a full ceasefire.

So Israel is saying that they will have a plan to evacuate those to a safer area. That plan has not been given by the Israeli military to the government at this point for approval.

Well, President Widodo, who can't run again, is now backing him. And Jokowi's eldest son is Prabowo's running mate.
