The IDF says the three sons were operatives in the armed wing of Hamas guilty of terrorist activities. CNN though cannot confirm that. Hamas say several of Haniyeh's grandchildren were also killed when their vehicle was struck in a northern Gaza refugee camp. They were returning from social visits marking Eid al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan.Haniyeh, who lives in Qatar released a statement saying such killings will only make Hamas steadfast in its principles. Adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice. And after months of life threatening shortages of humanitarian assistance, Israel's defense minister says there are now plans to, quote, flood Gaza with aid. He made it clear that decision to ramp up humanitarian assistance was due to pressure from Washington. Meantime, the Israeli agency which handles the inspection and delivery of that aid, essentially what's goes in, what's comes out, has blamed the U.N. for failing to distribute the assistance once it gets inside Gaza, saying hundreds of trucks are waiting to be picked up by the U.N. agencies. He goes on to say to the U.N., do your job, focus on distribution and stop blaming Israel for your colossal failures. U.N. Humanitarian Affairs Office has accused Israeli authorities of restricting access to many parts of the Palestinian territory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS LAERKE, SPOKESPERSON, U.N. OFFICE FOR COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS: And when you put up statistics with numbers of draconian saying, look at all these hundreds of trucks going in, and you put it against, look how few trucks have actually moved around with a disc -- with distribution? Well, it's kind of an old goal, isn't it? Because half of the convoys that we were trying to send to the north with food were denied by the very same Israeli authorities. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The remaining convoys were denied by Israeli authorities 40 percent, postponed 20 percent, impeded 11 percent or withdrawn due to prevailing restrictions, security concerns or operational constraints.On top of that, Israeli forces have also opened fire and killed Palestinians lining up for food and other supplies.

And civilians cannot access aid safely, because of the ongoing bombardment and the Israeli airstrikes and shelling, in order for us to scale up aid to the levels that are needed right now, in Gaza.

That only came about by dialog, negotiation, by sitting at a table, by all voices being around that table. And actually having the conversations about how you can end conflict and move forward. I and many like me are so grateful for the gift of peace that we have been given by our Good Friday Accord. And we have much to celebrate. We're a society that has been completely transformed over the course of our peace process. And we have much, much more to do of course, but nobody could fault at all the transformation of the island of Ireland actually, throughout the periods since 1990s to where we are today. And I think unfortunately we too know the cost of conflict, but we equally know the value of peace and I think what we watch every day in terms of the things and some of the programs, some of the footage you've just shown is horrific. Six months on, this slaughter continues. Six months on, we need to see an immediate ceasefire. We need to see dialogue. We need to see humanitarian aid medically and we need to see a political solution.

And I'm committed to that, I believe that both of us want to do our very, very best for the people that we collectively serve.
