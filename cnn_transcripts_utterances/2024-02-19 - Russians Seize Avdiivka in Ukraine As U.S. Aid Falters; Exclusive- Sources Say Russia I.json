      "sentences": "Vladimir Putin may be the most mentioned leader in Washington this weekend. Russia has overtaken anotherUkrainian city as Joe Biden vows to get Ukraine more ammo. Trump is turning to sneaker sales, as he rails against a judge's ruling, forcing him to pay more than $350 million in penalties. And Kamala Harris is meeting with governors, Congress people, even celebrities, as she tries to break the Biden campaign bubble. Good day, everyone. I'm Kristin Fisher to our viewers watching all over the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington, Monday, February 19. Presidents' Day here in the United States. And there are just five days until the South Carolina Republican primary, only 259 days until Election Day, and this is today's STATE OF THE RACE. So, right now, the United States and its allies are struggling to unite around a strategy to counter Russia as the Kremlin seizes on divisions in the West. You have Russian troops raising their flags in Avdiivka after Ukrainian troops withdrew and U.S. aid stalls in Congress. This as U.S. President Joe Biden is vowing to get Kyiv the aid that it needs. The Ukrainian say the invaders are massing troops in other critical locations, and Russia's military ambitions may not end on this planet. There were warnings last week, Moscow was trying to develop a nuclear space weapon, and we have exclusive new details on the project. Sources say it is a satellite killer that could cripple commercial and government spacecraft in orbit. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Russian President Vladimir Putin is being blamed for the death of one of his chief opponents, Alexey Navalny. Navalny's widow, Yulia, is vowing to continue his work after her husband died in one of Russia's penal colonies. All right. So, we're going to dive in to all of this with today's panel. We have Laura Barron-Lopez, a CNN Political Analyst and White House Correspondent for PBS NewsHour; Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic Strategist. He was a Senior Strategist for Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. Alice Stewart, a CNN Political Commentator. She is a Republican Strategist and former Communications Director for Senator Ted Cruz. And of course, we have CNN Reporter Katie Bo Lillis who helped break that story about the Russian space nuclear weapon on Friday. Katie, before we get to that, I want to just go back and talk a little bit about the Republican response to the news that Russian President Vladimir Putin in some way, form, or fashion, had a hand in the death of his chief opponent Navalny. And I'd like to start by what Liz Cheney, the former congresswoman, said about really what this means for the Republican Party. Let's play that soundbite, and will get your take on the other side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: When you think about Donald Trump, for example, pledging retribution, what Vladimir Putin did to Navalny is what retribution looks like in a country where the leader is not subject to the rule of law. We have to take seriously the extent to which you've now got a Putin wing of the Republican Party. I believe the issue this election cycle is making sure that Putin wing of the Republican Party does not take over the West Wing of the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, he also posted this on Truth Social, and then we'll get your take on the other side. He says \"The sudden death of Alexei Navalny has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our Country. It is a slow, steady progression, with CROOKED, Radical Left Politicians, Prosecutors, Judges, leading us down a path of destruction.\" And he goes on a bit from there.

He essentially said that it's absurd that the U.S. would walk awaynow right at this critical moment when Ukraine is running out of ammunition. Laura, you cover the White House. I'm curious what you thought of the President's remarks over the weekend, and if there is anything more he can say or do to get this funding bill passed, if that's what he thinks is in Ukraine and the U.S.'s best interest. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, &amp; WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"PBS NEWSHOUR\": Well, President Biden has done almost everything he can do to try to get this passed. I mean, he even came to the negotiating table to agree to a border deal with Republicans, and then Republican said, never mind, that they didn't want to be a part of that anymore. And he did that so that way he could get Ukraine aid passed and Israel aid and Gaza aid. Republicans backed out of that. So then, he went along with the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's plan, which was they were going to pass what they could. They did. But now, House Republicans are saying they don't support that, that they don't want that, that they want to add some border back to it. But, again, you see this hardline group, Freedom Caucus group, in the House Republican Conference that is essentially saying it's their way or the highway, and a lot of them don't want to give any aid whatsoever to Ukraine. So, it's going to be really difficult for the administration and for the Republicans who want to see that aid passed, get it passed at all.",

But, it's certainly been floated as a theory. And Katie Bo, I just want to talk to you a bit about this other big news from last week that Russia is developing a space-based nuclear weapon. And we were able to figure out on Friday exactly what that is. And it is a nuclear EMP, a nuclear electromagnetic pulse. And essentially, what it is, is a nuclear weapon in space that when detonated would send out highly charged particles, electromagnetic particles, and it would essentially fry all of the satellites that we depend on here on Earth, those satellites in low Earth orbit that are dependent upon for our communications and making ATM transfers and things to operate everyday life. So, Katie Bo, we know what this space weapon is now. But, why now? Aside from Turner making it -- putting it out there in the public space, what is the intelligence behind it in the sense that, why is the U.S. government worried about it right now?",

As we've said, this is a tremendously serious threat, and action needs to be taken. And we need to stop talking about pointing fingers at who put out what information, when, and do what the best we can to declassify this information, talk about it, and do what we can to prevent this from taking shape, and protecting Americans first and foremost.

And the question this fall is going to be, do we want an unstable Donald Trump as chief -- in the presidency, or do we want somebody who with the experience and stability of Joe Biden? And I think that's what these events really, really put on the table for the electorate this fall. BARRON-LOPEZ: When you talk to veteran U.S. diplomats, people who are even ambassadors to NATO, they will say that this is serious, that Trump saying and encouraging Putin and essentially saying, if you were to go beyond Ukraine, go ahead. I'm not going to stop you. They've told me that could essentially lead to another world war. And that if the U.S. thinks that we won't eventually get dragged into it, then that's probably not a wise viewpoint. And essentially, that European allies are starting for the first time since World War II having to tell themselves, OK, we need to build up our defense system in a way that we haven't since the last World War. And that's something that you heard a lot at the Munich Security Conference and the Biden administration, Vice President Kamala Harris trying to reassure allies, but, of course, they're certainly frightened that if there is a second Trump term that they will have to be on their own facing Russia.",

Now, they are supportive of it because it made him $4 million in two days. I think the idea that this is going to somehow pay for his legal fees is laughable, given that he owes more than $400 million in fees.

But, it does give you a bit of a flavor, Laura, for how this could really be energizing his supporters and his base. BARRON-LOPEZ: It's certainly energizing for his base. And every time he has been indicted, that has energized his base. But, I will say that the bigger question is, is it energizing for the broader electorate come the general election? And I don't think that it necessarily is because of the independents, the disenchanted Republicans that I've spoken to. Yes, President Biden has an enthusiasm problem with his Democratic base and his coalition. But, there are those swing voters, some that voted Trump in 2016, voted Biden in 2020, and the ones that I've checked in with don't see anything in Trump world that they can go back to. And a lot of them cite January 6. They should cite the continued election lies which his campaign is primarily based on, and the conspiracy theories that Alice was talking about Trump saying that the entire judicial system, whether it's federal, but also local DAs, state DAs.

I think he has done that over four years. Now, over the course of the campaign, which is what Ezra was talking about, he has got to demonstrate that in the campaign, and I think that's the challenge.",

This is about Joe Biden's age and is only getting worse for him, and we're seeing this time and time again. Democrats and liberals who would normally be supporting him are not supporting him, and they're raising these serious questions. Look, I do believe that there needs to be pierce in the Biden bubble. It does not need to be Kamala Harris. She is the last person that could come forward with any meaningful information. She was in charge of the border. She didn't succeed there. She was in charge of election integrity. She didn't succeed there. I do think she has a strong role, and what Democrats could really campaign on, and that is the abortion issue. She started this Reproductive Freedom Tour.
