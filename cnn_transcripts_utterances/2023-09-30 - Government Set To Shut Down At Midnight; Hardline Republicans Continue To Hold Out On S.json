And some of those notices already went out this week to some or to a lot of the workforce, including personnel at the White House who also received instructions as to whether they're going to be furloughed, what that looks like, and who would be considered essential.At a practical level, that looks like senior aides learning the jobs of junior aides to try to get by if they're furloughed. Now, in terms of the impact, there are several agencies who are preparing for change here, including, for example, the Small Business Administration would not be able to process new business loans, there would be delays in long-term disaster recovery efforts. There's a risk of millions of women and children going without food assistance, as well as federal workers and active duty troops not getting paid over the course of this shutdown.

So, you're not resolving anything. You're not making this negotiation any easier.

So many warning signs. So, there are encouraging signs. We do talk to members on a bipartisan basis all the time. They understand the problems. But when you look at some of these things that are grabbing the headlines, the discussion about the government shutdown isn't making any progress on how you'd actually fix the overall problem unless they include something like a commission and start talking about the bigger real issues that are really hanging out there because we've been avoiding them for so many years now.",

We know there's a lot of contractors at the NSA and what have you. Let's talk about credibility, though, because I did mention this off the top.I mean, I'm sure Americans at home are just, you know, rolling their eyes, saying, OK, here we go again. You know, our lawmakers are not lawmaking. They're not doing their jobs. But also, when it comes to credit worthiness, right? I mean, last month we were talking on air about Fitch downgrading the U.S. credit rating to double A plus. Moody's is now issuing a warning. And by the way, when Fitch downgraded the U.S., they pointed to exactly this, the repeated debt limit political standoffs, eroding confidence and fiscal management. That's what, that's what Fitch said. Now, Moody's could, perhaps, at some point, make this move. Does that concern you?",

The fact that two of the three major rating agencies say that our creditworthiness is no longer the top of the bunch, and a third one is warning it could change, and they're pointing to two issues. We have an unsustainable fiscal situation, and we have a governance structure that isn't working.So, it's hard to see how we maintain our role in the world, frankly, if this continues for too long. In the more immediate run, every time there's a downgrade, there's a risk that that pushes up the borrowing costs. We still need to borrow a lot of money. People are going to charge us more to do that. And because our debt is already so high, every time interest rates go up just one percentage point above what they're already expected to be, that adds about $2.7 trillion in our borrowing costs over a decade. So, in just a few years, even if those rates don't go up, we'll be spending more on interest payments than we are on national defense. The fact that that could continue to increase because of our bad credit worthiness, that is a real cost to all American families.

And what's supposed to happen is there are essential personnel, which would be all of air traffic control, air traffic control maintenance, licensing, hazmat, accident investigation, and all contractors that keep all the equipment running, they're supposed to be on the job.Now granted, the federal employees are on the job without a paycheck until at the end of the furlough, then the government goes ahead and pays them, and that's how it's always happened in history. Now, that's what's supposed to happen. It's supposed to continue working for all essential employees. What really does happen is after a while, things start coming apart. It's a furlough time. The regular rules don't apply. People call in sick. People get tired of working without pay. Things slow down. There's a high absentee rate. There's a high sickness rate. So, things start generally falling apart. But technically, that's not supposed to happen at all because if you're deemed essential, you're supposed to get to work, you're supposed to be the good air traffic controller you always are and you're supposed to function. And remember at the FAA, there will be 25,500 employees still at work. So, that's a lot of people that will do their jobs. But -- and remember the TSA is not part of the FAA.

Most of the heavy rain is really focused over portions of Rhode Island and Connecticut. But you've also got some heavy rain making its way across Massachusetts. You've got some around Newport, Rhode; Island, Bridgeport, Connecticut starting to see a little bit of a pickup in that rain and even Oyster Bay in New York. So, again, it's going to be often on the bulk of the rain today, I want to emphasize is going to be late. We're not expecting the crazy five, six, seven-inch amounts that we had yesterday. But there are still some flood warnings in effect. Again, not necessarily for the new rain today. But it takes time to get rid of all of the rain that fell yesterday. For example, JFK setting an all-time record yesterday, picking up over eight inches of rain. Valley Stream, New York, picking up over nine. And many other locations, not just in New York, but Connecticut, also picking up, five, six, even seven inches of rain as we went through the day yesterday. So, again, still some rain expected as we go through the morning. The bulk of this rain really starts to push out to see once we get to lunchtime today. And then, finally, by tomorrow, a nice day from start to finish with some sunshine in store. However, we are still expecting maybe an additional one inch of rain on top of what they've already had.",

According to progressive think-tank, The Century Foundation, more than 70,000 child care programs could close across the U.S. without those funds, and by their estimates, that will leave more than 3.2 million children without a place in a child care program. Joining me now to discuss what they call a child care cliff is Julie Kashen. She is a senior fellow and director for Women's Economic Justice at The Century Foundation. Really appreciate you joining us this morning. First off, give us those numbers again, because it is really astounding to know how many people will be hurt when this pandemic era program will expire. Let's talk about the number of families and childcare centers, and of course, those people who work at these childcare centers. JULIE KASHEN, SENIOR FELLOW, AND DIRECTOR, WOMEN'S ECONOMIC JUSTICE, THE CENTURY FOUNDATION: That's right, so what we expect is that 3.2 million children across the country could be impacted by the loss of this funding. That will impact their parents, who will be forced to make really tough choices about leaving work, cutting down their work hours, shifting their shifts around, and it will impact the entire economy. And we've estimated that it could impact the economy to the tune of about $10.6 billion. I think what's important to know that -- is that, even before anyone had heard of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents were already breaking the bank to afford child care or stuck on long waitlist, because there just wasn't enough child care. So, this pandemic era funding made a huge difference in stabilizing a sector that had long been precarious before. When this money goes away, we expect that the impacts will be serious, although, they won't happen all at once.",

So, that made things even worse for them. What they were able to do with this money was paid for their operating costs that net rent and utilities, pay for safety and health equipment. And the biggest part was paying higher wages for early educators. They created bonuses and stipends so that the wages could go above what was previously about $14 an hour. This made a huge difference for recruiting and retaining a great workforce to care for our kids.",

But what they are going to have to do is raise prices first to make up for the lack of this funding.We already know childcare jobs are down 40,000 before the -- since before the pandemic. That means that there is already a staffing shortage in childcare. So, in order to get more people into the sector, they're going to have to raise wages, which means raising prices. That's what we're going to see first. Then, we'll likely see them serving fewer children or shutting some classrooms. And then, a last resort hopefully will be actual closures. However, we've already seen in Wisconsin 40 -- week. So, the impacts are already starting to be felt.",
