WALSH (on camera): Do you think there were good enough fortifications here? OLEKSANDR (through translation): Nothing was prepared here. Nothing. Just nothing. All the positions are being built by the hands of the infantry. The Russians are trained professional soldiers. We can see it from their equipment, from their tactics. WALSH (voice-over): There were eight airstrikes just in the last hour, so we leave soon. A buzzing noise near us, very close, and the only way they know whose drone this is, is if it attacks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Is it your drone? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Who knows? (GUNFIRE) WALSH (voice-over): All around Kharkiv, they don't have enough guns and the Russians have too many drones. The 92nd Assault Brigade show us something that isn't even theirs. (on camera): Russian artillery piece that they captured in the first year of the war in the fighting in Kharkiv region. And now they use, strangely, French mortar rounds to fire from here. It's just a sign of how little appropriate ammunition they have available to them. This wire is a protection from FPV drones. (voice-over): Above. Above. He sees a drone with two battery packs, a long- range scout. (on camera): Run. Basement. (voice-over): It is not friendly. If you can tell, it's an attack drone. Hide. This seems to be a scout. So, running is better before it calls in shelling. Another artillery unit wants to show us something not even Russian, but Soviet. Made in the 1940s, it can still fire newer Polish shells. In the autumn, it was a hundred a day. Now it is 10. (on camera): Extraordinary to see something here that's three times the age of either of these two guys holding back a new Russian offensive in 2024. I say the metal is so old that that limits the number of times. (voice-over): That sound warns another drone is incoming. And back in the bunker, they show us the online bought $30 gadget that is their best warning mechanism. (EXPLOSION)",

And they're here to collect the bodies. (CROSSTALK) (voice-over): A seven-month pregnant woman was among the seven dead here. Another body found later. Just fragments in the mulch.

And people who are objecting to Justice Alito and Justice Thomas are, in fact, doing that. That is exactly what Justice Alito and Thomas are doing. They are creating an appearance of partiality and politicalization of the court that clearly affects the respect the court has and affects their ability to have the respect of people around them to enforce their edicts and their -- their opinions. Remember, the Supreme Court doesn't have an army. It is the fact that people, in fact, respect what they say and believe in their legitimacy in interpreting the Constitution that makes them effective. And if, in fact, people don't believe that, then the court loses its legitimacy. And that's exactly what is happening here. And I think that Senator Cruz, having served as a clerk on that court, knows better than what he's saying and what some others are saying. They know full well what's happening here.

CO2 gets sucked in but so does the heat.When you make the heat in the ocean so high, then, all of a sudden, that's what the fuel to the fire is here. And 85 percent chance above normal, because the water is so very warm. Aside, El Nino and La Nina, that has nothing to do with climate change. It's always there. But it's the hot water that's going to be out there making these numbers quite scary.",
