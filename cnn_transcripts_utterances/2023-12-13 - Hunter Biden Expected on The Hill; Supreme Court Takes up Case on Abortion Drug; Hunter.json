Not clear whether that is a statement he will make before going in to testify to this House committee or a statement he will make to say he is not going in to testify to that House committee.The committee has called Hunter Biden -- this is part of the impeachment probe -- not into Hunter Biden, again, although you would be forgiven for thinking so, an impeachment inquiry into President Biden that so far has struggled to find any benefit whatsoever that President Biden received from Hunter Biden's questionable business dealings. The committee has called Hunter Biden to testify. And, again, we are expecting to see Hunter Biden on Capitol Hill shortly. Lauren Fox is on The Hill. Lauren, what are you seeing right now?",

Obviously, House Republican chairman had scheduled this deposition behind closed doors. They were prepared with questions. They were prepared this morning just in case Hunter Biden showed up.But it is important to point out that this all comes as the House Republicans are expected to vote later today to open an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden. That is an inquiry that has been going on since the former speaker, Kevin McCarthy, announced it in the fall. But this is a step to formalize it. So, there's a lot of things happening on Capitol Hill today for House Republicans when it comes to this impeachment push. You heard yesterday from Mike Johnson as he pointed out that a vote today on the impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean Republicans would move forward with impeaching President Biden. He said they had to collect more evidence, get more information. But, obviously, John, this is all building as pressure continues from House conservatives to move forward.",

We're going to have much more ahead because, as I said, events unfolding before our very eyes. So, stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:36:52] SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: All right, we have breaking news for you now. First, the breaking news from Capitol Hill. That podium is where we are expected to see President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, come up to the podium and make a statement. Now, you'll remember he is in Washington, in part because the GOP has put together an investigation, they are looking at an impeachment inquiry into his father, and they wanted him to do a deposition behind closed doors today. We do not know if he is going to do the deposition, but we do expect him and his attorney to come to the podium to make a statement. We will bring that to you as soon as we get it. Now, to some other breaking news, this at the highest court in the land. The Supreme Court has now decided to take up another case involving abortion. This one involves the widely used perhaps most popular abortion drug out there known as Mifepristone. CNN's Paula Reid is joining us right now. This is a big deal. The Supreme Court has decided to take up the case in the first place. What can you tell us, Paula?",

      "sentences": "That's right, this is significant, and this is something that could be decided possibly by July, which would put this decision right in the middle of the presidential election cycle. And here the Supreme Court said it will consider whether to restrict access to the widely used abortion drug Mifepristone, even in states where abortion is still allowed.Now, the case concerns the drug Mifepristone which, when used with another drug, is one of the most widely used abortion methods in the United States. But, again, the really key thing here is that this puts the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, once again, right in the middle of the abortion issue when just last year, of course, they overturned Roe v. Wade. And this would potentially put this issue, and whatever they decide here, right in the middle of the election cycle. So, this is going to likely be one of the biggest cases that they take up this term. And, again, Mifepristone is available right now, but this decision could change that.",

Would this decision by the Supreme Court sort of take that away? REIDtalking about, you know, close to a quarter of a century for this drug having been approved. And that's actually one of the ways that they've tried to attack this is undermine the actual approval to restrict access to this drug. But we'll see what the Supreme Court decides, how they approach this, after they, of course, hear arguments and make their decision.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, look, I mean, Hunter Biden is here, obviously, on the Capitol grounds and he could just walk right across the street there to where the House Republicans say they want to depose him behind closed doors. What he's saying he's doing - he's only willing to do is to do a public hearing, which he says is something that the Republicans were once open to, but are no longer offering.Of course, this means that the Republicans who are sitting there at 9:30, they were expecting him to show up there for this closed-door deposition, what this means is that they will move forward. We expect them to move forward with their threat to hold him in contempt of Congress. That's a process, obviously, that's going to be drawn out. And, in the end, really this is -- this was all part of a show. Hunter Biden kept them guessing whether he was going to show up, whether he was going to show up over on the House side. He's over here on the Senate side in an area, by the way, that's colloquially - locally known here as the Senate swamp. That - this is where he chose to come to provide that statement. You heard him really for the first time in his own words answer many of the questions that have been sort of thrown around by Republicans, by conservative media about his financial activities overseas, his work with the Ukrainian company, his work with Chinese businesses, all of which, of course, Republicans say is -- there is some proof, they believe, that there is some kind of corruption that's tied to the president of the United States. That's why, of course, we expect later today that they're going to formalize -- they're going to formalize their impeachment inquiry, again, part of this ongoing investigation. So, in the end, they are not going to get Hunter Biden if they insist on getting him behind closed doors. One other thing, John, it's become obviously a lot more complicated in the -- since the time that the Republicans subpoenaed Hunter Biden to appear. He was indicted last week, nine counts, including three felonies, failing to file taxes, filing false returns and tax evasion. Those are the problems - some -- those are the things that he just referred to during his time he was struggling with addiction. But what you heard there for the first time in his own words, really the most fulsome explanation from Hunter Biden about his - his problems, his financial problems, his addiction problems and everything really that has now turned into a political problem for the president of the United States, his father.

      "sentences": "We are waiting to see how Republican chairmen respond to that ask by Hunter Biden and his team there. I think it's important to point out that this was the line that Hunter Biden's lawyers had been making for some time, right, that they were willing to come before Congress in a public setting, that what they did not want to do was go behind closed doors, have a deposition and then their concern, they said, was that parts of that, selectively, could be leaked.So, one of the questions now becomes, what do Republicans do? I also want to point out, though, that in the larger context of this moment, and I think Paula really pointed this out, you have a son of the sitting president of the United States who House Republicans are going to vote today to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry into. You have him coming forward and talking about his troubles. You have him talking about his dad's love for him, talking about how all his dad has done at this point is supported him, that there is no link to his dad benefiting financially from any of his business dealings, that no matter how long Republicans are going to investigate they will not find that evidence. It's also important to point out that this has been sort of a sensitive political issue for Democrats, as well, because some Democrats in past reporting that me and our colleague Annie Grier (ph) have done have worried that the White House, that the president wasn't being forthcoming enough about getting out there in front of Hunter Biden's legal issues, talking about them more publicly, trying to separate the president from them. And I think that this is really an interesting moment for Democrats as well because this sort of provides them a road map for talking a little bit more about the fact that Hunter Biden clearly is getting out front of some of what he has said he's done in the past and yet also arguing his dad was not involved. So, I think that that is going to be an interesting political moment for Democrats in the larger context of what House Republicans have planned today on Capitol Hill.",
