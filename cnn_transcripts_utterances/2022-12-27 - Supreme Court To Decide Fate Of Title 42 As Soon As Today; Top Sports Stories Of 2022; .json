Not only 16 years in federal prison, but it will be concurrent on both counts. So the sentence will be served together after that, however, five years of supervision once he's out.While he's in prison, substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment. And once he is out, he cannot have a firearm at all. He cannot have any type of weapon on his person or in his possession at any time. And then that mental health treatment has to continue, and the probation officer will have to monitor that mental health and substance abuse treatment as he goes forwards in his life.",

This as the Supreme Court weighs the fate of Title 42. A decision on the Pandemic era immigration policy could come down at any moment. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is following this story for us. Priscilla, I know we keep talking about Title 42. Some people may not be following this story so closely. First off, tell us what Title 42 did in effect and what a post Title 42 southern border would look like.",

      "sentences": "Well, Title 42, to remind viewers, dates back to March of 2020. The onset of the Coronavirus pandemic is a public health authority that was invoked by the Trump administration and allowed border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or quickly return them to their native country, all on the basis of public health. Now, it has been criticized for years. Immigrant advocates and public health experts said that it was essentially a pretext to just keep migrants out, many of whom may be eligible for asylum in the United States.Now, we're at the point where it could go away. And what that means is essentially a return to protocols that existed for decades before this authority came to be in March of 2020. That means that migrants who come to the border are processed and they're either released into the United States while they go through their immigration proceedings, detained or returned to their native country. Now, as the anticipation has built up on whether or not this authority goes away, migrants have been coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. We know that approximately 22,000 migrants are across just three cities in Northern Mexico waiting for what happens next because they would no longer be turned away in the way that has happened since the pandemic began. Now, what is the Administration doing? Well, the Department of Homeland Security says that they are setting up temporary facilities, scaling up air and ground transportation, cracking down on human smugglers and working with NGOs as they have been doing in El Paso, which you see there. Of course, this has been a concern for the administration primarily that when Title 42 lifts, there would be a surge of migrants, and they have been preparing for that ahead of when it could happen.

Now, Tagovailoa played the entire game Sunday. The Dolphins head coach said he is not sure when the quarterback, excuse me, might have suffered a head injury, but there's been focus on a play where he fell to the ground. Tagovailoa got a concussion back in September in a game against the Bengals after being sacked. He laid on the field for several minutes and was taken off on a stretcher. Earlier this season, the NFL updated its concussion protocols to mandate any player who showed symptoms of a head injury had to sit out the rest of the game.From the Olympics in Beijing to the world cup and Qatar, 2022 was a remarkable year for athletes on and off the field.
