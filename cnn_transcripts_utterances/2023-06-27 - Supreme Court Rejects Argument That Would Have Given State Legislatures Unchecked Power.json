Rules, we should note, that would be decided by potentially partisan state legislatures. The theory, you might recall, was bolstered by backers of the former president following the 2020 election. CNN's Jessica Schneider was at the Supreme Court earlier today when this decision came down. Put this into context for us, Jessicas. Why is this case so important?",

BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: This week, severe summer storm are wreaking havoc across parts of the U.S. and that includes causing quite a mess at some of the busiest airports in the nation. Thousands of flights have either been canceled or they have been delayed all over the country today. And it is the fourth straight day that passengers have been stranded. United airlines hit especially hard here. Now the company is pointing fingers at the FAA. We have CNN aviation correspondent, Pete Muntean, joining us. It looked like summer travel was off to a decent start. But here we are.",

So stopping flights going to the airport. And also a ground delay program for flights going to Newark. And this is having this nationwide trickle- down effect. And we know when there are big delays and big cancellations, it takes airlines, in some cases, days to recover. I just checked FlightAware, 2,200 delays nationwide, 1,105 cancellations. United taking it really hard on the chin, 533 delays, 402 cancellations. We're talking about two in every 10 of its flights. One in five of its flights. That's a big impact. The real issue is that this is really impacting United in Newark, New Jersey, and that is a place where so many United flights fly in and out of. And we're seeing the problems on the ground there in Newark. We are seeing people sleeping in cots in some places as far away as denver. They can't get hotels. United's CEO, Scott Kirby, came out pretty hard against the FAA in a memo last night, an internal memo, we obtained here at CNN. He says, \"The FAA, frankly, failed us this weekend.\" He points to these problems at FAA, air traffic control facilities on Saturday and Sunday, really compounded by the weather. So we're layer upon layer of issue here. And he said that really led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions, as well as crews and aircraft out of position. So we're seeing the deck of cards coming tumbling down in some ways. And let's set this against the backdrop, Brianna, of what will be a huge weekend for summer travel. July 4th right around the corner. The TSA said on Friday there will be so many people flying, about 2.8 million people.",

It details multiple failures that led to Epstein's suicide.And for the first time, we're also seeing photos of his cell. Now, some people may find them disturbing so we do want to warn you first. Remember, the 66-year-old was found unresponsive in his cell with a noose around his neck just weeks after he was arrested on charges of sex trafficking minors. The medical examiner ruled it as suicide. But his death sparked a rash of unfounded conspiracy theories. This DOJ report found no evidence of criminality. CNN's Kara Scannell joins us now live. Kara, bring us up to speed on the details in this report. Do you think it will be enough to finally stop the incessant questions surrounding suspicions over his death?",

      "sentences": "Boris, that is the big question here because conspiracy theories have been abound since Epstein died on August 10, 2019, just several weeks after he was arrested on the sex trafficking charges.What this report finds through interviews is that -- and looking at some of the evidence that they uncovered in this, was that the problems here began several weeks before Epstein's death, that it was even late July where Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. It was then that the Psychiatry Department said he needed to have a cell mate. It turned out that just before he died, he did not have a cell mate in his cell. That person was transferred out and they didn't replace him. That enabled them -- the situation and the opportunity that this report found that created the ability for Epstein to then die by suicide. He was also able to stockpile bed linens. You can see from the photo of his cell that was taken the day he was found, he has numerous orange bed linens, blankets, sheets, that they said he was able to fasten into nooses, more than one, that he was able to use to hang himself. And that the guards, who were supposed to be doing 30-minute checks -- Epstein was in a special housing unit known as The Shoe. This is where, every 30 minutes, do a prisoner count. This report determined that beginning at 10:40 p.m. on that night before, until 6:30 a.m., when he was discovered, they didn't do any checks. And the guards had falsified records to suggest that they were. So a number of shortcomings. They didn't have video in place to give a live feed into the area where the guards were, where they should have been able to see if the video was working, what Epstein was up to in that cell. So a lot of issues there. The big question of the criminality, I mean, it showed there were no defensive wounds from the medical examiner's report. No evidence of a struggle. The report finds that all prison staff members interviewed by the OIG said they didn't know of any information suggesting that Epstein's cause of death was something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible information that Epstein's cause of death was something other than suicide. The report saying that the problem here really hurt the victims of that fiend because they weren't able to get justice -- Boris?",

You can smell it. You can taste it. I spoke a short time ago with Juan Rojas. He's a lung doctor here in town at Rush University Medical Center. And he says the air quality here in Chicago right now ranks among the world's worst. He's been practicing here for a long time and he says he's always concerned about his patients, but never has he had to worry about the air quality here in Chicago. But it's not just here in Chicago. It's also across the Great Lakes region. So if you are in this area or in the Great Lakes region, doctors are warning to limit your activity outside. Take a short walk instead of a long run or a bike ride. It's the summer in Chicago, but it's gray and hazy here today -- Brianna?
