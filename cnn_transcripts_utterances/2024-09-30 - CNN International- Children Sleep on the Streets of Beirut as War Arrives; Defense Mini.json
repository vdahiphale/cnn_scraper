Just ahead a CNN on the streets of Beirut as Israeli airstrikes continue in the Lebanese capital. We bring you the stories of civilians trying to survive.Plus, washed away by Helene, whole communities in North Carolina are without power as rescuers struggle to reach those in desperate need. And Donald Trump back on the campaign trail today, why both Republicans and Democrats are denouncing his recent comments about Kamala Harris. Hezbollah is vowing to fight on and choose a new leader, while Israel is striking more Hezbollah targets in Southern Lebanon, just days after taking out its leader. Also, for the first time since war broke out on October the seventh, air strikes hit deep into the heart of Beirut. The Lebanese capital is on edge after the first Israeli strikes within city limits. You can see the chaos near the city's Cola bridge, the major intersection. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment. Here's a look at some of the damage in the daylight hours, the barrage of strikes prompting Syrian refugees who once came to Lebanon to flee violence to return home. The U.N. says at least 100,000 Lebanese and Syrians have crossed into Syria. 1 million people have been displaced, according to Lebanon's Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Israel confirms that it also carried out airstrikes more than 2000 kilometers away in Yemen on Sunday. Israel's Defense Minister says the strikes in Yemen show that for Israel, quote, no place is too far. A Palestinian group says three of its members were killed in the Beirut airstrike. CNN's Ben Wedeman filed this report from the Lebanese capital just a short time ago.",

Now, many of the people who left the southern suburbs moved to areas like this because they thought it might be safer. Clearly, that's not the case.",

What advice are people getting about what they should do, where they should go in the midst of all of this?KARADSHEH (on camera): Well, you know, Max, the government is saying it's trying its best to set up shelters. There are about 170 or so that have been set up those schools that have been turned into these displacement centers. But when we were at one of those yesterday, people were coming in, and there was just no space for them. You've got multiple families sharing one classroom, and so some people say it's better for them to just stay out on the streets than get crammed into these centers where there's not enough for everyone. And it's not just that, Max. The fear is that we are now looking, according to the government here, at up to a million people who have been displaced in a matter of days. No one expected these numbers. I mean, one minister was telling me a few days ago that back in 2006 during that Israel Hezbollah war, they had about 6 to 800,000 people who have been displaced. But right now, you have Lebanon facing its biggest ever internal displacement crisis, and the government just doesn't have the resources to deal with it. So, they are trying their best, but they are coping with these numbers. They're continuing to grow, and the fear is you are going to have so many more. I mean, that strike that Ben was reporting on that really sent shockwaves across the capital. A lot of people very worried seeing that you now have a strike taking place outside of the southern suburbs for the first time during this war. And a couple of days ago, we heard from the Israeli military's Arabic language spokesman putting out a warning in a post on X addressed to all the people of Lebanon, while specifically addressing the people of the southern suburbs, Southern Lebanon and the east where these operations and these airstrikes have been concentrated. It was also a message to the entire population, telling people that they have to stay away from Hezbollah facilities. People don't really know where Hezbollah facilities are. So that's absolutely terrifying for the population. And it also sends a message, along with these strikes, where you see it expanding beyond the southern suburbs, that there might be more coming. That other parts of the capital and other parts of the country might also come under Israeli bombardment, as we are seeing this war really widening right now. It is absolutely terrifying for the civilians in the city and across this country, Max.",

Now, the U.S. official did not detail exactly what Iran's attack might look like or the specific measures that the U.S. military is taking in preparation. But the Pentagon yesterday did say in a statement that if Iran or any of its partners or proxies tries to use this moment to target American personnel or American interests in the region, that the U.S. would respond in defense of their personnel. They noted that the U.S. military has significant capabilities in the region, including a carrier strike group. You have also heard from the Pentagon that they plan to increase their force posture, their readiness, readiness to be able to deploy in the region if necessary. On Saturday, President Biden convened a call with his national security team and Vice President Kamala Harris to evaluate the situation in the Middle East and also talk about the U.S. military readiness in the region. So right now, they are trying to take these potential steps in preparation, to prepare for all scenarios. If they don't exactly know what that might look like from Iran, or whether there might be something else coming from Hezbollah, but it all does come at a very precarious moment for the region, as President Biden you heard just there say that he wants to prevent all-out war in this region. Something that his administration has really feared and been working against since the start of the conflict nearly one year ago. Now, Biden also said that he plans to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon, though, officials have not detailed exactly when that will happen. But one area where the administration is still holding out some hope is that there can be some type of diplomatic solution. In this situation, you saw the U.S. and France, along with other countries, roll out what they thought was a plan to lead towards a 21 day cease fire between Israel and Hezbollah that quickly went away, even though U.S. officials thought Israel had signed on to it. Then Israel poured a little bit of cold water on that, and then moved forward with their targeting and killing of Nasrallah in Beirut just last Friday, the administration still insists that they believe that there is a diplomatic solution that they can achieve to try to get Lebanese and Israeli citizens back to their home safely. But it's unclear right now what the progress towards that diplomatic solution might be. But in the meantime, the U.S. is starting to make preparations in the event that they could be a potential attack by Iran, though they haven't detailed what that might look like, but also making clear the Pentagon over the weekend that they are ready to defend American interests and personnel in the region if there is any such attack.",

But I think it would probably be couched here in terms of an incursion across the border. And what would that incursion be intended to do? Well, every time we ask the IDF, are they going to push troops across the border? They say, we'll do whatever it takes to make it safe for our border communities, 60,000 people living on the northern border to move back. What does that actually look like? Some people have described that to me as perhaps creating a buffer zone along the border. So, the houses that Hezbollah uses to launch those quick and easy to use shoulder launch rockets that can't be intercepted by iron dome or anything like that, to hit houses just over the border. It would be to stop and prevent -- doing that? But, you know, history tells us, and I've heard this very senior officials as well. There's no such thing going into Lebanon as a limited incursion. It quickly becomes something else. But I think here it would be framed as something relatively small, not trying to send troops all the way to Beirut, because of the many failures through history Israel has had in trying to do that.",

And from my conversations with people close to Trump, that seemed to have struck a nerve. Donald Trump believes that she was fighting on his own turf. And really, all of the rallies and the speeches we heard from Trump this weekend really painted a dark picture of America. Again, Donald Trump often uses dark rhetoric, but he amped up these attacks in a way that we haven't seen in some time now. And so, I think it's very notable. But as for your question about how are people responding? We heard Republicans, allies of Donald Trump, publicly criticize those comments. We heard Lindsey Graham yesterday say that this isn't the right path, that Donald Trump should be prosecuting the case against Harris' policies and on the issues. We heard Tom Emmer, who has been helping vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, behind the scenes prepare for tomorrow's debate. He said this is not the right path. Donald Trump needs to be talking about the issues. But as we've seen with Donald Trump, he has been told this repeatedly from people within his own camp, and he doesn't take that advice. I asked him about this a couple weeks ago, and he told me that he believes that he's entitled to personal attacks.

The IDF continued to strike Lebanon overnight. Hamas, meanwhile, says its leader in Lebanon and his family were killed in attacks in the southern part of the country. And for the first time since the war broke out nearly a year ago, Israeli airstrikes hit within Beirut's city limits.

On Friday, there was an explosive stock market rally after China unveiled a major stimulus package, and on Monday, markets soared yet again.The benchmark SHANGHAI Composite rose about 8 percent the Hong Kong HANG SENG added over 2 percent and SHENZHEN shares surged nearly 11 percent. Mainland markets will be closed tomorrow through October 7th for the Golden Week Holiday, and markets here in Hong Kong will reopen on Wednesday. Now, data released on Monday shows China's manufacturing activity contracted for the fifth consecutive month in September. But on Sunday, big moves are made to revive the property market. China's Central Bank said it would start cutting existing mortgage rates before the end of October, and three Chinese megacities, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, eased curbs for home buyers. China has been facing a number of economic challenges, including weak consumer spending, a property slump and rising local government debt. And for months, economists had been asking the government to do more to boost the economy, and Beijing appears to be heeding that call. Last week, China's Politburo, this is its top decision-making body, vowed more stimulus to reach China's annual growth target of around 5 percent and investors and economists cheered the news. In fact, Bruce Pang, he's a Chief Economist China at Jones Lang LaSalle said this quote, a pickup in government spending will probably be sufficient to drive a turnaround in business confidence, market sentiment and economic activities helping China to catch up with potential trend growth. The Politburo's pledge came days after China's Central Bank unveiled its most aggressive stimulus package since the COVID-19 pandemic. But this won't be a quick fix. It's going to take time for the stimulus measures to filter through, so investors may have to brace for more painful data ahead. Kristie Lu Stout CNN Hong Kong.",
