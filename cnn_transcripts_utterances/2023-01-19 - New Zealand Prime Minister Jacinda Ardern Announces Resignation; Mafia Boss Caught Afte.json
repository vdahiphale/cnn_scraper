And including, of course, the devastating 2019 Christ Church terror attacks when a terrorist targeted two mosques and ultimately, took the lives of 51 people and Jacinda Arden responded with compassion and decisive action. On the international stage, she has been hailed for her progressive views, for her strong leadership. Domestically, she had been facing some strong political headwinds. As for what's next for her personally, she says professionally, no plans yet.

He's been convicted in absentia on a number of crimes here serving multiple life sentences. This is the first time he was supposed to appear in court and he's chosen not to -- well within his rights under the Italian legal system. And he is represented by his niece who is a criminal lawyer, conveniently. So we're going to -- waiting to see and hear what's coming out of this court decision. This is actually the appellate level. Italy has a complex court system. Everybody gets three tries, essentially. First degree, in which he was convicted -- he gets an automatic right to appeal, which is where he is right now. And then the high court will rule on it. And there are a number of trials coming up. This is the first time. We do know he's very sick. We do know that he has cancer and he's been getting treatment.

Imagine you're getting ready to retire after decades at work only to have the government tell you not so fast -- you have to work another two years to collect your pension.CNN's Melissa Bell has more from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For 28 years, Enrique Moreira has carried the same equipment to work. But on Thursday, he'll take to the streets in protest over the two extra years the government wants him to spend working for his pension. ENRIQUE MOREIRA, CONSTRUCTION WORKER (through translator):  Living is getting more expensive, retirement further away. It's ridiculous. I can't go on. That's why we have to take to the streets and that's what we'll do on Thursday. BELL (voice-over):  French President Emmanuel Macron has unsuccessfully tried pension reform before. In 2020, he backed down in the face of street protests and the COVID pandemic. Twenty-twenty- three, he says, will be different. EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator):  This year will be the year of pension reform, which aims to guarantee the balance in your system for the coming years and decades. We need to work more. BELL (voice-over):  Currently, the French can retire at 62 or even earlier, in some cases, with a minimum monthly government pension of around 1,000 euros. Earlier this month, the French prime minister announced plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, with a full pension raised by an average of 100 euros a month. STEPHANIE RIST, MEMBER, FRENCH PARLIAMENT (through translator):  If we don't pass this reform, the books will not be balanced, which means that we will have to lower the pensions of retirees or increase the contributions of working people, thus producing the purchasing power of the French. BELL (voice-over):  Pension reform has been derailed in the past, in 1995, under then-President Jacques Chirac. It also faced stiff resistance under Macron's two predecessors. FRANCOIS HOMMERIL, PRESIDENT, CFE-CGC UNION (through translator): It's true that there is a strong symbolic value for the social model put in place after World War II. The political forces from the far left to the right came together to govern France and they created this model. It's our heritage, our wealth, and the French are incredibly attached to it. BELL (voice-over):  The hope of the unions on Thursday, that the protests will be as big as they were in 2010 when they claim more than three million people took to the streets of France.

It's become so expensive to produce because of the rising cost of buying cattle, animal feed, farm labor.And it's not just milk prices that remain stubbornly high. On average, groceries cost nearly 12 percent more than they did a year ago. Looking at markets around the world this Thursday morning, European stock markets are lower. Global recession risks still a nagging concern there. Asian shares closed mixed. And on Wall Street, stock index futures are leaning down after the Dow fell more than 600 points yesterday and the Nasdaq's seven-day winning streak ended.

But we have to remember as well as just inflation coming down naturally because of improving supply chains and hopefully, the food and energy side starting to improve as well.One of the reasons that inflation is coming is because the economy is slowing. And the economy is slowing because central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have raised rates very aggressively. In fact, it was the most -- it has been the most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s.

It is a possibility, absolutely.And as you said, consumers have been quite resilient to date. And the labor market, particularly, has been very, very strong with a 3.5 percent unemployment rate. It tells you just the significant strength. The concern, though, is that the labor market is typically the last indicator to react to the slowing economic environment. So it might be that it could be several months still before you start to see the labor market really show the impact of this weakness. It does, however, mean -- as you said, the strength of the labor market does mean that if there is a recession, that recession is unlikely to be anything like the great financial crisis. It should be quite short, so we're thinking about two to three quarters in length. That's the average U.S. recession. And it shouldn't be in any way as deep as what we saw during the GFC.

There's a lot of concern and panic right until the last minute and then, finally, it's passed. So we have to see that there's going to be something like that again.But I have to say the political risk this time around is a little bit more elevated. One of the concerns that we do have is that in order to get the debt ceiling past -- to be raised -- there are going to be so many concessions coming through. But it's very unlikely that if there is economic weakness coming through, as we anticipate, there will not be any fiscal help. So, no fiscal stimulus coming at a time when the U.S. economy really does need it.
