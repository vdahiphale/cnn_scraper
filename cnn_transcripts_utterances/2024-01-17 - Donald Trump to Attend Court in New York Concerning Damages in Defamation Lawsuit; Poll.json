But Ron DeSantis is the only one out taking questions from voters, talking to the press, and talking about the issues that ultimately matter most, not just to Republican voters, but to voters all across this country. That's the economy, that's immigration, school choice, the things that are top of mind that are going to ultimately decide the 2024 battle not just for the GOP nomination, but who controls the White House are going to be based on those issues.

You have got to be willing to roll up your sleeves, or roll them down in places like Iowa and New Hampshire where it's really cold and snowy, and get to work and block out the noise. And that's just what we did.We told everybody we needed to get a top two position out of Iowa to accomplish what we wanted, and we did that. Even after Nikki Haley spent a record amount, the most amount of money in this race, not only, you know, out of all three contenders, but more importantly, leveling $25 million of that towards Ron DeSantis in negative false ads. We got our ticket out. We went to South Carolina first yesterday morning to lay the marker that we are in this for the long haul and we expect to run a very aggressive campaign all across the palmetto state, and then we came here last night and spent some time with voters in New Hampshire, spent some time with Wolf on the stage, and we'll be back out at it today. And what I'd say our expectations are pretty straightforward. We're going to grind in every state for delegates. We will do it here in New Hampshire, we're going to go to Nevada where Nikki Haley is not even competing for delegates. We're going to go to South Carolina and do it, and on February 25th, the day that Nikki Haley ends up having to drop out of the race after she gets wholly blown out in her home state, it will once again be a two-person race as we predicted all along.",

Nobody in the summer thought Ron DeSantis was going to even be on the ballot the other night in Iowa, and not only was he, he was the second choice of Iowa caucus goers even after he's taken over $46 million in negative ads from both Haley and Trump. You've just got to stay patient. You've got to stay in the game.You're got to find your opportunities and opportunities to punch, pivot. And ultimately when you get a two-person race and Donald Trump across the entire country, not just one state on Super Tuesday, you're going to get a real chance to make some gains and show some wins and show some successes that are going to be meaningful.
