      "sentences": "Hello and warm welcome to our viewers in the U.S. and all around the world. I'm Max Foster in London, with our continuing breaking news coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas.Israel has signed off on a deal to release at least 50 hostages held in Gaza by Hamas, in the move that's bringing hope to families awaiting the return of their loved ones. The government overwhelmingly backed the deal after six-hour-long cabinet meeting. The hostages to be freed are expected to be women and children. In exchange, Israel will pause its campaign against Hamas for four days. Hamas says 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children, will be released from Israeli jails as part of the deal. Qatar delivered the proposal following weeks of continuous negotiations and says the start of the humanitarian pause will be announced within the next 24 hours.

      "sentences": "Well, more than 50 hostages held in Gaza could be freed over the coming days. After the Israeli cabinet approved that controversial deal to pause its military operations against Hamas and to release some Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.The Israeli government statement said it approved a pause in the fighting for four days, during which hostages, women and children, would be released. The statement added, the release of every additional ten hostages would result in an additional day's pause. It's the first time that Israel has agreed to ease its deadly assault on Gaza, which is estimated to have killed nearly 13,000 Palestinians since military operations there began following the October 7th Hamas attacks, during which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and nearly 240 were abducted. Israel insists it will resume military operations to destroy Hamas after the hostages are released. Hamas says Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian prisoners as part of the hostage deal, and to allow hundreds of trucks carrying relief, medical supplies, and fuel into the Gaza Strip. In a six-hour cabinet meeting to debate the deal, the Israeli ministers voiced concern that a pause in the fighting would allow Hamas to regroup and prevent Israeli forces from achieving their goal of destroying Hamas. But an Israeli government source told CNN that the deal was eventually approved by a significant majority. Matthew Chance, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I wonder what your sources are telling you about, a bit more detail about that deal. Do you understand anymore of the detail? ORY SLONIM, FORMER SPECIAL ADVISER TO ISRAEL'S DEFENSE MINISTER:  I think that if you know all the details and nothing is secret nowadays after the cabinet has approved it. I hope it will go quite smoothly as I was from the beginning of this month, I was against the stages. I insisted on having one stage for everything and not for long, this process for Hamas or even more. I think prolong the process is something very risky and I was against it by as it is now, I am blessing -- I am blessing the government for having a consent, not hundred percent, but having consent for deal. I think that bringing back children, babies, and their mothers is much more important than any other risk that we can -- I believe, we can afford.",

The international community must now seize the brief window of opportunity to generate further momentum for the diplomatic track, recognizing it as the only viable route to ending the conflict in both the short and long term. Qatar's statement earlier suggests that the pause will start within around 24 hours. And a statement from the lead negotiator went on to say: Qatar's priority now is to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected, and this statement includes the term, redoubling our efforts to secure a long term cease-fire, end the war, and work towards lasting peace through a comprehensive political process. Perhaps not a surprise that Qatar would be seeking a long term cease- fire in this statement. After all, that has been its position from the outset of this conflict. Becky Anderson, CNN, Doha.

That could also potentially include three year old Abigail Idan. She is an American citizen whose parents were killed in that October 7th attack by Hamas. The U.S. says they are working tirelessly to ensure the release of all American citizens who have been held hostage and they are hopeful that after this initial release, that  this could provide incentives for Hamas to release more hostages as well. But this all comes as the administration, the White House, has been in constant contact with leaders in the region as they have been working through these negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that President Biden himself had gotten involved and he believed the president had improved these negotiations. The president had spoken with the emir of Qatar twice last week, Qatar, of course, acted as a key mediator in these talks between Israel and Hamas. And now, the U.S. will be closely watching to see how many Americans will be included in this initial release. Officials say it will take about 24 hours to implement the deal before they can begin seeing these hostages released, but the White House certainly welcoming this news as they are hoping to get some of these hostages back home with their families.

Abigail has a sister who is six, a brother who is ten. These two children sought their parents both be murdered. They spent 14 hours in a closet on the 7th of October, hiding. The one thing we all hold on to is that hope that Abigail comes home, she comes home by Friday, Friday is her fourth birthday. And that's -- there is nobody that is giving up hope, it's just that we actually need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to be -- to believe it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
