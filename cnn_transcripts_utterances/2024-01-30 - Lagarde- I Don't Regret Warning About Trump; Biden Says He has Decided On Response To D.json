The best interviews, the moments wehave shared together, the markets, of course, we start with those as we always do. Up like a rocket and it is staying there, 137, up a third, the best of the day. Those are the markets and the headlines to bring to your good attention. Europe must be strong to prepare for potential harsh decisions from a second Trump administration. Our exclusive interview with ECB President Christine Lagarde. President Joe Biden says he has reached a decision on how to respond to the deadly drone strike on US troops. We are awaiting to see what he means. And unhappy farmers are blocking the key roads into Paris. We are live from London as we were 15 years ago. Today is Tuesday, January the 30th. I'm Richard Quest, and for the last 15 years, I mean business. Good evening. Tonight, the President of the European Central Bank tells me she has no regrets about her warnings on Donald Trump. I spoke to President Lagarde in an exclusive interview as the ECB reaches a turning point on monetary policy. She tells me while inflation is comfortably on the way down, it's still too soon for rate cuts. And Europe needs to get its act together to prepare for the possibility of another Trump presidency. She said she intends to remain in her position until she fulfills the bank's mandate, and that's getting inflation back to two percent. It was a good meeting we had at the ECB headquarters, and I pushed Madame Lagarde on when rate cuts from the Central Bank will be appropriate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Because the two goals you want to accomplish; one, to deter futureattacks that threaten the lives of US servicemembers in the field, three servicemembers lost their lives earlier this week. You want to deter those without, the administration says, broadening the war and there is an argument that those two things are antithetical because if the US responds more strongly, as it is expected than it has so far to a whole series of other attacks that weren't yet deadly, they will factor into that decision an Iranian response, which presumably might be larger than ones we've seen in the past. So you have an escalatory element, and you have a deterrent element and those two things are in fundamental conflict here. The other piece is this, Richard, is that it raises a broader question that is this approach to this current conflict failing, right? Of limited military intervention, surgical strikes, whether it be against Houthis, the Houthi rebels in Yemen for their attacks on shipping, the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria for their attacks on US servicemembers, Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, right, to prevent a front there. None of that is holding back the expansions of each of those conflicts, not quite to a hot war, but they're pretty darn warm, right?

They've attacked Iranian assets. Donald Trump ordered, in fact that killed a senior Iranian commander, but not on Iranian territory. So you're hearing some -- many in the Republican party saying he's got to hit Iran itself now. Well, fact is, a series of Republican and Democratic presidents have deemed that too escalatory, right? So, you know, the political sniping is happening. I don't know, of course, anything that happens this year is going to have a political element to it and it is going to be run through that filter.

So ultimately, what Neuralink is hoping to do is to use these implantation chips, these brainimplant chips, to connect human brains to computers to do things like helping people who have been paralyzed regain access to their limbs. He has also suggested that it could help people who have lost their eyesight to regain the ability to see. Of course, we have a long way before he's going to get there. This first human trial, we don't know very much about this person, about how it went beyond Musk saying that it is recovering well. And so it's a bit unclear at this point about just how significant this is ultimately going to be for Neuralink. Of course, getting through this implantation surgery is really just the first step in this larger testing process that the company is doing of the safety and efficacy of these brain implant chips. And so the proof is really going to be in what we hopefully are going to hear about how this person is progressing in the coming weeks and months -- Richard.",

The company has faced significant regulatory scrutiny over the past couple of years, as well as concerns that its procedures weren't necessarily safe for the animal subjects that it was testing on previously, but the company did receive FDA approval to begin these human trials. And I will say, too, that Neuralink is not the only company that's working in this space and it is a space where experts say there is a lot of promise to help people who are suffering from neurological issues.

We were at a blockade earlier, and I think, because I can't show you much of what's going on around from the sky up, your producers can show some of what we shot earlier. Some of those roadblocks that have been caused all over the country over more than a week now, but they've now been getting closer to Paris. This was one of the big auto who's leading into Paris that we were actually just a short while ago. The farmers then moved 15 kilometers up. We're following them to get towards Orly.

And in the words of one of the farmers we heard from earlier, to starve Parisians of their food by preventing anything from getting in to the city. So there are a great deal of anger out there. The farmers are really fed up about a number of things: European regulation, high taxes, the fact that cheap imports are competing with their produce, it's possible they say for them to earn a living. And all of that, as you say, is going to culminate in Brussels on Thursday, when this is taken to the European level.

The IMF says the storm clouds are beginning to part and it's upgrading its forecast for global growth, claiming the world's economies finally began a descend to the soft landing. Now inflation is slowing in most countries. And as we've already heard, central banks have signaled that the next move down, or the next move will be down, but exactly when and how is the unknown. Yes, and that still warns of possible turbulence, saying geopolitical shocks could lead to renewed inflation. Now, Christine Lagarde, of course, used to serve as the IMF's managing director before she joined the ECB, and she was well-known for her whether metaphors. She always used to say that you fix the roof when the sun shines. Now she says she intends to stay in her position until inflation returns to 2 percent in the euro area. So how is the decision made?
