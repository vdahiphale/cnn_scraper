I'm Kasie Hunt.It is 5:30 here on the East Coast where Maine is now the second state after Colorado to disqualify Donald Trump from its Republican primary ballot for president. Maine's Secretary of State Shenna Bellows telling CNN's John Berman last night the decision is based on the 14th Amendment of the Constitution that officials who, quote, \"engage in insurrection cannot hold office.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHENNA BELLOWS, (D) MAINE SECRETARY OF STATE:  And when we looked at the weight of evidence it became clear that January 6 was an attack not only on the Capitol, on government officials, but also an attack on the rule of law that it was an insurrection and that the U.S. Constitution does not tolerate an assault on our government -- on the foundations of our government.

A challenge based on the insurrectionist ban is also pending in Oregon. The California Secretary of State released a certified list of candidates just last night, opting to keep Trump on the ballot there. Let's bring in CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Joey, good morning to you. Thank you so much for being here. So, when the Maine Secretary of State was asked why she made this decision she said this. Take a look at that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is something that can be appealed.JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, it certainly can, Kasie. I mean, what I make of it is that this is what democracy looks like, right? You have 50 states that form a union and in those 50 states you have laws, rules, and regulations that must be abided by. Every state, remember, has a governor, has a legislature. That governor and legislature, independent from the federal government, set their own rules, processes, and procedures. And here in Maine, Kasie, you have the Secretary of State who is empowered by the legislature to make an assessment as to who is qualified. In making that assessment, what she did is she had a hearing where she heard views and issues pertaining to the matters before her and she evaluated that and considered. And in giving her considered judgment issued a 34-page opinion noting that the former president is disqualified because of the insurrection and number two, he engaged in an insurrection. And number three, based upon the totality of those circumstances he would not be qualified to appear. So she embraced her role. Call her partisan. Call her a Democrat. Say she should be disqualified. I read it -- the opinion and decision, which certainly to your point will be appealed -- no question -- but I read it as a very factual analysis with respect to those events, what they mean, and what Maine law required that you do. And in keeping with that she said you're out.",

And it's likely that the Supreme Court is going to have to weigh in on this.I think what really interests me is -- and you mentioned this, kind of, at the top, right? Fifty states each decide their own rules and regulations for conducting elections. And that's honestly a prerogative that the, particularly, conservatives have always been obsessed with protecting, right? They haven't wanted the federal government to be involved. But it seems like the Trump team is going to be saying to the feds basically -- to the Supreme Court -- hey, fix this. Override the states.

But I think the core issue is going to be what these states have viewed. And even lawyers aplenty will debate and have different points of view as to what the Section 3 of Amendment 14 means. But if any office applies to the president, which is an office, and if an insurrection, as this opinion noted in Maine -- Look, Kasie, it talks factually about what happened. Seven hours, 2,000 protesters, 175 officers assaulted, seven deaths. If it's not an insurrection the essence of the decision is then what is? And in terms of engaging in it, if you sow discontent in an election beforehand hand and distrust, if you're waxing poetic about how it's rigged, et cetera, and how it's the only way I can lose. So it will be interesting to me once it gets to the Supreme Court, which it will, what their conclusion will ultimately be as to what Section 3, Amendment 14 means. Did you engage in an insurrection? Should you have? And are you disqualified? It's going to get there. It's going to take some time but we're all going to find out.",

And the guy throwing that party was 38-year-old quarterback Joe Flacco. The former Super Bowl MVP -- he was sitting on his couch six weeks ago but has just had an incredible resurgence with the Browns. Flacco was great again against the Jets, throwing for over 300 yards and three touchdowns. The Browns would win big 37-20. They clinch a spot in the playoffs for just the third time this century. Now, we did have a scary moment in this game. Flacco found Elijah Moore with his pass right here and when Moore gets tackled his head hits the ground very hard and he appears to start seizing on the ground. You see his teammates were certainly concerned at what they were seeing and calling for help. Moore was able to walk to the sidelines on his own and he left the game. After that, the team said he was being evaluated for a concussion. All right. And elsewhere, finally, we did have the inaugural Pop-Tart Bowl yesterday between Kansas State and NC State and the reveal of the Pop-Tart mascot was pretty epic there. Kind of equivalent to when Taylor Swift pops out at her concerts. Now, at the end, we knew that the winning team was going to get to eat that Pop-Tart, Kasie, and we wondered how all of that was going to happen. Well, he went back into the toaster at the end and he popped out the side. Well done. And he was a frosted strawberry apparently and the whole team just got to go to town there at the end -- he has a winky face -- to enjoy that mascot for the very first time. I thought it was great -- the whole thing.",
