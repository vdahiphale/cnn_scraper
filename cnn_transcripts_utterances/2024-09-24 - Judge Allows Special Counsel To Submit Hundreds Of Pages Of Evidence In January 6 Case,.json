Exactly six weeks to the day before Election Day, new data revealing the strengths and weaknesses among different voting groups for Trump and for Harris. But did Vice President Harris just lose out on a key endorsement? A senator who backed Biden is telling her today, shame on you. Plus, the explosive report on a New York congressman in a tight race for reelection, revealing that he reportedly put his fiancee's daughter and his lover on the payroll. And a Missouri death row inmate just hours away from execution, even prosecutors are saying, however, he might be innocent. So why is the state's governor essentially saying, tough luck. Welcome to THE LEAD. I am Jake Tapper. And we're going to start with a major development breaking in our law and justice lead today. Judge Tanya Chutkan, the federal judge in the January 6 case against Donald Trump, has ruled that she will allow the special counsel, Jack Smith, to submit hundreds of pages of evidence -- evidence against Donald Trump in this case. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is covering the breaking details. Katelyn, do we know what's in this evidence which the Justice Department is describing as substantial.",

This would be the first time this would mark up really major moment, especially before the election in this case against Donald Trump.One thing, too, we know this may be about is the interactions between Donald Trump and Mike Pence, because the reason that we're talking about this is that the trial judge over this case, Tanya Chutkan. She has to figure out if there's presidential immunity while Donald Trump was in office as president, especially when he was doing things like interacting with Mike Pence. So, the Justice Department wants to lay that all out. And what we do know about this filing and addition is its going to be hundreds of pages long. It's going to have exhibits, evidence attached to it, and also they're dumping out that thesaurus on how they're describing it, even though they aren't saying exactly what's in it yet. They say it's going to be comprehensive, substantial, detailed, exhaustive, extensive, thorough. So we're not getting to trial. We're not getting a final report from special counsel Jack Smith before the election but, Jake, we are very likely to see as the public and through the court this filing, this large amount of collection of evidence that investigators have done from the special counsel's office against Donald Trump.

This is the justice system, thecourt system. We are separate from politics in this proceeding. But I should be clear that there's always things that could happen in court that are unpredictable.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump in this poll are locked in an exceedingly tight presidential race, the tightest at this stage in modern history. Among likely voters nationwide, 48 percent say they support Harris, 47 percent say they support Trump. That's within the three percentage point margin of error. So the two are virtually tied. Our new CNN poll also shows a major shift in voters attitudes about each candidate, including that since Harris became the Democratic nominee, her favorability rating as skyrocketed to the highest level in CNN polling ever since before she just took office in 2021, but how does Harris, his public image compared to the real life issues that voters care about? And what might this mean for Harris now that she's lost an endorsement from a leading Senate moderate, Senator Joe Manchin, independent, former Democrat of West Virginia. First, let's go straight to CNN's David Chalian, who's at the magic wall, ready to break down the latest poll. David, what are the signs for Harris that are keeping her so competitive in this race?",

Kamala Harris is now up to 60 percent of her supporters saying, no, my vote is for Harris, 40 percent say it's against Trump. When we polled this in July, it was 50/50. So among her supporters, she's getting to be a real cause for them to get out and vote.Now Donald Trump is even -- have the greater advantage in this category, 72 percent say that their vote is for him, only 28 percent say against Kamala Harris is, you know, being for something is quite an appealing thing for a candidate to have in politics. You mentioned the favorability ratings. You said they skyrocketed. She's still minus two, right? Forty-eight percent unfavorable, 46 percent favorable. But that is not bad given where she was throughout the entirety of the Biden-Harris administration thus far, she's also in a much better shape on favorability than Donald Trump. He is minus 13, 42 percent favorable, 55 percent unfavorable. And then we tested some key qualities that people look for in a president. On temperament, Kamala Harris has a 20-point advantage over Donald Trump, 58 to 38 percent. On her background in life experience being what either exactly right, or close enough to what voters want in a president, she's got a 10 point advantage there. And on the empathy question, understanding people like you, she's got a six percentage point advantage there, Jake.",

That's why you continually see the Trump campaign trying to tie Harris to Biden as much as they can. Among likely voters, the most important issue is the economy. 41 percent say so. Next is protecting democracy at 21 percent. But issue number one, big time is the economy and that is a Donald Trump dominant category, 50 percent of likely voters say that they trust him to handle the economy.

That is on top of the more than 500 people killed yesterday, according to the Lebanese government by Israeli strikes on Lebanon.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed his travel to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. It's a trip that might not happen at all if this war continues to escalate. I want to bring in Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas. He's retired Navy SEAL. He served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is also on the House intelligence Committee. Congressman, always good to have you on. Israel is escalating its attacks on Hezbollah to the north in Lebanon while continuing to also fight Hamas in Gaza on its southwest. Today, in his final address to the U.N., President Biden said, quote, full- scale war is not in anyone's interest, unquote. How are -- how concerned are you about Israel's ability to fight a two-front war? REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Great question, I think in Israel's mind, they're wrapping up a lot of their operations against Hamas. It is -- it is not the full-fledged all boots on the grounds have been operationally used to be. They've moved a few of those units up north to deal with it has been a continuous threat from Hezbollah this entire time. And if you're constantly receiving rocket fire and attacks member, there's like 80,000 Israelis displaced from northern Israel because of those attacks. But at some point -- you have to say enough is enough and you have to take some kind of action and I think that's what they're doing. [16:35:03] There is some logic to the idea that you're escalating in order to de- escalate. Now, they're also saying that they're fully prepared for a ground war with Hezbollah, should it come to that, they prefer not come to that. But it would appear to anybody observing that these could be shaping operations for those -- for exactly that. When it comes down to it, you can't have a terrorist force on your border that is constantly using its territory to attack your people. And so there -- there are -- there are no good solutions here, and I hate hearing platitudes like the quote you just mentioned from President Biden. War is not -- in no one's interests. Of course, it's in no one's interest but that's not the real world we live in, in sometimes you have to navigate a very complex gray area where bad guys are going to be bad guys and they're going to keep attacking you whether you appease them or not.",

In Lebanon, Hezbollah has a lot of influence over a part of the government, right?The Shia -- the Shia led a section of the government. But there's also a Sunni section of the government and there's a Christian sect of the government. The Lebanese armed forces aren't necessarily tied to Hezbollah. It's a confusing and complicated picture. And if anyone knows the picture pretty well as the Israelis, they know what will be too far of an escalation. They know I think what the what the right measures are get to that point -- and that's a conversation we should be having with them, diplomatic levels as well, because I think Americans have a lot of opinions on that and they have theirs. But in the end, you can't -- you can't exist in this state where you're constantly as Netanyahu just stated, constantly just receiving fire against your civilian locations from a terrorist organization backed by Iran. That's not a sustainable future. And there's no peace involved in that.

They go, they take great -- they go to great lengths to reduce civilian casualties by doing more precision strikes. They warned. They've been warning Hamas and the civilians there of when they would operate in certain neighborhoods, well in advance. That's not good military tactics. It's kind of military tactics. You only use if you're trying to mitigate civilian casualties. So it's not like anybody is unconcerned with it. The question everybody has to ask themselves is -- given the realities we live in, who's to blame. And I think the people to blame are the ones who start the war. And whether that's Hamas or Hezbollah, they're the ones who always start the firing onto civilian neighborhoods and Israel. And then they use their own people as human shields. And then they use that narrative to make it seem like it drill is this nefarious being that doesn't have any concern for civilian casualties.
