Today, Syria's civil warreignites as opposition forces enter Aleppo and push ahead with a major attack on President Bashar al Assad's government. Plus, glory restored to one of Paris' most famous landmarks. We will tell you inside the newly-restored Notre Dame Cathedral. And U.K. lawmakers vote in support of assisted dying. We'll have the details on the landmark move which would allow the terminally-ill to end their lives. All right, at this hour, Syrian opposition forces are inside the major city of Aleppo for the first time since the government recaptured it in 2016. A stunning scene here, rebel fighters taking down the Syrian flag at the statue of President Bashar al Assad's brother, who died in a car accident in 1994. Another video geolocated by CNN shows a rebel fighter driving through the deserted streets on the western side of the city. This video appears to show government tanks leaving Aleppo as rebel forces advance. We should note the video was released by the opposition's military command. Rebels launched a major attack earlier this week against pro-Assad forces. They claim they've taken control of dozens of villages on the western side of Aleppo. Meantime, the Syrian government and its allies are striking back. New video shows the aftermath of attacks in Idlib. The White Helmets say that Syrian and Russian air strikes hit the rebel-held city of southwest of Aleppo, at least, four people were reportedly killed. The Assad government has long relied on support from Russia and pro-Iranian militia including Hezbollah as well. CNN's senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman has reported extensively for us from Syria. He joins us live now from Rome. So, Ben, you and I were speaking earlier, Aleppo is, of course, Syria's second largest city. It's a major industrial hub. I mean, this would be major if these rebels were actually able to retake Aleppo.",

And the three-day- old ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appears to be fragile at best after the IDF says that it carried out another airstrike in southernLebanon today. It follows two other strikes by Israel on Thursday. Israel and Lebanon have accused each other of violating the conditions of this truce. Israel's Foreign Minister is warning of an immediate response from the IDF is if Hezbollah does violate the ceasefire. As for the war in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying that he's ready for a ceasefire there, but not for ending the war until Hamas is eliminated. With Winter coming, the humanitarian conditions in Gaza are making an already dire situation even worse. With thousands of people displaced, shelter is hard to come by, and food and medicine are scarce. An aid worker described the desperation so many are experiencing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the Israeli military itself has acknowledged that it has now carried out at least three airstrikes that we know of in southern Lebanon since the ceasefire began. They say that they are enforcing this ceasefire, that they are acting against violations of the ceasefire by Hezbollah. In the instance today, we saw the Israeli military strike a truck that they said was a portable rocket launcher. And what we know is that the Lebanese military is describing these strikes as violations of the ceasefire. But this is ultimately the tricky part in all of this and the inherent risk in what Israel is doing, is that they are both a party to the ceasefire, but they are also trying to put themselves in the position of enforcing the ceasefire through force, through these various strikes. And so, the question is, is Hezbollah ultimately going to view these strikes as violations and choose to reignite this war? Or perhaps because they are so weakened by months of war with Israel, will they instead choose to let these slide effectively and allow the ceasefire to continue. Certainly, for now, it seems like both sides are incentivized to keep this ceasefire going, and it is indeed holding, although it certainly remains fragile. Zain?",

And we know this kind of battle requires boots on the ground because the opposition, the Islamist and the nationalist opposition are really using Guerrilla tactics. They're moving very fast, very quickly. A paramilitary fighting skills. Iran and Hezbollah don't really have the resources at this particular moment because Israel has been hammering Iranian bases and assets in Syria nonstop for the past three years. And Hezbollah is a bit exhausted. Hezbollah cannot really send any forces to Syria. So, the question facing now the Syrian government, will Syria be able to really reconstitute its forces? Will Syria be able to really go on the offensive? Will the Syrian government be able to stop the offensive by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist and the nationalist opposition and reclaim and recover the areas? Many big \"ifs\". But the reality is, I mean, so far, look, you and I were talking about the political and the military tools. More than 20,000 people have been displaced, hundreds of people have been killed. The Middle East does not really need any -- another warfront. More refugee, more loss, more suffering. It seems to me that the Syrian war that has been simmering since 2019 has been reignited.

So, the recapture, if and when the opposition, both the Islamists and the nationalists recapture Aleppo, this could really reconstitute, mark another turning point in this particular war. But the reality is, it's just the beginning. We have to be cautious about really generalizing -- about what's going to happen in the next few days and next few weeks.

There were many crowds, thousands of people had gathered when their first images on social media had appeared of the flames came out of the roof of Notre Dame. And you can see that tower on the right-hand side of the building. The flames were way above that. And as we watched in horror, the fear was that that tower, and perhaps much of the rest of the cathedral, might collapse. There were people chanting. There were people praying. It was quite a powerful moment. And now, more than five years on, we've had a chance to see what those many hundreds of millions of dollars have achieved. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over): A new dawn for Notre Dame Cathedral, more than five and a half years after a fire tore through parts of the Gothic structure in the heart of Paris. Sparkling stonework highlighting the stunning results of the estimated 737 million dollar restoration as it was unveiled to France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. After the 2019 blaze, the president had vowed to rebuild Notre Dame even more beautiful than it was. Entering the cathedral with his wife, Brigitte, on Friday, it was clear that France had achieved just that. It was at the same time repaired, restored, and rebaptized, Macron said. Millions had watched in shock and horror as Notre Dame's 96-meter spire tumbled into the church during the 2019 blaze. Now, its renaissance is complete. Touring the epicenter of the blaze, the medieval roof structure known as the Forest, Macron saw the beams rebuilt by hand from 1,200 oak trees from across France. Among the highlights of Macron's tour, a mural in the north enclosure of the choir that was badly damaged in the fire, and the Virgin of Paris, a 14th century statue that became a symbol of resistance when it was found standing resolute, surrounded by burnt wood and collapsed stone. And the beautiful Saint Marcell's chapel, one of 29 chapels that have been lovingly restored. Viewing the 12-meter-wide grand organ, Macron described it as sublime. More than 1,300 people involved in the restoration were invited inside as the French president wrapped up his final visit to the site before its former reopening. You have transformed ashes into art, he told them. The whole planet was upset that day in April. The shock of the reopening will be as big as that of the fire, he said, thanking the crowds. (END VIDEOTAPE) BELL (on camera): Zain, just that at timber rebuilding that roof, the Forest as they call it, at the very top of Notre Dame, such an extraordinary feat. Those oaks, the 2,000 of them that were involved, many hundred years old each, it was through the River Seine -- by the River Seine, that they were brought to Notre Dame in order that they could be rebuilt. Again, this has always been considered the beating heart of Paris. And what was so moving today was to see a glimpse of it, because the public won't get in for another week, but a glimpse of what the public, not just Parisians, but the French and visitors as well, will be able to rediscover for themselves shortly. The beating heart of Paris open once again, Zain.",
