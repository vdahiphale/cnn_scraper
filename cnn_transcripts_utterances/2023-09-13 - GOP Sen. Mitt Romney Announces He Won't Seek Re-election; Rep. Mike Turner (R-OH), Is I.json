      "sentences": "Yes, no question about it, because there was a hope that he would actually run for reelection, in fact, a lobbying campaign among some top Republicans urging him to do so. Senator Republican leader Mitch McConnell hoped that Mitt Romney would run, not necessarily because the sleep would flip, but because he represents a voice, an influential voice within the Republican Party, a more establishment voice, an anti-Trump voice, one that is waning in the Republican Party. Even though he was the party's presidential nominee in 2012, much has changed since then, something that he flatly acknowledged in his press conference just moments ago.We had chance to talk to him on a wide range of subjects about his decision to step aside. He said that it's simply an issue about his age. By the time, if you were to run and win reelection, he would be in his 80s. He said that is -- there's people should not be in office in his 80s, he said repeatedly. He said it's time for a new generation of leaders. He sharply criticized Donald Trump. He criticized Biden as well. He did believe he could win reelection, but he said it would be difficult acknowledging the politics within his party. Now, he also made clear time and again that his wing of the party is essentially in a middle -- in a battle with the Trump wing of the party. He argued that his wing is focused on policy. It's focused on some of the key issues that are central to the Republican Party platform, not about a personality, which is the Trump wing of the party. That is what something that he says he will continue to focus on, Jake, in the months and weeks ahead, particularly after he leaves office making clear here. And, Jake, just take a listen to what he had to say moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): Have a say in how we leave the Earth and how they prepare for the future they're going to live in. So you guys have already seen the statement that I put out. I don't know that I want to repeat that, but if you have any questions, I just -- I mean, populism doesn't work. I quote that H.L. Mencken line, which is, to every complex problem, there's a solution which is simple, clear, and wrong. And unfortunately, that's what we're hearing. And again, on the Trump wing of the party, I haven't heard policy other than saying we're going to build a wall. And by the way, he was president. He was president for four years. He built 50 miles. What did he get done? I said, well, how about the tax change? Well, the tax, that was Paul Ryan. That wasn't the Biden plan. He did, of course, he had a health care plan, remember that? That was going to -- everybody's going to have low cost health insurance that was fabulous. Never proposed, never saw. He was in four years. So it's not a policy centric approach.

He said he had hoped that people within his party believed that he was standing on principle and they would reward him for that, but fully knowing full well that this would have been a battle to win reelection here, he suggested that perhaps that was not the reason why he wanted to step aside. He simply continued to point to his age as being the main factor here.But no question, Jake, even though the safe seat -- is a safe Republican seat, and even though Republican voters in Utah are not as pro-Trump as some other red states in the union, it would have been a fight for him to win reelection, something they simply did not want to do at this stage of his life.",

But let me just say this. As the chairman or any member of the joint chiefs, our job is to render advice. We have plans for all kinds of things.

And you can see more of Fareed Zakaria's interview with General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on GPS this Sunday at 10Coming up, he was one of the Secret Service agents at John F. Kennedy's side when the President was assassinated in Dallas. And now he's sharing a story about one of the bullets that's raising new questions about what actually happened that horrible day. That former Secret Service agent will be here to tell me his story, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:46:11] TAPPER: In our National Lead, a new version of what might have happened to the magic bullet that was key to the official story of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. According to the Warren Commission report, this is in a new book called \"The Final Witness: A Kennedy Secret Service Agent Breaks His Silence After 60 Years.\" The book is by one time Secret Service agent Paul Landis, who was then in his late 20s and provided security for the First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy. Now, Landis's book is adding to the controversy over what has been called the Magic Bullet Theory, a reference to the Warren Commission's conclusion that before the fatal shot hit Kennedy in the head, a single bullet, recovered almost intact, passed through Kennedy's throat and continued on to seriously wound Texas Governor John Connally in the seat in front of Kennedy. Landis was in the car directly behind President Kennedy's limousine on November 22nd, 1963. He heard the shots and he saw with his own eyes much of what happened. Landis filed reports and continued working in the security detail for Mrs. Kennedy. But he left the Secret Service less than a year after the assassination. And he never mentioned then his own moment with that single intact bullet until he says he found out the Warren Commission report did not match his memory. Landis writes, quote the super bullet hadn't been on Governor Connally's stretcher in trauma room number two. I recognized it as the bullet I had found in the limo and placed next to President Kennedy's feet in trauma room number one. That assertion has kicked up a debate over the so called Magic Bullet, and former Secret Service Agent Paul Landis joins us now to talk about his book. Thank you so much for joining us, sir. So you were in the car directly behind Kennedy's during the Dallas motorcade. What do you remember about the shots being fired?",

And I immediately turned, looked over my shoulder to the right where the sound had come from, and I couldn't see anything right away.And I turned quickly and looked at the President, and President Kennedy was kind of leaning a little bit to his left towards Mrs. Kennedy. There was a second shot. Again, I saw no reaction from where I was inside the President's limo. And we were starting to move at a little higher rate of speed.
