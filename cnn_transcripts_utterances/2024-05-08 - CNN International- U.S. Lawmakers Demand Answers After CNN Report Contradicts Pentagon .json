When back to August 2021, the Taliban are taking Kabul, the U.S. are evacuating, taking Afghan civilians to help them out with them. An ISIS bomb --ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello and welcome to our viewers around the world. I am Erica Hill. This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing Rafah after an Israeli evacuation order. We have the very latest for you on that Israeli operation and also whether any aid is getting through. Plus, trial delayed. Donald Trump's classified documents now on hold indefinitely. We will explain what's behind the judge's decision and multiple sites across Ukraine are hit in what officials there call a massive attack on the country's infrastructure. As ceasefire talks are set a resume in Cairo, Israel's defense minister says its military operations in Rafah will continue until Hamas is eliminated from Gaza, or until the first hostage returns. About 50,000 people have now fled Rafah in just the past 48 hours, that's according to an agency. They began to flee on Monday after Israel ordered residents to evacuate the eastern part of the city. Governments around the world are urging Israel not to carry out a major ground offensive in Rafah. One U.S. official telling CNN the shipment -- a shipment rather from the U.S. of some 2,500 pound bombs to Israel last week was actually paused over concerns about their potential use in Rafah. Meantime, as I noted, that operation though does continue. At least 30 people have been killed since Monday. Israel meantime says a key border crossing is now open for humanitarian aid. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live in Jerusalem at this hour. So, in terms of these crossings in and out of Gaza and that aid, right, critical access for humanitarian aid, what do we know what this hour, Jeremy?",

And until early this morning, both of those crossings were closed. But now, the Israeli military has reopened that Kerem Shalom crossing. We are told by COGAT, which is the Israeli military agency in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid into the Palestinian territories that the Kerem Shalom crossing was reopen.Trucks have already begun arriving at Kerem Shalom where they are screened for security purposes and then allowed into the Gaza Strip. That comes several days after that crossing was closed on Sunday after a Hamas rocket attack killed four soldiers and injured several others very near to that crossing. The Rafah crossing, however, that's a different story. The Israeli military took over that crossing overnight the -- over 24 hours ago and as of now, as we understand it, that crossing remains closed and that could have some really serious implications for the humanitarian situation in Gaza in the coming days, if it remains closed, because not only is it the entry point for humanitarian aid, but it is also the only site through which humanitarian aid workers have been able well to get in and out of Gaza. It is also the place where Palestinians leaving Gaza, including those who are being medically evacuated, have been able to leave from. So, that is also a key crossing, a key lifeline for Gaza to the outside world. And as of now, it remains closed.",

Jordan's foreign minister, for example, say that at a time when Hamas is trying to push towards a deal, Israel is carrying out this offensive, albeit limited.What we've heard from the U.S. side though, the Biden Administration is Hamas was -- it was less of an acceptance of this Egyptian-Qatari proposal that was on the table and more a counter proposal. So what we see now is that the Israeli delegation is in Cairo. It's a working- level delegation though, which suggests that they're not as close as we assume they may have been back on Monday. If they were close to a deal, certainly you'd expect the Mossad Director, for example, to be heading up that delegation. But what we are seeing is the CIA Director is heading to Israel to speak to him, clearly, trying to bridge the gaps in-between the two positions to try and push this deal forward. We did hear something interesting as well from John Kirby saying that the U.S. has studied the position of Israel and also Hamas very closely, and they do believe that a deal can be done. So even though we are hearing from the Israeli side that they are far from close, that there are significant gaps between the two sides when it comes to hammering out this deal, we are hearing from the Biden Administration that they believe that there still can be a middle ground. Now, one of the main sticking points remains the end of the war. We are hearing from the Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan that he believes what Hamas has agreed to does include ending the war and does include the Israeli military pulling out of the Gaza Strip. Two things that Israel up until now has refused to agree to. Erica?",

So Evan, this ruling essentially delaying the trial indefinitely, what specifically are the issues she says that needs to be worked through? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Judge Aileen Cannon in this case, Erica, is saying that there are a number of motions, pre-trial motions, mostly from Donald Trump's side that she's still needs to get through. She said there is at least eight of them that are still pending. And so, she has now scheduled hearings and some procedural matters to go through at least late July, which makes the possibility of a trial that much more slim. We don't -- obviously, we've long known that the May 20th trial date that was on the calendar was really not operational anymore. We've seen repeatedly where the Special Counsel Jack Smith has requested for her to make some rulings and she has just refused to.

Adult film star Stormy Daniels will actually return to the witness stand tomorrow after some really explosive testimony yesterday, speaking about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in explicit detail. Here's more from CNN's Kara Scannell.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On the stand, Stormy Daniels, the former adult film star and director, at the center of the first criminal trial of Donald J. Trump. The $130,000 deal in exchange for her silence is at the heart of the prosecution's case. On Tuesday, prosecutors tried to paint Daniels as a credible witness, having her reveal specific details on her alleged sexual encounter with Trump and the events surrounding it. Trump denies the affair. Meanwhile, during cross-examination, Trump's attorneys tried to undercut Daniels' testimony by attacking her motivations, credibility, and demonstrating how much she hates Trump. Daniels testified she we met Trump while working at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006. That's when Trump invited her to dinner. Later in Trump's penthouse suite, she said they talked for two hours and Trump asked thoughtful business questions. She explained she went to the bathroom and when I exited, he was just up on the bed like this, in boxers and a t-shirt, she said while demonstrating his pose for the jury. She noted it was not in a threatening manner. Daniels said, the next thing I know, I was on the bed.

A reminder that back on March 22nd, they used some 150 missiles and drones when targeting Ukraine. In the middle of April, an entire power station just outside Kyiv was completely destroyed. But this, according to the air force (ph), was a mixture of missiles and drones, some 76 aerial targets as they call them in total.So, it wasn't a large scale and other measure of that is that the public is now being told to conserve energy, even though the weather, of course, in May is relatively mild. Ad I think the key thing to note here as well is that Russia, Putin in the past has said in the past few weeks, I should say, that this is a response to Ukrainian attacks on Russia's energy facilities, things like oil refineries. We know that they've been doing that using drones deep into Russian territory. But this is part of a playbook that we've seen all along really, an effort to exhaust the Ukrainian population, to cripple their economy. This sort of ongoing attrition that you see and it's a cumulative effect on the energy grid. DTEK, which has Ukraine's largest private power-generating company, said that three of its thermal power plants were badly damaged today. They had already reported back in mid-April that 80 percent of their power generating capacity had been taken offline. It's not clear how much of that has been repaired, but this look -- really underscores Ukraine's vulnerability. Of those 76 aerial targets, 16 missiles, and one attack drone actually got through. So if Russia is going to continue this tactic, then Ukraine is going to continue to I think call for more air defenses and have to grapple with the prospect of repairing these facilities only to see them potentially damaged again.",

It is one of the biggest days of the year in their calendar. Ukraine though, in an effort to distance itself from Russia, has moved its celebrations of Victory Day to May 8, which is when it's widely marked in Europe. And so, I think it's logical to look for a connection here between the massive attack we saw overnight and this date.And certainly, President Zelenskyy has drawn on that connection in a post on X. He said that Nazi Putin, as he called him, launched a massive missile attack on Ukraine. And then said the entire world, you can see at the bottom there, must understand who is who. The world must not give a chance to new Nazism. Of course, we know that on the flip side, Russia continues to claim that it is de-Nazifying Ukraine. On the other side of this is that Russia, I think despite having not achieved a strategic victory on the frontlines in recent months, will go into its own Victory Day celebrations, which we'll see tomorrow, somewhat emboldened by the gains it has been able to make while Ukraine waits for military aid.

They want an answer really between the discrepancy of the information they got in briefings from the Pentagon in line with the two investigations the Pentagon had put out over the last couple of years, and the information in the video that we reported on and released. The big discrepancy really comes around gunfire in the aftermath of that blast. Now, the video we showed shows 11 episodes of gunfire over about four minutes, far more, far longer than the two Pentagon investigations said. The Pentagon insisted there had only been three bursts of gunfire that were nearly simultaneous. There were fired by U.S. or U.K. troops, the only people firing in the area and that nobody had crucially been hit by any of these shots. Now, that was important because we had also heard from nearly 20 Afghan survivor that they had either been shot or seen people shot in the aftermath. Now, the Pentagon say the only people shooting there were American or British troops that leads to a specific conclusion. Now when you hear that doctor talk about the scale of the casualties of the dead, they saw at their major Kabul hospital in the aftermath, over 70 people with gunshot injuries who died. That suggests a significant development here. Now, at the heart of what the congressmen I want to know is exactly why this video does not tally with the Pentagon investigations. They want to know too why it was these to investigations didn't interview any Afghans. The Afghan doctor you saw there not interviewed throughout two Pentagon investigations. They said that wasn't part of the scope of what some of what they were looking at indeed was. So, a lot of volume here from Congress for answers. The families, you mentioned, well, they say yes, they've been misled. That's seven -- families of seven marines out of the 13 Gold Star families who lost their lives there, the U.S. service personnel, and they say they want proper answers and feel that the briefings they had led to them being told lies by the Pentagon. The Pentagon themselves, well, they say they'll respond directly to the Congressmen and they say that they have a sacred obligation to honor the service and sacrifice of those 13 service members who died, through providing the best information they can, and the truth to their families. But, it is the truth that's at the heart of this letter from the Congressmen say that they say the truth must come out, and they urge in the strongest possible terms, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin to handle this. Look, two years -- over two years now, two investigations, it's clear that so many of the facts are alluding the Pentagon's investigators, they did a misstatement to me yesterday, suggest that they would be open to new information if it came to light, but they have steadfast stuck by the idea, there was limited gunfire, it hit nobody, and only American and British troops opened fire, despite the growing evidence from there their own marines to their own investigators, and from the Afghans we spoke to, that wasn't entirely the case.

She has an axe to grudge, then there's enough in the cross-examination to feed that narrative. But if you felt that she was a young woman, age 27, who was brought under bad circumstances to a hotel room by now former president wearing pajamas and they ended up having sex when they were supposed to have dinner, then I think she has painted herself as a very vulnerable person who, when it became clear that she had a story to sell, she decided to sell it.And if selling a story is bad, then we've got a lot of former politicians selling books with sort of these salacious stories that have apologizing to do so. I think that all in all, the prosecutor got what he wanted or she wanted out of Stormy Daniels and probably the defense got what it wanted. And this is all going to lead to a closing argument which says on the Trump side, reasonable doubt, and on the prosecution side, this defies logic to think that he didn't know about all of this stuff. And we'll see how the jury decides.",

These are not serious motions. Yet, she continues to entertain what I think are essentially frivolous motions. And as I say, I don't know whether it's incompetence, inexperience or political motive.But it doesn't make a difference which of those three it is, because all she's doing is denying the American people the right to have this case tried, so they can understand whether Former President Trump did or did not commit a crime, so that they can safely evaluate it before they go to the polls. It's really too much for me at this point. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt all along.

The campaign also trying to do more to energize support with that community as they're heading into November's election. But it's clear that they're also trying to take advantage of this split-screen that's been occurring in recent weeks between Biden and Trump as Former President Trump has spent much of the past three weeks in a courtroom in New York City, while President Biden has sought opportunities to hit the campaign trail. That's something that his advisers say they will continue in the weeks ahead as they are facing an incredibly close contest with President Trump across battleground states, including in critical Wisconsin.",

But I think in this country, there has been a huge amount of talk about Harry and Meghan, and they're not popular throughout society, but there is a lot of people who do support him. So, I don't think there's anything new in the fact that wouldn't meet Charles, so maybe that's the thing. But certainly, there has been a lot of push from his side about promoting the word, we haven't really seen before.",
