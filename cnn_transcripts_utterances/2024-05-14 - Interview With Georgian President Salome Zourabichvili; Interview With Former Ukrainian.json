Georgia's future hangs in the balance. The former Soviet Republic has seen mass protests for weeks coming to a head today as riot police clashed with pro-European demonstrators after its parliament passed a controversial foreign agents bill, which critics say mirrors a law in Russia which is used to crack down on any opposition and any dissent. Much like Ukraine, Georgia is caught between Russia and Europe. But today, the country appears to have taken a step back into Russia's orbit, and away from what the overwhelming majority of Georgians want, which is to join the E.U. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Certainly,there's been a massive shortage of the ammunition for months now, like for many, many months. The proportion between us and Russians has been sometimes even one to 10. So, there's been a severe shortage in this rationing of the ammunitions every day. When the battlefield units were receiving a very few every day, and basically, they could only fight for X number of hours. And after that, they could just defend with the small arms and so on. So, certainly, with this type of war, like a land war, which we have right now there, the artillery is absolutely critical. And obviously, when Russia has artillery and we have very little of it, I mean, there will be these consequences. There's -- you know, Ukrainians are -- Ukrainian forces are extremely brave and are very resolved, but, you know, we need to be understanding the objective reality, if there's no weapons, it's very difficult to hold positions.",

So, the fact thatU.S. is resulting -- decided legally to deliver those to Ukraine, I'm sure that that will help tremendously. I think we can stop Russians from any -- from moving anywhere. It's absolutely realistic. But we absolutely must realize the fact that European industry and generally European defense sector wasn't prepared for any large war in Europe. And that that's a fact, because they run out of their stocks very quickly, whether they're from there -- with their inventory very quickly. And right now, there's been a decision last year to supply 1 million of rounds of 155 ammunitions to Ukraine, and that hasn't been done because simply they cannot make them. So, Europe needs to step up there, and it's not just for Ukraine, it's generally to enhance European security. It's absolutely clear. And that's also a fact. And I think that there's -- there are already factories being built in Europe right now to -- for ammunition. There is already some activities happening, but unfortunately, that takes time. And Russians currently are trying to use that window of opportunity to maximize the gain in the battlefield, but more importantly, in the information sphere, so that they're projecting the success, which we need to be very clear about that because lots of their gains, particularly these villages around Kharkiv, they have very little strategic effect. It's more to show maybe to president -- to Russian government, maybe to international community that Russia still can be winning. But they cannot win strategically still, and that's what we see here.

Their intimidation can't be overstated at this point. You know, Navalny's wife, who's tried to take up his baton, operating from outside of Russia now, same with his anti-corruption foundation. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, named the Russian opposition leader, Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion, all now either exiled, or if they remained in Russia, it seems imprisoned or dead, quite a chilling effect on the Russian opposition there. Again, not new, but accelerated since the invasion of Ukraine with criticism of the military outlawed, even one-time allies of Putin. Remember, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Mercenary Group, known as Putin's chef, because he made billions off of catering contracts with the Kremlin, who had challenged Putin and the regular defense ministry, a brief rebellion that he then called off and ends up dead in a very mysterious plane disaster. So, any challenge to Putin clearly is meeting very, very strong and forceful pushback.",

But indeed, it's a shakeup within the Kremlin security leadership. And part of that is because of endemic corruption in the defense ministry. Now, we know Russia has long suffered from extensive corruption among high level officials. Navalny made his name as an anti-corruption crusader. Now, curiously, the war has served as an anti-corruption tool in the sense that it is now hugely important. There's a great imperative in Russia to make sure that resources directed to the defense ministry are not stolen, but in fact, yield weapons and soldiers and uniforms, all the material that's needed at the front. And so, we have a new defense minister coming in, who's actually not a military guy. Belousov, Andrey Belousov is an economist, a former economic development minister, believe his mandate in part will be to oversee and exercise some tight control over a vast increase in military spending that Putin is authorized to be sure that, in fact, those rubles are spent on weapons, on the bombs, on the shells, on the uniforms that are needed to fight in Ukraine and not lost to graft.",

We know there are Russian troops stationed in Moldova, in the Transnistria region. We know Russia, in 2008, invaded Georgia. Georgia experiencing mass protests these days over a Russian style foreign agent law, the same kind of law that Putin has used to crack down on political dissent, on free speech. So, Russia's reach is quite long. Again, largest nuclear arsenal anywhere in the world. We see these threats against the West all the time that if it overreaches and, in fact, intercedes too strongly in Ukraine that Russia will resort to a weapon of mass destruction. So, for the West, there is a real need to recognize what kind of a challenge Putin is presenting, especially as he builds a generation, trains an entire new generation to see the West as its enemy. That's just the reality of Russia today. And it is exactly why, Hari, we've been working on this series to explain to people just what's happening inside Russia these days.",

In fact, the textbooks, the history lessons are being rewritten to make it out as if Ukraine was always just some part of Russia. And as you know, this argument has found some currency in the United States, including in the Congress, this idea that Russia is, you know, exerting its proper authority over a sphere of influence rather than understanding that, in fact, Ukraine has its own, you know, thousands of years of history and its own desire to live as a free democratic country. If there is that democratic model next door, there is no reason why Russia itself should not be democratic and free. I've lived in Russia. I absolutely believe that democracy was possible in Russia and is still possible in Russia. There is no reason why one man has to rule that country as he has for a quarter century, circumventing all the term limits and having a democratic Ukraine would prove that point.",

The other is that Russia is defending Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine, who are being persecuted, who are under attack. I can assure you that even with my bad American accent, it was possible to speak in Russian from one side of Ukraine to the other without anyone ever giving you a bad look. That was before, of course, the big invasion. Now, of course, a lot more pride being taken in speaking Ukrainian, in separating Ukraine from Russia because it is bombing and destroying Ukrainian cities, killing thousands of civilians. In the case of these children, some of them, again, it's a matter of building this new generation, convincing them. And we've seen the child's right -- child rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, who along with Putin has faced an arrest warrant from the international criminal court describing how she herself adopted a Ukrainian orphan, took him in and had to retrain him essentially to love Russia, to reprogram him to not think of Ukraine as his home. Quite chilling. Some of these stories that we've heard from children who have escaped, who have gotten back to their families in Ukraine, who have managed to get this in terms of long circuitous route to get there. So, again, this part of this effort to essentially prove that there is a greater Russia. There is no independent Ukraine. Putin has described that in public interviews. This view that Ukraine has just always been a part of -- a small part appendage of Russia and that, in fact, Russia should reassert its influence. Seizing these territories, four regions in addition to Crimea, that he's intent on annexing. He's declared to be annexed in violation of international law.

So, indeed, there's an effort to resuscitate. The image of Stalin and Putin would like to see himself perhaps as a cross between Stalin and Peter the Great, the modern czar. I think you can put it as making Russia great again. He will be the leader who restored Russia to a level of power and influence in the world that it lost when he was a KGB agent stationed in East Germany and Dresden. There have been a lot of biographies that have described this, Putin calling Moscow as the Soviet Union was crumbling and Moscow being silent, and he had vowed that under his watch, Moscow will never be silent. In fact, it will be the opposite. It will always have an answer to any challenge. And this what we see. And this incredible transformation that's going on in the country right now.",

That's more children than in all the other global conflicts around the world since 2019. And when you're, you know, confronted with that kind of devastation, that kind of horror, I could understand why, as parents, we want to shield our children from it. But I truly do believe, as a parent of four children myself, that this conflict is actually an opportunity to teach our kids and give them the tools necessary to cultivate compassion and empathy, the critical thinking skills, because, yes, this war has been devastating for the children of Israel and Palestine, but children all around the world, including here in the United States, have also been impacted by this conflict. They're inundated with these images of destruction and despair. It's unavoidable, Christiane. And as parents, I get it. Most of us feel like we ourselves barely understand this conflict. I do it for a living and I barely understand it. And so, what I wanted to do was provide a text that would allow caregivers, parents to have the meaningful conversations necessary with their children that could give them context, a sense of understanding about where we are in this conflict.

And you're well known for it. You know, you're talking about two sets of children, Israel and Palestine, as your title says, who have been raised on completely different diets and narratives about the other. What did you choose to put into this book to show that there are two sides who are human, two sides who are victims, two sides who need to understand the story of the other?

It becomes very hard to talk about the suffering and the oppression that Palestinians have experienced without negating the Israeli narrative and the seeking of peace and security, et cetera, and vice versa. So, the real challenge here was, can we provide a factual opinion lists history of this conflict that lays out both sides, both narratives, and then to challenge children to simply be able to see both sides? Can they walk in both shoes, if you will? Because if they can, as I explained in the book, that's a kind of superpower. It means that they have the empathy and the compassion, the critical thinking skills necessary to become the generation that can advocate for peace in this conflict. You know, children, I think, people have to realize, have the ability to maintain very complex ideas in their minds, sometimes conflicting ideas, sometimes contradictory ideas. And as long as these issues are brought to them in an age-appropriate way, as the book tries to do, they have the ability to grapple with what we think of as perhaps things that are inappropriate for children. But, again, we live in a world in which insulating our children from the problems of the world, whether it's Israel, Palestine or whether it's Ukraine and Russia or whether it's anywhere else in the world, that's just simply not feasible any longer. So, we have to give them the tools necessary to be able to navigate those complexities to become the generation that can actually advocate for a lasting peace between Israel and Palestine.",

There's a whole host of after questions in the book, opportunities to create precisely the safe space necessary so that caregivers and children can have this larger conversation.

But if I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, this book is not so much for those stakeholders, because they are living the reality of this conflict every day. Really, it's for all of the adults and the children in this muddy middle who are constantly bombarded with information, a lot of it misinformation, prejudices, stereotypes about one side or the other, these images that are becoming increasingly impossible to avoid, regardless of where in the world one lives, and who really don't know how to think about this conflict and are just looking for some kind of groundwork, if you will, some context, some ability to understand how we got to the place where we are today. Because this not a conflict that began on October 7th, everybody understands that. This an intractable, decades-long conflict that isn't about religion, it's not even really about politics, it's about things that children understand, sharing, justice, fairness. These are things that your kids get in a deep visceral level. And so, just simply laying out the conflict for them and then giving them, along with their parents and caregivers, the opportunity to talk about how their values of sharing and fairness and justice can be applied to this conflict is an incredibly valuable insight.",
