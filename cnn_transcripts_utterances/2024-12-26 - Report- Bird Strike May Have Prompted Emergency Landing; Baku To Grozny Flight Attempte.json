But given his violent past, prison officials were very concerned and very eager to get him back into custody. It was in 2016 that Johnson was convicted of murdering a friend. That friend's body found buried in a field with more than 2 dozen stab wounds. Once he was taken into custody, the Shelby County District Attorney's Office said that Johnson attempted to murder an inmate, later pleading guilty to attempted first degree murder. And his violent streak did not end there. The Shelby County District Attorney's Office said he tried to burn the jail down twice. Now prison officials in Mississippi were pleading with the public to stay vigilant around the Christmas holiday, a time they say that people tend to let their guard down and be a little bit more generous.
