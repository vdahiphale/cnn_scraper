And, you know, it fits in with a pattern through this campaign where they have both he and J. D. Vance have really signaled their affirmation of traditional gender roles. I mean, all the hyper masculine symbolism of the Republican convention with professional wrestlers and ultimate fighting championship, folks introducing Trump and J. D. Vance talking about childless cat ladies and the idea that, you know, women with parents should get extra votes for their kids. Basically, Trump is appealing to the portions of America that are most comfortable with traditional gender roles. And that includes mostly men, but a large amount of blue collar and evangelical women as well. His problem is, is that the idea that women need to be protected by a man, especially this man who has been adjudicated to have committed a sexual assault and has been credibly accused, you know, by two dozen or more other allegations of sexual assault. As one Republican pollster said to me, the whole idea that women need protecting is cringey, but it is cringiest coming from him for single women, college educated women, younger women. And as you point out, women are a majority of the vote in America. They're a majority of the vote in every swing state. Donald Trump has to win men by more than Kamala Harris wins women to win probably any state that is still at play in this election. And I don't know if this adds to the problem, but it certainly reinforces it.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean -- look, I mean, I think there's -- the dominant view in both parties has been that Democrats have to win the nationalpopular vote by a considerable margin in order to squeeze out an electoral college victory, and that's because all of the swing states in 2020, and I believe in 2016 as well, voted more Republican and the national average. I mean, Hillary Clinton won national popular vote by two points, but that wasn't enough because she lost Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin narrowly. Biden, it took him winning the national popular vote by four and a half points to get over the top in those states as well as Arizona and Georgia. The difference this time is that the reason Trump is narrowing the national popular vote is largely because he is gaining among Latino voters, especially men, and to some extent black voters, especially men. Kamala Harris is holding the gains among white voters that Joe Biden made in 2020 relative to Hillary Clinton. And that means that even if Kamala Harris wins the popular vote by about the same amount as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, because more of her votes are coming from whites, she is better positioned to win those predominantly white states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. So, it is entirely possible, I think, that Kamala Harris could win the popular vote by about the same amount that Hillary Clinton did. And unlike Clinton, who fell short in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Harris might be able to squeeze them out and get to 270. Of course, Pennsylvania is the toughest of the three. It is the battle of the bulge in this presidential.",

But because of recent legislation that has been led by Republicans here in Arizona State, you see that, like, urgency died down.

The same thing happens in California, but to the east of California, there isn't a Mediterranean Sea. There is a desert. So, we don't get this type of flow into California when we have to cutoff low to the southwest, just west of Mexico, really proper. Look at this, 491 millimeters in just eight hours. The normal yearly rainfall for Chiva is 475 for the year. They picked up their years' worth of rain in eight hours. Here's the before and after pictures. Here's the lagoon here. Here's Valencia up here. Notice how much water kind of fills into the lagoon. But what we're seeing here, if we get closer to the cities, take a look at these normally very dry rivers. They were not dry. The water was just rushing down from the mountains. Another picture here. You can see grass where the river sometimes is, but not anymore. This river was completely out of control. So, here we've seen pictures of the cars that were piled up on the highway. There is that highway, mud just completely clogging the roadways.

It was just last week that it was only 3,000 troops, North Korean troops, that is, in Russia that the U.S. was willing to acknowledge publicly. And now, it's 10,000 in Russia, 8,000 in the Kursk region that you just showed a map of there. And then, the U.S. now speaking to the training they have received, that is, training in trench clearing, infantry operations, the usage and firing of artillery as well as drones. The U.S. making it clear these North Korean troops are very much heading for the fight, heading into the -- and into and onto the battlefield, quoting Secretary of State Antony Blinken here in the coming days. The U.S. views this very seriously. And in a two plus two, that is the secretary of state and the secretary of defense of the U.S. meeting with their South Korean counterparts here, they're making it very clear that there will be some sort of response and how closely the U.S. and South Korea will be watching this. And then, of course, the concern was always that this would mean that the fight in Ukraine in will have essentially involved or entailed another region that is the Far East. And we're seeing, essentially, North Korea's own actions here with the South Korean ministers of defense and foreign affairs here, North Korea firing a ballistic missile that flew for nearly 90 minutes. That is the longest firing of a North Korean missile we've ever seen. And it comes about a year after North Korea's last intercontinental ballistic missile launch. So, you see the cooperation here between the U.S. and South Korea. You see it not only not only with North Korea's own launch and a large-scale air exercise, more than a hundred advanced fighter jets from the U.S. and South Korea flying there, but you see the intelligence and cooperation of what North Korean troops are doing as they are expected to be seen on the battlefield in Ukraine, near Ukraine in the coming days. Julia, one more country to bring into this picture here is China, the U.S. and South Korea making it clear they'd like to see China's engagement here to try to essentially get North Korea to back off.

But we did see a rising in the core rate of inflation month over month. So, a slight thing to watch, not cause for concern for the Fed, but something to watch.

In other business news, tech giants Apple and Amazon also out with their latest earnings results, rounding out a torrential week of tech earnings, Amazon rallying in afterhours trade thanks to strength in the Cloud. Apple shares a touch weaker. One reason a China sales miss. Lance Ulanoff is editor-at-large of TechRadar and he joins us now. Lance, it does say something about a company that they can take a $10.2 billion hit due to back taxes and still make almost $94 billion worth of net income. But that's Apple. Just talk us through the numbers because China was a disappointment again. LANCE ULANOFF, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, TECHRADAR:  Yes. Well, they said China was basically flat, which in a way was maybe good news for them, but it was a miss from where they wanted to be. But when you look at, you know, Apple's numbers and iPhone, again, is, you know, revenue up like 6.6 percent over the same time last year. And, you know, every -- actually, every category with one exception was up. The one category that dropped, and this is something that I kind of paid attention to, is wearables. It had a 3 percent drop over last year. And that does include you know, the Apple Watch. AirPods, and I believe it might include Vision Pro. In the earnings call they didn't talk about Vision Pro at all. You know what they talked about, almost nonstop? They talked about Apple Intelligence. And the big question is, because, you know, that the majority of the revenues came through the iPhone, is whether or not excitement and interest in Apple Intelligence is what drove that number. All that Tim Cook would say is that the uptake of iOS 18.1, which is the first blush of Apple Intelligence for U.S. English -- the English U.S. version, because not all around the world, but it was faster than last year for iOS 17.1. So, to him, that indicates tremendous interest, but it is really untested. We don't even have the full version of Apple Intelligence, that is going to show up next year.",

But broadly speaking, there are more concerns in Beijing for Chinese citizens than what's happening in the United States.
