I'm Jake Tapper live at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire, the site of tonight's CNN town hall with GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley.I'll be moderating the town hall and there is so much that New Hampshire voters want to ask the former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor before they go to vote in next Tuesday's primary, much more to come on the race for 2024. But we're going to begin with our law and justice lead today -- the 2022 Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 children and two teachers killed that could have been stopped much sooner. And that's what the U.S. Department of Justice's nearly 600- page report into the botched police response found. Justice Department officials bluntly calling the 376 police officer response and unimaginable failure -- a failure to take any action at all for 77 minutes, even though police could hear 45 rounds of gunshots ringing out in the classrooms, even though there were numerous 911 calls made by a child inside one of the classrooms, there were parents begging to run into the school and save their children who were forced to stay outside the building. And the Justice Department's review of this epic failure by police does not stop there. Imagine being told by police that your child survived the shooting when in fact he or she did not? That's just a sliver of the chaos, confusion, contradictions, and lack of accountability that unfolded minutes after the shooter was killed and continued in the days, months, and more than a year after. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, who has spent months investigating this deadly school shooting, has more on the Justice Department's scathing report and the reaction to it.

What is your reaction to the Justice Department report? REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX):  Yeah, it's a tough day for us that live and work around Uvalde. First, I want to thank you for covering the story I spoke with you that the day after the shooting from Uvalde and here we are nearly two years later and you're still covering it. I'm grateful for that. You know, I spoke with the attorney general last week at length. I spoke with the assistant attorney general this week ahead of the releasing of this report. And, you know, anytime there is a shooting, whether it's in Perry, Iowa, or whether it's in Maine, we are almost re-victimized in Uvalde. And today's report is certainly opened up a lot of -- lot of old scars, but I also think it's important for us to acknowledge the mishaps, acknowledge the lack of communication, the lack of policy, the lack of reaction, understand that, and then fix it, and then find a way to make sure that what happened in Uvalde never happens again.",

But this sentiment that, you know, some folks were cowards and they didn't want to go in, that's the furthest thing from the truth. But there were a lot of breakdowns. And how do we fix it? One of the discussions I had with the attorney general was out of this report. There's a lot of recommendations, and we have already started to work together, my office with the Department of Justice on how we fix some of these things, you know, with grants, with federal funding, talking to local leadership.

That's in all caps as I noted, that tirade just one week after Trumps attorney argued in a court of law that a U.S. president cannot be prosecuted for ordering, ordering SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political opponent unless first impeached and convicted by the Senate. Let's bring in our expert CNN team. Joan, this Truth Social post ends with \"God bless the Supreme Court\". So one thing is maybe it's aimed at the Supreme Court. What might Supreme Court justices be thinking right now as they prepare to take up this immunity claim after the appeals court showdown?",

But the Supreme Court is also watching what's happening on the immunity question and the appellate court. It knows the contours of this case because both sides presented the general outlines in December when Special Counsel Jack Smith tried to get the Supreme Court to intervene early. They sent it back, of course, had the appellate court look at it, and I suspect that many of the justices are aware of the kinds of legal issues that emerged last week when the three-judge panel heard the case.And I think they would extend from even the most basic question of do courts have jurisdiction at this moment to look at the immunity question? Remember that were in the middle of proceedings and sometimes these appeals of discrete issues have to wait to the very end of a case. It's an interim appeal here and the lower court is hearing it, but we know that the lower court was also struggling with the jurisdictional question as the Supreme Court itself might, and then on the merits, Jake, I'm sure that they would have similar questions about whether okay. So if he lacks total immunity as his lawyers are arguing, what defenses might be left to him. So bottom line, Jake, they could go narrow, they could go broad, or they could say we will decide no case before its time",

That's how they're able to govern while in office is how they can conduct wars and implement policy without having personal liability. But the limits of this when it comes to arrest or criminalprosecution, have never been tested because no former president has ever been charged with a crime. And here as I noted, you have to be able to govern. So the first issue here is -- well, is what Trump was doing in and around election subversion, part of his official duties? Well, the special counsel says absolutely not. But Trumps lawyers argue, well, if you prosecute a president for this, that'll open a Pandora's box. You go after Biden for what's going on at the border. But again, the special counsel says, no, there has to be limits that there's no limits on this immunity, then you effectively have a king. Now, of Trump's own former lawyers, Tim Parlatore, he told me exactly who he thinks has the better argument here. Let's take a lesson (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "You know, I do. I think that this post was not really about legal issues, but more about a political strategy. We've seen Donald Trump use this and implement this type of tactic before. He is trying to get ahead of a potential ruling by posting about it on social media and arguing that he thinks he is or deserves absolute immunity.Then we've seen in poll after poll that this type of tactic does work at with his base. And we've also seen Donald Trump, you know, his voluntary court appearances, reeling against his legal issues repeatedly online as well as on the campaign trail, does very well with his base. But I think the question, Jake, that still remains is, how will this be viewed by general or potential general election voters? We know that many people are increasingly growing concerned about whether Donald Trump, if elected in 2024, would abuse his power and abuse the office. And this is another argument that they can point to. It's also ammunition being given to President Joe Biden, who as we've seen, has increasingly ramped up his attacks, likening Trump to being a threat to democracy, and so, this is more ammunition for him as well. And one thing I also just wanted the point out that I find very interesting is that this is not a ruling or a case that is brought before the Supreme Court yet. So I think that this kind of shows that Donald Trump may intend to lose or may anticipate that he's going to lose at the federal appeals level. And so this is him also just trying to get around that and free frame the narrative to in the court of public opinion and not the court of law",

But I think at this point, given this case and given the other case that's now pending before the justices, this testing whether he needs he can be removed from the ballot because if of its role in the January 6 attack on the capital, I think the justices are ready to seize the moment. They've accepted the fact that they're going to be in the middle of that.And I think the schedule that they set out for the other case, the one involving whether Trump can be removed from ballot shows that they're ready to act quickly. And I think once the D.C. circuit rules on this immunity question, we'll probably see some quick action, which frankly, as I said, could involve not taking it right now for jurisdictional reasons, but at least I think they understand that only those nine justices have the final say on the law, and Donald Trumps certainly recognizes that.

They pass a short-term extension that led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, the then-speaker, because members on the far right did not like the deal that he cut to allow the government to stay open. He had to step aside. Mike Johnson came in past another short-term extension. Johnson said he wouldn't move on anyway for short-term extension. But guess what?

And the Republican led house that was leading to questions because Mike Johnson, the speaker there, has indicated that he wants the Republican plan, perhaps he's not indicated he's willing to go is where the senators are willing to go at this moment.

And what's almost to be expected at this point, Jake is Republicans, Democrats came out with pretty different views about what Morris said. James Comer, who's the oversight chair, said that he still has a lot of questions about these loans more first made to Hunter, and even went as far as to say that Morris, who's a Democratic donor made these loans, is part of a way to curry favor with the president. Now, Jamie Raskin, who is the top Democrat on the oversight committee, had an entirely different picture to pain and said that there was no wrongdoing here, that Morris talked about his long relationship with Hunter and that there was never any conversations with the White House where the president about these loans, and he fully expects Hunter to pay him back.
