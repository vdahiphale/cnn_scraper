Were there any accomplices? Was this attack tied to the Cybertruck explosion outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas? There are notable similarities. Was this attack actually directed by ISIS or just inspired by the terror group? Just a short time ago, we learned the New Orleans attacker pleaded guilty to DUI charges in 2015, and police shared new details about a series of videos he allegedly recorded, one of which includes a pledge to ISIS. This morning, we're also learning more about the victims as witnesses now describe what they saw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUTH CHAVEZ, WITNESSED ATTACK:  We heard the gunshots and everyone started running and then they ended up locking us in the building and they shut all the doors, told us to get down. And when we came outside, that's when we saw the truck that was crashed right outside where we were at. And we saw the first responders trying to save a young man, and they were working on him for so long. And we were just hoping and praying he was going to survive. But there was no life in him at all.

You can see the large police presence is starting to lessen just a little bit, but that's where the focus of the investigation has been for the last 24 hours and evidence collection, the body removal, all that very much going on.But let's take a look at this video that was just 24 hours ago when that white truck, that Ford Lightning, turned onto Bourbon Street and accelerated. Of course, we blurred some of the images here, but that is what really devastated this scene. We know the suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, he's 42, a U.S. citizen from Texas, Army veteran, had an ISIS flag on the back of that truck. He discussed plans to even kill his family at one point. And then, of course, that video, chilling video, where he says he wanted to join ISIS. Take a listen to the FBI talk about this active investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We understand that this driver was in Las Vegas for about an hour driving around the strip before pulling up to Trump Tower before that explosion happened. And authorities say the driver rented the Cybertruck in Colorado via the Turo app before driving down to Las Vegas. Video released by law enforcement shows ex Explosives that were contained inside the truck, which included fireworks, gas tanks, and camping fuel, and all of that was connected to a detonation system that was controlled by the driver. And the sheriff pointed out, which is really incredible, how the Cybertruck actually contained the explosion, the way that it was built, forced the explosion to go upwards instead of outwards, which meant that the glass from Trump Tower was not broken, and seven people nearby were injured, but with minor injuries. All of them are okay. They've all been released from the hospital. The driver did die, and Las Vegas police believe that this was an isolated incident. They are not yet willing to say if this was, in fact, connected to what happened in New Orleans, but it is quite unusual that both the drivers in these incidents rented their cars from Turo. We do have a statement from Turo and they said they're cooperating with these investigations, but they also said that neither of the drivers had criminal backgrounds, which would have flagged them as security threats.

That's been ruled out. So, we still don't know if the FBI is quite as confident now that those four people have been ruled out about the presence of others.Nevertheless, there are other indicators here that could be forcing the investigators to broaden their search. And that is simply the fact that if these other suspected IEDs that were placed around the French Quarter are in fact connected to the driver of the truck, then there's a logistical challenge here. They're trying to determine, would it be possible for him to have created and placed those devices and then gotten in the truck and driven to his destined attack? So, it's simple logistical questions like that could be compelling the investigators to think, you know, this person probably had someone or some group of people helping him execute the attack.",

      "sentences": "It's a great question, John. So, ISIS has definitely been very forward-leaning in trying to recruit what we would think of typically as lone actors to strike out and acts of terrorism on their behalf in their home country. So, without ever traveling to Syria, without ever meeting an actual ISIS member in person, without receiving specified training, they do that through the propaganda that they distribute around the world on the internet. So, it really becomes a question of how do we think about those people who are inspired to act on ISIS's behalf.Typically, we refer to them simply as ISIS-inspired attacks. We think of that as an act of international terrorism, even though those folks may never have associated directly. But one of the ways that ISIS motivates them is to literally put out an instruction manual of how to do it. We know that ISIS in the past has advised their followers to obtain large, heavy vehicles to drive those vehicles into crowded areas at events to, run over and kill as many people as they can, and to also carry a secondary weapon so that when the truck is inevitably stopped at some point, the driver will be able to get out and continue the killing with a gun or a knife or some sort of bladed weapon. So, when we look at the details of this attack, it very closely matches exactly what ISIS has essentially asked its followers to do in their home country. So, I think the connection here on the inspired level is very good. To determine whether or not he's an actual operative who had contact and received direction from ISIS, that requires the community to go deep into its intelligence holdings to look at datasets like this dataset we acquire through FISA Section 702 to see if there have ever been communication connections between this actor and any of the known or suspected terrorists we are following overseas",
