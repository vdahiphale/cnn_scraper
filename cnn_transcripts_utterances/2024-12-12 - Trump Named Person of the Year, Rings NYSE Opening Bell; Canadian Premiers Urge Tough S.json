The latest of those companies, Meta, confirming that it donated a million dollars to Trump's Inaugural Fund. CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president-elect two weeks ago at Mar-a- Lago and if you think it feels like a major reversal, you're right. Remember, Meta, of course, banned Trump from its platforms after the January 6th Capitol riot. CNN media analyst Sara Fischer is with me. It is a large shift for Mark Zuckerberg, for Meta, but one that we have seen coming certainly in the last several weeks. What more do you expect to see from Mark Zuckerberg on this front?",

The message that it sends is that we support you as you head into this administration. You noted that Meta had Mark Zuckerberg, its CEO, had met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago a few weeks ago. That message, we have been told, is all about how can I support Donald Trump in investing in the American economy? I think, Erica, that is something that a lot of big tech CEOs, corporate CEOs are trying to get on board with, especially when you think about how Donald Trump has discussed his trade war with China. They want to be the ones who are helping to support the American economy, bringing jobs back here.

And if you are a big tech company that has to have a wide spread of users, if you're a media company that wants to grow your audience, I think this election was a wake-up call that you can't isolate half of the country just because of the way that you thought things should have gotten done, and I think that will definitely change the policies that we see coming out of these tech companies, Erica. You mentioned that meta had blocked Donald Trump before bringing him back. You know, many -- most internet platforms had banned him or blocked him after the January 6th siege, so this is a very, very big reversal in just a few years.

So what are the things they are looking at. In Canada, besides what the premier just said to the prime minister, they're looking at a list of retaliation. And some of that may include critical minerals, energy, fertilizer, things that perhaps the last time around weren't on the list may be this time around. And that also highlights the change in the economy, right? I mean, look, with all of this AI and the supercomputing, there is a higher demand for electricity. And Erica, you know as well as anyone, the grid is completely integrated, right? There is no border at certain times when it comes to energy between Canada and the United States. What were the president-elect's demands? Right. He wanted that enforcement on the border. He said he wanted the fentanyl across the border to stop, given what's going on in the southern border, the amounts -- on the Canadian border, on the northern side are minuscule, sill, Canada is saying, look, we are prepared to put 700 million additional US dollars on that border. It is something we would like, too. So they're at the table negotiating. But I think this is what is really getting under a lot of people's collar. I mean, look, the president himself, the president-elect posting after he had a dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Trudeau, which he thought would actually kind of quell some of the concern, it didn't work. He posts: \"It was a pleasure to have dinner the other night with Governor (governor) Justin Trudeau at the great state of Canada. I look forward to seeing the governor again soon, so that we may continue our in-depth talks on tariffs and trade.\" I mean, look, Erica, some people say that this is trolling, that it is just a joke. But what it does do is stiffen the spines of Canadians and it means that, you know, for better or for worse, it means that these politicians can actually talk tougher and perhaps put in tougher retaliatory tariffs if they need to, given how the president-elect is now, for lack of a better term, trolling the prime minister.

That was a question that we were seeing leading up to the election that peoples fear.I have -- I do a podcast with Dan Ives, number one tech analyst in my opinion in the world, and he is very much in the pulse of what is going on in tech and in AI and globally as well. And I asked him that question, I said, what are the fears? You know when we were weighing out whether Kamala Harris would be president and/or Mr. Trump and the fear about Mr. Trump obviously was all about the tariff question and how that would impact AI and how that it would impact the whole tech sector in general. And then once Mr. Trump brought Elon Musk into the inner circle that they felt that they had carved out a little bit of protection because they didn't feel -- they felt that Elon was going to protect the tech sector from Mr. Trump going on the all-out defensive -- offensive, excuse me around tariffs, whether it will affect an individual country or an individual sector on the stock market. So once they brought Elon into the fold, they felt they had carved out some kind of a cushion and that we would not be fearful of Mr. Trump being president and having that effect on the tech sector. Look, we know that about Mr. Trump. He is a wild card. Right? And I am hoping that he is not going to -- look, the past administration has left us with one of the most amazing four years of a stock market coming out of COVID. Surely the last -- this year itself, up 27 percent in the S&amp;P, literally just a day ago, hitting record highs, we broke through 20,000 on NASDAQ. We were at record highs in the Russell and the S&amp;P and the Dow. So the market couldn't be any better. It couldn't have been a better year. So I am hopeful that Mr. Trump is going to surround himself by people who are bright enough to know that look, that whether he wants to raise tariffs or not, we do not want to interrupt the incredible market that we've had over the last number of years, you know, and find a softer way to handle his aggressiveness around the tariff question.

He gave a number of reasons for why things have changed, for why there is more optimism in the air. He said that following the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, that Hamas seems to have changed its negotiating posture somewhat, recognizing that it was no longer receiving the support of Hezbollah and that perhaps, other actors that it had hoped would come into play in its defense ultimately will not. At the same time, he also indicated that there were changes on the Israeli side as well, noting that Israel has killed Hamas' leader, Yahya Sinwar, and that some of its other military successes in Gaza may have made Israel more willing to reach for an agreement.

Where is she? Where's my brother? Where's my husband? Where are they? Doctor Ahmed Abdullah shows us into the morgue where about 35 bodies have been brought in. Discovered in a military hospital days after the regime fell, they are believed to be some of the last victims of Bashar al-Assad. Take a look, this is the crime of the regime, he says. Even in the Middle Ages, they didn't torture people like this. Another man points to their tattered clothing, evidence he says that most were detainees at the much feared Saydnaya prison. Even in death, they are still only identified by numbers. Everyone here heard about the horrors that took place in Assad's notorious prisons. But to see it up close is something entirely different. A lot of them have bruises, have horrible wounds that seem to be consistent with torture. I just saw one woman retching as she came out of the other room. Families are now going through trying to see if their loved ones are here. (Voice-over): There's not enough room for all of them in the morgue so a makeshift area has been set up outside. More and more families stream in. The light from their cell phones the only way of identifying the dead. My only son, I don't have another, they took him for 12 years now just because he said no. 12 years, my only son, this woman shouts. I don't know anything about him. I ask Allah to burn him, she says, of Assad. Burn him and his sons like he burned my heart. A crowd swarms when they see our camera. Everyone here has lost someone. All of these people are asking us to take the names of their loved ones to help them try to find them. (Voice-over): It is a mark of desperation. Such is the need for answers. But finding those answers will not be easy. At the military intelligence facility known as the Palestine Branch, officers burned documents and destroyed hard drives before fleeing.

And as any ECB or general central bank nerd worth their saltknows, it's not just about the rate decision, but all the language that comes along with it. And I think really interesting in this meeting because they've actually dropped a line that has been in every single rate decision for months and months, years, I think, where they've said they're going to keep interest rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as needed. That is now gone, which certainly suggests that not only are we likely to see more rate cuts ahead, but perhaps that rate might not always be restrictive. It may go below the so-called neutral rate. And actually that's what markets are pricing in. ING is one bank. They think the rate will drop to under 2 percent by next summer. And why, why are we seeing so many rate cuts sort of forecast perhaps ahead? Well, this is largely due to the very anemic growth we're seeing in the Eurozone, barely growing at all, not helped by political turmoil both in France and in Germany, the two biggest members of the Eurozone.

But also very recently, she did a long interview with the \"Financial Times\" in which she essentially said the strategy for Europe needs to be to avoid a trade war. And if it comes to it, she actually mentioned a checkbook strategy, i.e. throw some money at it, buy more American products, be it LNG, be it agricultural products. What Europe really can't afford right now is a trade war with its biggest partner, which is the U.S., while its economy is so anemic.
