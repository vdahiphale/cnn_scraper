And already, 75 million Americans have cast their ballot in what has been a tumultuous election cycle. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have stops in Pennsylvania today, and no matter the outcome, history is on the ballot for both candidates. If Trump wins, it would be one of the most staggering political comebacks nearly four years after his infamous January 6th speech, and in the same year that he was convicted of a crime and survived two attempts on his life. And if Harris wins, she would shatter the -- she would shatter the ceiling after nearly 250 years of men securing the role of commander in chief. She would become the first woman U.S. president. Here's what she said in the battleground state of Pennsylvania a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  But over these next 24 hours, let's -- let's enjoy this moment to knock on a neighbors door and in their face, even if we've not met them, know that we have a lot that we care about in common and that we are optimistic about the future of our country, that we love our country, and that that's what this fight is about and about the promise of America and the promise of America being represented by everybody who's here.

The vice president not even mentioning the former president by name, because in these closing hours, their belief is that the former president's record, his rhetoric has now been well-litigated. And at this time she has to do all that she can to excite the base of the party. And then consolidate various coalitions across the country. And she's ending the campaign here in vote rich Pennsylvania with its 19 electoral votes. They are confident in the ground game that they have employed here, and the diversity of the state. That's why you see her just about everywhere. She started the day in Scranton. She's headed here soon to Allentown, Pennsylvania, which has more than 30,000 Puerto Rican voters and then after that, she goes on to Reading and then ends the day in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

And we've got seven remaining yellow toss up battleground states. And as you know, those battleground states are razor thin. Look at these are a poll of polls in the battleground states. No clear leader in any of them, in any of these battleground states. So this is razor thin. So what is the path to victory for each candidate? Well, the Harris campaign will say that their best, most direct path to 270 electoral votes is through the blue wall. If she were to win Pennsylvania Michigan, and Wisconsin, she'd be at 270 electoral votes, and the next president. But what if Donald Trump repeats his 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, then Harris drops down to 251 and she has to go hunting in the Sunbelt to find some more votes. Certainly, if she were able to flip North Carolina from red to blue this time, that would get her knocking on the door to 270. And then maybe Nevada behaves like it has for Democrats in recent cycles, and that would put Harris over the top in that scenario. What about Donald Trump's path? Well, let's reset the map. Seven yellow battleground states and Donald Trump's most direct path is to hang on to North Carolina. That is the state he won by the narrowest margin four years ago. In fact, its the only state he one of the seven battleground states. And let's say he flips Georgia back. You'll recall he famously lost it by just fewer than 12,000 votes. So let's say that ends up back in his column and let's say he does get that Pennsylvania victory repeated from 2016. That's it. He'll be at 270 electoral votes. He doesn't need any of the rest of the battleground states. But what if Harris does pull it out in Pennsylvania? Then where does Donald Trump go for the next 19 electoral votes. Well, even if he were to win Nevada and Arizona out west, that still would not get him to 270. He would need at least one of the other remaining so-called blue wall states, such as Michigan. And that would do the trick. And get him over the top at 283. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

MEGHAN HAYS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF MESSAGE PLANNING:  Well, first, I don't think you can live and die by the polls as I've said many times, but I don't think that that the vice president is actually going to win Iowa. What I do think is interesting in this poll is the lead she's taking among women, especially white women, and 65 and older women, and then also with rural voters. So I do think that some of the key demographics here could -- could be telling for the other states like Wisconsin or Michigan in the Midwest. So it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.

So men and women, 65 and older, he performed very well. In 2020, he performed fairly well as well, the most recent polls outside of that poll in Iowa, the recent Siena poll, \"New York Times\"/Siena poll suggested that he's behind maybe two points from his performance in 2020. Now, that actually does make me nervous. So the competitiveness with women doesn't surprise me the potential decrease in strength or competitiveness with older voters does surprise me.

But the idea that you're encouraging spouses and this would also apply for men.I'm saying this as a man, you should have that conversation as someone who's married with your wife and maybe the wife may say, well, honey, I'm, you know, with all due respect, you vote for Trump. I'm going to vote for Harris, I certainly respect that. But the idea that spouses are keeping stuff from each other, I don't like that. I can only speak for my own marriage. People do what they will with their own relationships but I don't think that's healthy. With that said, no, I don't think there's a surprising vote or group of women that support Harris. Again, I've been saying this for two years now. Overturning Roe v. Wade is like the dog catching up to the car. Well, what happens next from the Republicans perspective, you fought 40, 50 years to overturn this darn thing. You finally gotten it, and now were realizing the political ramifications. We have two years worth of electoral data that shows us we are just not strong on this issue. Several months ago, I did a focus group with rural evangelical voters in South Georgia, and I talked and focused on this issue, and I asked the voters there if Donald Trump were to take a different posture on this issue he always says, well, it's up to the states. I said, what if he took it a step further, and said, it's up to the states, but not in terms of the legislature making the decision but ballot initiatives -- meaning the voters have the right to vote on the issue? Would you agree with that, even if it meant your state voted to protect the right to an abortion or reproductive rights? They all said yes, and one gentleman stood out to me. He said, sure, Michael what works in Atlanta isn't necessarily what's going to work in South Georgia. Their values are different from our values and I'm okay with that. And so what that revealed to me at least qualitatively, is that there are a lot of Republicans out there who may say, hey, this isn't my thing. But if there are a lot of women who want access to it, I'm okay with that, because that doesn't impact necessarily my values.

Those were the thunderstorms right there, right over the airport in Barcelona, 150 millimeters fell in just four hours. And that's the kind of weather were probably going to see over the next couple of days -- very, very localized rainfall which means we're not going to get widespread flooding, but because the ground is already so saturated, there's no place for any of the rainfall to soak in, it's just going to run off. So yes, there are still some risks here from about Barcelona down to Valencia. But in smaller little pockets of some of this rain making its way onshore and when a storm like we saw on the other map gets stuck, that's when the potential for increased rainfall rates and obviously increased runoff. Here's Valencia proper, and this is what all of this is all about. Take a look at the dry riverbed here, the dry up through here and then after the rainfall everything turns brown. This is a river that rarely runs any water at all in fact, so much so that there's grass growing in the riverbed but not anymore. This is the area that the people are talking about that they really need help. There's a roadway. There's a back here to the river very, very far away.

So she has Visa stock and she sells her stock the day before it was announced that visa is under major federal investigation, I don't know. I wonder, do you think she had any insider information?

He's winning with men, but that isn't sufficient to overcome the woman's vote because women are a majority of the electorate in all 50 states.

And it shows Harris beating Trump 51 percent to 47 percent in the popular vote.Now, how that translates into the Electoral College, nobody can say and I certainly cant tell from the numbers that I've seen, but that's a good sign for Harris. Now, the Iowa poll was a shock to the entire political community. Nobody had even thought about Iowa being a competitive state. I sure no, I hadn't, and yet even though Trump carried it twice by eight percentage points, this shows him behind by three. Do I really believe Trump is going to lose Iowa? No, I don't, but the reason this is significant is because his former base was composed of states like Iowa, a farm state in the middle of the country. Some people call it flyover country. I don't. It's great territory. And because Trump had done so well there before, the idea that women over 65 and independent women who are not affiliated with either party were moving in large numbers to Kamala Harris, is very significant.

So it's not really one election that Americans will have on Tuesday.But if you count Washington, D.C., where each state holds its own election to then allocate their Electoral College votes. They appoint electors essentially instead of while -- while voters are voting for a candidate. Really, what they're doing is choosing slates of electors. Those people will meet in December in state capitals to cast votes and then on January 6th of next year, all the votes will be sent to Washington, D.C. where they'll be counted. So we have these 538 electors that's tied to representation in Congress, 100 senators and 435 members of Congress, plus three extra votes for Washington, D.C. I could go on.

But under the Biden-Harris administration, those military exercises between South Korea and the United States have begun once again.
