I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. In just hours, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will meet on that Philadelphia stage for what might be their only presidential debate of the 2024 election. Debate host ABC News shared this first look at the stage. Harris and Trump will stand behind podiums just a few feet apart. Their microphones will be muted when it is not their turn to speak. Tonight will be the first time that the candidates meet each other in person. Trump didn't attend Biden and Harris's inauguration after he refused to acknowledge the results of the 2020 election. This one night presents Harris with the opportunity to introduce herself to millions of Americans and to voters who, polls show, say that they need to learn more about her. The vice president has been preparing intensely for tonight and for an opponent unlike any she has debated before. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS (via phone): He plays from this really old and tired playbook, right, where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go.

Welcome to all of you. Thank you so much for being here.Mark, big day. Debates, how much do they matter? How much does this one matter? What are you looking for tonight? MARK MCKINNON, FORMER ADVISOR TO GEORGE W. BUSH AND JOHN MCCAIN: Tension city, baby, Georgia H.W. Bush used to say. There's so much on the line, particularly for Harris. I mean, it doesn't matter what Trump's going to do. He's not going to move the needle with one vote tonight, I doubt. But Harris has a real opportunity. Thirty percent of voters feel like they don't know enough about her yet. So, this is all about her opportunity to define herself and also Trump's opportunity to do the same about her. So, that's what I look for. And -- and the key here, I say, and I wrote in my \"Vanity Fair\" piece this week, is it's all about confidence. If you've ever done debate training, the key to a candidate getting out there is, I mean, in a sense, this is kind of \"Game of Thrones.\" She's Sansa Stark. He's Hodor. You've got to get and say -- you're going to get him, baby. Both -- both internally and externally, she's got to show strength, confidence, and go just kick some ass.",

So, she has raised the stakes in this debate, and that's also why you've seen her really holed up in Pittsburgh. The one anxiety I hear from a lot of Democrats, both Biden administration officials, Harris officials, former and current, is like, is this new Kamala or old Kamala, right?

And right on cue, we have a looming tropical storm, and soon to be hurricane, threat right along the Gulf Coast states. Sixty-five-mile-per-hour winds with Tropical Storm Francine still just located off the Texas -- South Texas coastline. You can see the swirl in the latest radar, some sort of a semblance of an eye trying to form. There are some outer rainbands reaching the U.S. mainland. This would be extreme Southern Texas. But it's really where it's going to go from here. You can see the hurricane warnings that are in place across the Texas -- rather, from Texas border through Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center still has this intensifying to a Category 2, making landfall sometime mid-day to late evening on Wednesday. So that's for the day tomorrow. Timing this out, you can see tropical-storm-force winds enter into the equation by about noon. And then we really pick up in intensity from Harline (ph) to New Orleans and then the Baton Rouge region could experience tropical-storm-force winds. Those could knock down some trees and take down power, as well. On top of that storm surge threat, five to ten feet in some of the greatest hit areas. That's above dry ground. There will be a flash flood component along with the potential for isolated tornadoes as this soon-to-be-hurricane moves on shore tomorrow afternoon -- Kasie.",
