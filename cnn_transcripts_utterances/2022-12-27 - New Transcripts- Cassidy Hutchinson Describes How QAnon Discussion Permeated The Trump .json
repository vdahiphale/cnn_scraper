Also tonight, the question thousands of angry stranded passengers are asking at this hour, \"What's going on with Southwest Airlines? Why are they subjecting travelers to so much chaos? How will the Airline make it up to those passengers?\" And, the Supreme Court, allowing that, Trump-era border policy, to stay in place. That's the one that sends migrants back to Mexico to wait for their asylum hearings? So, what does this mean, for the mess, at the border, tonight? Will it change anything? And whose responsibility is it to fix this? We have a lot to talk about tonight. But let's start with the new transcripts, from the January 6 committee, and CNN's Justice Correspondent, Jessica Schneider. So, tell us what's in these, Jess?",

That was actually right after she had fired her Trump-world attorney, and her new attorney was letting her correct the record, and really tell every truth, to the Committee.So first off, she told the Committee that she saw Mark Meadows burning documents, in his office fireplace, around a dozen times, which she guessed amounted to about once or twice a week, all between December 2020 and January 2021. And she says at least twice, she saw Mark Meadows burning documents, after he met with Republican congressman, Scott Perry. Perry, meanwhile, he'd been subpoenaed by the Committee, but he never complied. Then there's another account that Hutchinson says Mark Meadows actually told White House staffers, during the transition, that they should keep a close hold on their meetings. So, she says he put it this way. \"I remember him having a meeting with Oval Office saying: Let's keep some meetings close hold. We will talk about what that means, but for now, we will keep things real tight and private so things don't start to leak out.\" And Hutchinson expanded upon that. She said that these meetings were essentially kept off the books. They were out of the Oval Office diary, essentially, there'd be no record of these meetings. So, Alisyn, between this detail and also Hutchinson observing Meadows burning documents, a lot of questions, a lot more, tonight, now that this transcript is out, about what exactly Meadows was trying to hide and, Alisyn, really, who he might be trying to protect.",

You tell me what's going to happen, during those four years? I'm not looking forward to that. And, by the way, Cassidy Hutchinson, she didn't want to do that.

Hackers stole data, belonging to multiple electric utilities, in this October ransomware attack, on a U.S. government contractor that handles critical infrastructure projects, across the country. This is according to a memo, describing the hack that has just been obtained by CNN.The contractor is a Chicago-based Sargent &amp; Lundy. It's an engineering firm that designed more than 900 power stations, and thousands of miles of power systems. And that firm also works with the Department of Defense, Energy and other Energy - agencies, to strengthen nuclear deterrence. So, this news comes just days after an attack on four power substations, in Washington State, that left thousands of people in the dark on Christmas Day, as well as a number of other attacks, on power stations, across the country, over the last few months. Joining us now to discuss this is Phil Mudd. Phil, thanks for coming back. Does it sound like these--",

That is stealing stuff or shutting down a system, and telling a company, or a contractor, they want millions of dollars, to get that system back up and running. I guess the thing I worry about, when I see all these events, going into this century, is looking at the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, who've got to be reading U.S. newspapers, and watching CNN, and trying to understand how much they have - might have stolen, or compromised, over the past decade, and what they would do, if they wanted.

You've got to have a requirement, from the White House, for example, that those people have plans, to respond to an event like this, that they are required to report it. And, by the way, companies don't like reporting this stuff, because it's not that great for the stock, when people outside realize that your company is vulnerable. You've got to have plans for dealing with private entities, contractors, who are vulnerable.
