      "sentences": "Right. Good morning, Sara. That's right. I am here just near where Donald Trump still is after his speech last night and holding a private fund-raiser.And I do want to focus on the fund-raising aspect of that event. Donald Trump and his team are viewing this indictment largely through the lens of his re-election campaign and they think that his charges -- or these charges, at least in the short term, will have a political boost but also a fund-raising boost for his reelection campaign. And shortly after Donald Trump left yesterday, his team fired off a campaign email. It read, quote, \"I'm writing you this email as I fly back from the Miami federal courthouse where I was arraigned as an innocent man by the corrupt Biden administration.\" Now I think one thing, Donald Trump's relationship with some of these donors at the club last night, he is hoping to hold onto these wealthy donors that he had during his 2016 campaign. But some sources are telling my colleague, Kristen Holmes, and I that there are some concerns that some of these wealthy donors could defect. And we have seen some of these defections already from some of these donors. But the worry is that if these indictments continue to mount, they could see more of that. But I should also point out that Donald Trump's team maintains that he still gets his best fund-raising from the small dollar donors, the same thing that we saw when he was president, and that they do expect him to bring in a lot of money, not just from that event last night but in the days immediately after following the announcement of that indictment, Sara.",

He's been arrested and he has restrictions placed upon him.So there's going to be a lot of attention paid to that going forward. I want to go over a couple of things that happen in the near future. Right now, over the next two weeks, Walt Nauta, his co-defendant, still needs to enter a plea, just like Donald Trump did yesterday when his attorney stood up and said he was not guilty. He has not done that. So he will do that. That has to happen to kick off the case. And after that, prosecutors will be providing a list, both to Trump and his legal team as well as Walt Nauta and his lawyers, with a list of people that they cannot discuss the details of the case with, people that could be potential witnesses. And also they can't talk to one another about the details of this case. And then there's also the path to trial, right? Prosecutors will be turning over evidence to the criminal defense team so that they can get ready, so they will get to see everything the Justice Department has collected to charge this case, take it through the grand jury. But that is a really significant thing that Donald Trump is now under a court order that he can't talk to people about this case and also that his words publicly, if he's talking about the case publicly or to law enforcement officials, it can be used against him in the court of law. And even last night when he was at Bedminster, giving his speech, he had said that he had every right to keep documents under the Presidential Records Act. That's going to be a legal argument that his team is likely to make during this path to trial. But it's also something that could come up in the case if the Justice Department wants to use his own words, saying, yes, he did know he had these documents. He says, even after he's charged and in court and arrested, they were his documents to keep -- John.",

But a defendant can waive that right and ask for more time. If this does go to trial, it could be months before it begins. That's because, while federal law forces federal government to bring a case to trial within 70 days, that deadline, can of course, be extended. Then there's the process known as discovery, when prosecutors have turn over their evidence to the defense. Both sides will have to work out a timeline for that. There may also be more court hearings to set deadlines and agreements on how the evidence should be handled. There's also the possibility that Trump's team files pre-trial motions that could ask the judge to simply dismiss the case or to keep certain evidence from being used at trial. It is unclear at this point if or when Trump will be due back in court. But his co-defendant and his close aide, Walt Nauta, is set to be arraigned on June 27th. Rahel.",

And the people who need to review those documents, the president's lawyers, his co-defendant's lawyers and ultimately a jury, they are all going to have to go through security clearances by the government to make sure that they are able to review those documents.

Let me push in here, because this is -- you can just make out where the Ukrainians have started to take back a sliver of this territory that's been held by the Russians for more than a year. Why do you think this appears to be the focus right now of the counteroffensive? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, John, I think one of the key things about this is that they're going for the Sea of Azov. And if they can make their way down to the Sea of Azov, that will cut the land bridge between the Donbas region and the Russian-occupied parts of the Donbas region and Russian-occupied Crimea. Once they do that, the Ukrainians will not only have that path to the Sea of Azov but they will have broken off a large hold that the Russians have had since February of 2022 on this area.
