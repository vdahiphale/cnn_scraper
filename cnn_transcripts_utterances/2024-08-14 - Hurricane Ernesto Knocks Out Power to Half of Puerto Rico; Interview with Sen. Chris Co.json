      "sentences": "Maybe if we kind of average it out about 200 miles northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. So we're going to get a new update here around 5 o'clock. So that will help things out a little bit for where it exactly is.But it was very windy at St. Kitts and St. Thomas, St. Croix, even the islands there east of Puerto Rico, almost 86 mile per hour gusts there. But look at this. This is six hours of radar for Puerto Rico. Hour after hour of training thunderstorms over the same places causing flash flood warnings. And that's what was causing all of those water -- drinking water issues. Here you go. This is where it's going to go though from here to Bermuda as a category two, possibly even a category three for a time. We'll see. The water is very warm. This is certainly a possibility. Could it get stronger? Absolutely. Will it? Yes, likely. But where does it go after that? Well, here's where the models are thinking it's going and right under that M is Bermuda. So very close to the right side of the eyewall on this one model. There are many models out there to choose from. So we'll kind of spread it around a little bit. Here's a wave model. If you're up and down the East Coast this weekend, there will be huge waves, dangerous surf here on the East Coast. Waves that don't look like the Atlantic Ocean whatsoever. So stay out of the water because it's going to be one of those rip current kind of weekends. Here's another model. This is when I showed you about 1:30 or so where it was taking it into Nova Scotia after it left Bermuda. Well now the newest run as promised is in no longer hitting Nova Scotia, but a very close pass to Newfoundland. So yes, this thing still could get a little bit stronger and make its way at least toward the North Atlantic Coast, not the U.S. coast. But right now it is a healthy storm getting stronger. Hurricane Hunter will be in it in just an hour or two -- Boris.",

And for many folks, including -- We just had a story we highlighted today. Folks that are receiving Social Security, the same dollar for them doesn't go nearly as far. So how does she need to craft a different narrative around the economy that incorporates the strain that so many Americans are feeling despite some of the positive numbers you laid out?",

The Biden-Harris administration has been working hard at improving the affordability of housing in the United States, and that's something I expect we'll hear even more from Vice President Harris about this week and in the weeks ahead. SANCHEZ: We're also expecting to hear more from the vice president on foreign policy and explicitly defining her view of the United States' role in the world, including in Gaza. And on that issue, she has to balance messaging to several constituencies. I'm wondering how tricky you think that is as an issue for her to navigate as a candidate. How would you advise her?",

I appreciate the implicit compliment, but what matters is working hard together to make sure that we win this November, that there's a Democratic majority in the Senate, that Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are the next president and vice president. There's plenty of time for conversations like that after the election. We have not discussed it beforehand.I do think that having traveled with her overseas and gotten to see and hear the vice president's strength and skills and ability in diplomacy and national security policy, I very much look forward to a Harris-Walz administration and to the positive difference they could make in the world.",

Politico is reporting that President Biden does harbor some frustration, is the word that they use, toward members of his own party that he believes pushed him out of the presidential race.

And President Biden was positive, was looking forward, was weighing what he can get done in the next five months. On Monday, he was very much looking forward to the Cancer Moonshot event in Tulane.He's looking forward to speaking to the convention in Chicago this coming week. The First Lady has a bold initiative around women's health and continues to be an advocate for educational opportunity and access. The Bidens, as a couple, continue to support our military families. And there's important work left to be done on the world stage. There will be a new Prime Minister in Japan in just a few weeks. And the relationship between South Korea, Japan, and the United States is the strongest it's ever been. The AUKUS partnership for providing nuclear submarines to Australia is a critical, groundbreaking new partnership. I think you'll see President Biden looking forward, working to make a difference on the world stage and here at home. And I very much look forward to supporting him in that work in the remaining months of his term this year.",

She died last October from a severe allergic reaction after eating at a restaurant in Disney Springs where he says the waiter guaranteed the couple that certain foods could be made allergen free. Now Disney is trying to get the case dismissed and sent to arbitration based on terms he agreed to years ago when he signed up for a free one month trial of Disney+.The company also claims it should be shielded based on the man using one of its websites to buy tickets to Epcot. Joining us now is defense attorney, Misty Marris. Misty, I'm pretty sure nobody thinks when they sign up for Disney+, a free one month trial that they're signing their rights away to a jury trial if something goes wrong. Is that normal?",

      "sentences": "It's absolutely a very novel legal argument, Jessica. This is something that Disney is looking to do because they want to keep this out of the courtroom and before a jury. Arbitration is often a venue that's seen as more favorable to the defendant, especially with a sympathetic case like this where you have someone who died from an allergic reaction, have it before a judge behind closed doors.But look, when I went through this Disney agreement and I read it in anticipation of this story and covering it with you today, it relates directly to the app. Remember, these are contracts. A reasonable person is not going to think that signing up for Disney+, is going to take away any right when they're physically in one of the Disney parks. And that's going to be part and parcel of the plaintiff's argument. Not to look at just the arbitration agreement that's in here, the contractual language, but to look at it in total in context with the other provisions of this agreement when you sign up for the application. So those are what the arguments are going to be on both sides.",
