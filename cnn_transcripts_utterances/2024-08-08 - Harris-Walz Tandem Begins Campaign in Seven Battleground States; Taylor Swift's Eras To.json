Thanks for having me. And this election has a totally different feel to it from just a couple of weeks ago. You're absolutely right. It wasn't long ago that Trump had emerged defiant from the assassination attempt. There was excitement about who his V.P. pick was going to be. Then there was a GOP convention where Trump was welcomed almost as a messianic figure. Trump's campaign was talking about putting money into states that Republicans hadn't competed in in years. Now it's a totally different story. He's complaining that he's having to beat two candidates, Joe Biden and now Kamala Harris. Harris' rollout of her campaign, her endorsements, the way she's consolidated support, all of it has been really impressive. And I think Trump just knows that the limelight is not with him right now. And so he'd rather spend money and energy after, kind of, this honeymoon period is over. I think we're going to see a lot more of Trump after the Democratic convention. But meanwhile, he's really kind of lacking energy and struggling to keep on message. FOSTER: Yeah, they've got a message, haven't they, on Walz, which is questioning his military record.

And that fed security concerns on social media. We heard from Barracuda Music. This is the promoter for Taylor Swift's concerts in Austria. And they issued the following statement. They said this quote \"With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Hoppe Stadium. We have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety,\" unquote. Now, Swift's official Website says all tickets for the shows will be automatically refunded. Now, let's get to the arrests. On Wednesday morning, police arrested a 19 year old Austrian citizen who pledged allegiance to Islamic State. This arrest took place and I believe we have the map for you. It took place in Ternitz, which is located south of Vienna. And it was there that's where officials found chemical substances at the suspect's home. And that signals a possible link to bomb making. Now, later on Wednesday, they detained another person in Vienna. And police say that the two suspects, both of them, were radicalized by the Internet and that they were taking, quote, \"concrete measures for a terror attack.\" The assumed target here, events in the greater Vienna region. Now Austrian police, they say, and this is interesting, they said that further detentions have been made in relation to the alleged plot and they've also increased surveillance.

But the difference is that obviously Iran certainly seems to be pondering its response more so. But on top of that, Hezbollah, of course, being on Israel's doorstep, can carry out responses with little to no notice. I should also point out that the simmering tit-for-tat strikes that we've seen over the past 10 months was continuing. Yesterday Israel was saying that Hezbollah launched 10 projectiles and three drones towards it and that it responded by taking out a rocket launcher and also by taking out, by dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure.

Police beefed up their presence as well. Most of the right-wingers didn't show up at the immigration and visa processing centers that were thought to be the targets here. Now this comes after the U.K.'s worst bout of anti-immigrant violence in more than a decade. Over the weekend, rioters clashed with police and damaged public buildings. There are reports the app Telegram has been used to organize the riots. The platform says its moderators are now removing calls to violence.

The suspects were allegedly radicalized online and one claims to be an ISIS sympathizer. Organizers have canceled all three of the Vienna shows. Thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets here in the U.K. on Wednesday as a message of solidarity for migrant communities to counter far-right anti-immigrant sentiment and violence.

The GOP is seizing on his dozens of visits to the country over the past 35 years, taking students on school trips and even going there on his honeymoon. CNN's Will Ripley has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the summer of 1989, about two months after China's military massacred pro- democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, Tim Walz, an American teacher fresh out of college, traveled halfway around the world to China, paying respects in Beijing, where so many people died. TIM WALZ (D), THEN-MINNESOTA REPRESENTATIVE: I felt it was more important than ever to go, to make sure that story was told and to let the Chinese people know we were standing there, we were with them. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Welcome the next Vice President of the United States, Tim Walz! RIPLEY (voice-over): 35 years before becoming the Democratic nominee for Vice President, Walz volunteered to spend a year in China, teaching English and American history to mainland Chinese students. The Nebraska native later telling his hometown newspapers he was treated like a king, and there was no anti-American feeling whatsoever. Walz moved to Minnesota, teaching high school there for years. He got married on June 4, 1994, the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. He wanted to have a date he'll always remember, his wife told a local paper at the time. They spent their honeymoon taking students on a two-week tour of China, Hong Kong and Macau. Those student trips became a summer tradition. CARA ROMHILDT, FORMER STUDENT OF MR. WALZ: I would go back in a heartbeat, in a heartbeat, because it wasn't political for us. It wasn't any of that. It was an educational trip with one of our favorite teachers. RIPLEY (voice-over): Cara Romhildt says she and her classmates still talk about their trip to China with Mr. Walz in 1998.",

And this illustrates the challenge that China will face in portraying Tim Walz. Yes, he made around 30 trips to China. He humanizes the Chinese people. He knows how things work over there.But he's also co-sponsored a series of resolutions supporting human rights in China and Hong Kong and has been a fierce critic of the Chinese government. Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei. (END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: Moscow says hundreds of Ukrainian troops have crossed the border and launched an incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian forces have pushed several miles into Russia as Moscow scrambled troops and fighter jets to hold them back. That appears to be the largest cross-border attack since the war began, reportedly also involving tanks and armored vehicles. For more, we're joined by Clare Sebastian here in London. It does feel like the game has changed here.",

Can they do something independently of Iran? Can they defy Iran in terms of their reaction? Or is all this actually directed from and supervised by Iran?And that has to do, or that affects, rather, the main question that is on people's minds here in Israel, and that is whether or not this is going to be a coordinated attack, meaning from Iran and from Hezbollah. Is it going to be sequential, meaning it could start with Hezbollah and then Iran will join in contingent on how wide, broad the scope of the Israeli reprisal will be? Or, which you see in the last few days and you alluded to it, could this just be a Hezbollah-Israeli thing and the Iranians will stay outside of this and just wait for the right opportunity or the right target?

And Hezbollah may not be interested in that.You know, that is as far as the speculation and the guesstimates go. But you asked about the sense. The sense is anxiety and uncertainty. You know, everyone has a sister or brother or a friend who knows, supposedly, and he said or she said Thursday, and then they said Saturday, and now they're saying the next Thursday. No one really knows. And look, there are some tangible pieces of information here. There were 132 air carriers that flew into Israel regularly. Now there are only 24. The airport is basically empty. People are going out less. You can even sense it in the traffic. It's that palpable. And so the mood is sort of anticipation, expectation, and, you know, and dark black humor.",

He is now celebrating gold, having taken the 400 meters victory in a personal best time. It was a quick one, the fourth fastest time ever run over the distance. He came from fourth to first to beat the pre-race favorite, Matthew Hudson- Smith. The fight and the grit, the expressions you can see clear for everybody to see. He was asked how he did it. He said, well, you can't outrun a dog. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUINCY HALL, U.S. OLYMPIC ATHLETE: The race was anyone's at that point. I just wanted to keep doing what my coach told me to do. Just keep driving, keep driving, get home. We do a lot of hard practices and then we focus on coming home at the end of each practice. So that was nothing more than just me trying to go hard, just harder and harder than what I'm used to doing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
