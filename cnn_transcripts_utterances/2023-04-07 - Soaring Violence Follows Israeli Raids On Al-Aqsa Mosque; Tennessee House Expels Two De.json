Two days after Israeli forces stormed one of Islam's holiest sites, the Israeli military announced new strikes on both Gaza and Lebanon, saying it went after targets belonging to Hamas militants, and that's after a flurry of rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel, most of them reportedly intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome.Now, the U.S. Israel Defense Forces retaliated with yet another round of airstrikes on Gaza, which Hamas controls. The Palestinian health ministry meantime says one of those strikes damaged a pediatric hospital. And, of course, it terrified the children inside. Israel blames Palestinian militants for a barrage of rocket attacks from Lebanon into Northern Israel. Meantime, many were intercepted, but there was some damage. It was the largest attack from Lebanese soil since the war with Hezbollah 17 years ago. Now, meantime, Hamas released a statement saying it, quote, holds the Israeli occupation fully responsible for the consequences of such grave aggression, which reflects the atrocious nature of the fascist Israeli leaders and their policies. Hamas is calling on the Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation to intervene. Now all this anger began boiling over after Israeli police raids on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is extremely sacred to Muslims. CNN's Hadas Gold has our details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I think that Netanyahu is trying to limit the scale of violence by pinpointing only the Hamas as the ones who are responsible for the violence, and not talking about Iran or its proxies like Hezbollah and others. So I think that what we saw now, the retaliated by the Israeli forces, will be relatively limited, but no one knows what will happen.

And then sometimes it works. No doubt that the Hezbollah knew about this, what's going to happen. But I think that Netanyahu is -- knows that a overall clash, and not only with the Hamas, but also with Hezbollah, or maybe Iran, would be very, very difficult to handle.But, you know, you mentioned the scale of violence.

And so we've seen his popularity rating taken quite a tumble. It's incredibly low.In fact, the last time it was this low was in 2018, during the Yellow Vest protests. Now, back then to try and kind of appease tensions, Macron organize these great big town halls across the country to try and get the French people to air their grievances. And this time, he doesn't seem to have offered any kind of solution or exit to the crisis. So, yes, you know, next Friday, the reform will go to the Constitutional Council, we'll hear if it's greenlit or not. They may decide that parts of it are unconstitutional or indeed the whole thing. But we think it really is just going to be a formality. So let's say it does get greenlit and then the protests have died down, Macron will still be left with this problem. He will have to try and gain back that trust, win back popular opinion. And I think, Paula, you know, if you look at these protests that have been going on for the last two and a half months, a lot of people thought that they would have run out of steam by now. But the reality is half a million people taken to the streets yesterday. Yes, it was a lower turnout, but that is still significant. And the protesters have vowed to continue to protest because they say they want to be heard. They want to be listened to. So we will see more protests next Thursday. We'll see more strikes. Hospital workers will down tools, school teachers will down tools, factories will be blocked. And all of this is to try and bring the government back to that negotiating table, but also to be heard.
