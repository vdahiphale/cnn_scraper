Sources tell me new information about the tracking of the suspect, 28-year-old Bryan Kohberger. The source who asked not to be identified said that they did not know the Kohbergers but engaged in friendly conversation with Bryan and his father at a store on December 16th in Pennsylvania. The father told the source that he flew out to Washington state and made the cross-country trip with his son and that Bryan would be traveling back to the West Coast alone after the holidays. Now police have not indicated the suspect's father is in any way connected to the November college student murders. But this source saying it was chilling thinking back on that conversation and the fact that it occurred after the murders of those students in Idaho.
