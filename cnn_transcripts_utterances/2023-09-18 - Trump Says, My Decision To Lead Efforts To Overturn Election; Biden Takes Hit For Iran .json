Raffensperger, Trump claims, said that was a negotiation.Now, I looked far and wide for this supposed Raffensperger quote where he said Trump didn't do anything wrong. Pam, it does not exist. Raffensperger simply did not say that. Trump made it up. And Raffensperger was not the only old foe, if you can call him that, that Trump kept talking about. He kept falsely blaming then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the January 6th rioter insurrection. He claimed again that Nancy Pelosi said she turned down 10,000 soldiers. If she didn't turn down the soldiers, you wouldn't have had January 6th. And he said she was in charge of Capitol security. Well, as I've explained over and over again, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker is not in charge of Capitol security. That's the responsibility of the Capitol Police Board. Second of all, Trump is the commander-in-chief of the D.C. National Guard. It is him, not the House speaker, that can deploy it if he had wanted to.

This is the last point where we should be engaged in this notion that if we just pull back, we'll be safer. It's exactly the wrong way.

They're not very happy.Now, the White House has argued that jobs are better, inflation is going down, but when you look at the numbers more closely, that's not exactly true. Energy is going up, commodities is a problem. Sure, you may have a job, but wages have an increase with inflation. These are very real things that the American people are filling. And touting numbers doesn't tout what people see in their bank accounts. I think the president's going to have to speak to those things.",

It's seen as a nod to Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman who likes to wear shorts and a hoodie to work as you see. Schumer's move is facing some backlash.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The U.S. Senate just eliminated its dress code because you got this guy from Pennsylvania who's got a lot of problems. He wears like sweat shirts and hoodies and shorts and that's his thing. We need to be lifting up our standards in this country, not dumbing down our standards in this country. And this is an example why. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, to both of you, does a dress code for members of Senate matter for you? Absolutely it matters. I think decorum and standards matter.Professionalism indicates one's respect for the institutions and the values and this lowering of standards to me, it's not a good thing. I'll use this quick example before we hand it over to Ashley. I went to Morehouse College for undergrad. At Morehouse every single week, all of the guys had to wear a suit and tie for crown form. It was mandatory. And it was about respect for each other, respect for the individual, and also respect for the history of the institution. And I would like to see that in my United States senators.",
