Now, all my sources say Pennsylvania is absolutely neck- and-neck, so I have some questions there.

Sir, thank you so much for being on the program. I'm very grateful to have you. This is quite an operation, and I want to ask you about something that The New York Times reported about how this happened. And so, they write that even before Mr. Nasrallah -- of course, the head of Hezbollah -- decided that he was going to -- going to expand the group's pager usage -- this was because of concerns about cellphones -- \"Israel had put into motion a plan to establish a shell company that would pose as an international pager producer. By all appearances, B.A.C. Consulting was a Hungary-based company under contract to produce the devices on behalf of a Taiwanese company, Gold Apollo. In fact, it was part of an Israeli front, according to three intelligence officers briefed on the operation. They said at least two other shell companies were created as well to mask the real identities of the people creating the pagers: Israeli intelligence officers.\" So they're writing here these devices weren't tampered with; they were literally made by the Israelis. Can you help us understand the scope of this and just what you make of it? PHILIP MUDD, CNN COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST, FORMER CIA COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIAL, AUTHOR, \"BLACK SITE: THE CIA IN THE POST-9/11 WORLD\" (via Webex by Cisco):  I can, sort of. But I only spent 25 years at the CIA and the FBI and this, after 25 years, this -- when I was talking to some friend yesterday this is really good. You talk about a bit of scope, but that is just establishing the shell companies, establishing the physical infrastructure, rent some buildings. Think about the piece that I find really fascinating. You have to understand enough about the Hezbollah procurement infrastructure -- how they buy stuff. Who they buy it from. How they establish the bonafides of a company they're going to work with. Whether you trust the intermediary -- that is, the company that you're working with, and Hezbollah might have checked the backgrounds of company officials to ensure that they weren't Israeli intelligence. It's not just the physical infrastructure -- and that's impressive alone to establish some shell companies -- it's the intelligence for the Israelis to get into the gears of how Hezbollah buys stuff that I find really fascinating, Kasie.",
