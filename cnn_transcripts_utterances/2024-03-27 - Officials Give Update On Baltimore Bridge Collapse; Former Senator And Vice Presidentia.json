And he is no stranger to tragedy in his own family.And, Governor, thank you so much for your leadership throughout this challenging situation. It's been steadfast, and it has been remarkable. We are all in this together. When President Biden first heard about this yesterday morning, he summoned everyone who had a relevant stake in the game to come together to make sure that every federal resource was put to bear. So, we see the Coast Guard. We see the Army Corps. We see the National Transportation Safety Board. We see the Department of Labor. The president directed us to make sure that we are doing everything possible. Success occurs when everybody is working together. That's exactly what is happening here. I met with the families earlier today, and it is really, really tragic. And we will get through this. We have no doubt about it. And the president has directed us to move heaven and earth. Those aren't my words. Those are his words. To make sure we are helping the remarkable people of the great state of Maryland to move forward. And we will indeed, Governor, I can inform you with confidence that we will process your request promptly because the situation calls for prompt action. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE).",

A lot of people could have filled that role.Coming out of the 90s, the Bill Clinton White House had been rocked by scandal. There was a sense that maybe Bill Clinton was a tarnished figure. And Al Gore had to figure out how can I signal to people that this is going to be a button-up operation, this is going to be a high- integrity operation? My White House is going to be run by adults. I'm going to get Joe Lieberman, because his reputation, his standing, his -- the esteem that he was held by the whole country, that was the biggest single-weighted signal, the kind of man he wanted to be associated with, and it was very important for Gore at that time. And so, and, again, as I just said, came within a couple hundred votes of becoming the first Jewish vice president, would have made history doing that. And given his heart for service, would have been a fantastic vice president, no doubt. At the same time, when McCain ran against Obama, Joe Lieberman actually endorsed John McCain, which, on the one hand, is a beautiful statement of bipartisanship, on the other hand, was heartbreaking for Obama folks, like myself, to see a great figure like that walk across the street and hold hands with the other side. And that is also Joe Lieberman, independent, tough-minded, isn't going to go with popular opinion, is going to go with his own heart. Sometimes that helped Democrats, sometimes it hurt our feelings, but a lion of the Senate and a legendary figure, for sure.",

He truly focused on the priorities of the American people. And he's so -- he's such an interesting person to reflect on in this political moment because he so strongly decried toxic partisanship. I mean, a remarkable legacy, to Van's point, that he was on a Democratic presidential ticket and was very seriously considered years later to be on a Republican presidential ticket.

I've learned so much about not just politics and policy, but respect for other people for different viewpoints. And one of my favorite things about him and what I will always take away is when we were at events and we're, you know, maybe backstage or in the kitchen, he would always take time to talk to the catering staff, the bartenders, and make them feel seen and show respect to them.

And I had the opportunity to kind of drive with him and oftentimes drive him to some early morning stops to diners across Connecticut. And, again, it was remarkable to see a man who was very comfortable sitting in boardrooms with CEOs, in meetings with heads of state, with presidents of the United States, but also being very comfortable talking to cops, factory workers, teachers, the kind of people he would meet in diners, and take their questions and take them seriously. And as much as he was a statesman and a master of policy and negotiated some very important pieces of legislation, he also was a master retail politician.
