He helped switch key votes in the end, and McCarthy made clear after he is grateful. Another is the Pennsylvania congressman, Scott Perry. He tried to help Trump steal the 2020 election, and his actions are part of a Justice Department investigation. Yet Perry will not rule out serving on a new House committee to investigate what Republicans claim is overreach and abuses by the FBI and the Justice Department.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. SCOTT PERRY, (R) PENNSYLVANIA: Well, why should I be limited? Why should anybody be limited just because someone has made an accusation? Everybody in America is innocent until proven otherwise. And I would say this, the American people are really, really tired of the persecution and the instruments of federal power being used against them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that he's not going to be the chair of this new select subcommittee. It's going to be Jim Jordan. So, he won't lead it.

And some of these members have been calling for a select committee to look into January 6. Kevin McCarthy said, no, he didn't want to do that.

I was holding out my phone, saying, it's President Trump. He wants to speak with you. You know, President Trump endorsed, I think, all 20.

Probably not, but that's where they are at this point in time. It's almost like once you're in this deeply, you have no other choice.To some degree, though, I'm a little skeptical of the idea that this dramatically turned is around his standing, in the sense that these are his people, these 20, as Marjorie Taylor Greene said, they were all endorsed by him. They are all huge advocates for him. Still took him 14 votes to get everybody together. [12:35:09] And as Margaret Taylor Greene was saying and Mel's reported throughout the course of the week, he was calling them, he was staying in touch with them. Did help turn them in the end?

AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, \"WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": I think that's the thing. I mean, if you're Kevin McCarthy and you're saying that, oh, Trump may have got him over the finish line, but he allowed him to be humiliated over and over again, like if he really had the power to turn it, why didn't you turn it after the second vote? If I'm Kevin McCarthy I might do this. (CROSSTALK)",

The new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, met with his cabinet for the first time today to take measures to make sure those vandalized buildings are operational again and also make sure as well, that the security situation across the country doesn't get worse. It's hard to overstate the seriousness of what happened, John.We just learned that at least 70 people were injured, six of them severely, but no one died, according to the Brazilian Health Ministry. Supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed those key buildings over claims that the presidential runoff election in October was stolen. Bolsonaro lost by less than two percentage points to current President Lula da Silva. And this is the same Bolsonaro, John, who was known as the Trump of the tropics when he was in office. The same Bolsonaro that refused to concede when he lost the election in October. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is. Steve Bannon, former White House Chief Strategist and the Trump administration has reportedly called the pro-Bolsonaro rioters freedom fighters.
