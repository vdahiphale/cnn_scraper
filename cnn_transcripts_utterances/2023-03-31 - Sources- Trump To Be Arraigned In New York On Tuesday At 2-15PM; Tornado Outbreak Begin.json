Tuesday, around 2:15 p.m., Trump is expected to appear before Manhattan judged to be arraigned, according to sources. The former president is facing more than 30 counts related to business fraud. And the indictment remains under seal and may not be unveiled until Trump's arraignment. On Monday is expected to travel to New York from his Mar-a-Lago resort, where he intends to remain over the weekend. Trump's attorneys are saying the former president will absolutely voluntarily surrender himself. However, they do plan to file substantial legal challenges against the indictment. And this all comes as the Secret Service is meeting with New York officials today to discuss the logistics for Trump's court appearance and to address security concerns in the city.

That includes clips of his allies defending him across media platforms, and this is all part of an effort to control that public narrative. We know that Trump's team is watching this very closely, they are sending out updates blasts via email of who has Trump's back who is defending him, and Trump is really rallying his troops. We know that he has been calling advisors meeting with advisors calling allies, including on Capitol Hill, shoring up the support that he has and many of his advisors that I have spoken to say that they are pleased with the Republican response because, as we have talked about, Trump is not only a former U.S. president, but he is currently running for president right now, and they believe that this could help him in a contested primary, although it's still of course, remains to be seen whether or not an indictment like this could help him politically. Now, here at Mar-a-Lago or outside of Mar-a-Lago, West Palm, we just drove by the resort. It is relatively calm. We had heard rumors of protests. We're talking about all of this increased security. There was only about 10 to 15 people outside peacefully protesting in support of the former president, something that we obviously are keeping an eye on.

A significant tornado was on the ground and probably still is for miles across that northwest part of that city, and across the river and across I-40. There's significant damage to the western suburbs of Little Rock at this hour, and a new tornado warning was just issued for the very same area, maybe three miles farther south, where that tornado tracked just about 30 minutes ago.Also, we know that there is damage near Priori, Illinois, just to the south of that city. They're more storms are firing as we speak, and many of them are rotating. When that happens, a tornado can come out at any time today. This is level five of five. This is the worst possible scenario for risk for severe weather that we've seen for a couple of years. And this only happens just a few times a year and we haven't had one now for almost 700 days. This is the area where we have tornado watches, from Chicago, all the way down to Dallas. Any one of these storms could rotate today, which means they could put down a tornado. The other problem is that they're moving 50 to 60 miles per hour. You won't have a long time to take cover. When you know something is coming your way. You need to do it now. Be ready. Make sure that phone is on your alerts are on because this is going to be a dangerous night for everyone in this area, especially these two pieces, these areas, these areas that are in pink. Those are the most significant areas of damage. Here's some video. We just got out of Little Rock. I've seen quite a bit of it. Most of it is to the west of town, but the trader was on the ground there. You see it kind of coming out of the cloud right there. This to me when it was on the ground looking like what I call a stovepipe tornado likely an EF-2 tornado on the ground, and the damage that I've seen is somewhere between one and two. Obviously, not all the damage has been seen yet because this video is just coming in to our control room just coming in, even to the control rooms of the little rock affiliates there in Arkansas. If you are into this area, this red or orange or yellow area today is the day to pay attention.

And there are many areas here that we see there's three different or five different technically, but we only really count three.Slight moderate enhanced and then we go to high and then behold below that. There's a chance of a thunderstorm that could have some lightning in some wind. But when we get to this high risk, it is the highest risk. It's right below when you put a watch out, and people still don't understand the difference. My mom never did, watch and warning. The watch means that it's possible to warning means it's happening. Let's go to some of this video here. We're just getting this in my ear, Little Rock video coming from the ground, some of this here looking out from the high rise apartments here from Little Rock, looking to the west here. This is the tornado on the ground. This is what I was talking about how it's not just a small little rope. This was a very wide tornado at the base, which means the extent of the damage isn't just maybe a block wide. It could be 3 to 5 blocks wide, as it was moving across the northwestern parts of the city and then across and right toward the airport itself. And for a time, the National Weather Service said we are taking cover right now because the tornado was heading right toward the airport, which is where the weather service office is. But this is significant damage caused by this -- a big, big tornado. This is going to continue to play. Obviously, the person that was shooting this was out of danger, but still you need to stay away from these and don't just try to be a videographer. In this point in time, when you know that this is coming, you hear the sirens? I really need you to take the cover that's necessary to protect you, your pets, your property and the people that you love around you because this is what can happen. This is where we're going here. This is what the damage occurred as the storm rolled through, this area. Now, many of these areas here, probably, I'm seeing some of the buildings that aren't brick structures, so we're not going to be able to tell what kind of damage that was when you -- when you roll over a trailer, you know, a small RV, you can get a wind to 60 or 70 miles per hour to do that. But look at the damage here to this shopping center, all of the cars, the carts in disarray, windows blown out of those cars, which is why we tell you don't go into your car because a big tornado doesn't have any place left in that car when it's done with it. There's no place left for you in that car. And obviously, those windows shattering out can put cuts and all kinds of debris into the car itself. You need to be in a proper structure when you see something like this happening that. The biggest threat I think today. Yes, obviously, the tornado is the threat. The biggest threat is how quickly these are moving. You will not be. Get out of the way of these. I mean, if you have five or 10 minutes, that will be a lot when these tornadoes decided to come down to the ground. Warnings will be to the county's two years southwest and then you need to pay attention. You need to know the county to your southwest. And if you hear on the radio or the TV, hey, this is southwest of us, by 30 miles. You only have 15 or 20 minutes at this type of rate of speed as these storms are rolling to the Northeast very, very quickly. And the watches go from Chicago all the way down to Texas. And in Chicago, tomorrow, it will snow. This is how violent this low pressure center is. There is a big clash between the warm and humid and the cold and the dry and that's what happens when this happens and, you know, we get many tornadoes like this, and they roll through farm fields and cornfields and the like, and nothing happens and they never get any coverage. But when you get a small tornado to roll through a town that is coverage. When you get a tornado this size, this is breaking news. BROWN:  And like you said, there's just not much time to take cover once it's close to where you might live, so people need to be heeding these warnings, checking there, you know their local forecasting what's going on. We have some new information just coming into CNN, more than 50,000 customers are without power and Pulaski County, Arkansas, that includes Little Rock as a confirmed tornado, west of Little Rock is expected to pass just north of downtown. And what strikes me, Chad, as you're going through this is just how wide the swap is the concern of this severe weather.",

A lot of times, these tornadoes hit at 5:00, 6:00, 7:00 at night in the warmest or at least the most.

That is the tornado warned storm that moved through Little Rock region, caused the damage that you've seen on your TV screens, but it's moving so quickly, so if people aren't paying attention, they won't have that opportunity to seek shelter from a storm that's moving 60, 70 miles per hour.
