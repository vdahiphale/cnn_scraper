And they can use the lines that Hur wrote about memory to attack Biden and show that in always that he's not fit for office. I mean, that is kind of a double whammy win for Trump.And that comes as he's winning in Nevada, as he, you know, won on the ballot that he was not even on in terms of the Nevada primaries two days ago.

Its clear that the president, the White Houses argument is going be -- well, look at how we handled this differently, right, President Trump, the probe and the criminal charges and the things that he's facing in that instance do involve trying to keep the classified documents, not turning them over to the government. There are allegations about trying to I potentially hide evidence, get people to lie on his behalf.The president's team is arguing, we fully cooperated here. I'm kind of interested to know if there are going to be retroactive questions about whether sitting this for this interview was a great plan as part of this, but they can legitimately say, look, we made the president available to you as soon as because we found this out, we rushed return them to the Archives.

Number one is exactly what you said. It is to show how Biden's handling and reaction in response to the investigation and his full cooperation is very different than Trump's response, especially initially and even after, you know, he was -- he was sort of given a heads-up about that.And secondly, the Biden campaign will be showing and sort of saying out loud that the special counsel was Trump appointed and that he is not a doctor. He's a lawyer and that the things that the special counsel have written about Biden's mental capacity, he doesn't actually have the authority to say and should not be listened to. So that is the plan for the Biden campaign in the next couple of days and weeks, potentially even months in terms of responding to the special counsel's report.",

DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah. I mean, we need that to sink in for people. The first ever tornado in Wisconsin during the month of February, that is significant. We need to mark that because it's just not something that we've ever seen before. They're in total -- we have three tornado reports across parts of the Midwest and this is all part of the warmth that has been bubbled across this region, breaking records for so many locations. Look at Des Moines, Iowa, yesterday, 63 previous records, 60 degrees. And that warmth and the warming trend continues for the Midwest, and that will shift eastward over 150 warm temperature records possible through the day on Sunday. Now, this is a very interesting graphic put together by my weather producer Monica. I'm just so grateful for this because what you're seeing here, every single red dot across the Midwest and northern New England, that is locations that have experienced their warmest winter to date. So, let's just really puts it into context how warm its actually been across this part of our country. And this is having great impacts on the ice cover, on the Great Lakes, so much of it as normally frozen in ice, frozen in time. What we have a mere 5 percent of the entire Great Lakes covered with ice really near the Saginaw Bay and portions of northern Lake Michigan. And this is following that trend of declining ice coverage across the Great Lakes every winter since the '70s. And this, of course, has major impacts on the outdoor winter sports activities like ice fishing, perhaps the snow sports industry as well. And here you can see temperatures well above average, well above freezing. So we're going to keep that warmth in the forecast to go. Lots of rain though across the Deep South. The storm system will bring the potential for some severe weather across the Deep South, especially into Louisiana by Saturday and Sunday. So monitor that and there's the potential for heavy rain from Mobile, Alabama, all the way to Atlanta, Georgia -- Kasie.",
