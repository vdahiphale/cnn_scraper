Huge developments playing out in both his hush money case and at the U.S. Supreme Court, where the former U.S. president's legal team made an historic push to get him absolute immunity.Back in New York, the former publisher of \"The National Enquirer\" tabloid returned to the witness stand to reveal secrets about the so- called catch-and-kill deals involving a former porn star and a \"Playboy\" playmate. David Pecker explained how he brokered the agreement to purchase model Karen McDougal's story about an alleged affair with Trump, but said he refused to do the same thing for Stormy Daniels. And that Trump's former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, handled that payment instead. After leaving court, Trump once again, railing against the whole trial.

A warningThe Palestinian civil defense said on Thursday they concluded their search of three mass graves at Nasser Medical Complex. Some of the bodies were still wearing surgical gowns or hospital wrist bands. Some allegedly had their hands and feet tied up. The IDF denies it buried Palestinian bodies in mass graves and said Palestinians had dug a grave at the complex several months ago. The Gaza civil defense acknowledged around 100 bodies were buried at the complex before the IDF operation there. Some Palestinians at the scene said they had buried family members on the premises in January, but later returned to discover the bodies had been dug up and placed in a mass grave. Farther South, Palestinian medics say Israeli airstrikes killed at least six people, including a local journalist, in Rafah on Thursday. The strikes came ahead of a planned Israeli ground invasion into Gaza's most Southernmost city, an offensive that's been on hold while hostage negotiations play out. The Israeli war cabinet met on Thursday to discuss the situation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that entry into Rafah is, in his view, necessary for a complete victory over Hamas.

I mean, unfortunately since the 2010 earthquake, instead of Haiti rising from the ashes, it just seems to have been on this downward spiral. So I think that, you know, we need to first start to look at the institutions. You have to build institutions in that country. You have to restore faith. You have to find a way to empower Haitians to begin to sort of take back their power; to believe in the power of the vote, the ballot box, democracy; to feel that tomorrow is a brighter day, despite all the negatives and all of the challenges. What I have always found amazing is that the average Haitian spends a majority of whatever salary or money that they have on an education. They still believe that that is the key to the future, that's the way out. And so how do you take that kind of hope and build on it and say to people once again, you can feel secure, and you can start to train.",
