And what do I mean by that? Israel says it's a limited incursions, a limited ground operations to cleanse, to search and destroy, to borrow the term from the Vietnam War. But these things, they -- in planning boards, they stay limited. In real life, there's also another -- there's always another hill, there's another village, there's another little valley, there's another little mountain. And before you know it, you're 25 kilometers north of Israel in establishing a de facto security zone, and then you become sitting ducks.",

Speaking of mission creep, I want to talk and get your sense as Israel is now measuring its retaliatory attack for last night's Iranian missile barrage on Israel. You have some in this country and some quite publicly now calling for strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. They include Naftali Bennett, of course, former prime minister.

And we are already -- Jim, we're already caught in an escalating spiral. And to begin with the fallacy of we control escalation and we dominate escalation is a flawed premise. We don't, and nor do the Iranians. And if this is going to become a ping pong or retaliatory strikes, before you know it, you're going to have a full-blown war that may drag in the U.S. Now, what Mr. Bennett is proposing -- and he's not the only one -- is that, oh, we have this unique opportunity. Circumstances, the stars are aligned. It's a perfect geopolitical constellation. Let's hit Iran. Well, number one, Israel cannot take out Iran's military nuclear program without U.S. help. It just cannot. It could set it back, but there are repercussions. Secondly, the oil terminals? Did he think about the implications that might have on oil prices? I mean, where did these ideas even come from? We could talk about retaliation. We talk about a barrage of missiles. But the way he presented it is an all-out war.

It's personally hard to deal with. We do a lot of them. And to hear that over 100 individuals have lost their lives, and those are the ones that have been recovered so far, is really -- it's horrible. This is a beautiful area.

And what we're doing and the supplies we're being offered will require a large, organized force of citizens to move them forward. There's two approaches to this. There's two worlds in the disaster relief area. There's the government approach and there's repairing infrastructure and bridges and cell towers and telephone poles. There's the human approach. And what that takes is you and me. It takes every citizen to bring their best to the scene. And that's what we're preparing to do. We have an offer of 125 pallets a day of supplies. That's an incredible amount of supplies. We will go a whole disaster and not see 125 pallets. How does a nonprofit organization handle that? It takes logistics. It takes technology. It takes smart people. It takes collaboration. It takes good people, no drama, and incredible effort.

All that discussion that we have been having about longevity, it's got -- we're going to see the impact of that over the next few decades. Incidentally, the United States doesn't fare too badly when it comes to centenarians overall.
