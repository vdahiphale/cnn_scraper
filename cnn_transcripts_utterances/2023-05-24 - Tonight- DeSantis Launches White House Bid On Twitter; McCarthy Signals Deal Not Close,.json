After a month of speculating and strategizing, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will officially launch his White House run, long anticipated, and he's going to do it on Twitter spurning traditional media for a live conversation with social media firebrand. In fact -- in fact, the owner of Twitter Elon Musk. Of course, the shadow looming over all this is former President Trump.A new CNN poll out today confirms Trump remains the Republican to beat and by a wide margin with more than 53 percent support among Republicans. The poll also confirms that DeSantis remains Trump's most formidable opponent, though he lags far behind. So, will his Twitter launch help the governor close that gap? Can it? Let's speak now to CNN's resident Twitter expert Donie O'Sullivan. Donie, as you well know, Twitter represents really a sliver of the U.S. population and at times quite an angry sliver and even extreme in some cases sliver of the population here. What population -- what audience does he reach by announcing in this forum right now? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jim. I mean, to your point, most Americans are not on Twitter. It's mostly you know journalists, politicians, people who are kind of following politics extremely closely. I mean, political campaigns, going back years now, spend all their money and invest basically all their digital ad dollars in Facebook and Google. And Twitter is not really seen as a place where you can reach voters directly. But what it does do for DeSantis, though, is -- I mean, it is one way I guess, seen him bypassing the so-called mainstream media. But I think most importantly, probably, you know, Twitter has tried to present itself at the moment as this bastion of free speech. And it's just another way I guess, of DeSantis being able to engage in the culture wars, which we know he's a fan of.",

But I do remember him endorsing Republican candidates and voting Republican in the midterm elections, and now here he is taking a part -- taking part, you might say a promotional part in the announcement of a Republican candidate for president. What does Musk gain from this, and what does Musk communicate with this?O'SULLIVAN: Yes. Look, I mean, you know, he -- Musk has certainly been trying to get conservatives, Republicans people on the right kind of back on the platform, in his view, I guess, restoring Twitter's image after the company suspended president -- then President Trump a few years back along with many other influential right-wing figures, so he has been courting people like this.

Errol, is this good politics for DeSantis in the Republican field right now? ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, if he was going to stay in the Republican field, he had to do something at this point. As the new CNN poll shows, he's 27 points behind Donald Trump among Republicans. And that's the bad news. Now, the worst news is that he was only 14 points behind a couple of months ago, so the numbers are going in the wrong direction. And this is an attempt, I think, by Ron DeSantis to try and stop that trend before it turns into an irreversible trend. He's got to try and put together some kind of a plausible path to victory. He apparently is going to try and appeal to social conservatives, which is good for a start. It's not enough to necessarily overtake Donald Trump. But it seems to be what he's going to try and do.

They like what he personally represents not the policies. Nobody's voting for Donald Trump because of his policies. People have voted for Donald Trump because of who he is and his rambunctious style, and the enemies that he declares and makes war on. And unless Ron DeSantis is willing to do that and say, I will make liberals just as mad. I will insult all kinds of groups. I will talk bad about immigrants and say outrageous things to delight you and to shock moderates and liberals.

We're now just eight days from falling off the fiscal cliff. And obviously, it takes time to have any agreement get through Congress. So, realistically, for these negotiators, what's the deadline? How much time do they have left? ROBERT REICH, FORMER LABOR SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON: Well, Janet Yellen is setting the deadline, Boris, in terms of the so-called X-date. That is the date by which the United States really runs out of money to pay the nation's bills. She has said that it's going to be at the start of June. She has not been very specific about it. But I just want to bring viewers' attention to a simple fact, and that is that the X-date doesn't really exist. That is there's nothing in law or the Constitution or any other place where you can find a definition for when the United States runs out of money. In 1985, Treasury Secretary Jim Baker faced with similar kinds of circumstances where there was no debt ceiling increase. What he did? He raided the Social Security Trust Fund to keep paying the bills. Now, I'm not suggesting that by any means. I just want to make sure that people understand that there is no necessary date by which we run out of money.",

But we'll just keep on going as we are. The cannon will be kept down the road for quite some time. And it could even be argued. Now, the Biden administration has not yet argued this. But it could even be argued that the Constitution, and that is the article -- you know, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, section four says that the debt shall be respected.There is no way that the validity of the public debt is going to be called into question, and could rest on that and say that Joe Biden has a constitutional responsibility, given his oath of office to respect the Constitution and pay the nation's bills and protect the full faith and credit of the Constitution and the United States.",

The judge, Robin Meriweather, has ordered that this defendant remain in custody pending his detention hearing. And that detention hearing is next Tuesday, May 30.Prosecutors had argued several reasons for why this suspect, Sai Varshith Kandula, 19 years old, should remain behind bars. Among those arguments, they said that he has no local ties to this area of Washington, DC, and also that they say he poses a serious flight risk. Right now, he faces this one federal charge of deprivation of property of the United States in excess of a thousand dollars Now, that charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison or a $250,000 fine in a conviction or a combination of those two. But again, there could be more charges added to this later. We're told that he appeared in an orange jumpsuit just a few moments ago before the judge, that he spoke in very soft tones that he answered her questions, but that he did not speak at length. You mentioned the charging documents, some very disturbing things that according to those documents, he said to a secret service agent who interviewed him on Monday evening after he was arrested following that crash into the security barrier at the White House. Among the things he told the agent was that he supported Nazi ideology, that he supported the Nazi idea of eugenics. He called Adolf Hitler a very strong leader. He said he would kill the president and would harm anyone who got in his way. But we have to reiterate that he also -- in that truck, there were no weapons found, no explosives, nothing like that. So, he may not have had a very well-thought-out plan, but he did at least menace the White House allegedly on Monday night. Even with the -- you know the espousal of that Nazi ideology and that Nazi sympathy, we did speak to two of his friends from back in high school in Chesterfield, Missouri who said that he was known as a very quiet guy who never got into any trouble during their school years. He just graduated from high school in January of last year. What we're told by law enforcement sources is that authorities are considering the idea that mental health might have played a role in this incident.
