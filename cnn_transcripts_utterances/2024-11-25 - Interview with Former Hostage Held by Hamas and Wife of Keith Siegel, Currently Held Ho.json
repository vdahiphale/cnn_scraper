Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. One of the wars on Israel's borders could be drawing to a close with a potential ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. A source tells CNN, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has approved an agreement in principle, but any deal would still need to be approved by the cabinet, which is planning to meet and vote on Tuesday. Lebanese officials say dozens were killed in an Israeli strike over the weekend, and that the death toll has risen to over 3,000 since mid- September. Meantime, there is little hope for a ceasefire in Gaza, where the humanitarian situation in the north has been described as apocalyptic by aid officials. It's been one year since the only deal between Israel and Hamas led to the release of over 100 captives taken on October 7th. Around 100 hostages are still believed to be held inside Gaza to this day. Aviva Siegel was released as part of that original deal last November, but her husband Keith, an American-Israeli citizen, remains in captivity. And she's joining us now from Israel. Aviva Siegel, welcome to the program. And I just want to know what you're thinking today regarding the fact that you and about a hundred others were released exactly a year ago. What do you think about that deal that enabled that?",

That happened over the weekend. Citing its coverage of the war on Gaza following the October 7th attacks. Haaretz described the move as an attempt to, quote, \"silence a critical, independent newspaper.\" Meantime, Israelis, and many around the world, are still digesting the ICC's decision last week to issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and from the deputy Hamas leader, Mohammed Deif. The court said it found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes, including starvation as a method of war. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy says the U.K. would follow due process if Netanyahu visited Britain, but the United States and other allies have rejected the ICC warrant. Geoffrey Nice is a leading human rights lawyer who prosecuted the former Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, in 2002 at the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. Now -- he's the man. Now, he's joining us. Welcome to the program, Geoffrey Nice. You heard -- let me just respond to Aviva Siegel. You just heard this desperate commentary from a former hostage whose husband is still there and the description she made of how she was treated by Hamas and how the others were treated by Hamas. I want to ask you your opinion as a legal scholar and one who's prosecuted these crimes before, do you think Hamas should have been charged with genocide as well as the crimes against humanity that they have been charged with at least three people, Sinwar, Haniyeh, who are both being killed by Israel, and Deif, who we don't know whether is alive or not because genocide was not part of the charges.",

What isabsolutely clear and has been clear from before this conflict or war started is that what Hamas has done, both in the firing of unaimed rockets and particularly in respect of hostages is of course criminal. There's no doubt about its absolute wickedness. And indeed, it would be very hard not to be moved by the extremely powerful statements of your previous contributor. But that doesn't necessarily mean that Hamas is culpable of genocide, because genocide requires proof of a particular state of mind of the leader or other person suspected of committing genocide.

Hamas may be regarded as wider than simply those who drafted the original charter. So, I'm afraid -- I'm not afraid -- I don't think that in itself is enough. It may also be the case that the court in issuing these arrest warrants has in mind that it can add further charges -- not charges, allegations, the allegations that support arrest warrant or arrest warrants.",

And that is the -- you know, the thing is alleged crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza. You know, back in May, you told me that you welcomed all the investigation and Karim Khan's decision to apply for warrants. Now, the warrants have been approved by the panel at the ICC. But what I want to first ask you is, are you surprised by the level of rejection of these warrants against Israeli leaders by allies, you know, and many, many newspapers and leading opinion makers and thought leaders?",

The horrifying conflict between Palestinians in Gaza, maybe elsewhere in Israel and the State of Israel generates thestrongest of emotions in politicians and in commentators and even in media. And the legal issues of whether or not certain crimes may have been committed, and if so, by who, need to be detached from emotion and looked at clinically. So, on the one hand, there's no reason to doubt that the very extended consideration given by these judges to the material presented to them has led to a solid conclusion that it may be very difficult to change on any form of appeal or reconsideration, but it's not going to change the emotional response on both sides about this conflict, and those therefore lead both to enthusiastic acceptance of the appropriateness of countries arresting Mr. Netanyahu, should he and Gallant and the other gentleman or man, if they fall into a particular country and on the other side to outright rejection of the work of the court.

We wish to see this kind of horrifying treatment of people on both sides come to an end. And I'm afraid our political leaders overlook the potential value of investigation, not necessarily convictions by other war criminals, by war criminals that may or may not affect the behavior of future leaders of conflicts, we overlook or they overlook the value of investigation. If support had been given to the ICC to investigate Operation Protective Edge, which happened in 2014, when it was given jurisdiction, if it -- that had enthusiastic support, it's by no means certain that what happened starting in October last year would have happened.",

Now, the annual climate summit wrapped up in Baku, Azerbaijan over the weekend after much wailing and gnashing of teeth over the amount rich polluting nations should be paying poorer nations to decarbonize and mitigate their climate crises. The deal struck was about a quarter of what they had asked for. This COP29 in oil producing Azerbaijan follows last year's in the UAE, also a petro state, but which hammered out a landmark commitment to transition away from fossil fuels. But Saudi Arabia has been lobbying to derail that commitment ever since, and hopes that Donald Trump's return to the White House will help, given his drill, baby, drill policies and his cabinet picks filled with industry execs and deregulators. But as wildfires spread across North America with increasing frequency, the dissonance between that harsh reality and climate policy is being felt.

You know, Americans and Iguess North Americans in general are used to seeing almost now a forest fire season, and we associated with say, California or maybe Colorado. You wrote a piece in The New York Times recently that said, ladies and gentlemen, the Northeast is burning. Why is this significant? What's the change here? JOHN VAILLANT, AUTHOR, \"FIRE WEATHER\":  I think what we're seeing is this creeping of flammability and like so many other Americans and Canadians, we assumed 10 years ago that wildfires were a California problem, maybe a Colorado problem, maybe an Australia problem. But I live in British Columbia, and that's a technically a rain forest. And we've been having terrible fire seasons for the past decade. And so, I saw it creeping northward up into Oregon, up into Washington, up into B.C. And so, logically, you'd think, OK, this is still moving. And I think in the northeast, where I grew up, where -- you know, very familiar landscape to me, we've had this sort of sense, well, we won't be touched by that. You know, that's a western thing, it's an Australian thing, but we were nice and wet here. It's cool and green. And yet, this trend in heating, warming and drying across the continent is spreading steadily and measurably. If you talk to foresters, if you talk to forest hydrologists, they, you know, have the inside scoop on that. And so, they're not surprised by this. But the United States right now is in the driest year in recorded drought history for the entire country.",

You have warm years and cold years, you havesnowy winters, you have dry winters, but then you also have -- and so that's natural to see fluctuation there. On top of that though, we have, you know, fossil fuel emission driven climate change, which is measurably heating the atmosphere and the oceans. And so, that is this extra push from behind. And so, what we're seeing now is, you know, record temperatures. It's certainly warmer than normal in the northeast. And, you know, think about your laundry outside on a warmer day, your laundry is going to dry faster. Well, so is the forest floor, so are the grasses. But the other thing, when you look at it globally, it's not just the northeast that has low reservoirs. The Mackenzie River, one of the great rivers of the Canadian North, is right now at record low levels. There are huge lakes in the Canadian Subarctic, really inland seas, that are at record low levels. The Amazon River is at a record low level. So, this is a global issue.

You know, that is not anybody's diary, you know, from the past. And so, we really are going through this visible measurable change and we're feeling it in our bodies. It's changing our concept of what the seasons are. And so, now out west, people's concept of summer rather than being this time of kind of liberty and freedom and being outside and the sun and the warmth, is when's the smoke going to roll in, you know, when am I going to have to stay inside because it's too smoky? And again, for, say, people in British Columbia or Washington State, that is just not a reality that any of us grew up with. And so, we're -- you know, our consciousness is being sort of forced into this new concept of what seasons even mean. And that creates a real dissonance. I mean, if you think about it, you know, we've been around for a long time, not just in North America, but, you know, as homo sapiens on Earth, and we've never had to go through a change this rapid where, you know, in a decade or two, we're actually having to almost redefine what seasons are.",

You know, it's one of the big questions as fire impinges on ourcommunities more intensely because it burns faster and more intensely now because of heat and, you know, The Journal, in fact, made that their cover story, the changing nature of wildfire and how fast it moves. And so, many people who live in fire prone places, especially out west, have a kind of outdated notion of fire and what they might do to combat it. And now, fires are moving faster and with such intensity, so they can project radiant heat of close to 1,000 degrees. You know, a human can't survive that. But what if your home is uninsured or what if you live on a ranch, and, you know, your grandfather fought fires and your mom fought fires? And so, you're going to too, except now it's 110 degrees. And the relative humidity is in the single digits. And so, this fire is now -- it's not just going to be a fire on the land, it's going to be a firestorm rolling over you. And yet, there's this -- you know, I think there's a natural stubbornness and wish to protect what's ours. But again, if you don't have the means to replace it, if you don't have insurance, which fewer and fewer Americans have now, that's going to change your calculus. So, there's a few different factors, but some of it too, is, again, going back to consciousness and thinking about how -- we're needing to catch up with the climate. The climate's moving beyond us right now. We still have outdated notions of it and it's capable of new outrages now. We've seen it in the flooding, you know, after Hurricane Helene, and we've seen it in the fires in Paradise and Lahaina, really shocking energy.",

I didn't even know there were 50 insurance companies there. So -- and they've realized they can't -- they can no longer afford to cover losses on, you know, multibillion dollar disasters, which are happening almost annually now. So, the insurance industry, in a way, is sort of the grownups in the room who are actually observing the damage done and tabulating it in this quite objective way. Meanwhile, you have the petroleum industry and financial markets who are very bullish on anything that appears to make money. And so, there's a lot of investment in offshore drilling right now.

And when a house is uninsurable, it's really hard to get a mortgage. And without a mortgage, that impacts the housing industry. And without a functioning housing industry, you don't have a functioning economy because that's one of the pillars of the American economy. And so, it's not rocket science. You know, it's really quite simple that when you put people in these vulnerable situations, when you don't deal with climate, don't deal with CO2 and the world becomes more flammable, more floodable, that is going to have direct impacts, measurable impacts as we're seeing in the insurance industry on our entire economy.
