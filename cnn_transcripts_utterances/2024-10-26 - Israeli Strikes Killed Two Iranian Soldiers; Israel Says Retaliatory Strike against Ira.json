And in conclusion, it says that all of its planes made it back safely to Israel and that this mission has been completed. It was now done. Then we've gotten confirmation from the Iranian side in just the last hour or so that at least two Iranian soldiers were killed in these airstrikes and that the targets were what Iranian state media described as military centers in three main provinces. That's Tehran province, Khuzestan and Ilam, which are kind of in the south and the southwest, on the borders really with Iraq and the Gulf there. But this gives you a sense at how far the Israeli warplanes had to travel to try to carry out these airstrikes. We are now hearing from residents in Tehran that traffic is flowing normally, that shops are open. There were people who were woken up overnight to scenes that almost looked like fireworks tracer fire from anti-aircraft defenses, firing up into the night sky. And explosions in the night sky, which was certainly frightening and unsettling for people. But now it's after noon on the ground in Iran in Tehran. And we have not seen any imagery that's at all similar to the kind of scenes of massive, massive devastation from Israeli airstrikes in densely populated parts of Gaza or in southern Beirut or southern Lebanon, which suggests, at this point at least, that civilian infrastructure was not targeted. Now we do know that the Biden administration was vocal about not wanting Israel to bomb these types of locations, didn't want nuclear facilities bombed. There was concern about Iran's oil refineries and oil infrastructure being bombed, the effect that could have on global oil prices just days before a U.S. national election. We haven't gotten any indication whatsoever that that has taken place at this point. And we're already starting to hear voices of criticism now. Yair Lapid, leader of Israel's opposition, coming out in a tweet, basically saying that it was wrong, that Israel did not target economic and strategic targets with these bombing attacks. [05:05:00] He is arguing that Israel should have exacted more of a cost from Iran for the scores of rockets and drones that it fired at predominantly Israeli military bases on October 1st. And that is the whole argument for why Israel carried out this wave of airstrikes. It framed this as retaliation for those rocket attacks from Iran on October 1st, which as far as we know, killed one Palestinian man in the West Bank -- Bianna.",

Let's go live now to Tel Aviv and Miri Eisin, senior fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism and retired colonel with the Israeli military. Miri, it's good to see you. Israeli sources I spoke with say they consider this a pretty significant and expansive strike, focusing on military targets. Their initial assessment thus far is there was significant damage done to Iran's weapons manufacturing, missile storage and air defense capabilities. Just from your perspective, early indications suggesting to you what about the extent of this strike? COL. MIRI EISIN, SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER- TERRORISM:  When we talk about what Iran is going to put out, what Ivan was talking about before. Bianna, just think about the fact that I don't even think CNN has somebody on the ground into Tehran to be able to give a different perspective on what's happening there. What Israel has said and what it looks like is that what we attacked -- we, Israel -- are the manufacturing sites themselves, both of drones and missiles. Exactly what was attacked against Israel, both on October 1st and, just to remind everybody, also in April. They did two different attacks directly against Israel. In this case, it's going after the sites of the manufacturing. Those aren't sites that you're going to have civilians in. And I'll just add that Iran as a country -- and that's different from Hezbollah as a non-state entity -- Iran as a country has bases and military sites. Hezbollah holds all of their capabilities in the heart of civilian arenas on purpose. And that's why there's that big difference when you attack military sites and when you attack the terrorist sites that are hidden under civilian sites.",

But it's not just that. Think about it, 1,600 kilometers away from Israel. If you put a map up and you showed the distance itself, Israel had to get there. And we said that we did it with airplanes. We announced when we left, as an Israeli here, I have to say I was sitting here and just waiting for the announcement that you mentioned before, that all of our planes have returned back, meaning we actually said, when we went, we said, when we returned. This shows a lot of capabilities that are vastly different, both from anything Iran has ever shown or, for that matter, any of the proxies. It's sending a very strong message about capabilities, about intelligence, about our capability to defend. It doesn't make everything perfect. This isn't a war and everything is not perfect.

Well, as Kamala Harris continues to create a contrast between what an America under a Harris administration would look like and an America under a Trump administration would look like, when it comes to abortion rights, Texas is center stage. Texas is the biggest stage because Texas is one of the states with the strictest abortion bans. There is -- there are no exceptions for rape or incest in this state.
