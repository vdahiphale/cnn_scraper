Welcome to the program, everyone. I am Christiane Amanpour in London. After more than a year of investigating, the January 6th Committee has announced that it is near the finish line. Next week, it will release its final report about the attack on Capitol Hill. And at its last public hearing, it will make criminal referrals to the Justice Department. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was a prime target that dark day. Her office was ransacked and some rioters hunted around the capital, looking for her and then Vice President Mike Pence. They were all there in Congress to certify Joe Biden's election. A new documentary called \"Pelosi in the House\" features this phone call between the speaker and the vice president as the insurrection unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI, U.S HOUSE SPEAKER:  How are you? Oh, my goodness. Where are you? God bless you. But are you and -- are a very safe? We're in that -- we are still not safe enough for us to go back. We have been told it could take days to clear the Capitol. And that we should be moving everyone here to get the job done. We are at Fort McNair which has facilities for the House and the Senate to meet. We'd rather go to the Capitol but it doesn't seem to be safe. We've gotten a very bad report about the conditions of the House floor with defecation and all that kind of thing. OK. And then call us back. OK. I worry about you being in the Capitol.

They were hunting her down. So -- I mean, you have said and others have said that -- and she has said that this is really the final blow for her political office holding going forward. A. PELOSI:  Well, you have to remember that, if I take you back to the beginning of January, the first week of January, someone put a bloody pigs head on my parents' doorstep, on my childhood home, there was a big -- this was over the holidays, right, and spray-painted the garage and all that. So, that was the week of -- leading into January 6th. So, we go to Washington for -- where she was being sworn in as speaker. And this is a ceremonial event that the family always goes to, the whole family goes. All families go to these things. So, I was with her for the day that they were going to certify the election result. And when the Capitol police took her out of the -- you know, she was at the roster room, just going through the script of how we certify the election results. The security came in and they removed her from the podium. She didn't even have her cellphone with her. She was just taken out of the building. She didn't even want to be removed from the building because she's like a captain, she wanted to stay, you know, with the ship. She was not happy. She was -- there's footage of her, you know, not -- wasn't very happy about the fact that they were taking her to an army base to get out. But I started filming because, you know, you didn't have the clerk of the House there to record this. I'm a documentary filmmaker, that's what we do. You know, it's like a soccer player. You put a soccer ball down, what does the soccer player do? They kick the ball. Of course, I filmed everything because that was my human nature. It was all with an iPhone. You know, people think -- you know, conspiracy theorists say like, oh, Nancy Pelosi wrote a documentary crew to the Capitol. No, I had an iPhone and I filmed what was happening. But she started to make calls to the vice president, as you just saw, and to all the people, the secretary of defense, the attorney general to -- what they were trying to do was they were trying to take 435 members of the House and 100 senators and get them from the Congress to the army base to certify the election results. So, they were going to do this -- they were going to complete what it says in the constitutions, this is how it goes, they were going to complete that task that night no matter what. And so, that's what I was filming, was how they got -- you heard in that call, what she's trying to do is saying, should we bring everybody here to the army base --",

And you would have thought it was a buddy film, the two of them were getting along so well. Now, they had bitter fights. She voted against the war. There were people protesting, living outside of our house for the entire Iraq war because they were angry that, you know, even though she voted against the war, there were people living outside of our -- the protesters -- this whole idea of protesters living outside of our house. We've just been living with that forever, it seems. So, they still got along as human beings because even though they didn't agree, they still had respect for the institution. He's the president. She's the speaker. And they come from political families and they understand that there has to be some respect. That's what we lost with the last president. There was zero respect for the office of the presidency. Zero respect for the -- for anything in the Congress. And so, the reason why January 6th was such a tough day for Nancy Pelosi, I think, is because her father was in Congress and she thinks of the capital as the sacred temple of democracy. This is like the most sacred place on Earth to her, right. She's been in Congress for 35 years. She thinks public service is a noble calling.",

In her more than three decades in politics, Nancy Pelosi has made protecting the planet as well, one of her key issues. And a new report out today underscores the urgency of the matter. The International Rescue Committee says that climate change will accelerate humanitarian crises around the world next year. So, this week's scientific breakthrough on nuclear fusion has been hailed as a clean energy game changer. But my next guest says, it is not all that clear. It's not a silver bullet. Brian Greene is a professor of mathematics and physics at Columbia University and he's joining us now from New York. Welcome to the program. Brian Greene, you are known for making very difficult subjects accessible. So, everybody got extremely excited. You saw the secretary of energy in our clip earlier, you know, talking about how this is going to change the way this whole notion is looked at. What is fusion? What is nuclear fusion first and foremost?",

      "sentences": "So, nuclear fusion is a way of extracting energy that's locked up inmatter. We've done this in the past with a nuclear fission, which is taking large atoms and breaking them apart. And when they break apart, sort of, like rubber band snapping, energy is released. But we all know the problems with fission, right? There's nuclear waste, there's meltdown and so forth. Nuclear fusion is a cleaner form of nuclear energy where you take light atoms, like hydrogen, plentiful atoms, and you meld them together. This is exactly what power is. A star like the sun. And when these atoms meld together, some of their mass is converted into energy. Einstein's famous E = mc2 comes into the story here. When that mass is converted into energy, we can then harness that energy, in principle, like the sun does to create energy that we need here on planet Earth. That's the basic idea of the science.",

And what's happened now is for the very first time, and this is a big scientific breakthrough, the scientist at Livermore Laboratory have been able to get more energy out from a fusion reaction than they directly put in. And this has been kind of the gold standard. When you can reach more energy out than you put in, now, you're on the road to being able to harness this. So, it sounds great and it is great. This is a big breakthrough. But the leap from what they've done to having power plants that use nuclear fusion is a huge leap. And I guess I somewhat worry when I hear about thinking that this the panacea for climate change. This is the panacea for our energy needs. Maybe 30 years, 50 years from now. I don't know. Nobody can predict the rate of technological progress. But you don't want this to somehow mitigate in the minds of people and leaders the crisis that we face right here right now which requires right attention.

To that end, you know, professor Katharine Hayhoe, she has said -- and we've had her on this program often. Getting a lot of questions about what today's nuclear fusion breakthrough means for climate. My answer is not much. We already have the technologies we need to decarbonize 80 percent of the electricity sector by 2030 even's demand soars due to electrification. So, you've explained, you know, that this is not a short-term solution. So -- OK. We have the technology, as she says.

And my fear and perhaps it is not completely well-founded fear but I just think that we scientistsneed to be clear that this breakthrough scientifically essential and vital and the scientists need to be lauded for the decades of research that has finally allowed us to cross this threshold of getting more out than we put in. But we need to focus on cleaning up our act today, not looking 50 years down the road to what may well be the answer at that time. And I, sort of, also can't help but underscore one point which is this, so the scientists, for the first time, have found that they are putting in less direct energy through powerful lasers that caused the fusion process to happen compared to the energy that comes out. But if you also include the energy that it required to power up the lasers themselves, if you look at, sort of, the whole shebang from beginning to end, they put in the heck of a lot more energy to include that than what they are able to extract. So, this is an important step. A vital moment that perhaps will be remembered, December 5, 2022 as the moment when we finally crossed this barrier between getting more energy out then we put in for the first time. But this is the first step of many steps to get to a place where we can actually turn this into a technology. I mean, right now, we're able to create this experiment, you know, a couple times a week, they're able to fire the lasers into this little tiny gold capsule that fuses the ingredients together to yield a net access of energy. But the energy that's produced, you know, can boil a pot of water. It can keep a couple of light bulbs on for a couple of hours. That's the amount of energy we're talking about right now. To turn this into a power plant, you're going to have to do this thousands of times a second, which is ores of magnitude beyond anything that anybody can really do today.",

What he thought would be a single journalist, but really it was a sea of cameras and reporters and microphones. And so, when he steps to the lectern, he gave a, kind of, shocked, gasping half laugh.

He lost his ability to defend himself in court because he wasn't compliant with what the judicial system requires. So, that set the stage for a series of three trials for damages. One that was in Austin this summer, in which a jury awarded Neil Heslin and and Scarlett Lewis, the parents of Jesse Lewis who died at Sandy Hook a total of nearly $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages. And then a very big case brought by the families of eight victims in Waterbury, Connecticut, that negative verdict of $1.4 billion dollars for those plaintiffs, those family members. And then there is one more damage of trial brought by Lenny Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa whose son in Noah Pozner, and that is scheduled for March 27.
