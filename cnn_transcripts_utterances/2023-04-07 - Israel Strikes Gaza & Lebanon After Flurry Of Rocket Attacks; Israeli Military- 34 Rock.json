The Israeli Military launched new strikes on both Gaza and Lebanon, saying it went after targets belonging to Hamas militants. Now, Lebanese state media is reporting some damage in southern Lebanon, and says families have been displaced. The Israeli strikes follow a flurry of rockets fired from Gaza toward Israel, some of them reportedly intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome. Now, the Israel Defense Forces retaliated with yet another round of air strikes on Gaza, which Hamas controls. The Palestinian health ministry, meantime, says one of those strikes damaged a pediatric hospital, and as you can imagine, it scared the children inside.Israel blames Palestinian militants for a barrage of rocket attacks from Lebanon into northern Israel. Many were intercepted, but there was some damage. It was the largest attack from Lebanese soil since the war with Hezbollah 17 years ago. Meantime, Hamas released a statement saying it holds the Israeli occupation fully responsible for the consequences of such grave aggression, which reflects the atrocious nature of the fascist Israeli leaders and their policies. Hamas is calling on the Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation to try and intervene here. We want to go now to CNN's Salma Abdelaziz. She joins us now live from Jerusalem.

That was extremely inflammatory to the Muslim world, as you can imagine, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan.In response, we saw rocket fire coming from Gaza, rocket fire coming from southern Lebanon, as well as you mentioned the largest barrage coming from that region in years since the 2006 war. Most of those rockets intercepted, but after, of course, there was barrage of rockets again coming from Gaza in southern Lebanon. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to respond.

I think the first challenge, and this is challenge mainly for the Israeli Police, is today in the prayers on the holy mountain, and how to be able to contain whatever happens on the mountain while not repeating the same kind of footage that we saw from two days ago.This is - the Temple Mount, as the Jews call it, I think it's the most sensitive place on earth. And it's extremely volatile, can explode and can explode the region. We see that everything and, of course, this is on top of a region that was tensed (ph) in a very charged moment anyway. But, what started this sequence of events was the riots in the reply or the operation of the police immediately afterwards. So, this is coming now.

We also heard from a French diplomatic source that President Xi is willing to have a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy when the time is right. So, that remains to be seen.But, the landscape isn't all that different. There is a clear difference of opinion from what we are hearing from the west and from China. So, for example, we heard President Macron say that he feels very much that Russia has been the responsible party for disrupting decades of peace in Europe. Yet, we have President Xi say that for the moment he is going to take this open peacekeeping type of position, but not condemning Russia, and strengthening or continuing diplomatic and economic discussions with Russia. So, right now, we have a lot of words, but very few sides of any kind of action, Paula, that's going to lead to any kind of wholesale shift as to where this conflict in Ukraine is heading, and if a large superpower such as Russia is going to have any more influence than it has perhaps in the past.",

Now, no casualties were reported, but the Ministry of Health says the attack as you can imagine caused distress among the young patients there. The Israeli military says it's been carrying out strikes against Hamas targets in Lebanon and Gaza. Lebanese media reports several families were displaced by those attacks. That's the latest escalation since tensions flared earlier this week, when Israeli police twice raided Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during Ramadan prayers.The strikes against Hamas came just hours after a barrage of rockets nearly three dozen and all were fired from Southern Lebanon toward Israel. The IDF says most, but not all were intercepted. Joining us now from Gaza is Omar Shaban, he is Founder and Director of Pal-Think for Strategic Studies. I want to thank you for being with us. And I have to ask you, what are your fears at this hour as Gaza now has been pulled into this latest conflict. OMAR SHABAN, FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR, PAL-THINK FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: Thank you very much for having me. We are happy that the escalation over the night has ended, it is not sure that things will continue to be calm, despite our understanding that Israel and Hamas both declared publicly and through mediator that they are not interested in escalation. Yesterday, Israeli shelled several targeted in Gaza, no human injuries, some destruction here and there. And Hamas and other militia and Gaza have responded by sending rocket, but to the NBT land (ph). And that this is - this was the game between Israel and Hamas and other militant group in Gaza in the last couple of years. We call it the rule of the game. So, as long as there is no casualties here and there, things will be under control.

But he said it does not come anywhere close to support a recusal. A spokesman for the court declined to comment. Meanwhile, District Attorney Alvin Bragg is pushing back on House Republicans who are seeking information about his investigation, tweeting the House GOP continues to attempt to undermine an active investigation, an ongoing New York criminal case with an unprecedented campaign of harassment and intimidation. Repeated efforts to weaken state and local law enforcement actions are an abuse of power and will not deter us from our duty to uphold the law. Bragg's comments came after the Republican Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan subpoenaed a former top prosecutor at the District Attorney's Office, Mark Pomerantz for his testimony. Pomerantz resigned last year after Bragg stopped him from seeking charges against the former president over the accuracy of his financial statements. The committee has set a deadline of April 20th for his testimony. Pomerantz has previously said the district attorney's office directed him not to cooperate. Kara Scannell, CNN New York.",
