John Berman here, in for Anderson.Tonight, what happens now that the Supreme Court has gutted affirmative action in a decision that could profoundly change college admissions and more broadly, reshape life for millions in this country? Also what, we are learning about the arrest in the Washington neighborhood where the Obamas live of a heavily armed man with materials to make a Molotov cocktail, who is also wanted in connection with January 6th. Plus, what we're learning about a new cooperating witness in the January 6th probe of the former president and why he could be in a position to now say, a lot. First, the Supreme Court's history making decision today dismantling a pillar of affirmative action, specifically college admissions. In it, the court ruled by a six to three margin that race conscious policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina violate the 14th Amendment. In his majority opinion, the Chief Justice writes that the programs \"unavoidably employ race in a negative manner involve racial stereotyping and lack of meaningful endpoints. Those admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause.\" Justices Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, and Thomas wrote separate concurrences. Justice Sotomayor wrote a blistering dissent and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson who recused herself from the Harvard case because of ties to the school wrote this in dissent on North Carolina. \"With let them eat cake obliviousness today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces color blindness for all by legal fiat, but deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\" President Biden meantime offered this.

Something though that Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent called a false promise to save face, her words. No one, she said is fooled.

Apparently, I'm the first person in my family that was born with all my rights. I'm the first person in my family that was born with a right to vote.So apparently, one generation is enough. After 400 years of brutality, of lynching, of discrimination, of overt discrimination, one generation of trying to at least get the kids together on the campuses is enough. It's too much to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court seems like it is living on a different planet from the communities that I work in. These kids are doing all they can to try to figure out a way to get ahead and door after door gets closed on them, and the Supreme Court seems to be acting more like a super legislature that is shutting the door now on women's rights, on the rights of people of color, probably tomorrow on lesbian and gay rights. Something is really wrong here. If you care about this country, if you care about democracy, the Supreme Court is supposed to be playing a role that respects precedent, that has some relationship to what's actually happening and that is not happening here. Look, if you're an Asian parent tonight, you might breathe a little bit of a sigh of relief. We have to acknowledge that some Asian parents have felt their kids have to be three or four times as good. I understand their pain, but to pit Asian kids against Black and Brown kids, when so many kids at campuses like Yale where I went to, Princeton where I taught, half the White kids there, they are there for legacy. They're there just because their granddaddy was there. My granddaddy couldn't be there. My granddaddy couldn't be there. And so to pit Black and Brown kids against Asian kids is wrong. If you want to knock down the doors of unfairness, start with the more than half of the White kids who are there just because of who their families were in the past. Our families couldn't have gotten there in the past, and now maybe not in the future as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, his commentary revolves around the notion that race actually has a role in so many of our socioeconomic factors and that geographical location about opportunities. And so, because race has been so interwoven in all of the things that he outlined, it would hold true that considering each of those factors would have an impact on diversification with race as one component.But it is important to keep in mind here, we've heard a lot of things today unpacking and parsing through what this opinion does. Let's begin with the bare basics here. Affirmative action does not begin with the premise that one is not qualified and then race makes them qualified. It begins with the premise of people who are otherwise qualified, and all of the varieties that are subjectively considered by an admissions policy and process and then race is part of a holistic part of the conversation. Similarly, too, whether you were a cellist, whether you're an athlete, whether you're a legacy, whether you are a veteran, what you would bring holistically to the place that many of the most conservative justices have called a marketplace of ideas, hence, reason all of our discussions about First Amendment and what we want our students to learn and not to be censored about. So keep in mind that factor and now where we are today. Now, they are saying that race cannot be used, but, and there is a bit of a caveat here and the caveat is perhaps the most confusing for admissions officers across the country, and that is, you cannot consider race as a part of a factor or part of the holistic discussion about a student, but if the student should choose to discuss their identity, their lived experience, their actual race, in perhaps an admissions essay, well, then they are able to consider that. Now how does this quagmire work? Would an admissions officer have to then say, well hold on a second, they've talked about race or their personal experience, am I now forbidden because of what the Supreme Court had to say? That's apparently why the administration has spoken out about having some type of standards to use as a guide for different educators and admissions officers. But it does really open a kind of Pandora's Box, particularly with a footnote about the military, when we know that there is a correlation between the officers' ranks, and that which who goes to a university or college setting. And so there are a whole lot of issues here that are now going to be front and center, which will likely lead to further litigation, but mostly, this notion of the dynamic, the hypocrisy to some and the just overarching uncertainty of how this could be enforced, implemented, and followed.",

But that quote that you just read, I think suggests, you know, how applicants could still get their race on the table and have it considered.So this goes all the way back to the oral argument when the Council for the SFFA challenging the affirmative action program was asked, what if somebody wrote on their essay that they overcame and experienced racial adversity? And the council said that would be totally fine, because that would go to the individual's character, rather than to a simple membership in the group. And Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, gave that his imprimatur, and that creates a big avenue. You know, when you think about what every university is now going to do, they're all going to ask a question about have you had any kind of adversity in their life that you would like to bring before the committee? And then that will be done with a wink and a nod and savvy applicants will write you know, I had this experience overcoming racial adversity and universities will be able to take that into account.",

This is the one into January 6 and the efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the election results.And why it matters that Mike Roman is now cooperating is that he may not have to appear before the grand jury in a formal way. He did get a subpoena earlier this year. They did seize his phone a few months ago. So two notable factors there, obviously. He could speak to them in a more informal setting. And it is notable, because he is someone who was involved with the fake elector scheme and we know that is what Jack Smith's team has been zeroing in on in recent weeks and in inquiries they've had with certain witnesses, people they brought before the grand jury, that has been something that they've been talking about. And this campaign aide is someone who was part of the coordination effort with advisers for the campaign, attorneys for the campaign in these seven states that Trump lost where they were trying to develop this alternate set of electors.

You're talking about a very broad scope of conduct. Some of it could get into First Amendment issues. Was the president engaged in political rhetoric?

If they do bring what we call a superseding indictment, basically indictment 2.0, and if they do add people or charges, we don't know. But if they do, one of the practical consequences is they're going to reset the clock here and they're already in a bit of a race to get in ahead of the 2024 election. I'm not sure whether they'll be able to do so. We have a tentative potential trial date of December. But if they do bring additional charges, that's going to basically set the clock back to zero and may really eliminate any chance of getting this in before November.",

We're not going to do a whole Russian history thing here, but go back to Stalin's time when he did the Great Terror.I mean, when he thought that there was stuff going on around him, he killed everybody. Literally, almost everybody, innocents, those who were plotting against him, it didn't matter. Fast forward to 20 years ago, 2003, a guy by the name of Mikhail Khodorkovsky (ph), who was a very successful oligarch, not unlike Prigozhin, who overstepped his bounds, became political, spent 10 years in jail and was exiled. Putin knows how to do this. He has the tools to do it. He puts, you know, nerve agents in people's underwear. He shoots people in parks overseas. He has the -- I think he enjoys doing it, so he knows how to do this. The big question is, why did he not do it here? And I think what the real reason is Ukraine. He is so in such trouble with Ukraine that you've got all the security services that you are referring to, primarily FSB, which has some significant wartime responsibilities. Everything is focused on how badly it's going in Ukraine. So focused, as a matter of fact, that apparently he failed to do what both Stalin and even he himself 20 years ago, knows very well how to do.
