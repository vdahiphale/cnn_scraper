Reviving the Black Sea grain deal Russia says it could happen, but only with major strings attached and Ukraine calls that blackmail. And African leaders work to deliver a unified message. The summit in Kenya is the perfect place to talk climate investment. We're live in Nairobi. Well, the Kremlin is keeping quiet about a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. The U.S. government believes Kim may travel to Russia, likely to discuss providing arms to Moscow for its war in Ukraine. Here you can see a 2019 meeting between Kim and Putin in Russia's Far East. The U.S. National Security Council warns arms talks are actively advancing, but there's no word yet on precisely when the expected meeting might take place. Kylie Atwood has been following the story and joins us from the U.S. State Department. What are your sources telling you, Kylie?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, Adrienne Watson, who's the spokesperson for the NSC, is saying that it's Kim Jong-un who is expecting to meet with President Putin in Russia. Now, that's according to information that the U.S. has. It comes on the heels of U.S. officials warning, as you have said, that the two countries have been actively advancing the possibility of a new arms agreement between them.And we know that last year, North Korea did provide Russia with some weaponry, some battlefield infantry weaponry to be used in the war in Ukraine. And the expectation now is that they're moving towards another potential deal. Now, U.S. officials are very clearly warning North Korea to back off, to cease these negotiations, threatening sanctions if they do go ahead with this. But as of now, what U.S. officials are saying is that the expectation is that this potential new deal would include a significant amount of ammunition for multiple different types of Russian weapon systems, and also the possibility of new raw materials for Russia's defense sector. And that's significant, of course, because we know that Russia is facing so many sanctions so actually, you know, supplying and building up its defense sector has been a challenge. So turning to North Korea here appears to be, you know, one of their only options, frankly. The NSC is calling this a desperate attempt on behalf of Russia. And we should note that we have actually seen a flurry of activity between the two countries leading up to what is this potential meeting between the two leaders. The Russian Defense Minister Shoigu traveled to North Korea back in July, according to the NSC. That was an effort to try and convince North Korea to go ahead with the sale of ammunition to Russia. We also know that there were additional Russian officials who also traveled to North Korea following that visit. And there have actually been letters that have been exchanged in recent months between President Putin and Kim Jong-un talking about advancing the bilateral ties between the two countries. So all, you know, indications here are that this is moving forward. The U.S. is trying to warn North Korea not to go ahead with this, but we will continue to watch for when this potential engagement between the two leaders actually happens. The New York Times saying that it could happen as soon as this month.",

Vladimir Putin told his Turkish counterpart, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Monday that Moscow won't re-enter the agreement until Western restrictions on Russia's agricultural exports are lifted.

      "sentences": "Yes. Here's the details on that, Max. It is dissipating, as you said, tropical depression. But this, remember, is coming on the heels of another typhoon that impacted the Fujian province late in July. So very saturated environment that was Doksuri that made landfall just to the north of where the current tropical depression has made landfall.Now look at the rainfall totals here. We're going to -- actually over 1,000 millimeters in some of these locations across the Fujian province and into Taiwan. Mountainous terrain here kind of wringing out the available moisture in the atmosphere. Still more rain to come, another 150 to 250 millimeters in some of these hard hit areas north of Hong Kong. And you can see how the rainfall moves inland as well. Now, Max mentioned the heavy rainfall threat across Greece. This is something that's kind of unfolding as we're on air right now as a large low pressure system across the eastern Mediterranean continues to fuel itself from the warmer waters above average too. You can see the satellite loop and that counterclockwise rotation. Here's the latest radar from Greece. And some of these rainfall totals might be underdone as well. This is the past 24 hours, over 200 millimeters in some locations. But look at how that rain is just impacting the same location on this radar loop. So we anticipate some of those rainfall totals hereto go up in the hours to come. But the problem here is that the potential for flash flooding and mudslides and debris flows definitely exists within this area. Specifically where we've highlighted that shading of red, that is where we have excessive rain that is ongoing. And some of the pictures that we're seeing on social media right now indicating that as well. We're trying to get those cleared. Here's the additional rainfall that will fall on top of what's already taken place. And these are just off the chart numbers. I mean, we're talking 150 to 250 millimeters of rain for eastern sections of Greece. And this is just north of Athens, by the way. And this region has been impacted by wildfires, as you know, Max. So having rain on top of burn scars creates mud flows and debris flows that can be very dangerous sometimes traveling over 50 kilometers per hour down those mountain slopes.",

We've heard from two U.S. officials that they believe some of the technology that Pyongyang could get from Moscow, if this deal goes ahead, is going to be able to further its nuclear and missile capabilities.Now, the potential for satellite launches is something and a technology that North Korea needs help with. It's tried twice over recent months to launch what it said was a military satellite into space. Both times that has failed. The last time, just last month. So they need more technology know how, and U.S. officials believe that could be one of the deals that they do with Moscow. On top of that, you also have the fact we heard from South Korean intelligence agency just last month that they believe that Pyongyang is looking to know how to be able to repair old equipment, how to have the technical knowhow to be able to do that. So certainly they're looking further long term as to what they can reuse in the future. There are a number of technologies that Moscow could help North Korea with, and that is a great concern to the U.S. and its allies. Max?",

And he had been to China a number of times. So clearly the focus had always been on that closer ally.But what we see is, given what has happened over the past four years or so since Kim Jong-un met with Vladimir Putin, a lot has changed. Russia has invaded Ukraine. It is faltering in its military efforts in Ukraine. So really, the status of Kim Jong-un has changed when it comes to his relationship with Vladimir Putin. [08:20:11] All of a sudden, he is needed by a great power in the world. So that is something that North Korea and Kim Jong-un is obviously going to be trying to exploit. It can also get more oil from Russia. At the moment, its oil is coming from China, and Beijing can decide how much it allows Pyongyang to have at any one time. It is also always good for Pyongyang to be wanting to try and counter that reliance it has on China. So that is clearly going to be one of the factors that Kim Jong-un will think about as well, to have two allies, two large allies in the region, both of which are able to give it technology, oil, potentially cash, and anything else that it might need.",
