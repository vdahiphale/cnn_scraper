But there's a sense in which I think sometimes Democrats, in particular, make this too complicated for themselves. I mean, there's -- there's an old adage in baseball that you should never do what makes your opponent happy. You know, whether you should pull out a pitcher or not. Well, in this case, it seems that Donald Trump's team really wants President Biden to stay in. They think that he is the best chance that they have because of all the good work they've done in laying the groundwork of him being an elderly man that they have the best chance against him. And he is the best recipient of their attacks. Well, if that's the case, I don't think the Democrats need to do anything that's going to make their opponent, especially one who they think is a threat to democracy, make their opponent happy with his opponent.",

That fire is churning through acres and it has thousands of people evacuated because of the conditions up there. We've just learned right now that 11 firefighters have been injured while battling this blaze. Eight of those injuries are because of heat-related concerns. There getting cleared right now as we're learning from CalFire. But this is turning out to be a very dangerous fire season. And part of the reason is because of the fact that we had wet winters.

So it shows you this is a much more active year as far as fires are concerned. And that is why they're asking people, it's Fourth of July, but the last thing you need to do is set off any fireworks that can easily spark the blaze between the heat, the dry conditions, and also with the fires just being able to take off in these winds, they're asking people not to do that. And they're also saying people should stay inside because the heat is going to be in some parts of this area above 110 degrees for several days. And in some places, 110 degrees is in the shade. We have seen deaths already, one in San Jose, California. We've also seen some in Nevada as well or in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Dangerous conditions, Boris.
