He served as the Regional Director for the New York office. And the SEC, basically shut this place down in 2021, right around the time that Santos left. They called it a classic Ponzi scheme in their complaint against the company. Now, what Santos has said, last year, \"The Daily Beast\" reported on the Ponzi scheme. And he said, you know, I don't know, didn't know about it. I'm just as shocked as everyone else. But what our reporting has found, has called it into question, in an exchange with a customer. Let's take a look at that exchange so people can see what happened. Now, you can see that this customer is raising concerns to Mr. Santos about what is essentially the company went out and they told people that if they invested with what the SEC says is now a Ponzi scheme, all of their investment would basically be backed by this line of credit from banks. And here we have this customer telling Mr. Santos, you know, I looked into this. I called my bank. They said it's fraudulent. And most importantly, here is -- this is April 2020. The SEC doesn't take action against them until April 2021. So this is more than a year before that that Santos was alerted to possible fraud at the company.",

The Ukrainian saying that they still have part of it under their control.Now, CNN has spoken to soldier inside Soledar who say -- who would indicate that there are small pockets of Ukrainian forces still inside, but they're divided from one another, they have problems communicating with one another. So, the situation is unclear. What we saw was that certainly on the outskirts of the town, they have set up defensive positions pretty well dug in defensive positions. And it may be a matter of time before they simply have to pull out because of the intensity of the Russian onslaught that has been going on for weeks. And we've seen in the past that, for instance, in Severodonetsk in June, the Ukrainians pulled out after putting up quite a fight. And Lysychansk in July. So, at a certain point, there real diminishing returns to fighting house to house, street to street taking heavy casualties.

With her father's death, Lisa Marie Presley learned at an early age what it means to grieve. Years later, she would experience tremendous grief again when her 27-year-old son Benjamin Keough took his life in 2020. Last year, Lisa Marie wrote an essay about grief for People Magazine. She wrote in part, grief does not stop or go away in any sense, a year or years after the loss. Grief is something you will have to carry with you for the rest of your life.
