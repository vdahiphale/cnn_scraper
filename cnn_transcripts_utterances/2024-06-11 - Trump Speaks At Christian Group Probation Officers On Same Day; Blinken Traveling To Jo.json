Shelby, good morning. Wonderful to see you. Let's start off with what we heard from former President Trump at this event yesterday, with the Danbury Institute, which is a very conservative organization on abortion rights. And the bottom line seemed to be to keep from the left for showing up at all, but what he had to say wasn't good enough for the right.",

And I think this really just represents how difficult of an issue abortion is for Republicans, it's essentially a lose-lose situation, and we've seen how Donald Trump has struggled to grapple with that fact and figure out how to speak on it.So he faced -- he faced backlash from the left because, of course, this is an extremely concerning derivative group that wants to ban all abortions and so their argument was, why is he showing up at all? And then he faced backlash from conservatives who argued that, you know, he sounded like a politician and his brief pre-recorded remarks. He didn't mention the word abortion at all. He didn't take pride for overturning Roe as he so often does, but it encapsulates how the abortion issue is really, really hurting Republicans and how they've just struggled to figure out the happy medium and how to talk about this issue.",

It does as you said seem to have maybe shifted things a little bit four at least the short term, who knows, in five months what's going to happen?But what I think is notable as every time I talked to the Biden campaign, they've been really focused on saying throughout this entire election that they're going to focus on touting his accomplishments, focus on trying to remind voters in a very tough election cycle what he has done. And so, this -- this gun speech is going to be one of those prime examples. It's an issue that a lot of voters care about, particularly his core base and we're going to see a lot from him about this issue. And we've already seen how there also at the same time contrasting what Joe Biden has accomplished in office with Donald Trump's policies. And so, this -- this gun speech sort of represents how the Biden campaign is trying to run their campaigns. One other message that the Biden campaign has been trying to really push, and if you know, anyone that works for Biden comes to the set, they will say -- they will make this argument that Donald Trump is out for himself, that he doesn't care about voters, which is why it stood out to us on the show when Donalds -- this is from over the weekend, Donald Trump rally in Las Vegas.

And quote, so he's kind of -- he's talking about these people who are dying in Gaza as a way to pressure the Israelis.

On the Hamas side, there will be people saying that this is a fight we can't -- you know, we have to outlive it and then you have these quotes which do seem ruthless. Another one says you'll remember when the political leader, Ishmael Haniyeh, his sons were killed. And there's a message apparently, you know, these messages are coming from people have different views on Sinwar as we said. He wrote that the deaths and those of other Palestinians would infuse life into the veins of this nation, prompting it to rise up -- rise to his glory and honor. Was he making the best of a bad situation there or is it as you suggested within this article that the bloodshed actually works for the Palestinian cause? I think a lot of its open to interpretation. A lot of people would have issues with this article. Lot of people who are also say, this says an awful lot about the current leadership of Hamas, obviously.",
