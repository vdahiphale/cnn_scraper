And you know, in America, you are entitled to raise a question. You are entitled to question whether it was honest or not. That's the uniqueness of the First Amendment. That's the uniqueness of America. But you know what? You shouldn't be prosecuted for your thoughts. And the difference here is, when Hillary Clinton said it, nothing happened to her.

He's a different man than the one who was arraigned in Mar-a-Lago's case because now there are additional obstruction counts against him. It makes perfect sense to admonish him about that because that threat has grown larger. But it also creates a potential conundrum here because almost everything that he says when he is insulting a prosecutor, insulting witnesses, all of that can easily in a normal case be construed as trying to affect the jurors. If he gets called on that, that's going to set up quite a train wreck just over that issue. I mean, in the normal case, he could be held in contempt for that. His release conditions could be revoked and of course that's going to immediately tee up the First Amendment arguments. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A top Ukrainian official says that Russians have laid, quote, an insane number of land mines which Ukrainians are clearing on foot.

Economic analysts are predicting the U.S. added a modest 200,000 jobs last month. That would be an encouraging sign that inflation in the U.S. is coming down. The government's latest employment numbers are set to be released in just a few hours and analysts say pegging the jobless rate to remain at 3.6 percent. But if the July employment figure is significantly higher than 200,000, it could be viewed as too inflationary and more possibly lead to more rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. U.S. Gasoline prices have now climbed to their highest level in nine months. Up an average 28 cents per gallon in just the past month. But don't expect relief from OPEC because an official Saudi source says Saudi Arabia will keep in place its voluntary cuts in oil production that were enacted in June. That's 1 million barrels a day of Saudi crude being kept off market. On top of that, Russia reportedly will trim its oil exports by 300,000 barrels a day beginning next month. Also affecting fuel prices is the extremely hot weather around the world which has had a negative impact on refinery operations. We're expecting an update on the Gilgo Beach murders.

Police in Florida have arrested an elderly man for allegedly killing and dismembering his wife. Her remains were found in suitcases in Delray Beach nearly two weeks ago. 78-year-old William Lowe now faces a charge of first-degree murder.

Well this is where the rainfall is going to be the heaviest for later on today. Right along the top of the heat dome here, the rainfall comes down here, and in the same places that we had rainfall yesterday and really almost the day before yesterday. Some of these areas, especially south of Nashville, south of Atlanta, could pick up 2 to 4 inches of rain, in some spots maybe enough to cause some flash flooding. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
