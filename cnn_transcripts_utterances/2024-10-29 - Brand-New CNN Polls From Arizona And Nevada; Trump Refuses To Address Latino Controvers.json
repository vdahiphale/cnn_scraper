CNN finds that Kamala Harris just barely ahead, but no clear leader in that race. And from next door in Nevada, also no clear leader. Though Donald Trump does have a tiny, tiny slim lead there. To help us understand, we can glean from these numbers and the rest of the new Arizona/Nevada polls, we welcome in CNN senior data reporter there. I love that look.",

So I actually brought a backup option just in case I brought a yellow wall if I needed it, but it turns out I do not. So let's sort of dig into these numbers. You know, you mentioned Arizona and Nevada. And what's so interesting to me about these two states is, it's actually not part of Kamala Harris' best bet in order to achieve 270 electoral votes. Her best path actually runs through the Great Lake battleground states up here, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. That would get her to 270 electoral votes. You see on the screen her best bet actually includes Nevada and Arizona being red. But the fact that those states are so close and our new CNN/SSRS polling opens up a potential second path for Kamala Harris, and that is through the Sun Belt. So let's just say those Great Lakes states that I think are part of Kamala Harris' best path, actually go to Trump. She could still get the 270 electoral votes by winning in Nevada and Arizona, which our polls say are certainly possible, as well as winning down here in North Carolina and Georgia, which are so, so tight. Now, this is the good news for Kamala Harris. Let's talk about perhaps the bad news for Kamala Harris. And that comes with Hispanic voters, all right? So this is the Democrat versus Hispanic voters. This is among likely voters in our last poll. Arizona, Nevada average. You go back to November of 2020. Look at this. Joe Biden carried Hispanic voters in these two states by 24 points. You take an aggregate in Arizona and Nevada this time around in our latest poll. Look at that. Kamala Harris is up by just 10 points. So Donald Trump is cutting into the Democratic advantage among Hispanic voters. And more than that, more than that, when you compare it to where we were in August in these two states, look at this. Kamala Harris was ahead by 13 points. Now she's ahead by just 10 points. So there's no sign that Donald Trump isn't keeping up his gains with Hispanic voters. If he ends up winning in Arizona and Nevada, it's because he went in, took a part of what is normally a huge chunk of the Democratic base in the Southwest, and was able to bring those voters closer to them. One little last thing I'll note. I don't have it here on the slides which is you ask whether or not we can trust the polls. And you know what my answer is?",

      "sentences": "That's right. And I'm going to be quiet, both Bianna and Zain, just because he's still talking behind me and I don't wantto be disruptive. But you're totally right. He has not addressed some of those racist, sexist remarks that he had made at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Or excuse me. Not that he had made, but many of the speakers who were in part of that pre-programming before then. However, even though Donald Trump himself did not say those things, did not make those comments or specifically make that joke that we heard from the comedian, Hinchcliffe, where he had said that Puerto Rico or likened Puerto Rico to a floating island of garbage. A lot of people are angry with the Trump campaign and a lot of that backlash is being directed at Donald Trump because they are the ones who gave those people the platform. Now we have heard from many people, including the Archbishop of San Juan, as well as several other Republican leaders, saying that Donald Trump needs to not only address some of what was said, but also condemn and apologize for it. But so far, we have not heard him do that. Now, one key question, of course, is whether or not he's going to take questions from the press once he finishes with these remarks. It's unclear the way that the setup is -- excuse me. The way that this setup is behind me, it's not very conducive to that. But if he does, I think that's what you'll actually hear him address some of this head on. Now, one thing I also just want to point your attention to is that later today, Donald Trump is going to Pennsylvania, particularly he has a later rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, which is home to a very large Puerto Rican population. I think that's going to be another moment where people are going to be wondering, are you going to apologize for what was said at one of your events? But all to say, I think if we put this all together, this is not what his campaign wants to be talking about with just seven days left until election day. You just asked me if I'm talking to people behind the scenes, I am. And we've been hearing that a lot of Donald Trump's allies, those people who want him to win come election day, are calling up Trump's campaign, calling up his advisers, saying you need to do something about this. Now, just to give you a sense as well, Zain and Bianna, of what Donald Trump is currently talking about since he's not addressing those things, this has pretty much been a typical stump speech that I have heard at a lot of his most recent rallies. He's talked a little bit about the economy and inflation, but mainly is focused on immigration issue that he continues to say publicly he thinks is the number one priority, even as many people are telling him the economy is the number one issue for voters. He did actually touched on some of what we have heard him and others really focus on this week about, you know, this question, this conversation around Hitler and whether or not Donald Trump is fascist. Now, he said that Kamala Harris has been labeling him Hitler and calling him a Nazi. Things that we know are not true. But she did tell CNN that she believes he meets the definition of a fascist. But he's also spent a lot of time talking about undocumented migrants coming over the border. But all to say, this has really meant to be these remarks, his rebuttal to Kamala Harris' speech on The Ellipse later today. That is where she is going to deliver her closing argument. And I was told that this is really supposed to be Donald Trump's version of that, trying to draw that contrast with Harris. And I'll also note that this came together. This was not a preplanned speech or remarks that he is giving right now. It came together in less than 24 hours. It was kind of a scramble for all of this to come together. So we're still waiting to see whether or not there's going to be some bigger announcement around this. Zain, Bianna.",

The permit from the National Park Service put it at 40,000, which would be the biggest rally that she has spoken to so far. So, you know, a big event that they're planning for down there on the mall. It was cold earlier, but it should be warmer tonight when she speaks. And the words that her advisors are describing the speeches hopeful, optimistic. These aren't necessarily the themes that I think a lot of people first came to mind when they said that she was going to deliver this closing argument address at The Ellipse, which is where Donald Trump rallied his supporters on January 6th before they marched to the Capitol to stage an insurrection. People had expected, you know, this treaties on democracy, a dissertation on the state of the republic. That is not what advisors say she'll be doing tonight. There will be some of that. Certainly she wants to, you know, make clear this contrast with what she says was the chaos of the Trump presidency versus what she would bring to the office. But they do say that they want her to really help people visualize the kind of president that she would be. And The Ellipse helps in that because it's only 500 yards from the Oval Office. She'll be speaking in front of the South Portico of the White House and her team really wants people to be able to picture what kind of president she would be. And they really do view this as the last probably big tent-pole moment to try and convince what they call conflicted voters. People who aren't really sold on Donald Trump, who may be concerned about some of the rhetoric that they've been hearing from him on the campaign trail over the last several weeks, but who also aren't sold on Kamala Harris, who want to know more about her plans for the economy, for example, who want to know really more about who she is as a person. They say this could be the moment for her to do that. They say that this is a closing argument and they've likened it to some of the closing arguments she gave as a prosecutor in courtrooms. They say she's been laying out the evidence to the jury, in this case, undecided voters, and this will be her a moment to try and bring it all together to try and thread it all together into this cohesive argument for her candidacy. And so it remains to be seen. You know, there's no question. I don't think one speech, one moment like this is going to to convince every undecided voter out there that she's the candidate for them. But they do believe that in this final stretch of the campaign, as there are fewer and fewer moments like this to reach an audience, a televised audience of millions, that this could be the last chance for a lot of these people to hear from her and they do want to make the most of that in that speech tonight.",

Jeff, thank you so much for being with us. I just want to sort of jump off from what Kevin Liptak was just saying there. I mean, obviously, Harris' speech at The Ellipse is, of course, steeped in symbolism.

Now we hear from Harris' campaign that she's not just going to be focusing on the need to preserve democracy and the threat that Donald Trump poses. She'll also be speaking about the economy as well.

She is going to make clear what that means, yes, in terms of democracy. And, of course, that is fundamental and important. But you're right, it's not fundamental to every voter and not necessarily fundamental to a lot of the voters she now needs to reach. And so I think you will also hear how she's turning the page a little bit on President Biden. And I say this with love and respect for my former boss, but she is stepping out there and giving people a look at what she will be like as her own person and her own president. And so I expect you to hear about her tax cuts for middle families, making housing more affordable, making healthcare more affordable.

There's no reason that Vice President Harris can't make her own policies similarly concrete. In the case of housing, actual concrete, but make it meaningful in people's lives, what Trump's tax plans will do to raise taxes on the middle class, what her plans will do to lower taxes, same with housing, same with healthcare, same with a whole host of issues.

The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, expressing concerns aboutthe fact that Israel does not appear to be improving access to humanitarian aid in Gaza. You'll recall that before this UNRWA bill came up, before the Israeli Parliament, several weeks ago, the United States sent a letter to Israel giving them 30 days to dramatically increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza with very specific benchmarks of the number of access points into Gaza, the number of trucks per day, a whole range of steps that needed to be taken, especially as the situation in Northern Gaza was growing more and more dire. And not only have Israeli officials not come close to fulfilling that list of demands by the United States on the humanitarian aid front, but now, they have also passed this bill into law yesterday, overwhelmingly 92 to 10, in the Israeli Knesset to effectively ban UNRWA staffers from transiting across Israel to ban UNRWA resources from going on to Israeli territory. And while this doesn't explicitly ban UNRWA from functioning inside Gaza or the West Bank, it is going to make it exponentially more difficult and perhaps may ultimately end up having the effect of debilitating UNRWA's ability to provide aid to Palestinians as the number one provider of aid to Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip. So it's not clear who can or will fill the void. The United States still seems to be pressuring Israel to hold off on implementation of this law. We heard from the Israeli prime minister in his office yesterday making clear that sustained humanitarian aid, he said, must remain available in Gaza. But, of course, that rhetoric simply is not matching up with what we are seeing on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza, where parts of that -- part of the Gaza Strip have been completely besieged by the Israeli military. And that was evidenced this morning in the aftermath of this strike in Beit Lahia in Northern Gaza, not only did you have at least 90 people who were killed in this strike, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry and local hospital officials, but you also don't have Gaza's civil defense able to go there to rescue people from under the rubble. You don't have ambulances that can take the injured to hospitals. And once people do make it to the hospital at Kamal Adwan, for example, there simply are not enough doctors. There are about two doctors now remaining at that hospital, none with surgical expertise. And getting patients from that hospital further south in the Gaza Strip has proved enormously difficult. So it is very clear when you listen to U.N. and other humanitarian aid officials that Northern Gaza is staring down perhaps one of the worst crises that we have seen over the course of this war. And there is no real indication that that is a problem that the Israelis are focused on solving. Instead, it appears that their actions are only making the situation there worse. Bianna, Zain.",

A lot of that can be traced to economics, and a lot of it can be traced to educational divides. And so I think the question for those of us in the West, those of us within the Republican Party in the United States, is how do you provide a solution to close that educational gap? Does that mean more college for everyone? Or does that mean more trades for everyone? Or is there a healthy combination of the two? What does that look like in terms of closing that economic gap so that you don't have people who live in sort of major cities or suburban areas earning far more than those who do not reside in those areas? This is a very complicated problem that I think the party and society is writ large are going going to have to address. But I think, you know, again, to answer that fundamental question, what does it mean about the Republican Party? It just means that the party is disparate from where it was 10, 15, 20 years ago.
