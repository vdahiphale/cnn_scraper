We have new numbers to illustrate choices women are making since Roe versus Wade was overturned two years ago. Most abortions are still provided in-person, but that number is on the decline. Slowly declining.So, what are women turning to instead? CNN's Meg Tirrell is with us now. Tell us more about what is changing here and what is being used instead as women seek abortion care.",

Wade was overturned. And they are higher now than they were before the Dobbs decision in 2022.So, on average, there are about 99,000 monthly abortions provided either through hospitals, clinicians offices, or through telemedicine per month in the United States for the first half of 2024. If you compare the last quarter, up through June to the same period in the year before, they were up 11 percent overall. And a lot of that is being - being driven by access through telemedicine. So, people who are getting access to medication abortion. You can see there, that red line was when the Dobbs decision was that overturned Roe v. Wade. And now the average number of monthly abortions is higher than it was previously before that decision. So, telemedicine is the way a lot more people are getting access to abortion. It was about 4 percent of total clinician provided abortions in April of 2022, right before Dobbs was overturned. Now, it's 21 percent of total abortions.",

But, of course, there were more than a dozen states that almost totally banned abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned. Still, more states enacted, you know, six-week bans that are fairly early. And what we see is that there are shield laws, which are laws that provide some protection to doctors in other states who can prescribe medication abortion through telemedicine to people in states with these bans. And we saw that about 9,000 people, or even more per month, were accessing medication abortion through telehealth in states with bans or with these early gestational limits on accessing abortion.We also know that folks travel outside of states to get abortion care if they have bans or limits in their states. But in states like Texas for example, where the travel time is much farther than it could be in other states, you didn't see as many people being able to access abortion as before the bans went into place.",

Daniel, let's play some of this, what we heard from the former president yesterday first. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They had spent hundreds of millions of dollars doing other things. Things that I don't think bear any relationship to this money. There was - they were not supposed to be spending the money on taking in illegal migrants. They didn't get the proper support from this administration. They spent their money on illegal migrants. They spent their money. They didn't have any money left for North Carolina. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Trump made at least three false claims on this subject in his remarks yesterday.So, he claimed at one point in North Carolina that FEMA's disaster relief money is, quote, \"all gone.\" It's not. As of last week, FEMA had about $8.5 billion left in that fund, although it might have to go back to Congress to get some additional funding for the rest of the year. Second of all, it is again - and we've pointed out - not true that FEMA improperly diverted disaster relief money to House migrants. What happened was that Congress appropriated about $650 million for FEMA to administer a program to support the sheltering of migrants, but separately appropriated more than $35 billion in the same fiscal year for disaster relief funding. Those are simply two separate pots. There's no sign that anything inappropriate is happening. And third of all, it is not true that the Biden administration ran out of money, they had no money to support North Carolina in the wake of this hurricane. In fact, FEMA itself has already provided more than $100 million in individual assistance to North Carolina residents post-hurricane. And the Biden administration over all says that it has already provided more than 300 million to the state in general. That includes aid to county and other local governments.",

It's not true that the Trump presidency lost more manufacturing jobs than any other presidency. Under George W. Bush, there were about 4.5 million manufacturing jobs lost. Under Trump it was about 178,000. And there are also more manufacturing jobs lost that under Trump under Eisenhower, under Ford, under Reagan. So, Trump does not have the record.I think it's also worth pointing out for context that these Trump job losses in manufacturing overwhelmingly occurred because of the Covid pandemic. Pre-pandemic under Trump there was a gain of about 414,000 manufacturing jobs. Again, he ended negative 178,000, but that was largely because we had a pandemic related crash.",

In 2024, among Latino men right now, Harris leads Donald Trump 48 to 45 percent. Now, that same group, when you ask them who they supported four years ago, it was Biden, 39, Trump, 30.

But we have seen a shift in regards to Latino men. But that's not necessarily the case when it actually comes to Latina women. The one thing that, you know, really none of the campaigns have actually really account before is that 20 percent of the new Latino voters will be voting for the first time, right, ever.

Men who were - people who were aspiring to be models and essentially allowing them to travel - or helping them travel internationally, sometimes in the United States, to ascend these sort of sex-themed parties where those men allegedly thought that they might have a chance to actually be a model, possibly for Abercrombie and Fitch or, you know - you know, go - you know, expand their career. And those parties, we're learning, included drugs, they included alcohol, they included sometimes Viagra as part of this whole sex trafficking scheme that we're hearing happened between December 2008 and March 2015. Now, during part of that time, Jeffries was still currently the CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch. And these allegations might sound somewhat familiar to you because if you remember the BBC had a long investigation into Jeffries after they learned about some of these allegations last year. CNN actually reaching out to the company who described the allegations at that time as appalling and disgusting, saying that they were going to launch their own investigation. But now it seems that there are criminal charges against these three men. I'm told that this was a united sort of investigation with the Eastern District of New York, as well as the FBI and the sex trafficking unit of the NYPD. We're learning those three men were arrested in different states, two in Florida, including Jeffries, one in Wisconsin.
