      "sentences": "It is 3I'm Jim Sciutto. Thanks so much for joining me on CNN NEWSROOM. And let's get right to the news. We begin with closing arguments in the criminal hush money trial against former President Donald Trump. Right now, Manhattan prosecutors are making their final argument to the jury, asking them to do what has never been done before in American politics, and that is convict former U.S. president of a felony or felonies. The prosecution getting the final word, that's how it works under New York law after roughly three hours of closing from Trump's defense attorney Todd Blanche, who urged jurors to discount the testimony from Trump so longtime former attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, telling jurors Cohen is a liar, the MVP of liars, the greatest liar of all time, GLOAT, coining that phrase. That's clearly a focus of their closing arguments. Following every development with me, CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, right now, we have the prosecutors in the midst of their closing argument and it strikes me as I watch headlines from inside the courtroom at what they're trying to do here is show that their case goes beyond Michael Cohen to some degree. For instance, they bring up David Pecker, calling his testimony regarding the scheme theme to kill stories inconvenient to the president are utterly devastating, but also adding that when it comes to Cohen, sure, Cohen lied but Cohen lied on Trump's behalf for years.",

Good to have you both on because -- well, the jury is going to get this case quite soon. And I want to start with you if I can Misty because you've been on a lot of courtrooms here.

What the defense wants to argue is that the jury should actually completely discard his testimony. Their team that up in the closing arguments, the jurors will be read a jury instruction that will say, if you believe a witness lied about something material, not sky is blue. No, this guy is aqua, but a material fact, jurors, you can actually disregard their entire testimony. So that's why you saw so much focus by the defense on Michael Cohen, who the prosecution has largely built their case around. Now, of course, on the flip side, you're hearing prosecutors try and corroborate Michael Cohen's testimony with other evidence, which is very predictable on that front. But, yeah, the defense really went after Cohen and there was a reason for it and it's really strategic.",

He's a liar when it comes to this particular evidence. And that's again on the flip side, that's what -- that's what the prosecutors are going to try to do, is to show even if he is imperfect, he had no motive to lie here around these particular circumstances.And so, to try to maintain his credibility and jurors look at how they testify, how witnesses say what they say, your demeanor, their tone of voice, how they performed on cross-examination and redirect.

Of election interference by paying off to kill, to kill stories. So he -- he doesn't have what a lot of imperfect witnesses might have, which is to say they're testifying so that they don't go to prison. Prosecutions made that point.Misty Marris the other strategy the prosecution is seems to be pursuing now as they continue their closing argument is to say, our case goes beyond Michael Cohen. I mean, they said, for instance, the testimony of David Pecker, the former publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", who discussed this early meeting with Trump and Cohen to kill a lot of these stories going forward. They describe that testimony is an utterly devastating. I wonder do they -- can they do that successfully saying we've got a lot more here than just his testimony or is Cohen's testimony so central that to convict the jury essentially has to believe him?",

And from what I understand, this particular judge, they seem to have a pretty good back-and-forth and rapport. So that generally doesn't work for you.On the other hand, there's sort of two ways jurors think about attorneys. One is do they like them and one is, do they trust them? They don't decide cases based on whether they like an attorney or not, but whether they trust the attorney can have an impact because it can color how they weigh the credibility and the probative value of the evidence that that attorney is presenting to them, either through witness or through their open-air closing. So, if they get the sense that the attorney is just not a likable a person. That's one thing, but if they get a sense that the attorney is trying to mislead them, then that can do some damage to their case.",

At least 29 Palestinians were killed in two separate attacks on displacement camps today. The first coming in the early hours of the morning, striking three tenths in a camp, 150 meters away. That's all from Sunday's horrific attack. The second happens just hours ago, hitting another displacement camp in the alleged safe zone of al-Mawasi. The IDF denied is striking the humanitarian area. Really this month, Israel had ordered people in eastern Rafah at ahead to that area, al-Mawasi, as the IDF moved into the southern city that was supposed to be the safe place. Since then, UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, says, some 1 million people have now fled Rafah. This all comes as eyewitnesses report Israeli military tanks are seen now in central Rafah for the first time since the IDF entered the city. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem. Jeremy, explain to me what's happening in Rafah. We've had all this debate, all this pressure from the U.S. saying don't go in, if you go in, go in a limited way. Now, there were tanks in there and there have been multiple strikes in the last 24 to 48 hours, that it killed significant numbers of civilians. What is actually happening in Rafah and have Israeli forces effectively invaded? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, there is no indication of any kind of slowdown in the Israeli military's operations in Rafah, as you mentioned eyewitnesses spotting Israeli tanks in central Rafah today in the downtown part of the city. That is the furthest west that we have seen Israeli tanks and troops actually advanced in Rafah until now, the military offensive of in terms of ground troops was largely centered around eastern Rafah. And as you noted, the on that strike on Sunday, which killed 45 people according to the Palestinian ministry of health, overnight about 150 meters away from that Sunday strike zone, the Israeli military carried out yet another strike on another camp where displaced Palestinians were living. Now, in terms of the ground offensive within Rafah itself, there is some indication that this is not the kind of all-out ground offensive that was feared. And part of the reason for that, Jim, is because it's not what we've seen the Israeli military do in northern Gaza or in Khan Younis. We are watching military activity on a much different scale. That doesn't mean that it's not deadly, that doesn't mean that these airstrikes aren't resulting in significant civilian casualties. But in terms of the movements that we are seeing on the ground, it seems that the U.S. pressure may a have at least gotten Israel to tailor its operations in a more precise way and in a way that causes far less destruction. We should also note, of course, that nearly a million Palestinians from Rafah have already been displaced. And so, in some of these cases, the Israeli military is moving into areas where people have already largely left, although we know that generally, some civilians do still remain.",

But we have also seen that the Israeli military has used some of these crossing points like Kerem Shalom, like the Erez crossing in the north as staging grounds for its ground troops and armored vehicles. And so, we've also seen Hamas targeting those areas in part because there are Israeli troops there. So there's no question that there are still a number of difficulties in terms because of getting the sufficient amount of aid in via the land. And, of course, that floating pier which already was struggling to get the amount of aid in that it was supposed to now broken apart and the future of that effort remains unclear. At the same time, we are witnessing the mass displacement of Palestinian people within Gaza. And also a shattering of what little sense of safety they may have had.

There should be no innocent life lost here as a result of this conflict.Israel, of course, has a right to go after Hamas. And we understand that the strike did kill two senior Hamas terrorists who are directly responsible for attacks against the Israeli people but as we've also said many times, Israel must take every precaution possible to do more to protect innocent life. As soon as we saw these reports over the weekend about the strike, we reached out to the Israeli defense forces at various levels to gather more information and we've been actively engaged with the IDF and with partners on the ground to learn more about what happened. I'll note that these really defense forces today released initial findings, initial findings that point to the fire being caused by a secondary explosion, not the initial strike. I think this speaks very clearly to the challenge of military airstrikes and densely populated areas of Gaza, including Rafah, because of the risk of civilian casualties, which of course happened terribly in this case, a horrible loss of life.
