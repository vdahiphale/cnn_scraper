For the second time, in two days, Israeli forces attacked UNIFIL, the U.N.'s peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, seriously injuring one peacekeeper and leaving three more wounded. The IDF says they told the staff to enter into protected spaces hours before identifying and responding to a threat. Meantime, in Gaza, the U.N. says that no food, no food at all has entered northern Gaza since October 1st, putting 1 million people at risk of starvation there. Two of central Gaza's main bakeries have been forced to close down, a new independent U.N. inquiry accused Israel of carrying out a concerted policy of destroying the health care system, saying its actions constitute war crimes. CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, is in Tel Aviv for us. So, Nic, as we mentioned, nothing -- pretty much nothing has gone into northern Gaza since October 1st. Just walk us through what that means as it pertains to the situation when it comes to hunger on the ground there.",

The air, warning sirens have gone off about ten miles up the coast from here. And we heard from here a couple of dull explosions way off in the distance and the IDF is saying that the alarms -- in the sirens, the alerts have been activated in some parts of central Israel because hostile aircraft were detected.Normally, that would seem to imply that UAVs or drones, but to your question about what's happening in Gaza, the humanitarian situation there, which are in northern Gaza has really taken a turn for the worst over the past ten days, U.N. agencies are saying that no humanitarian aid has been able to get into northern Gaza since the first of October. And if you just look at them numbers from the past couple of months, in August, 700 aid trucks got into the north. In September, about 400 aid trucks got in. So it's really dwindled down to nothing. And U.N. officials say that that people are hungry. Hunger is rampant and the risk of -- the risk of starvation is becoming very real, again. Of course, a north of Gaza was the part of Gaza that really suffered most at the beginning of the war that suffered worst in terms of the humanitarian situation, the IDF for started up military operations in the north over the past few days that they've also put in evacuation orders for about 400,000 people there, hospitals in the north are running out of fuel. Three of them, their face complete shutdown according to doctors and that would mean their life support centers, the ICUs. They would have no power. So they say people in there would perish, that they've -- the hospitals have been told to evacuate. This say it's not safe to evacuate in many cases, because they're fighting is too close some. So the picture -- the humanitarian picture in the north of Gaza is absolutely stark. And, you know, in the past couple of days, U.S. officials have told the Israeli counterparts that they must uphold the international laws -- humanitarian laws, which mean that Israel needs to make sure that enough food, enough water, enough other humanitarian goods like fuel, is getting through, and it's not just in the north. Bakeries in the center of Israel, in central Gaza, rather, were being told, have also had to stop production. They were getting their fuel and flour supplies from the U.N. The U.N. can't get those supplies in. So the bread -- that is an absolute staple for people in Gaza at the moment, that many tens of thousands would have depended on there, that's not getting delivered now either.",

One of them has serious shrapnel injuries to her stomach and has been evacuated the hospital. So this is what is causing a lot of international concern. The Spanish prime minister has taught to Israelis officials about his concerns. The U.N. has spoken about their concerns about this.

WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  I don't think Lebanon really avoids it. Unfortunately, I just think we've reached a point where Israel, which has military power, which is insecure about its future, which she's threats from every direction, has decided that it can wait no longer, despite the entreaties of the Biden administration has decided to use its military force to strike at Hezbollah, and the sad part is Hezbollah has anticipated this for years. They have dispersed their sites all over Lebanon as far as we can tell. And apparently, the Israelis continue to have a targetable intelligence and go after these sites. Maybe these sites are not as prominent or as important as the early sites, but as Hezbollah struggles and tries to put together a defense and a resistance and uses more and more of Lebanon for this, the Israelis are coming after them in those spots.

He's going to announce when they are exceptionally are calling Project Aurora, which would be a rounding up of Venezuelan gang members, migrants, if he were to be elected in November. But the thing to remember here is that we have heard from governor of Colorado. We have heard from the mayor of Aurora. We have heard from local officials, state officials, who have all said that this has been exaggerated, that they are, the city is not overrun by these Venezuelan gang members. But when it comes to that fear-based messaging, whether or not it's on immigration or the economy, Donald Trump and his team believed that it is working, that it resonates with voters. And if you look at the most recent polling, we just saw with new polling out today, \"Wall Street Journal\", that shows that this race is neck and neck, razor-thin margins, too close to call, in most of these battleground states, and you're getting close to that November day, which means that Donald Trump and his team believe that this message is working for them. So any idea, despite this law enforcement pushed back, despite these local officials saying, this isn't true, that he would tone down his rhetoric seems to be a moot point because they believe that this, the kind of rhetoric, particularly when it comes to immigration, that could help propel him to the White House in November.

You know, the polls now, neck and neck between Harris and Trump, but there has to be, I imagine, a small but maybe significant contingent among Democrats, even among independents who might say that they're voting for Harris, but who might not, because she is a black woman.How will that factor into things?",

And so they haven't leaned in on that message the way that maybe Hillary Clinton and some of the people around her did back in 2016.But that does remain a big challenge that even if it's a small slice of voters who are publicly saying they support Kamala Harris publicly saying they support the idea of breaking the glass ceiling for the first time in history are not privately comfortable with it and are either going to sit at home and not vote or are going to vote for Trump secretly. And so that is a big challenge that is something that could sway the election in a very close race where we could be talking about states decided by thousands of votes, not even tens or hundreds of thousands of votes. And so, that is a big challenge for the Harris campaign. They are trying to close the gender gap that has existed between Trump and Harris, Biden speaking to men. She's going to be talking to Charlamagne Tha God on next week in Detroit, trying to reach some of his male listeners and so they're trying to close that gap. Tim Walz is doing it as well. But they do have that risk that some people may publicly say that they're supporting her, but privately vote for Trump or stay home.",

But the Alafia River's a mile away from here. So this really took people by surprise to see their community. I mean, look at this, this is a gas station underwater. So many cars flooded. I saw deeper into the neighborhood, the water reaching up to mailboxes and up to the homes as well, so many people that have lost it all. We've been following around with the Hillsborough County sheriffs office by air boat as they've been checking in on people rescuing people, allowing people to even go back inside of their homes, filling up trash bags with their belongings, clothes, shoes, necessary, things, pictures, memories. I followed a couple and their names are Ralph and Tina as they were doing that. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, some of them are away and into warmer, better conditions. But a lot of them are still using that elementary school.
