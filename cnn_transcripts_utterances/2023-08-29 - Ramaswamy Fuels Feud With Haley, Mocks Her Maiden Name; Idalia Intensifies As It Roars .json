But I've given up on him knowing better than anything at this point. We saw the childish, demeaning side of him on stage\".Let's discuss now. CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson is here. CNN's Kristen Holmes is still with us. And Heidi Przybyla of Politico is here. Thank you so much, one and all. Great to see you. Nia, I'll start with you. What are your thoughts on this? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: You know, it was kind of a surprisingly low. I think she used the word childish blow. Listen, progressives have sort of done this online too, with Nikki Haley suggesting that somehow she was ashamed of her Indian heritage. I don't know what he's trying to do here other than kind of draw attention to himself and be an agent of chaos. That's who he was on the debate stage and that's who he is, I think, just generally in this field and, you know, he's able to get under the skin of people. But it certainly, I think, underscores their debate and the kind of fuel that was, I think, lit at that debate and that Nikki Haley is trying to go after him and prove that he is not ready for primetime. And in some ways, this stunt, I don't know if it was a staffer, I don't know who did this on his webpage, but it kind of proves it's a little bit amateurish and a little immature.",

Given that, most Republicans aren't looking to be rescued from Donald Trump. The fact is, they really do like him. And at this point, they think he's their best shot\". Joining our conversation is the woman who wrote that and also a CNN Political Commentator, Kristen Soltis Anderson. This is such a fascinating thing because if you talk to anybody who is on the Democratic side, and even some almost -- they obviously cringe. They can't even conceive of the concept of liking Donald Trump. And then according to what you wrote, and we just know based on everything that we've seen, it's the opposite when it comes to Trump's supporters. They don't support him begrudgingly. They genuinely really like him.",

We've seen poll after poll after poll that he is far out in front, at least in national polls, in the GOP primary. But what is surprising is that it's not that they like him, despite worrying that he might struggle in a general election against Biden, it's that in some ways, they think he's their best shot against Biden.Polling from CBS News showed that 61 percent of Republican voters think that Donald Trump would be a sure bet to beat Biden, because exactly how you describe Democrats and independents think of Trump, oh, I can't believe anyone would like him. That's exactly how Republicans view Biden. They can't imagine anyone would vote for him. And so they think, sure, Donald Trump versus Joe Biden. Trump's more energetic, he's the one that would win.",

That's why DeSantis is always talking about I'm a winner, look at the wins I put up in Florida.And there was a point in time early on in the presidential primary where DeSantis and Trump were closer to evenly matched. That has faded as the memory of the midterms have gone away. And now all of these contenders, you saw Nikki Haley try to make this argument in the debate, Donald Trump's not well liked.

One of the things that Trump and his team have been doing is -- and they've been doing this since he announced, is that they have these dinners at their -- first at Mar-a-Lago, now Bedminster, with these social media influencers on the conservative side.And they get feedback from them on what the biggest issues are that are riling up the far right, the right community. This is like the Charlie Kirk's of the world, and there are a lot of them. And that dinner and that trip to East Palestine stemmed from one of those. This was a news story that they believed the right was all rallying around in Ohio and now a really red state. And that was really not getting a lot of attention from the left and from other candidates. They decided to go to East Palestine then. The reason I bring that up is because I do think that there is a strategy there. And I thought the most interesting part of your piece was after the midterms, when essentially people were telling me they thought Donald Trump was going to lose. It was sad. I was at Mar-a- Lago, it was like a depressing scene. We thought he was going to come over. He just walked out. I mean, it was really probably one of the lowest moments, but it goes to, one, the fact that he's always been able to bounce back. But two, they have this strategy in place where they're reaching out to these conservatives and tapping into what they care about and then acting on it.",
