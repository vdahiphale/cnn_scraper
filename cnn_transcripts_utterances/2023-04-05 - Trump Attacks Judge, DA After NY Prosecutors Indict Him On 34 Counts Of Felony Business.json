      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. New developments in the cases against Donald Trump. Top Trump aides tell a federal grand jury about the former president's plan to cease voting machines. And there's new fallout from the 34 felony count New York indictment. Trump attacks the prosecutor and the judge and that case now on a parallel path with the 2024 nominating calendar.Plus two big middle election -- middle America elections in Chicago. A progressive wins the Chicago mayor's race dominated by crime and by schools and this Wisconsin blockbuster, Democrats seizing control of the state Supreme Court. That giant proof of the power of the abortion issue. And today the Speaker of the House plays host to Taiwan's president. Beijing reacts angrily even though this meeting is a compromise of sorts. Up first for us, next steps in the 34 felony count New York case against Donald Trump and some important exclusive new CNN reporting about one of two federal investigations of the former president. New York first and what we are learning the day after Trump's history-making Manhattan arraignment. The former president is attacking the prosecutor and the judge despite that judge telling all sides in the case, please watch your words. That part of a political strategy in a case now slated to play out on a parallel track with the 2024 Republican nominating calendar. More on the politics in a moment. But the law first. The 16-page charging documents spells out 34 separate times the president allegedly falsified business records as part of a hush money scheme. Each count reads the same, and each count carries the same maximum penalty of four years in prison. Prosecutors inside the 15th floor courtroom drew a direct line between the cooking of the Trump books and what they allege was an urgent plot to hide damaging information from voters in the final days of the 2016 campaign. What the prosecution leaves out though, is as important. District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his prosecutors can only charge the business fraud as felonies if they prove it was done as part of another crime. Bragg says he will connect the dots at trial. But he did not specify an underlying crime, either in the indictment or in an accompanying -- accompanying statement of facts. Some legal experts see that as a weakness in the case. Others though, say smart poker players don't show all their cards until they have to. Let's begin in Florida and with CNN's Kristen Holmes. Kristen, the president responding to the indictment once back in his safe and happy place, Mar-a-Lago. More about the politics and the substance.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, John. Most of this was an attack on all of the current investigations into former President Trump and when we talk about that New York case, he essentially ignored the warning from the judge that was issued to all sides to tread lightly when talking about this case.And he went full throttle, he attacked the District Attorney in New York, and he went after the judge and the judge's family. And there is no indication from any person close to Trump, who I've talked to that that's going to slow down. And in fact, I believe it will amplify. As we know, they've already started trying to fundraise off of this. Immediately, during that arraignment, they put out that fundraising email where they had actually modified and put a manufactured mug shot on it to try to raise money there. They are looking at this through the 2024 lens. So of course the question becomes, what will the judge do? Will there be a gag issue ordered? Well, there's going to be a very fine line to walk here because Donald Trump is not a normal defendant. He is running for President and his team is watching this very closely. They know that they want to again engage this as a political action. They want to look at this through that 2024 lens. So that's something to keep an eye on here. Now, of course, as we know, there are some upcoming dates as this moves forward. First of all, you have the political side. Donald Trump is going to speak at the NRA next Friday. They are keeping this as campaign you know, this is the new normal despite the fact that he had this indictment. On the legal side motions need to be filed in August and September. Of course, as we know, Donald Trump's lawyers have said they were going to throw everything they can at this. And then there is in-person hearings on December 4. So a lot coming up and it all goes around you know as we ramp up that 2024 calendar.",

Now, the problem is that Donald Trump as a defendant, forget what you think of him as a politician, Donald Trump, the defendant is entitled to know the evidence against him that he will face in trial and the charges that he's going to be confronted with. And if there's ambiguity as to what criminal charge would cause this bump up, that might cause a bit of a problem.

So lay this out. You have exclusive reporting. Ken Cuccinelli, top official at the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, who I believe at the time was his boss at the Department of Homeland Security, testifying to a federal grand jury about being involved in meetings where Trump wants to seize voting machines. What do we know? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: John, that's right. Multiple top national security officials that served in the Trump administration have gone into the grand jury and testified in recent months and talked a lot about how they had conversations directly with Trump himself and said, look, DHS, the military, they don't have the authority to seize voting machines and they had to repeat that message not just to Trump, but to his lawyers to various allies within the administration within the White House. But the fact that Trump himself was asking whether or not the federal government could seize voting machines is really one of the first details that we're learning about this closed door testimony in the Jack Smith, January 6, federal investigation. Now, this is all happening in secret. You know, witnesses go in and they testify in private.
