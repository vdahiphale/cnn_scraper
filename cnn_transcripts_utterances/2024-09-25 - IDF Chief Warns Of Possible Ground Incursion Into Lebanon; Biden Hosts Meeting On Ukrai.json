And workers, we feared, McDonald's touchscreens would kill jobs, what they actually did was transform how they the restaurants operate and create new ones. Well, I am in New York, it is Wednesday, September the 25th. I am Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. Israel's top general says, the military is preparing for a possible ground incursion into Lebanon as the Israeli Defense Forces call up two reserve brigades. Israel has now launched heavy airstrikes on Hezbollah targets for three straight days. Lebanese officials say the latest strikes killed at least 51 people and have injured 200, and the United Nations estimates nearly 100,000 people have been displaced. Hezbollah, it continues to fight missiles deep into Israel further than ever before. Now, in Tel Aviv, residents woke up to sirens after Israel intercepted a missile over the city. Hezbollah says the target was Mossad's headquarters. President Biden of the US says the conflict must not be allowed to spiral out of control. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The strain has been found in several African nations as well as Sweden and Thailand. China says it successfully fired an intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead into the Pacific Ocean. The Defense Ministry says the launch is part of its annual training as China and Russia conduct joint naval exercises. It's Beijing's first big public announcement about a missile test in more than four decades. In Los Angeles, the police have arrested an armed hijacker who took control of a public bus. It was a one-hour pursuit and ended with police puncturing the bus's tires with a spike strip. One person in the bus was shot and died from injuries and the driver and one passenger had to be rescued. The southeastern U.S. is bracing for a powerful hit from Hurricane Helene. It's a monster storm that's gaining strength and it's barreling through the Caribbean towards the Florida Panhandle. The forecasters are warning the area could see a storm surge of three to five meters as Helene grows bigger and picks up speed. There are now mandatory evacuation orders in place as part of 15 Florida counties and when it makes landfall on Thursday night the 200 kilometer per hour winds. Parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula already seeing severe flooding and power has been knocked out to 50,000 customers in western Cuba, which is where Patrick Oppmann is in Havana.

And this was despite new evidence that suggested he may have been innocent or at least raised doubt as to whether or not the execution should have taken place or there should have been a stay. Prosecutors -- even the prosecutor and the family of the victim were calling for his life to be spared, that of Marcellus Williams. It was 1998, it was a stabbing death of Felicia Gayle, and his lawyers appealed the rulings at the state Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court. Well, the top court declined to block the execution. Three justices, the liberal three, indicated they would have put the execution on hold. Sonya Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They are the liberals and the makeup of the court is now raising questions on the conservatives' super majority and how it moves. Our chief Supreme Court analyst is Joan Biskupic, and she's with me. When I read it, it is so -- look, the point here, Joan, is it is unusual in these cases for dissenters to literally say we're dissenting.

But I have to stress that they didn't give their legal reasoning and neither did the majority. You know, in these kinds of cases, they handle them in a quick emergency fashion and they don't explain why they're not -- why they will not intervene or get involved. But you hit it exactly right in the intro. This was the unusual case where a prosecutor who had been responsible for even having Mr. Williams convicted back in 2001 when his actual conviction took hold, he had come in and said, look, the evidence was potentially tainted.

This is of employees in the Renton factory in Washington. That's the same factory where this plane rolled out new without the critical door plug bolts in place. And so the really big bombshells here, you mentioned the training, you mentioned speed above quality, which is significant because this was a quality control issue at the heart of this door plug blow out. But then something is really damning here is about the tools. And one of the workers told the FAA in this audit that he was using a tool that he made himself to measure the gaps in the fuselage on the 737 line there in Renton. And this is the quote from the audit. \"The tool is mechanic made, unauthorized, uncalibrated, unmarked.\" And when that mechanic was asked how other door mechanics take the same measurement, he said, they do it all the time.

My colleague, Nathaniel Meyersohn in work has found out the opposite is true. Nathaniel, you found out the kiosks show actually free up workers to work in other parts of the restaurant, delivering orders at the pickup counter, cleaning, and improving the availability, and working in the kitchen.

And the main problem with self-checkout has been all the theft. It's much easier to steal with self-checkout and all of the issues, the mis-scans.
