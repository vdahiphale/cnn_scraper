It's a major decision that's certain to further delay his federal election subversion trial. Tonight, we're breaking down the massive impact of the high court's announcement.Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to the breaking news, a pivotal moment in the special counsel's election subversion case against Donald Trump, the U.S. Supreme Court announcing it will hear arguments on Trump's claims of immunity. CNN's team of journalists is covering this truly historic moment from every angle. First, I want to bring in CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid. Paula, how is the Supreme Court taking this up?",

      "sentences": "Well, tonight, Wolf, it is unclear if former President Trump will face federal prosecution before the November election, because, tonight, the Supreme Court announced that it will hear all arguments in late April on Trump's appeal, where he argues that he has presidential immunity that should shield him from the federal election subversion case.Now, this is the second time that the Supreme Court has rejected pleas from Special Counsel Jack Smith to step in and resolve this issue quickly so that he could move on with his case. Months ago, Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on this issue of immunity, not to let it go through the appeals process and drag out. They declined. The issue went to the court of appeals, which issued a skating and unanimous opinion rejecting Trump's claims of absolute presidential immunity. Now, of course, Trump's team appealed to the Supreme Court, and it took them two weeks to announce the fact that they will hear arguments in this case. His arguments are scheduled, though, not until another two months from now, which means we expect an opinion, possibly in late June. And then we need probably two months, the judges who said this, overseeing the case before they could begin that trial. So, Wolf, that makes it unlikely, though not impossible, that the January 6th federal election subversion trial could go before November. And as we know, the Trump team's strategy all along has been delay, delay, delay.",

And we expect to get some guidance on that on Friday. But there is a concern that that could get pushed back multiple times, which, again, it's unclear at this point if former President Trump will be tried on either one of these cases, but we'll be watching very closely on Friday to see what Judge Aileen Cannon does with that case. As of now, the only criminal case that we are confident is going to go this year before former President Trump is the so-called New York hush money case, the case related to hush money payments that he paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels and the lead up to the 2016 election, that case brought by the Manhattan district attorney.

I want to bring in our legal experts for some serious analysis right now.Joan Biskupic, you're our senior Supreme Court analyst, two questions. Why did it take the justices so long to decide to hear these important arguments about presidential immunity? And when do you see a ruling coming from the U.S. Supreme Court? JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: Okay. I'll give you a brief answer to the second first and then a longer answer to the first. I think by the end of June, we should probably see an answer. But the question -- it's not surprising that the justices agreed to take this up. I thought they'd want to have the last word on it because it's such a big question of presidential immunity. The D.C. Circuit opinion was very sound. There were some arguments for just leaving it in place. And the fact that it took them about two weeks to even decide what to do suggests that there was some dissension behind the scenes, that there was enough people there, a number of justices who thought, let's not engage on this, because they've put it on an expedited schedule to hear it the week of April 22nd. But every day counts when you're talking about briefing. If the justices were going to do that from the start, they should have done it two weeks ago when they had all the filings. And as I said, it suggests that there was some trouble there. But the bottom line then, Wolf, is no wonder Donald Trump is saying, thank you, Supreme Court, because this actually makes the Supreme Court a bit of a partner in his effort to delay things. Why do I say the end of June then for a final ruling? Cases that the justices will be hearing off the Donald Trump topic, that they'll be hearing that at the end of April, will all be resolved by the end of June because that's when the session ends for the 2023, 2024 session. Now, it could go longer. They could actually decide this even sooner. But I think what we have now is a situation where obviously we're not going to see the start of any trial on these election subversion charges in early March. But I think at this rate, we won't see a trial in summer, and we might not see it before the end of 2024.",

We had always thought it would consider treating President Trump's application as an appeal.I think Joan is right. The surprise is only that it took the better part of two weeks for the court to get to this result. And, Wolf, what that suggests is that there was an effort over the last two weeks within the court to find some kind of conclusive resolution that didn't require the court to give it the full process. Maybe there were four votes for that resolution, but there weren't five or six. And so I think the real tea leaf here is that there are a couple of justices in the middle, maybe a Justice Brett Kavanaugh, maybe a Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who might not be sympathetic to former President Trump's immunity claim, but wanted the full court to have the opportunity to receive briefing an argument. And, Wolf, just really quickly on the time and point, you know, yes, this is not as fast as a lot of people would want. This is about two weeks slower on the briefing schedule than what we saw in the Colorado disqualification case. At least by historical standards, this is still pretty fast for the U.S. Supreme Court. That's not going to satisfy those who are worried about the delay. This is going to bake in now to the general (ph) prosecution. That's a fair reaction. But if we look at the court historically, this is still the court moving much faster than President Trump had asked it to you, and then it at least theoretically could have.",

Because if former President Trump is re-elected and he hasn't been tried in either one of these federal cases, he can make them go away.

And I think it's very possible that we're going to look back and say, you know, that wasn't adequately accounted for. Wolf, it's worth reminding folks, though, that we wouldn't be in this position either in the Trump Colorado disqualification case or with all of this hanging in the balance on the January 6th prosecution if nine more senators had voted to convict President Trump and disqualify him from office in his second impeachment trial in January 2021. So, you know, I think it's unfortunate that we are at this point where we're pushed up against these clocks. I think it's worth remembering that we've got here not just because the Department of Justice, at least two outside observers, moved a little more slowly than we might have wanted, but because the more conventional procedure that the Constitution contemplates for removing a president, for disqualifying him from holding future office for this kind of conduct, was not followed for what we're in the moment, deeply political reasons.

Katelyn Polantz, thank you for that update.For more on the breaking news right now, I want to bring in Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. So, what's -- first of all, what's your reaction to this decision from the U.S. Supreme Court to even take this case and hear these arguments about presidential immunity? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): It's really hard to understand the decision, Wolf, except that it is likely some of the justices simply want to assist Donald Trump in delaying the resolution of this case in the hope of pushing his trial off past the election. If that were to happen, then of course Donald Trump would try to, if successful in the election, make the whole case go away. And I say that as a very likely motivation for some of these justices because there's no reason to take this case. The legal and constitutional issues are not difficult. If a president was immunized in trying to overturn a presidential election, that would mean that any subsequent president could call out the military, could seize ballot boxes, and if they were ever prosecuted for it, they would be held immune. That would be the end of our constitutional system. The ultimate check on a president's power is the ability to vote them out of office. You take away voters' ability to do that by saying you're immune from essentially trying to overturn the election and its chaos. So first, the Supreme Court says to the special counsel, we're going to make you go to the Court of Appeals, even though you've asked us to decide this in an expedited basis. And then they do go to the Court of Appeals. They get a very sound judgment, unanimous three-judge opinion, very well-reasoned, and they say, okay, having sent you the Court of Appeals, now we're going to take up the case anyway, hard to conclude, it's not for the purposes of delay.",

The extension of that argument is you could murder the Senate majority leader, prevent an impeachment trial going forward, and, therefore, protect a president or former president from any kind of criminal liability.That's absurd. I think they know they're going to lose this case, but as we have seen from Trump lawyers, in case after case after case, long preceding his presidency, but during his presidency, now after his presidency, the goal is to deny justice by delaying justice, and they may just succeed. If the oral arguments are in April and a decision doesn't come out until May or June, and Judge Chutkan at the district court says they're going to have three months after that to prepare, then you're right in the fall up against the election. That bumps up against the Department of Justice policy of not normally taking legal action in close proximity to an election. I think the issue here is the proximity to the election is because of the defendant's own conduct, his effort to delay the proceedings. In that case, I would hope that the trial goes forward whenever it gets sent back to Judge Chutkan.",

But, you know, what time is it in London right now? Because Americans until June or whatever this decision comes on will actually have a king.What do I mean by that? Well, if you don't know whether the president, the United States has absolute immunity, guess what? You don't know whether your system of checks and balances will actually work. Remember what they argued before the circuit court of appeals, Wolf, they talked about the possibility of only having liability or prosecution exposure if you were first impeached and convicted. That means that unless you have that particular formula, which we know as checks and balances and a political discussion, then you have no real check on the president of the United States. The court of appeals launched hyperbolic, you know, discussions to them and scenarios and they were met with absurd results and answers. That tells me that right now, by Super Tuesday, we don't know whether a president of United States or former president United States is going to have absolute immunity. For those who think this is just an issue about Donald Trump, I would behoove you to know that, that also means that any behavior right now that President Biden is being accused of engaging in, unless they're able with an impeachment inquiry, for example, to have an impeachment and conviction, that would mean that anything he is doing right now is fair game as well under this particular peculiar theory of having carte blanche for president of the United States. So the stakes are very high. I'm really surprised at the Supreme Court, given that 50-plus page opinion from the lower court, very thorough, very fulsome, but I suspect well have the same conclusion reached in the end, would want to have their own bite at the apple as opposed to allowing that lower court ruling to stand, which would be the result if they did not take up the case.",

We also know that he's been taking Eliquis, which is a kind of blood thinner. It also goes into describing his stiffened gait. It recommends that he continued physical therapy and do more stretching.
