Hundreds of missiles and drones fired directly at Israel from inside Iran, an escalation without precedent in their long-running proxy war. Right now, the Israeli war cabinet appears to be divided over what comes next.A meeting on Monday, the second time in as many days, ended without any announcement. According to an Israeli official, both diplomatic and military options are on the table. At the same time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is urging the world to stand united against what he calls Iranian aggression, which he said was a threat to Israel, the entire Middle East, as well as world peace. In Tehran, a senior military adviser has warned there will be no restraint if any enemy crosses so-called red lines. The weekend drone and missile strike, according to Iran, was necessary and proportionate, an act of self-defence. Part of the difficult calculation for Israel in its response to that attack is the risk of further escalation by Iran. Still, the head of Israel's military warns it's not a matter of if, but when.

But I don't think that they achieved their goal of massive casualties. I do, however, think they've created a new normal. I mean, they've now fired these missiles and drones from Iranian territory. This is a direct attack against Israel.It's the first time in the 4 years that they've been attacking Israel that they didn't go through proxies, didn't go indirect, but went direct. And I think they want to create a new normal. They actually said it explicitly. The regime said, we will now attack Israel directly from Iranian soil with the full might of the Iranian regime.

It's never been anything like it.KARA SCANNELL, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Donald Trump speaking out on a day that saw 96 potential jurors pass through magnetometers to enter the courtroom with Trump. They were sworn in and questioning began. A few minutes later, at least 50 prospective jurors were excused because they told the judge they could not be fair and impartial. Of those who remained, three questioned by the judge listed the New York Times and CNN as their sources of news. None said they had read any books by Michael Cohen or Trump, and none of them said they worked or volunteered for any pro-Trump or anti-Trump groups. Just nine members of today's jury pool were questioned and not dismissed by the time court adjourned. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg says the former president attempted to cover up payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election, trying to stop her from speaking out about the alleged affair with Trump. Judge Juan Marchand started the day by denying a motion from Trump's lawyers to recuse himself. As attorneys debated, Judge Juan Marchand said he would not allow the infamous Access Hollywood tape to be shown or video of Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit that found him liable for defamation. Karen McDougal, a model who says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet about it, will be allowed to testify. Attorneys also argued about how much the jury can be told about Michael Cohen's crimes. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I did it at the direction of, in concert with, and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. SCANNELL (voice-over): The credibility of Trump's former fixer, who admitted he orchestrated the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, will be one of the most fought over elements of the case. Trump, for his part, entered very few words into the court record. He could sometimes be seen leaning back in his chair with his arms folded, and his eyes appeared to be closed for several minutes. When he was introduced as the defendant, Trump turned around and gave the potential jurors a tight-lipped smirk. Once jury selection began, Trump was active, at times conferring with his lawyer and holding the questionnaire up to read as the judge questioned jurors. Prosecutors also asked the judge to fine Trump for social media posts attacking witnesses involved in the case, saying he violated a gag order. The judge scheduled a hearing for next week to settle that matter. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. It may be the only case against Trump to face a jury before the 2024 election.
