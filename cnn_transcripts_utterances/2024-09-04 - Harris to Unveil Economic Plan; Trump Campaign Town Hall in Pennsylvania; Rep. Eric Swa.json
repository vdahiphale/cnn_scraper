The new CNN polling comes out of six key battleground states listed right there for you. Harris with a narrow lead in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump has an edge in Arizona, Nevada, essentially tied, as well as the two battles grounds that the whole race could now hinge on, Pennsylvania and Georgia, you see right there.Pennsylvania is where the candidates will be facing off for the first time in the debate, now six days away, and 62 days to Election Day. Today, as I mentioned, they're hitting the campaign trail. Kamala Harris is heading to New Hampshire to roll out more of her economic agenda. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has much more on this and much, much more. What do you know about what we're going to hear from Kamala Harris and her economic agenda today, Jeff?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Kate, good morning.Vice President Harris is going to be in New Hampshire today, rolling out more pieces of her economic policy. Really this has been the central issue of concern for so many voters, what is their bottom line, what is the, you know, the price of food, inflation, et cetera. But today she is going to be focusing on small businesses and entrepreneurs. She's going to be doing, at least proposing, something pretty significant. She's proposing increasing the small business tax deduction. What that means is the cost of doing business, for starting a small business, from $5,000 to $50,000. That includes salaries, advertising, other costs of starting a small business. That is one piece of her proposal. She's also going to be talking about cutting red tape, the bureaucracy for starting a small business. The licensing requirements from state to state. She also is setting a goal of starting 25 million new small businesses during her first term in office. That would compare to about 19 million as of right now during the Biden-Harris administration. So, Kate, all of these proposals, of course, are just laying the groundwork for how she's trying to make the case to voters that she's concerned about the middle class and she's focusing on the economy. And as you can see from these poll numbers here in our new battleground polls this morning, the economy is a central concern and a bit of a soft spot for her in her battle with the former president there. You can see these numbers. State after state after state, voters are trusting Donald Trump more on the economy. It's one reason the Harris campaign is trying to fill in some more of these blanks here, what she would do for the economy. Of course, the word Bidenomics not mentioned in this plan, but that is one of the things that hangs over this election. People just wonder if the Biden-Harris administration did enough for the economy. So, we'll see her later today in New Hampshire, Kate.",

That's where Jeff Zeleny is.I wanted to give people a sense of what today's CNN polls mean in the race to 270 electoral votes. And for now let's keep that blue dot blue. We're also going to keep the red dot in Maine red to show you how each candidate would get to 270. So, in our new CNN polling, Kamala Harris has a small lead in Wisconsin and in Michigan. Donald Trump has a small lead in Arizona. Where does that leave things for Harris? Simply put, (INAUDIBLE) on that map is Pennsylvania just (INAUDIBLE) Omaha would (INAUDIBLE) do right there - if Omaha would do right there, if you did not win the blue dot, if you did not win the blue dot then it goes down to 269, and that is not enough. The reason I didn't change it before is because it's a real pain in the neck to get the blue dot on the map there. OK, so Pennsylvania gets her to 270. If she does not win Pennsylvania, how can she get to 270? She would - you know what? We have to make Alaska red here also. She would need to get two of the remaining three states here, Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina. Either of those, if she wins Georgia and Nevada, that gets her over the top. You could also replace out North Carolina for Georgia, and that would get her enough electoral votes. All right, for Donald Trump, how can Donald Trump get there from where he is based on the polling? Well, if he wins Pennsylvania, it's still not quite enough. He still needs more. He needs these states that are left here. North Carolina, he won that last time. If he wins North Carolina and Nevada, he's there, right? But if he doesn't win Nevada, Nevada goes to Kamala Harris, he wins Georgia instead, you can see, he's also there. This is why right now inside Trump circles you're hearing a lot about a Pennsylvania and Georgia strategy. Kate. Oh, Sara.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:20:38] BOLDUAN: And breaking news overnight, Ukraine's foreign minister submitted his resignation ahead of an expected major reshuffling of President Zelenskyy's cabinet. The foreign minister is the latest high profile member of the cabinet to say he's stepping aside. And this is happening at a critical moment. Russia launched a new missile attack overnight on the western city of Lviv. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv with much more on this one. What are you hearing about this shuffling, Fred?",

It's actually something that we had been expecting, that the Ukrainian sort of had been telegraphing over the past couple of days, that more than 50 percent of the cabinet would be replaced or reshuffled. But certainly the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, is the most prominent name of those who have actually tendered their resignation. In total, though, it's another three ministers, two deputy prime ministers, and the head of Ukraine's property fund.Now, one of the things about all this, Kate, is that all these resignations still need to be accepted by Ukraine's parliament. Some of that was debated today. They've not yet debated about the foreign minister resigning. However, there were, for instance, one deputy prime minister and the head of the property fund where the parliament did not accept their resignation, and so they will remain in power for now. But you are absolutely right, this does come at a critical time for the Ukrainians as not only, of course, they're facing that Russian onslaught, but they also want to move on and want to get more assistance from the United States. I want to listen in to what the president of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had to say about that shake-up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE (through translator): The autumn will be extremely important for Ukraine. And our state institutions must be set up so that Ukraine achieves all the results we need, all of us. To do this, we need to strengthen some areas of the government. And we have prepared personnel decisions. There will also be changes in the office. I'm also counting on a slightly different wait for certain areas of our foreign and domestic policy.
