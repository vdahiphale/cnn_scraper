People are really worried that any bank that shares the same kind of profile -- pardon me, shares the same kind of profile as First Republic, that means a large amount of those held to maturity bonds that I discussed and a large amount of unsecured customer deposits could be vulnerable. And I think investors are really grappling with that.One thing I heard a ton of over the weekend, and I have been making calls, you know, over the past couple of days furiously, expect more consolidation in the banking industry, particularly among these regional banks, which I just don't think people understood quite how vulnerable they are. And I think you're going to see a lot of banks kind of race to find a partner and bulk up and just have a little bit more padding, that they hadn't really realized put them on a point of risk that they're now in.",

Because on the one hand, the lesson we learned the last time around is, you don't want to have too big to fail. On the other hand, now we're realizing, can you be too small to not fail? You know, that was the challenge with this. And so the question - you know, Elizabeth -- Senator Elizabeth Warren has been really opposed - or not opposed, she has put a tough eye on bank mergers, which there have been a lot of. But the question is, the Biden administration, which has, you know, really taken a hard line on consolidation, are they going to shift that right now when it comes to bank mergers because maybe the size of these banks simply aren't, you know, able to withstand this kind of pressure.And one more point on that, again, it's whose fault is what. Possibly if they had had the same regulations that were applied to the big bank or to the small banks, they would be better protected because they don't have the same liquidity requirements and I am sure in Capitol Hill we're going to start seeing that. President Biden alluded to that this morning in his speech. We're going to see a push for that. But there is going to be a big push to kind of restructure what it means to be a regional or smaller bank.",

The AG there says that the investigation and the search is ongoing. You can see there, there are dozens of vehicles, personnel, and drones that are being used to search for these women.Now, here's the latest timeline that we have. According to the Penitas, Texas, police chief, now this is in the Rio Grande Valley of south Texas, these three women crossed into Mexico on February 24th. According to various Mexican authorities, these women were going from China, Nuevo Leon, which is a state in Mexico, and they were going to Montemorelos, Nuevo Leon, another town in the state of Nuevo Leon, and that's when they disappeared. And that they were driving a 1996 Chevrolet Silverado, and that the color of that truck was green. Now, according to Mexican authorities, their families reported them missing on the 25th. They have been seen ever since. But that these search efforts are ongoing. Now, authorities there also say that the FBI is not participating in an official capacity. They say that they believe this is because these three women, while they are U.S. residents, they are not U.S. citizens. Now, Jim and Erica, you mentioned the tourists that were kidnapped in Mexico. And the reason why I mention this, too, is because these three women would have had to travel through the state of Tamaulipas, where the tourists were kidnapped, to get to the state of Nuevo Leon. Now, the state of Nuevo Leon, according to the Department of State, is not considered a do not travel state like the state of Tamaulipas is, but it's still considered extremely dangerous because of crime and kidnapping.

These seven teams, they are - they are good picks to win the national championship in your bracket. These four right here, they could get there by the end of the tournament, so they're not bad picks either. Now, you might notice the teams - a couple teams you don't see that are favorites. They're not on here. Gonzaga and Arizona. That's because Gonzaga and Kenpom, it's in the 70s in defense. Arizona's in the 40s. So, according to Kenpom, those two teams can't win.
