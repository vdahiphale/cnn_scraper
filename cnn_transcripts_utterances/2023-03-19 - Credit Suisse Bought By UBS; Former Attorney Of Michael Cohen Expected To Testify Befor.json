Switzerland's largest banking group UBS just agreed to buy its rival, Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue bid. The purchase is aimed at halting investor panic brought on by two sudden U.S. bank failures this month.The deal comes after shares of the ailing bank lost 25 percent over the last week. Even an emergency loan from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the fallout. CNN reporter Anna Stewart will join us in just a moment, and CNN global economic analyst, Rana Foroohar joins us now. All right, Rana, can you explain to us this deal?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, absolutely. So, a little bit of context. Credit Suisse has been a troubled bank for some time. So, this, you know, this is a bank that over the last couple of years has had any number of crises. It's been considered weak in the marketplace. Even late last year, it was having its own problems totally separate from the Silicon Valley Bank issue with depositors withdrawing funds.So, it was perceived by the marketplace as being weak. So, Silicon Valley Bank happens suddenly, the entire system is really looking for who are the weak players. And Credit Suisse is certainly perceived as being one of them. Its share prices fall, and then you get the guarantee from the government and ultimately a deal from UBS to buy it, essentially on the cheap. You know, and it's interesting to me because UBS is the biggest and strongest, and certainly now by some margin, strongest Swiss bank. And it seems at this moment that in some ways, but not a too big to fail crises, you know, we have more of a crisis with the second and third- tier banks, and the bigger banks are coming in and either guaranteeing or snapping up on the cheap. So, it's a different scenario than we saw in 2008.",

What are the next steps?ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (via telephone): Well, it's really interesting, just looking through some of the detail we're getting, and there's been a huge press conference with the Swiss government and the various players like the central banks and the regulator. UBS is essentially paying 3 billion Swiss Francs here. That's $3.25 billion. It's actually 60 percent less than the bank was worth. So, as Rana was saying there, UBS is getting Credit Suisse at a snip here. It also, from the press conference, very clear that everyone is very keen to say this is not a bailout. This is a takeover. However, the Swiss National Bank, the central bank of Switzerland is going to provide a loan of up to $100 billion Swiss Francs, that's over $100 billion to UBS and Credit Suisse to boost liquidity. And the federal government says they will give UBS a guarantee in the amount of some $9.7 billion for potential losses. There is definitely some money going in there. And also, I think, a really important part of the deal we're seeing here is what's happening to some commercial bonds in Credit Suisse. The so-called 81 bonds. Now, we can get sort of more into what those mean, but essentially, about $17 billion worth of bonds are being written off. So, you have to question how are investors in Europe, investors in banking stocks and banking bonds going to feel tomorrow morning, given this one type of asset has essentially been written off, is worth absolutely nothing. And so going ahead into tomorrow, when we see the market open, that's what we'll be looking for. What is the effect? Is there any contagion effect? Do investors feel reassured? Or are we going to see another week of a sell-off.",

But that was the first case, that case has been going on for a while. Now, she filed a new case, because that case is, frankly, not so strong. And the case is under the Adult Survivor's Act, which is a one-year statutory time for anybody to bring any rape case against anybody in the state of New York for a year. It's a very frightening statute that was passed by Hochul. But we asked for it to be consolidated because the idea, first of all, that we would have two separate trials, one on a case that we're probably going to win, is surprising. Secondly, it just doesn't make sense. It's from the same root of a complete lie that we have to now defend and will vindicate my client for.

It's a very big step, and there are many other investigations that are taking place, organizations, international organizations and others that are collecting information and data, realtime data, in Ukraine, about violations of humanitarian law and actual war crimes.So, this is just one of many investigations. And at this point, perhaps, you know, Vladimir Putin is certain to stick close to where he feels that he won't be arrested. But it is, I think, just the beginning of collecting all of that information, that could lead to some people ultimately being arrested and charged for these crimes.",

So, hypothetically, what kind of international reverberations would there be if Putin were apprehended, or do you think he might just request to maybe attend remotely? DOUGHERTYfascinating moment to watch. Because it would create very problems for South Africa. You know, do they follow their own law in respecting the ICC or do they not? And also, for Putin himself, I think that's a way in the future. And who knows whether Putin will actually do that. The Kremlin is very careful, I think, at this point, they're probably trying to evaluate precisely what this might mean for the schedule. And remember, President Putin hasn't gone a lot of places. Yes, he went to Crimea, which they control and he went on this very quick trip to Mariupol. But he does not do a lot of traveling, international traveling. Some of it because of COVID. Now, he's getting back to a little bit more, but this will create definite complications for the Kremlin.",

The Israeli military says the man was shot while he and his wife drove through the town of Huwara.The area become a flash point recently. Two Israeli brothers were killed there last month, also while driving, an incident that triggered reprisal attacks by Israelis, all this as Israelis and Palestinians meet in Egypt to discuss way to say ease tension.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, we're learning that earlier today, this man and his wife were driving through Huwara and the reason that they were doing so is that one of the main roadways through the occupied West Bank that both settlers and Palestinians use crosses through this town of Huwara. And that's why it's become a flash point.What we know is that at some point they came under attack. A gunman began shooting at their vehicle. If you look at the images of the vehicle, you just see the windshield absolutely riddled with bullet holes. Now, the Israeli military says that actually the driver, the husband managed to shoot back at the attackers. They say the attacker was then injured before fleeing. He was later apprehended by Israeli soldiers. Miraculously, despite the number of bullet holes you see in that windshield, the man actually is now in a rather stable condition. The hospital saying that it's amazing the condition that he is in. But as you noted, Huwara has been a flash point for some time a few weeks ago. There were two Israeli brothers who were shot and killed and actually, a rather similar attack, while they were driving along that main road and attackers shooting and killing these two Israeli brothers. A few hours later, we had those Israeli settlers initially rampage revenge attacks. Dozens of homes and cars were burned and one Palestinian man killed in the ensuing chaos. So there has been a lot of tension already in Huwara. Now, actually, settlers have said that they wanted to demonstrate again tonight. So, there's a lot of concern that we'll see sort of a repeat of those settler rampages. But so far, it doesn't seem -- it does seem as though things are calm. It seems as though the Israeli military has a lot more control of the situation than last time. This all coming while Israelis, Palestinians, Egyptians, Jordanians, Americans are all -- they just met in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt to try and calm the situation, especially ahead of Ramadan, which starts later this week. All eyes will be here on Jerusalem on the holiest sites here in Jerusalem. Ramadan is expected to really raise the tension quite a bit.",
