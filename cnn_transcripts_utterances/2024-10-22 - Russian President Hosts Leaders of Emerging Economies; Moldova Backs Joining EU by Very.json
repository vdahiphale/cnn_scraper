The summit of major emerging economies is a very public way for President Vladimir Putin to prove that Russia still has global allies despite Western attempts to isolate it.Other prominent heads of state expected to attend are China's President Xi Jinping, as well as the Turkish, Iranian and Egyptian presidents.

In fact, in the last few minutes, we've now been receiving reporting from Chinese state media that Xi Jinping has indeed arrived in Kazan in Russia.And as we await for some of the substance of this meeting, there is certainly a lot of symbolism for Xi Jinping and for Vladimir Putin as well. But there's certainly this way, this method, this notion that Xi Jinping can promote this idea that not everyone in the world sees eye to eye with the United States, with NATO and with the West, as evidenced by the long list of attendees at this summit. It's a way for Xi Jinping to really promote this idea that there is an alternative worldview to the West and that there are people supporting him. In fact, as we've reported, it is widely seen that Xi Jinping has really helped promote this idea of expanding the membership BRICS. In fact, in recent months, we have seen the addition of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Ethiopia to the roster. In addition, other nations have been invited to participate as well, kind of on the periphery of all of this. Among the big points that we are watching, particularly from the China side of things, is this plan, this potential plan from Brazil and China to try to promote a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. It's a six-point peace proposal that was unveiled last week -- or last month, I should say, at the United Nations. It was not warmly received by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but that is something that we may see. China has long tried to portray itself, at least, as this objective party in this war in Ukraine. And of course, too, we'll be anxious to see if there are any kind of face-to-face meetings between any of these heads of state that could include a possible meeting between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, a bilateral meeting. We have seen these two men meet frequently in recent months. Perhaps this backdrop in Russia will serve as another chance for Russia and China to have further conversations -- Max.",

And I think, look, in terms of deliverables, the optics are really important. This is Russia, you know, hosting the summit. Last year he had to participate virtually because it was in South Africa, which is a signatory to the Rome Statute. Of course, we have the ICC arrest warrant out for Vladimir Putin.But he'll be the host. We see the leaders arriving on their planes. We're going to see a family photo. It really runs counter to Western efforts to isolate him. So I think it's worth emphasizing that. In terms of deliverables, the BRICS don't always agree on everything. But one thing they seem to be coalescing around is this desire to erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar. So I think we're going to see some discussions of new different payment systems. Russia is pitching one called BRICS Pay, which could be an alternative to SWIFT, which, of course, many of its banks have been disconnected to because of Western -- disconnected from because of Western sanctions. Take a listen to how Putin pitched that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We never refused the dollar as a universal currency. We were blocked from using it. Now 95 percent of all external trade of Russia, it is carried out with our partners and national currencies. They did all this with their own hands. They thought everything would collapse, but no, nothing collapsed. It's developing on a new basis. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A little bit complicated, but this is how they've engineered it so that the Russian money isn't just sitting there earning interest while Ukraine is essentially running out of resources to fund its economy.So we don't know -- we haven't got all of the loan in place yet, but this is the BRICS contribution. It'll be almost $3 billion, and it will be able to be used by Ukraine however they want. So obviously very much welcome going into winter when they have about a third of their energy producing, their electricity producing infrastructure still working. On top of that, of course, we got the U.S. aid package as well announced during Lloyd Austin's visit yesterday, $400 million for weapons. And they expect, President Zelenskyy said, another $800 million to be funneled into Ukraine's own drone program. So we're seeing these commitments coming through from the West. But of course, for Ukraine, the elephant in the room right now is the U.S. election and what that means for the future of aid.",

So initially, the campaign was all about that, saying to women, be breast aware, be aware of this thing called breast cancer. It's not something to be whispered about. It's something to run to your doctor about. And I think that happens more.

I'm a good kid. Why wouldn't he want to be around for me?And then as I got older and older and kind of had my own family, I started to think the reason he wasn't there is the reason why I became so strong mentally. So loving to my mother and I am who I am today because he wasn't there. Because I use it as motivation. SCHOLES (voice-over): LeBron and his wife Savannah had Bronny when he was just 19 years old in his second NBA season. And when Bronny started becoming a star in high school at Sierra Canyon, LeBron and Bronny playing together became more than a dream. But a frightening summer day in 2023 nearly derailed it all.",

He would recover and after treatment was cleared to return to the court just over four months later. Bronny would go on to play for one season at USC and then he declared for the NBA draft where the Los Angeles Lakers would select him with the 55th pick in the second round. L. JAMES: I know I'm super happy for him. Our family's super proud of him. SCHOLES (voice-over): Very proud but LeBron says they will need to keep it professional on the court. L. JAMES: We cannot be running down the court. And he'd be like, dad. B. JAMES: It's probably going to be like Bron. Bron would be the easiest. L. JAMES: That'd be the easiest. SCHOLES (voice-over): LeBron and Bronny shared the court in the preseason, a moment that LeBron called surreal. And it's even more than that. LeBron and Bronny on the same court is the culmination of LeBron's legacy, symbolizing the merging of a generational talent with the joy and pride of being a dad. L. JAMES: For a father, I mean, it means everything. I mean, for someone who didn't have that, you know, growing up to be able to be able to have that influence on your kids and have the influence on your son. To be able to have moments with your son and then ultimately, you know, to be able to work with your son. I think that's one of the greatest things that a father could ever hope for or wish for. So it's pretty cool. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
