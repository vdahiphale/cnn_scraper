This is as close as he's probably gotten to complimenting Ron DeSantis, saying that he is MAGA-lite at least, but Trump says MAGA is almost all of the Republican Party and saying that candidates who kind of are in the vein of Nikki Haley can't win a general election. I mean, that's a primary argument made against Donald Trump himself.",

Because if she's able to -- I mean, if she's able to beat him in New Hampshire, that does show that it is a possible thing and could create a permission structure down the line if some people aren't exactly enthralled.Now, these are a lot of ifs. This is a lot of, you know, wish-casting for people who don't like Donald Trump and the Republican Party. But if he keeps spending money against her, if he keeps spending money, if he keeps talking about her, that's all you need to know. He wouldn't, he'd be completely ignoring her if he wasn't threatened. MIKE LEON, HOST, \"CAN WE PLEASE TALK\" PODCAST: She's right. I mean, listen, Don Manley told Derek Jeter this one time, run it out because you never know who's watching. And right now, what you guys were talking about before in terms of donors watching this, they're closely watching this to see where DeSantis finishes. You're talking about leaning the operation. I don't even know if that's feasible in terms of what he did in Iowa. He hasn't really focused on New Hampshire. I know he's going tomorrow for a town hall. He's kind of shifted his focus to South Carolina where he feels like he could win that state. Tonight is a pivotal night. We're going to wake up tomorrow morning, and either Ron DeSantis is still going to be in this race, we're going to get a surprise, or we're going to get chalk like we say in sports.",

You know, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis are usually juxtaposed between 6 percent and 5 percent in New Hampshire. Every vote may matter there. So, I think it has as much to do with New Hampshire as it does with Iowa, and what Donald Trump's saying about Vivek Ramaswamy on that.You know, look, I've talked to folks in the Trump campaign, and for months they've been talking about, we want to win by at least 12. And so, I know they're re-lowering expectations again today. Internally, their campaign team recognizes that the largest spread in history was actually Bob Dole in 1988, when he won by about 13 points. They figure if they can do that, they can claim history. But the challenge, of course, is this. He's not just running as an open primary field. He's running as a quasi-incumbent. And so, they're going to have a lot of answering to do if he doesn't hit 50 percent. But regardless, the spread is what it is. He's clearly the frontrunner going into not just tonight in Iowa, but likely even New Hampshire.",

Like he's not even looking at these candidates. So, he's focused on just hammering them tonight, winning New Hampshire by January 25th. Let's all rally behind me.If one of them wins tonight or in New Hampshire next week with Nikki Haley, it's going to be interesting to watch.

We've had candidates from around the cycle coming to different college campuses, speaking with voters, and really trying to court that key demographic that the Republican Party's been trying to court this past election. So, I know here in Des Moines and at Drake University, we've had students volunteering and working on campaigns and just simply going to caucus events throughout this whole time, whether that's at a local diner or the big rallies like we see with President Trump. So definitely a lot of energy here on the ground, despite the weather. And today I think we're at negative one degree and it feels like summer compared to the last couple of days.",

You know that he played a key part of turning Iowa red in 2016 and doubling down with him in 2020 with a lot of those 33 pivot counties that voted for Obama twice and then doubled down on Trump again in 2016 and 2020. But I think we also have a lot of students that are saying, hey, maybe there's an alternative like Ambassador Nikki Haley or Governor DeSantis or Vivek Ramaswamy. So definitely a key demographic that I'm going to be watching tonight.

Like we've covered here on CNN, the caucuses start at seven o'clock, but try and get there around 6:30. You know, make sure you have plenty of time with the roads and the walkways to make sure you get there safely and get inside to where it's warm. So definitely close to campuses.

But I think continuing President Trump and Governor DeSantis have had a huge ground game here in the state of Iowa. So, you know, whether that's knocking doors or, you know, the mailers, the text, or the huge events that they're inviting students to, that's played a big role.But I think Ambassador Haley has had a lot, you know, has been going to a lot of campuses and really appealing to a lot more of those moderate students that maybe stayed home in 2020 or voted Democrat in 2020, but are, you know, maybe thinking that, hey, I want to come back to the Republican Party if it was a person like Ambassador Haley. So, like I said, definitely a mixed bag, just like what we see in the polls.
