I'm Eleni Giokos, I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. Welcome to the show. And tonight, the US jobs market is returning to Earth after a post-pandemic boom. Overall, the economy added 187,000 jobs in August. That's a healthy numbers, slightly more than most economists expected, but it wasn't quite enough to keep up with the number of people entering or perhaps re-entering the workplace. As a result, the unemployment rate rose to 3.8 percent. President Joe Biden describing the trend as a good sign for the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This reflects a cooling labor market, but still a relatively strong labor market.

There are always revisions, but these ones were pretty substantial. Again, not so much to worry about. These are still relatively steady numbers. You know, we did see some declines in a couple of industries. Most of those examples were anticipated things like a major trucking industry went out of business. Hollywood -- or much of Hollywood is on strike, and so you saw employment decline there. There are other parts of the economy that actually, I think if you want to be worried, those are the things that would cause some worry, things like delinquency rates rising, for example. But generally speaking, I think the economy has held up relatively well. And the question is, you know, have we felt the full effect of, for example, the Federal Reserve's rate hikes? Is there more financial tightening that's kind of working its way through the system that might displace some workers? We don't know. But for now, the numbers look pretty decent.",

So if you look at the numbers, if you look at the fact that we've had this long run of job growth, longer than many people hadanticipated, it is primarily driven by two groups, one of whom is immigrants, and the other is women. And when I say immigrants, what I mean is, we had a huge drop off in the foreign born -- in basically the foreign born labor force in the United States, initially around the pandemic, because borders closed and lots of stringent immigration policies were put into place, much of that has normalized. And in fact, if you look at the number of foreign-born workers in the United States, today, it's about 10 percent above where it was pre- pandemic, whereas the native born labor force is relatively flat, and that's partly because native born Americans tend to be older, they're less likely to be working, they're aging, et cetera. Immigrants tend to be a little bit young -- skew younger and are more likely to be of working age. And as I said, the legal immigration system also has been somewhat repaired under Joe Biden. The other group that I think has been punching above its weight is women, that if you look at what is called prime working age women, which is people aged 25 to 54. So out of traditional college going years and before traditional retirement years, that's around a record high, both for labor force participation and the share who are actually in jobs, which is remarkable for a number of reasons, including that, as viewers may recall, a couple of years ago, there all of these fears that the so called she-session, would set working women back a generation. The disruptions in childcare et cetera were going to disrupt women's careers as well. And instead, they seem to be kicking butt, at least in terms of their ability to hang on to jobs and to contribute to their families.",

      "sentences": "Yes, great news on that front. Catherine Rampell, great to see you. Thank you so much.I want to turn your attention to this chart. Take a look. US labor force participation has increased over the past year, that could be a sign as President Biden suggested that more people see this as a strong market for job seekers. It could also be that more people in the US are financially stressed. Now Americans are saving less of their income. In June, the personal savings rate dipped to three-and-a-half percent, a fraction of what it was during the pandemic. Now, in addition, some COVID era relief programs expire this fall. So that's imminent. Mark Zandi is the chief economist at Moody's. He joins me now. So great to have you with us to unpack these numbers. Look, job growth clearly losing momentum, core inflation sitting at 4.2 percent, but is it enough right now to stop the Fed in its tracks? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Yes, I think so. You know, obviously, it is difficult to predict what the Fed is going to do, but my sense is that they have all the evidence they need to stop increasing rates, at least at this point in time. So you mentioned the job market, job growth is slowing. That's consistent with a pause in increasing interest rates. Inflation is still high, but it is moderating here nicely, quickly moving in the right direction. All the trend lines look good getting inflation back to the Federal Reserve's target. So another reason for the Fed to pause. And then of course, there's the problems -- ongoing stresses in the banking system, you know, things are have stabilized there. But there's still a lot of pressure given the interest rate hikes. So you add it all up, I think it strongly argues for the Fed to pause its interest rate hikes and I suspect that's what they will do.",

You know, as you point out, they have to raise rates high enough, fast enough,long enough to quell inflationary pressures, but not so high so fast so long that it undermines the economy, pushes us into a recession. So that's a tricky balance, and of course, you could go back six, twelve, eighteen months ago, a lot of economists thought that that would end us in recession, that they wouldn't be able to pull this off. But at this point, increasingly, it feels like that they will be able to do it. They're getting some benefit from the fading inflation resulting from the end of the pandemic and its impact on supply chains and labor markets, the impact of the Russian war on Ukraine on oil prices, that's all fading, so that's helping out. So, there is still a script to be written here and things could go wrong, but at this point, they feel -- the Fed feels like it's threading the needle just right.",

Adani accused Soros-funded interests of being behind the reporting from the OCCRP. Now the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, the OCCRP says it gets four percent of its funding from Soros' Open Society Foundation. It is also backed by the US State Department and British Foreign Office. The research was shared with \"The Guardian\" and \"The Financial Times,\" CNN has not reviewed the research directly.

In fact, they said that the founder of Adani was pulling off \"the largest con in corporate history,\" their quote, not mine. You can see what that did for the share price of this group over the year, it absolutely plummeted. You can see where the report came out and how the reaction was. Now this week, the OCCRP claims to have unearthed documents which they have shared with \"The Guardian\" and \"The FT\" that are files from multiple tax havens, bank records, and internal Adani group e-mails. So they're saying that the documents and the evidence within those backs up some of these allegations of stock market manipulation and fraud and just to use one of the examples that is in both \"The FT\" and \"The Guardian,\" they say that they have tracked down essentially some of the people behind the investment vehicles and offshore tax havens that were trading the Adani stock. Both outlets report on to specific gentleman who were close associates of the Adani family, and they say that they controlled at least 13 percent of the free float of three of the four Adani companies that were listed at the time. Essentially what this boils down to is this idea that the Adani family indirectly and unknown to anyone had far more control over the Adani stock price than would be allowed under Indian market regulations, under laws, and of course raises this big question about stock market manipulation.",

This recent barrage hitting an airport in the city of Pskov, some 400 miles from the Ukrainian border. Russian air defenses spread thinly, unleashes firepower but faced with a major upsurge in drone attacks, there were just too many targets to defend. Russian officials say at least four military cargo planes used to transport troops and equipment to the war zone with damaged. Footage of the burning aircrafts suggests destroyed a significant blow to Russian logistics. On Russian state TV controlled by the Kremlin, the drone strikes are barely mentioned. Instead, the focus is on Russia hitting Ukraine and targets being struck across the frontlines by Russian forces, but the Kremlin can't hide what's happening.

We're probably down to the biggest gusts I can find, somewhere around 100 to 120 kph and the storm has lost an awful, awful lot of intensity here, because it's actually interacted with the landfall. And the landfall is what caused it to be less powerful, and that's certainly unfortunate. But the next storm is on the heels of it, not going to land in the same place, but it is certainly going to be a significant storm for Taiwan. So here it is, 215 kph. I'm sure it is much less than that right now, but the hurricane, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center will update that number in about one hour, so we'll have an update as soon as that comes in. There you go though, the storm has obviously lost, the eye intensity lost an awful lot of wind, but it is still raining in some spots. Look at these wind gusts, 181 was the official highest gust. Here is the radar where Hong Kong, way back here, we have now moved this well off toward the west, but the winds have shifted onshore. And so now all of a sudden, you could still see that coastal flooding, the erosion and water pushed onto land. It is going to be a 75 kph storm in about 72 hours just because it's interacting with drier air interacting with the land, and that's the reason why we're not going to see this getting any stronger. So here it is. This one will get stronger though. Take a look at what's here. That is Taiwan. This is going to be a wind event, 160, I think probably will be the highest gust. But we have mountains here. This is a very topographical place and there's going to be significant rainfall and I'm talking about 500 millimeters in white. But notice how large the white area is, how much rainfall is white, which is 500 or more that is going to have to run off. That's 18 inches of rainfall that is going to come down in the next 48 hours or so. And that's going to run downhill cause mudslides, landslides, and all the like. Most of it will be on the spine of the mountains here on the east side.

That's clear, you know, but don't be surprised that Paris is not more accessible. That it's not the best of the best because there's still so much work to be done.",

The platform updated its policy so it could use such info whichtypically includes things like fingerprints and facial scans. It says it's doing so to verify identities and increase user security. [15:405:03] The new policy notes that people have to consent to have this data collected. X also wants to know your employment history. The platform says it will use that info to recommend jobs and help employers find candidates. Interesting. Clare Duffy is with me to explain a little bit more. I know that, you know, X or Twitter has the sort of end game to become a mega app. But the question I have is how are they going to collect my biometric data? They would basically have to work with things like Apple and other devices, essentially.",

And it will use the biometric data from those things to help pair accounts to real people. The company says that this will help prevent impersonation and in general, keep the site more secure. So as you said, this is something that users not only are going to have to opt into, but they're actually going to have to provide the company this information in order for it to use their biometric data. The company also says it plans to collect as you said educational history, employment history, and an effort to recommend job listings and to better target advertisements. And while again, this is all opt in for users for now. I think it does, you know. And I also should say that a lot of these things are things that other social platforms also collect. But I do think this gives us some interesting hints about Elon Musk's potential plans and possible features for this X everything app that she wants to create.",

It can point you to jobrecommendations, it's got these services and these features that it wants to provide to users. In exchange for this kind of information when it comes to biometric data. There have been a lot of concerns that there are lots of bots and scams on X on Twitter previously. And so, X is saying that this is going to help it keep the platform more secure and help reduce some of that inauthentic activity. But I do think this is a really good reminder for users just to be aware on all social platforms of the kinds of information that they're handing over to platforms, and how that data might be used.",

I also think it's sort of interesting timing here, X didn't come out and say this was related. But this disclosure comes after the Digital Services Act. The E.U.'s new law that applies to big tech companies went into effect last Friday. And one of the things that law requires is for big tech companies to increase transparency about the kinds of data that they're collecting from users. So, I think this could be in part sort of related to that. The company is trying to be transparent about what it plans to collect from users.",

According to AMC theaters, the most ever in a single day. Spider- Man: No Way Home held the previous record at $17 million. Taylor's -- Taylor Swift's movie pass that in just three hours. And deadline is reporting that including sales from Cinemark and Regal pre- sales numbers are above $37 million. These are big numbers. Anthony D'Alessandro is deadlines editor director and box office editor. He joins me now from Los Angeles. So great to have you with us. Forget about, you know, creating blockbuster movies. All we need is Taylor Swift. This isn't the work of an antihero. She is shaking things up. Take me through these numbers and whether, you know, we could have forecast this kind of incredible sales. ANTHONY D'ALESSANDRO, BOX OFFICE EDITOR, DEADLINE: Well, it's something I mean, what a wonderful tale. Here you have a situation at the Fall Box office. The actor strike is going on. Hollywood studios are moving. Movies off of the schedule like there's -- like this in day of film challengers, in June part two and all of a sudden, you have this movie circuit that's on the brink of bankruptcy, AMC. They surprise us. They make a deal with the Swift family for the Taylor Swift's New Eras concert film. They date it in the middle of October, October 13th. 13 is her lucky number. And, you know, we're thinking, you know, I'm talking to sources yesterday, we're wondering, you know, what is this -- what could this do? What could this possibly do? You know, other concert films recently, like even the Billy Eilish one live at O2, it's like single digits. It was nothing. They played for one night, they play for one weekend, pre sales on this explode. It was at 10 million yesterday, it grew to 37 million. You know, for all the circuits today. Now we're projecting the film is going to open to at least 70 million which is more than some of these other concert films from Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber that they do in their whole lifetime. It's just an amazing tale for the box office and just -- especially after Barbenheimer just reconfirms the whole communal experience of the box office and theatrical.",

So, they're going to the theater, but you can, you know, just be real with me. It's a safe space. D'ALESSANDRO: No, I know, I know. Well, I will say I'm not a Swifty but I have, you know, jumped on the spin cycle to take it off. The, you know, a couple of my co-workers were very lucky they got tickets immediately. But I've heard it's really hard to get them. And the other thing here is AMC set up a separate web portal to accommodate business on this. To take care of business. They're adding show times, you know, in response to the Taylor Swift concert film coming on the schedule, universal moved its reboot of Exorcist. If they were going -- it was going to open on the same date as Taylor Swift. They're now going earlier.",
