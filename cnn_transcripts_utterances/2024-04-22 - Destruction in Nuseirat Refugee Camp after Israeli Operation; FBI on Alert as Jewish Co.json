Opening statements are expected to begin Monday morning in New York City --COHEN (voice-over): -- in former President Donald Trump's hush-money criminal trial. This is, of course, the very first time in American history that a former president is standing trial for alleged crimes. This is all about a cover-up in 2016. Donald Trump paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, to prevent her from going public with allegations of an affair. He denies the affair. The alleged crime, the prosecutors' theory of this case, is all about the falsification of business records at the Trump Organization: how Trump Org paid back Michael Cohen, Trump's attorney at the time, paid him back for that hush-money payment. According to the prosecutors, the Trump Organization and Donald Trump, at the head, falsified business records, falsely suggesting that those were routine legal retainers and legal services, when really, it was a hush-money payment intended to prevent the voters from learning about Stormy Daniels' allegations. It's a novel legal theory that will be tested and under the microscope for perhaps the next six weeks. That's how long we're expecting things to go. So opening statements are Monday, and eventually, we will get into witness testimony. And there is a big cast of characters that are expected to swear to tell the truth in front of the jury. Michael Cohen himself, in many ways, is the star witness of this case. His credibility will be crucial. There's also Stormy Daniels. She is expected to tell her side of the story.

You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.Well, Monday marks Earth Day here in the United States, where for more than 50 years, activists and educators have worked together to drive positive action for the planet. Planet versus Plastics is this year's theme, with EarthDay.org pushing to raise awareness about the harm plastic does, both to humans and the environment. And they say recycling is not the always the answer. Instead, the group has set a bold goal for the planet: reducing plastic production by 60 percent by the year 2040. Some of the ways they think that can happen includes phasing out single-use plastics by 2030, advocating for the policies to combat the impact of fast fashion, or clothes that include fabrics made of plastics. Finally, the group calling for larger investments in technology to find alternatives to plastics. CNN's Eleni Giokos has more on companies trying to reduce the amount of plastic in landfills, but also trying to find alternatives to the material. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tons of plastic waste flow through the conveyor belts at Site Zero every hour. This high-tech plant in Sweden is one of the world's largest plastic sorting sites. Using infrared lights, lasers, camera tech, and even A.I., the fully automated plant operates more efficiently than smaller plants to divide plastic materials, sorting up to 12 types of plastics to be recycled, rather than the usual three or four. [00:30:08] MATTIAS PHILIPSSON, CEO, SWEDEN PLASTIC RECYCLING: Every time you see this infrared light looks like sunshine, that detects a plastic type. And when we identify the right type, it will blow this particular type in a certain direction. The rest continues to be sorted.

HENRI BOURGEOIS-COSTA, PLASTIC WASTE SPECIALIST (through translator): The challenge is to replace them and eliminate them. We shouldn't reverse the problem. The tool itself is interesting, but it is interesting if it serves a global approach for society to reduce, and then better sort and recycle what we have sorted. GIOKOS (voice-over): Seaweed is one possible alternative to plastic, according to the World Economic Forum. It says seaweed's becoming more popular and could be a game changer. Dissolvable seaweed packaging has been used in Europe. Five years ago, London marathon runners were given edible capsules called Ooho instead of bottled water. The concept didn't take off as fast as the company hoped. They've pivoted to add other products, like these dissolvable capsules that are a bit sturdier, to replace sauce packets. So whether its biodegradable packaging or zapping away to sort recycled materials, experts are revolutionizing the way we use plastic and working to reduce the carbon footprint. Eleni Giokos, CNN.

And it tells -- therefore, it tells again, a much more personal story of something that we don't -- there's something called compassion fatigue, that we just don't feel anymore.
