      "sentences": "Good evening.After a historic and whirlwind day involving the former president and efforts to overturn the 2020 election, he says and CNN confirms that the special counsel has informed him, he is a target of the federal investigation to those efforts. The target letter, as it is known, is the clearest sign to date that the former president could be indicted. It is also the first time in history a former president has received such a letter regarding efforts to overturn an election. Think about that. Plenty of presidents in the history of these United States who wanted to stay in power. None have been accused of taking the actions that this man did. We should point out it is not the first time a former president has received a target letter, it has happened once before, and the former president it happened to is also Donald Trump. He received that target letter almost two months ago exactly, May 19th, involving Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. That of course led to an indictment 20 days later. There was more news today on that investigation as well. There was a court hearing in Florida attended by an indicted aide to the former president, Walt Nauta, but not the former president himself. A federal judge said the decision on a trial date will come in her words \"promptly,\" meaning at any time. Judge Aileen Cannon who was appointed by the former president also suggested the trial may not be as speedy as the special counsel had hoped, but she also appeared skeptical pushing the trial until after the election is the former president's attorneys would like her to. There was also another big development today in Michigan, also, for the first time ever fake electors who signed documents claiming the former president won in 2020, have now been charged in the scheme to overturn the election. Eight felony counts covering 16 people including top current and former Republicans in that state. So there is a lot to get to in this hour, including how Republicans are defending the former president today. Plus, I'll talk with Republican presidential candidate, Will Hurd, ahead. But we start with the target letter. Many legal analysts say proving intent will be important in any possible future indictment. Did the former President know he lost the 2020 election, but still schemed to overturn its results? According to testimony during the House Select Committee hearings on January 6, he did know he lost. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to read a statement from a conservative former judge, Michael Luttig, who advise former Vice President Mike Pence on how to handle the January 6 election certification vote. He wrote saying today: \"There is not an attorney general or special counsel of either party who would not bring charges against the former president for his efforts on January 6 to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He has dared, taunted, provoked and goaded DOJ to prosecute him for his offenses on and relating to real January 6 for two-and-a-half years. The former president has left Jack Smith no choice, but to bring charges lest the former President make a mockery of the Constitution of the United States and the rule of law.\" Do you agree with him?",

I do think it's more likely to be quicker this time because we have seen a parade of people called by this grand jury, all the people around Donald Trump. There is really nothing left for the special counsel to do, but to actually indict the former president.So I'd be surprised if it were as long as a week or two. I wouldn't be shocked. But one way or another, it's going to happen. And it's going to make it very difficult for the former president to keep claiming that he is the victim of a witch hunt. As Judge Luttig said, he has made it impossible for any self- respecting special counsel or attorney general not to charge him. All of the people who were engaged as foot soldiers in the violent insurrection, they have been systematically charged for the person who called them to Washington, who watched while they became violent, who encouraged them to remain violent, who made it clear that his sights were on his former vice president, for that person to escape accountability would mean that we have one rule of law for ordinary citizens and another for a former president. That can't be what we have in a democracy. When he was president, the rule that he invoked was you can't charge me, I'm president. When he ceased being president, he said, you can't charge me, I used to be President. Well, that's not the way a democracy works. That's a Banana Republic.",

I mean, there is an elaborate memorandum, almost 300 pages by Norman Eisen and a group of others, experts, former prosecutors, laying out in great detail what the charges are likely to be. They are likely to focus on the fake electors, and the attempt to say that the election was stolen when the former president knew it wasn't.Then, they are likely to include a second act pressure on various people, including the former vice president. And finally, they're likely to include aiding and abetting an insurrection. And if the president were convicted of that, then he would be ineligible to run again. And he has got a claim, of course. He always claims he's the victim. He's going to claim that the only reason this is happening is that he is running for president. That's getting it backwards. The main reason he's running for president is that the only way he thinks he can stay out of jail, and he wants to be president so he can pardon himself, or maybe declare himself unfit for a while under the 25th amendment so that whoever he has as vice president can pardon him, just in case there's any legal doubt about the ability of a president to pardon himself. So this is a three-act play. We are likely to see it quite dramatically play out. And of course, in the meantime, we know that he is going to be charged by Fani Willis in Georgia, a sprawling indictment probably next month. We know that he is already on trial before a likely friendly judge, Judge Aileen Cannon for espionage in connection with the top secret documents that he stole when he left the White House and refuse to return. He is of course also being charged by Alvin Bragg, and at the same time, we have seen in Georgia that fake electors now in Michigan are themselves being charged. So the walls are closing in from every direction. And finally, it looks like he will be held accountable.",

You know, just a couple of things about target letters. I think people need to understand that it is -- the department is not required to serve a target letter on anyone before they get indicted. They do it in some cases, they've clearly done it here. It is a very clear indication that they are looking squarely at him, that they have substantial evidence against him and that they are likely to indict him. These things don't come out when the matter is still up for judgment in the prosecutor's office.

I do not expect to see an insurrection charge as Professor Tribe just said, that would be the single most dramatic charge that Jack Smith could bring, and he doesn't need to.

He was trying to overturn the fair election results. His team, in the meantime, has been calling around to other attorneys.

We've been asking this question since Trump first posted this this morning. So far, we have not heard of one other person who has gotten a target letter. That factor has surprised Trump's team.

I think that that's the difference between the legal perspective here and the political one. Donald Trump has a lot of reasons to be legally nervous tonight. But politically, he's never looked better.He still remains the kind of frontrunner in the short term for the Republican primary. We have seen Republican voters really rally around him. If there's a bad sign there, we also see a kind of fomenting group against him, even among Republicans. If you look at polling, he remains the kind of plurality support and the kind of 30s, 40s above other candidates, but you see an increasing number of people who say they don't want Donald Trump to be the nominee, even among the Republican base. So we look a little longer term, and we look to a kind of general election, right, the goal is still to win back the White House for Donald Trump. This is a bad thing for swing voters. This is a bad thing for Independents. Those kinds of signs have been very clear since the beginning for Donald Trump of being really worrisome on that front. But in the short term and the question about the Republican primary that kind of build up to Iowa, we have consistently seen the Republican electorate rally behind him and just fit within that kind of narrative of victimization, and the weaponization of the federal government against him. We know that's the card he's going to play, and to this point, that's been the card that's worked. COOPER: And we heard Speaker McCarthy echoing that was his go-to today, the weaponization that this is essentially Joe Biden, the president seeing Trump's poll numbers going up and so he pulled the levers of DOJ and weaponized the government against Trump.",

There is a mountain of evidence that contradicts that from his own attorneys in the White House, to his political people, to the private firms that he hired privately and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to go out and find evidence of fraud, all of whom came back to him and said, there's no evidence of fraud here. So it doesn't matter -- and then of course, you have the witnesses who heard him say, can you believe I lost to this guy? One of whom is there in the room with you right now. So there is an overwhelming amount of evidence for each one of the points that he has to prove here. I'm sure the special counsel is feeling very confident if they sent that letter out and we will see how this plays out. But I should also say, Anderson that with respect to the political analysis, you've just heard, I think that is something that stands in Jack Smith and his team's credit.

And when we look at the House, a lot of those people are coming from places that are gerrymandered map, safe seats. We've seen increasingly few swing districts in the House, and that gives them the kind of political backing, they would have to be all in for the base. That's a different kind of calculation in the Senate. I think that's why you hear kind of different things coming out of the Senate or just silence from them being willing to defend him in a bigger sense. But for those House people who I think are closely -- more closely tied to the political base of Donald Trump, the folks who are driving the kind of plurality of his support in the Republican primary, they know who butters their bread, and you see that in the statements, they're really reflecting the kind of Donald Trump fandom that is still at the core of the Republican Party, even though we should continually say it's not the majority, we're not seeing him crack a 50 percent ceiling, we're not seeing him grow the base of support. We are still seeing him be toxic to Independents and swing voters and folks for the general election, but in that short term and the kind of people who are most important for their individual districts, the kind of activist class that is who is really driving this. I think about the Michigan electors, you know, those were people who -- and Michigan was one of those states where you saw a kind of Trump- wing really rise in the state party there.

This was an actual actionable effort to undermine the will of the voters, one that we fought at the time successfully. And now we need to see justice for those who attempted it.

So all eyes were on the judge and looking to see just how receptive was she going to be to this Trump legal strategy to delay, delay, delay. And from what I saw in court today, she is definitely open to delaying this trial, at least until next year. She told prosecutors that their proposal of doing this in December is just too soon. She said that was, quote, a compressed timeline and that cases like this take a lot longer. Now, she's not necessarily leaving to -- willing to leave it completely open ended. She did tell defense attorneys that she at least needs to know from them. All right, how long is it going to take you to go through all this evidence and at least be able to propose your own trial date?

Prosecutors argue, look, he's no longer president. He should be treated as, quote, any other busy, important American. But his attorney said, no, he is a candidate. That does make this different. And in order to be fair, this has to be pushed until after the election. But, Anderson, the judge was not interested in this question at all. She said, look, we're not litigating that right now. Instead, she's really focused on the mechanics. How long is it going to take the lawyers to do the work they need to do to at least get some sort of trial date on the calendar?

She could keep December 11 and make it subject to delay when delay makes sense.

Look, all of these court cases are probably going to last longer than anybody expects, but the opportunity -- and there is opportunity to win.This is not -- everybody says, he's has a commanding lead. Look, anything is possible if you work hard. The numbers exist for him to be beat. There are more people that dislike Donald Trump in the Republican Party than like him. And so this is the opportunity. We have 26 weeks to pull this off. I hope some of your voters go to hurdforamerica.com, help me get $1 so I can meet those requirements to be on the debate stage, so that we can have a real competition of ideas. Because -- and you know this, we are faced with a number of generational defining challenges. And if all we're doing is litigating stuff in the past and dealing with Donald Trump's baggage, we're not going to be able to make sure that the rest of the century stays the American century.",
