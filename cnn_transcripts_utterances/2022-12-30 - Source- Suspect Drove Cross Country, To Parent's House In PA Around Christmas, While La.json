He didn't recall what had happened, in the motorcade. Essentially, he didn't remember things that way.And when it came to the events of January 6, the Committee said, \"You know, do you remember people trying to get Donald Trump to say something, to make some kind of public statement?\" And Tony Ornato compares it to the fog of war, saying, \"I'll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information, and it was usually late information or it wasn't accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very - a very chaotic day, so I don't recall those specific details.\" Ornato's attorneys previously told us, they felt like he was cooperative, with the Committee that he was honest with the Committee, but the Committee went out of their way, in their final report, to question Ornato's credibility, and his testimony, multiple times, Pam.",

He went from Idaho, to his parent's house, in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested, today, on four counts of murder, in the first degree, plus felony burglary. Kohberger is a 28-year-old graduate student. He attended Washington State University, near where the four victims attended college.

Chief Ramsey, I want to start with you. A source told me tonight, a law enforcement source that, at some point, during the suspect's cross country drive that law enforcement started tracking him. And they were able to really zero in on him, around Christmas, when he arrived, at his parent's house, in Pennsylvania. I'm told that law enforcement was also surveilling his parent's house. It was a combination of DNA evidence, and the car, that led to the suspect being identified. Tell us a little bit more about how a law enforcement operation, on this scale, comes together? CHARLES RAMSEY, FORMER POLICE CHIEF OF WASHINGTON, D.C., FORMER PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER, DISTINGUISHED VISITING FELLOW, DREXEL UNIVERSITY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, I'd tell you. It'll be interesting to find out exactly what it is they did, when they said that they tracked him, all the way from Idaho to Pennsylvania. Were they tracking his cell phone, if they had that? Were they using toll booths that he may have gone through, as he was traveling? Did they actually have an eyeball on him, where they actually had identified the car, and him, and actually tailed him, all that way? I don't know the answer to that. But it'll be interesting. Apparently, they began to kind of narrow things down, on him, a while back, but they didn't have enough to really name him as a suspect. So, it'll be interesting.

So, in terms of litigation, there's really no question that he was there. Now, how they caught him is another story. I say, follow the evidence. And the evidence is DNA. And the evidence is the vehicle. Now, there were lots of videos of that vehicle, not only near the house, where this - the event occurred. But the Police looked at other videos, and they may have gotten a glimpse of the license plate. And they may have tracked that vehicle, with plate readers, or at toll booths, and followed that vehicle, as it made its pathway, 2,500 miles, all the way to Pennsylvania. With respect to DNA, I think that was explained fairly well, that this is a matter of not CODIS. Because CODIS is a national database.

He sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, which released the returns. Congressman, you made the first motion, to acquire the former President's taxes, nearly five years ago. Does it surprise you that it took this long? REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): Well, it's really outrageous. He had so many accomplices, in the Congress, House Republicans, who refused to permit us, to take a look at these returns, even in private, years ago. Many years ago, there was another New York City Hotel mogul, who declared \"Taxes are for the little people.\" And I think that's kind of the Trump idea. He thinks it makes him smart that he pays less of his income, a lower rate, on his income, than the waiter, or the maid, or the maintenance person, who works in one of his hotels. And I think that's just outrageous. When he got to be President, he puts a couple of his buddies in charge of the Treasury Department, and the Internal Revenue Service. And they don't do the audit that was done on other presidents, until they get a letter, from the Ways and Means Committee. They wait a couple of years to do that.

This is a guy, who had a huge inheritance, from his family, and he's frittered away a lot of it, apparently, and is now claiming he's a great capitalist.

That's what - I think that's the larger picture what we see here.Did Ginni Thomas make a mistake? Yes, she made a mistake, by calling Mark Meadows, the Chief of Staff, in the midst of all of this. But I think, to go to David Urban's point, what was she calling about? Well, she was calling, she testified, because she called - because she thought there was fraud that had been committed, and had not yet been explored, and that it ought to be studied before conceding the election. That's not a totally unreasonable argument, you know? So, that's why, I think, yes, she made some mistakes.

They can't understand not paying taxes. But in that instance, look, this is the Tax Code. I think the Tax Code is terrible, and it is what it is. And Donald Trump is not sitting around his kitchen table, on his laptop, with TurboTax, doing his taxes by himself, right? He's got a cadre of lawyers, and accountants, and he's taking - he's availing himself of the net operating loss carry forward, which is in the Tax Code. If we want to change the Tax Code, let's change the Tax Code, and we'll have a debate about that. But the fact that Donald Trump availed himself of something that's in the Tax Code?
