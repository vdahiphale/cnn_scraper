Iran has executed a second protester related to the antigovernment demonstrations that are gripping the nation. The, man named as Majidreza Rahnavard was accused of killing two members of the security forces according to the government. He was publicly hanged in the religious City of Mashhad earlier this morning. It is a second known execution relating to this uprising. On Thursday, Mohsen Shekari was hanged. These protests have been going on for three months now ever since Mahsa Amini died in the custody of Iran's Morality Police. She had been apprehended for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. But even in the face of brutal punishments and possibly even a death sentence, the protests have continued. The regime vows to continue its crackdown. My first guest tonight says, executions are a tactic of repression from an outdated playbook. Hadi Ghaemi is the executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, and he's joining us now from New York where the center is based. Hadi Ghaemi, welcome to the program. Can we start by asking you just to lay out what you know, what the human rights community knows, about the two individuals who we know have been hanged? What about Rahnavard who was hanged today? They say it was public. Was it? HADI GHAEMI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NEW YORK-BASED CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN:  Hello, Christiane, and thank you for having me. They claim it was a public hanging, but from what we know, the only people present were security agents and people from the judiciary and security for, even the parents of him were not aware that he is being hanged and we're not there.

And then, it got incorporated to their judicial system to the point when they repeated it in 1988, committing crimes against humanity by executing over 5,000 political prisoners in a matter of three to four weeks. So, the idea of lynchings and killings in times of crisis is very much in the playbooks of this regime and the 1980s was the height of it.

I'm not calling for closure of embassies or cutting off diplomatic ties, but I'm calling for immediate removal of their ambassadors and protesting. And this has to be really taken up to the Security Council too, from several angles. One is the very extensive violence against women and girls being committed. We are starting to get a flood of reports about rape and sexual assault against women and girls inside the prisons. And that Iran is also engaged with Russia in killing civilians by selling drones and causing damage. So, there's a lot of reasons that this should be taken up by the Security Council immediately.",

I believe this is not a sustainable situation, I clearly say. That's why I believe that the establishment needs to bring major changes to satisfy the people. The official polls, Christiane, says -- even the representative of the supreme leader's publicly said 80 percent of people, they are not satisfied. They are unsatisfied with the economic and the current situation. That's why with such a high level of unsatisfaction, it cannot be sustainable.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I would not be negotiating with Iran on anything right now, including the nuclear agreement. I think that, frankly, the horse is out of the barn. When Trump pulled us out, we lost the eyes that we had on what they were doing inside Iran. And I believe that they started those centrifuges spinning again and I think it's unlikely that any agreement would be agreed to and I don't think we should look like we are seeking an agreement at a time when the people of Iran are standing up to their oppressors.

But I think it's something that we readers don't really know, how a book comes to be, how two people work together to make the best book possible. And this particular relationship, between my father and Robert Caro, has been going on for 50 years and they both describe it as very contentious.

So, as New Yorkers, we're living in a world created by Robert Moses, still to this day. His great visions for the city and also, the racism and classicism that is built into the infrastructure of our city, still, we are living in that. And similarly, with Lyndon Johnson, we -- what Lyndon Johnson did great things and did terrible things, and we are still living with the effects of the way he yielded -- wielded, his power. So, I think that Caro is trying to, really, help us in our democracy understand how power has been used and abused and how people who don't have power are affected by those decisions, by those men that he writes about.

It's like he realized, at last, they had a champion in Washington. You know, that story does not -- in the Lyndon Johnson story is so complicated because at the end, Martin Luther King is saying, Vietnam is destroying civil rights legislation and the war on poverty. So, the Lyndon Johnson story, we've been talking about one side of it today, it's a lot more complicated than that. But his moments when he fought for civil rights, when he picked up the heroism of these people in the south, and it's amazing to look at it. You know, that's -- 64 is the summer of Birmingham.

And I want to ask, as an E.R. doc, are you seeing the same thing on the ground or what are you seeing? DR. MAHSHID ABIR, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND SENIOR PHYSICIAN POLICY RESEARCHER AT THE RAND CORPORATION:  Yes, Hari, you're touching on a really critical issue that is not new for hospitals and health systems. Over the course of the years, even before the pandemic, we experienced various shortages, including in IV fluids and also, cancer medications. The reason why, currently, the issue is highlighted of the way it is and brought a lot of attention to is that it involves children, and some of the medications that are important for the care of children, including amoxicillin, which treats various infections and also, albuterol for the treatment of asthma. And this is happening all at the same time as having spikes in RSV infections and COVID and influenza. So, it's a particularly sensitive time to be experiencing these shortages.",

So, you know, starting with albuterol. So, as you all know, there is a spike in RSV cases, influenza and COVID, and both in children and adults. Albuterol is a medicine for asthma. And any asthmaticus who is infected with any of these viruses may experience an exacerbation of their asthma, and they will really need their albuterol. And if not treated appropriately, asthma can be life-threatening. So, that's one problem. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that's used for the treatment of bacterial infections in both children and adults. And particularly if, in addition to these viruses that are now going around, someone has a bacterial infection and needs amoxicillin, because it is so effective against so many types of bacterial infections, it can potentially cause issues as far as patient's inability, because it's relatively inexpensive. Patients may not be able to get a substitute antibiotic because they can't afford it or their insurance is not paying for it, or that the treatment of their, you know, bacterial infection may get delayed.",

DR. ABIR:  It's usually a function of two issues. So, either decreased supply or increased demand. So, I think that we're at a juncture right now where we are experiencing both. So, given the increase in respiratory illnesses, both in children and in adults, amoxicillin is being used particularly if there is a bacterial infection in addition to a viral infection like RSV and influenza. And also, if there's any kind of disruption in getting the medication to these hospitals and health systems. So, that last mile. And getting these medications to the pharmacy, that also will impact folks getting the medications they need.",

So, if there is an issue with the facility, if they have shortages in the components of what goes into the medication, for example, amoxicillin, or that if the actual company or the location where the medication is made, if there is issues of staffing or labor shortages or any other issues that slows down production at the site, then you can experience it as is a user or patient.",

I just want to quote a paragraph here. Over the past several decades, medical product supply chain disruptions and shortages have plagued the U.S. health care system, putting the lives of Americans that risk, costing medical facilities millions of dollars per year and threatening the clinical research enterprise. I mean, this is not something new, as you've said, we've had these sort of decades long problems. Why aren't these problems being fixed? Who is sort of responsible for getting that fixed? DR. ABIR:  So, a lot of the issues that we are facing right now, and have historically faced, is due to lack of transparency. So, the companies that make these medications are not obligated to report who -- where they get the ingredients from, who is the primary supplier and where they are even made. So, the setting of this lack of transparency and not really holding these companies accountable, then it's hard to predict when there's going to be a shortage in any of these medications. So, a lack of ability to know that there is a potential shortage is going to make it very difficult to come up with strategies to mitigate and come up with solutions. And that is why one of the most important policy changes that we can make in the U.S. is incentivizing. And this incentivizing manufacturers of medicines and medical equipment to share more information about their ingredients and where things are made and where their products are made and that that kind of transparency, ultimately, can lend itself to surveillance of supply chain issues so that you can mitigate in advance and implement strategies.",

DR. ABIR:  Yes, I think you're referring to onshoring. So, you know, production of medicines here in the United States, which certainly is part of the toolkit of strategies that we need to think about, thinking forward -- moving forward. However, you know, it is not really kind of the ultimate solution because you have to think about, you know, the degree of demand and the time sensitivity of getting these medicines to the end user. So, you know, as part of, again, a toolkit of various strategies, including diversifying manufacturers abroad and ensuring that we have options of bringing in medicines that we need. Also, yes, I think onshoring is part of the solution but not the entire solution.",

I mean, how do you prioritize where to start trying to make some of these changes? DR. ABIR:  Yes. I think it's a challenging issue. Because, just as you point out, there are certain products like IV fluids that are critical to the care of many sick patients, similar with antibiotics or albuterol, which, you know, is important for asthma and many other very common lung diseases. So, I think it makes sense to start with medicines that are used more commonly and for -- apply to a wider population, or the whole population when they get sick. But at the end of the day, we also can't ignore those medicines that really are pertinent to a smaller, you know, proportion of the population or for rare conditions. But I can think starting off with the more common medicines and equipment that are critical in many conditions certainly make sense.",

And I wonder, have you seen any big changes like that? DR. ABIR:  So, these are all excellent questions. Typically, health systems in the U.S. don't plan that far ahead. Because the return in investment for them is low. So, imagine that they have to prepare for an incident where the next public health emergency that may never arrive. So, I mean, the perfect example is on a day-to-day basis, many health systems, even for staffing, they don't plan ahead of time. They really kind of determine on a day-to-day basis or maybe even 72-hour basis at best, how much nursing staff they need. So, it really goes against the paradigm of health systems to think that far ahead and plan. But you really raise an important point. I mean, so, we've had stockpiles for medicines and supplies in the U.S. and some of that came to good use during the pandemic. But otherwise, you know, outside of ensuring that our stockpiles are ready and available and they're designed for the modern issues that we're facing today, we also need to share resources. So, for example, during the pandemic, not all cities and hospitals were hit hard at the same time, and some had lax -- they have more resources than others. And having, you know, strategies in place and agreements in place to share those resources in addition to thinking about how we can do a better job of stockpiling is going to be really important.",

I mean, I remember those horrible stories, essentially the State of California competing withthe State of New York for the same finite number of whatever it was, masks and so forth.

We know you'll be good for it in a couple months? DR. ABIR:  You know, we saw some of that. So, you know, various states, including in Michigan, where I am right now, some of the hospitals that were not as busy and overwhelmed by COVID patients did accept patients and transfers from other hospitals in the state that were really overwhelmed and overcapacity. So, that is one way of sharing resources. Also, for example, assuring some capacity around critical care through tell a critical care where doctors kind of advice physicians in community or remote hospitals around the care of COVID patients. So, we saw some of that. But we certainly need policies in place and more defined strategies to disseminate the importance of collaboration and cooperation during public health emergencies, you know, more routinely. So, although -- for example, the United States are good examples of that. It's not something that was done, you know, on a routine or regular basis or enough.",

DR. ABIR:  Yes. Certainly. I mean, I think that, you know, the Defense Production Act, outside of a public health emergency like COVID will be more difficult to trigger. However, you're absolutely right. I mean, having a list of critical medicines and supplies and equipment that are important to sustaining the work of hospitals and health systems would be really important. So that we start by addressing the supply chain issues in the context of those priority items.
