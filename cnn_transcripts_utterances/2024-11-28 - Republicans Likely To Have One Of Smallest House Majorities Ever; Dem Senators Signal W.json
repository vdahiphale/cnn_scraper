Democrat Derek Tran ousted Republican Congresswoman Michelle Steel in California.And Republican Congressman Mariannette Miller-Meeks eeked out a win in Iowa. There's one race left that's in California, where Democrat Adam Gray leads incumbent Republican John Duarte by 190 votes. Now, if Gray wins, the House will be divided 220 to 215. And Republicans are losing three of those seats because of resignations to join the Trump Cabinet. Now that will give House Democrats a lot of leverage if they stick together. As Leader Hakeem Jeffries posted on X, he said, \"There is no mandate to jam far right policies down the throats of the American people\". He said, \"House Democrats will not let it happen.\" My reporters are back. How do we see Democrats because, you know, when we look at the first iteration of Trump, it was resistance fight, tooth and nail. We're not hearing that as much. What's your sense of how they will position themselves in the minority?",

We know that they are going to wage a legal battle when they can, and that Democrats have been quietly and for a long time they did not want to sort of cast doubt on the Democratic ticket when the election was ongoing but have been quietly preparing for this possible outcome.So that is an area where I suspect that we will see the most. But I think that where they can, they will try to work with the former president because he has shown that he isn't ideologically rigid and that he does respond well to positive public sentiment, to positive press. I'm thinking about the First Step Act on criminal justice reform, for instance, in his first administration. We know from how the former president talks about criminals, ironic because he is a convicted felon himself, but he doesn't necessarily have any sort of kinship there. But he was willing to move on that policy based on the pressure in that moment and his son in law. And so --",
