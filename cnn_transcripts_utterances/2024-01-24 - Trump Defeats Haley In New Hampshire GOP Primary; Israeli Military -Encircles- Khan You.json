After winning Iowa last week, Trump is now the first non-incumbent Republican candidate to win the first two-state primary contests. And in a rambling and at times mean spirited victory speech, Trump appeared annoyed by Haley's decision to stay in the race. Haley sharpened her attacks on Trump suggesting he's too old to be president and is a loser. Haley plans to continue campaigning until South Carolina, her home state which holds its primary in one month.

The speech sounded almost nothing like what we heard in Iowa when he called for uniting the Republican Party, uniting the country instead, focused almost solely on Nikki Haley staying in the race. I was told by an advisor that he was watching at least part of her speech backstage speech in which she sounded defiant. Listen to some of what Trump had to say.

It's what or I can go up and say, who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and like claimed a victory. She did very poorly, actually. She had to win. The governor said she's going to win, she's going to win, she's going to win. Then she -- she failed badly. And just a little note to Nikki. She's not going to win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes. And I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about.

That's not unreasonable.But it really is the case that if Haley couldn't win New Hampshire, she can't win anywhere. She had a huge advantage with independent voters supporting her. She invested almost all of her time in that state. She had virtually unlimited cash from anti-Trump super PACs. New Hampshire has an independent streak. Those variables aren't going to align in future Republican primary states. Donald Trump is right about that. And what we do know is that to win a Republican primary, you have to win over the right wing, the right wing supports Trump, it's coalescing behind him. And there's seemingly nothing Haley can do to blunt that momentum. And by the way, nowhere is that more true than in South Carolina, Haley's home state, which is upcoming. So, this is the coronation that Trump predicted. And the MAGA movement led by an election denier is really the one and only dominant force in the GOP. So, for Haley, she's going to stay in at least she says that for now. But I think she's really just doing so on the chance that these legal challenges catch up to Trump.",

And in that sense, it's about the military lives, civilian lives. And as you were saying before, the lives of civilians on the Gaza Strip are also right now so challenging. What is Israel achieved? While we're talking about what Hamas built over 15 years, they have been building this over a decade. We are systematically trying to dismantle that underground subterranean arena to take the enormous amount of weapons and to get to terrorists. What did the terrorists do? They built themselves inside underground and above ground in the civilian community. So we're systematically taking that apart. And as you said, or certainly not done. It's very slow. And it is part of that challenge of what Hamas built. And as I look at that right now, we have killed thousands of terrorists. That doesn't make me happy. I'd be much happier if there was no terrorism, if they did not use the civilian community as their defense system above ground and below ground.

I'm talking about a very long time. I completely understand the challenge, both inside Israel and worldwide in supporting this. And I've asked again, in that sense, what is the alternative? If Hamas stays in power? If Hamas keeps the hostages? If Hamas keeps their military capabilities? That's not a loss for Israel.

That is not good news for anybody. That is a plan for the next terror organization to do it. And when it's against Israel, for some reason, it becomes different. It's not different. We need the hostages back and all of us need to destroy Hamas capabilities so that they can't use the terror capabilities to be able to do what they did, and have said that they would do again.

Huge strides in history-making moments for women in film.But some good news for \"Barbie\", America Ferrera sliding in to the supporting category with a surprise nomination. Anyone who has seen \"Barbie\" is going to be happy that she got this nod because of that empowering speech in a really fantastic performance from her. Now, moving down on the list of snubs, Bradley Cooper not getting in there for best director for \"Maestro\" but still a good morning for him. He is a double nominee as a producer on that film, which was nominated for best picture and also as best actor. Leonardo di Caprio, not getting a nomination for \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" anytime that Leo is not there, that's a snub. He's one of the biggest actors in Hollywood history. But Leo was really setting his campaign this award season around his co-star, Lily Gladstone. Lily Gladstone did make history this morning, becoming the first Native American actress to be nominated. If she wins, she will be the first Native American winner at the Oscars in the major acting categories. Now, some other history-making moments. Robert Downey, Jr. was nominated for his role in \"Oppenheimer\". Believe it or not, if he wins, this will be his first Oscar in his entire career. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
