But one thing that everybody was very concerned about was a nationwide data shutdown, which is exactly what has happened at the moment.Our team here on the ground is having immense difficulties even getting on air to report the election. And we're an international news organization that multiple journalists on the ground are already concerned by digital rights activists that a mobile phone or cell phone shut down is going to cause panic amongst voters, it's going to contribute to a lower voter turnout. And we ourselves went earlier in the day do a polling station around eight in the morning, when polls did open and there was a considerable amount of people who had started coming in. There was a slight delay because polling agents hadn't arrived. And but again, this is a very huge electoral exercise. Pakistan is the fifth largest democracy in the world. 128 million people are eligible to vote. There are many main players who are, you know, involved in these elections. Imran Khan is behind bars, his party is still immensely popular, even though it's lost its popular electoral symbol at the same time. You've got Nawaz Sharif, he's been a prime minister three times coming back again for the fourth, we know in a couple of hours. So, lots of fears of security of militant attacks. Like you said, there have been a few in the lead up to this election to this day. But we're going to have to see how the day unfolds. And we'll keep giving you that information. John.

Well, U.S. senators will hold a procedural vote Thursday on a funding bill for Ukraine and Israel. But this time, it will come without any border security measures or immigration reforms. Republicans blocked the larger combined package on Wednesday, rejecting what was a bipartisan deal, which would have enacted stricter border measures and contain pretty much everything they've ever wanted for the past two decades. They bailed on the package under pressure from right wing members of the House, as well as Donald Trump, who is making chaos in the immigration system, a central campaign issue as he runs for president. New foreign aid bill includes $60 billion for Ukraine, well, then $14 billion in security aid for Israel, among other provisions. Senate Majority Leader Democrat Chuck Schumer, chided his Republican opponents for demanding border policy changes to be part of the bill only to walk away from the deal just days later.

It's certainly not necessarily positive, no really good reason to be sort of stay persistent in an environment like a water treatment facility or a power grid. So it does sort of beg the question of how does this relate to, you know, subsequent cyber incursion that will pre predate something more nefarious, all kinds of things have sort of been part of the conversation lately. But certainly as it relates to where and how widespread this is, that's what's making this quite a bit challenging. It's not an easy fix.

And when you think about the way water treatment works, if you simply change levels, you know, pH levels, for example, it doesn't mean about contamination, but simply that you can create an incredibly scary situation with, you know, non-potable water that people are now drinking unbeknownst to them that could cause a mass dysentery impact, which would then cause a flood of people into the hospitals and then you've got a cascading effect there.

In Israel, a deal with Hamas for the release of around 100 hostages, as well as a pause in fighting in Gaza seems increasingly unlikely. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spent the past few days in the region pushing that deal. On Wednesday, he met with the Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who did not outright reject a counter offer from Hamas. Instead though he described it as delusional and crazy. The Hams offer is for a three-state ceasefire over a total of 135 days. Hostages would be released over the first two stages in exchange with thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Hamas also demanding a total withdrawal from Gaza. All Israeli troops out within 90 days, as well as an agreement on a permanent ceasefire by the end of that lull in fighting. Netanyahu says, Israeli forces will not withdraw from Gaza until there is a complete victory over Hamas. He says it's just months away. Secretary Blinken though believes the Hamas offer still has some room for negotiations to continue.

Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza with dozens of request for Israeli concessions from the al-Aqsa mosque, to thousands of prisoners that he wants released, including those who were sentenced to life.And as you said, you know, permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, and all of those issues. So I think that when it comes to the process, the Qataris felt that, you know, there are positive things in the Hamas response. When it comes to substance, the gaps are huge. So now the question is, do you want to focus on the process or the substance? And today when Netanyahu was asked twice if he rejects Hamas' response, he called it delusional. He called it insane. He called it crazy. He said he will not capitulate to it, but he did not say -- he did not say at all that he rejected and is not willing to negotiate. And this is the interesting thing here.

And while Prince William is no stranger to public engagements, we may see him performing more formal and ceremonial roles in the coming weeks, like Wednesday's investiture. In many ways, this is a glimpse into the future for the prince who only took on the role of heir apparent less than two years ago. Meanwhile, the King will be working from home or, perhaps that should be homes. Currently it is Sandringham and according to Number 10 Downing Street, the prime minister had his weekly audience with the King by a phone call on Wednesday. In stark contrast to Prince William's public engagements, Prince Harry was barely seen. He was spotted in the back of a car. He had arrived from California to see his father. We understand that the meeting was brief, only around 45 minutes. And according to U.K. media outlets, Prince Harry had already head home. It is a reminder of how slimmed down the royal family has become in recent years and now with two key members off sick, there's certainly more work to go around. Anna Stewart, CNN -- London.
