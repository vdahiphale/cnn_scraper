It is in the Patapsco River in Baltimore right now.I just want to play again so people can see the ship hits the pylon. I'm going to reverse that right there. That pylon right there, that big ship runs into it, the entire bridge falls into the water there. And, again, just so people have a sense of the area we're talking about, this is the key bridge. This is Baltimore Washington International Airport. So, you can imagine if you're coming from the northeast down to BWI, you may very well go over that bridge. This area right here you're looking at, a lot of warehouses, Amazon, McCormick, important companies. So, this is a huge transport corridor up and down the East Coast. Let's get a sense of what it would be like for people who may be in the water right now, because, as you heard, there is a search for up to seven people. Derek Van Dam is with us now.

You know, the old -- you know, it's a mainstay of engineering that there are three parts to a bridge construction, the mass and inertia to protect it against wind, the stiffness of the trusses to keep it together, and then, of course, the stays to keep the bridge on its supports.And so in modern times, what they have done is built a built up bulwarks and, you know, cement pilings and all sorts of things to keep the barges or ships from hitting those supports. Because once those supports are weakened and the bridge band is weakened from the support, you know, that has explained the problem in a lot of bridge collapses in the United States, even a major one here in Charleston back in the 40s.",

Our partners from the U.S. Coast Guard will provide some more information momentarily. In terms of traffic, drivers should avoid I-695 Southeast Carter and use I-95 and I-895 as alternatives. I-695 is being detoured southbound at exit 43, the Peninsula Expressway, and northbound at Exit 2, Route 10. Vessel traffic into and out of the port of Baltimore suspended until further notice, but the port is still open for truck transactions. Obviously, we're very thankful for the first responders who are carrying out their efforts in these rescues, and that they're doing this all through the night and today, and we're praying obviously for everyone safe return. We'll continue to provide updates to you, the next one being approximately 9:30. With that, I will turn it over to Lieutenant Colonel Palmer from the U.S. Coast Guard. Good morning. My name is Lieutenant Commander Erin Palmer from Coast Guard Sector Maryland National Capital Region. I'm the current acting chief of response for the sector. The Coast Guard's primary mission right now is search and rescue, looking for any survivors in the water. On scene, we currently have three small boats. We also have Coast Guard Cutter Mako, an 87-foot patrol boat.
