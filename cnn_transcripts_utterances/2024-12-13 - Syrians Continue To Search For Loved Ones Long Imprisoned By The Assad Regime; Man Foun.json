They're meeting with rebel commander Mohammed Al-Jolani, the de facto leader of the new administration, and caretaker Prime Minister Mohammed Al Bashir. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also in the region, meeting Thursday with Turkey's president.

Part of that also has to be ensuring that ISIS doesn't rear its ugly head again. And critical to making sure that doesn't happen is the so called SDF, the Syrian Democratic Forces. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The United States here has an opportunity to emerge as the big power in the Middle East at a time of great power competition.There is a Pax Americana here that is in the making, given that its rivals, Russia, but also the regional power of Iran, are right now on their back foot. The Iranian axis in the region, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Assad regime in Syria is essentially faltering. But the tricky part in all this is that America's allies are not united. And so, the Arabs have an interest of their own, the Turks, a different agenda. The Turks, for example, very much adopting the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, whereas that poses a threat to American allies in Jordan, the Hashemite royal family, and then certainly within Syria, Kurd versus Arabs, and various movements and trends within those rebel forces. So it's a moment where all the spokes end up in Washington, which is the only hub that can bring all these pieces together. And this is why it's so crucial that Secretary Blinken is in the region, that American diplomacy remains engaged and that we try to put the pieces of that puzzle together, most of them America's allies, but perhaps not necessarily working together.",

And you had Trump, both in \"Meet the Press\" and on \"Time\", reaffirm what Tom Homan who is going to be his immigration czar in the White House said. That they will attempt to deport U.S. citizen children of undocumented parents. As I've mentioned to you before, there are four million Hispanic kids who are U.S. citizens born here in the U.S. who have at least one undocumented parent. And the only way to avoid industrial scale family separation if he really goes through with mass deportation, is to also remove the kids. And he has made very clear that they intend to try to do that. Now, the courts may stop him. But I think people have to be bracing themselves for the prospect that they will try to not only deport undocumented parents, but citizen kids in potentially large numbers in the weeks ahead.",

That's from a former senior official who spoke at the White House announcing half a billion dollars in new aid on Thursday. And the official says there will be more help in the coming weeks while President Joe Biden is still in office to put Kyiv on a strong footing in its war with Russia. Donald Trump takes over as president in January, but he's giving no guarantees to continuing to send aid. In an interview with \"Time Magazine\", he criticized the recent decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-made missiles for strikes deeper inside Russia. He says that will only make the war worse. Well, since the war began, more than 20,000 people in Russia have been detained for standing up against it. A Russian human rights group says more than a dozen of them are under age because people as young as 14 can be prosecuted for such crimes as treason and terrorism.
