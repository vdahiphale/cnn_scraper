It's also called into question his political future for the first time in 23 years.CNN's Randi Kaye has more on his rise to power. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  He is the ultimate alpha male or at least he'd like the world to believe that. Vladimir Putin always presenting himself as the picture of strength, often shirtless, captured hunting, or taking a submarine down deep in the Black Sea. Putin was born in October 1952 in what is now St. Petersburg. In 1975, he joined the KGB as an intelligence officer. In 1999, then-President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin prime minister. In 2000, Putin was elected president of Russia. At the time, even President George Bush was impressed though it didn't last. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. KAYE (voice-over):  Putin was reelected in 2004. By 2008, he'd reached the term limit under Russia's constitution so he got creative and switched jobs with then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. So Medvedev was elected president of Russia and named Putin as prime minister -- a move that raised questions about how much power Medvedev really had. In office, Medvedev changed the constitution, extending presidential terms from four years to six years before Putin was reelected president again in 2012. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (translated):  We have demonstrated that nobody can impose anything on us. KAYE (voice-over):  Putin has ruled Russia for more than two decades and his power is undeniable. He escalated the war in Chechnya, invaded Ukraine, and his government allegedly interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, though he's denied that. He also allegedly had a hand in disposing of his critics, like former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko who died weeks after drinking a cup of poison-laced tea. Litvinenko blamed Putin. The Kremlin denied his involvement. Still, Putin won his last election in 2018 with more than 76 percent of the vote. His critics have slammed the election as unfair, citing tight control over the media and election monitors. Some critics have suggested Putin has used his reign not to better the lives of the Russian people but to enrich himself through theft and corruption. Bill Browder, who once invested heavily in Russia, is now one of Vladimir Putin's toughest critics. FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, \"WATCH GPS\":  Can you estimate his net worth? BILL BROWDER, CEO, FINANCIER, POLITICAL ACTIVIST, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Two hundred billion. KAYE (voice-over):  Exact details about Putin's wealth are hard to come by. These photos from inside one of Putin's lavish homes were shared with CNN by an independent Russian journalist who left the country.",

      "sentences": "All right, your Romans' Numeral this morning, 1.27 million. Americans believe they will need 1.27 million bucks to retire comfortably. Northwestern Mutual says that number had increased from $1.25 million last year. The average amount U.S. adults actually have saved for retirement is just over 89 grand, up three percent from last year.All right. Looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished mixed. China's premier predicts five percent economic growth there this year. European markets also mixed here this morning, although now I'd say leaning slightly lower. And on Wall Street, stock index futures barely positive this morning. Markets really unphased by Russia's weekend drama but slipped at the close yesterday, dragged down by tech shares. Tesla shares fell by six percent. Meta and Alphabet also down about two percent each. Russia, of course, is a major oil producer. Crude oil prices initially rose on signs of instability in Russia but have slipped back. Gas prices have remained low. Gas prices fell a penny overnight to $3.56 a gallon, well below the $4.90 a gallon we saw at this time last year. On deck today, consumer confidence numbers and new home sales due out later this morning. All right, let's bring in Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Good morning, Mark. I wanted to get your thoughts on the weekend drama in Russia. I mean, I guess it's a reminder that Russia's war in Ukraine is bad for the world and very disruptive for global economies. You write this this weekend. \"The global economy would get a big boost if Russia's internal conflict forced it to curtail its war in Ukraine more quickly. The war has done serious economic damage, and while the Western response has cushioned the blow, ending the aggression would lift a dark economic pall.\" Is there a chance that a weakened Putin could be good for the resolution of this conflict? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS (via Webex by Cisco): Well, good morning, Christine. Yes. I mean, I think the -- you know, there's a lot of paths this can go down, obviously. The most likely scenario is the status quo -- Putin remains in power. Diminished, but remains in power and continues to prosecute the war. And that's not good. It creates a lot of uncertainty in global energy, agricultural markets, and there's a pall over the global economy. But the global economy has figured out a way around. It's kind of navigating through. But there is a scenario where this puts tremendous pressure on Putin to wind down and ultimately withdraw from Ukraine. And I think that would be an unambiguous positive -- obviously for the people of Ukraine but for the global economy -- because it lifts that critical uncertainty and stabilizes global commodity prices, oil prices, and that's a big plus for global growth. Now, obviously, there's other darker paths that we can entertain but I think the more optimistic path is the more likely path.",

The price for a gallon of regular unleaded three buck-fifty, still above what it was pre-pandemic but well down from where we were a year ago. We were paying five bucks a gallon at that point -- a record high.And it goes to demand and supply. As you point out, demand has been soft particularly because the Chinese economy has been kind of struggling here to get off the ground with its end of its no-COVID policy. And China is clearly a big consumer of oil. So if their economy is soft and not consuming oil that keeps more supplies on the market. So that's been -- that's been good. And then demand here in the U.S. also, Christine, moving in the right direction. If you go before the pandemic we were consuming 21 million barrels of oil a day. Now we're consuming 20 million barrels of oil a day. It goes to lots of different things, including remote work and less commuting.",

And the White House is actually sort of positioning this week to really start focusing again about Bidenomics. You know, some big broadband investments, infrastructure spending -- thing that the White House is trying to do show that it's building the economy from the middle out, not the top down. What's your sense of whether we can really skirt that recession and that -- is the -- are the Biden policies helping?",

Obviously, in a world of high inflation and a Federal Reserve that's raising interest rates aggressively to quell that inflation, historically, we've landed in a recession. But I think we've got a fighting chance this time to get through without one.And you point out consumers are really hanging tough for lots of reasons, including a lot of what economists call excess saving -- savings they built up during the pandemic because they couldn't spend and because of government support. The American Rescue Plan being some -- a piece of legislation passed early on in the Biden administration to help the economy. And I think in -- you know, there's -- you know, pluses and minuses with Biden's economics policies but I think on net, it's a positive. I mean, I think it's unambiguous that we are back to full employment. That means a very low unemployment rate very quickly because of the very aggressive policies. And I do think things like the infrastructure plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Chips Act which incents semiconductor producers to come back here and produce at home, will help the economy longer-run. I mean, we are left with a larger debt load and I do think that's a longer-term issue. So not an ambiguous plus but I think generally, the economic policies have been -- have been pretty good.",
