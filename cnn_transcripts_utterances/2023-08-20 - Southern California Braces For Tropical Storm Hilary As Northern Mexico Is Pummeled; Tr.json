We do begin this hour with the breaking news on Tropical Storm Hilary gaining speed and churning towards Southern California. It's about to become the first tropical storm to hit Southern California since 1939. Flash flood warnings are up across the region.(VIDEO PLAYING) And look at that dramatic footage. This is what Hilary unleashed on Mexico's Baja, California. One person in this coastal town died when their vehicle was swept away. Weather forecasters are warning those in the path of the storm, be prepared for catastrophic and life- threatening floods. We're covering the storm from all angles, from the weather center, to the cities in its path. The warning that blankets much of Southern California today. Stay off the roads if you can. Let me show you this. The small mudslide temporarily shut down a lane of the 14 Freeway north of Los Angeles. Crews were able to clear it quickly. Stephanie Elam is in Palm Springs, California for us where the weather is starting to come down on top of her. Stephanie, officials there took the precaution of closing some roads hours ago. How are things going where you are?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Now, we're really starting to feel the brunt of this, starting to make its way here. Jim, I've been only been outside for five minutes and if you take a look at me, I am pretty soaked. I've not even -- five minutes, I don't think I've been standing outside here.This is what's coming and what they're concerned about is down this street. This is a major way into Palm Springs and they have shut it off, closed it off because they're concerned about flooding, something they say they know this road does. Now that we're sitting outside here, it's way more windy than it was earlier. I can also tell you that there is a lot more rain. And what I can also see is that this rain is running down the street and they say that the water down there can take out cars and that is why they don't want people out here and driving on this road even though that's a very quick way to get to Interstate 10 and to get out in and out of Palm Springs. But what we are facing here is basically a year's amount of rain falling in about a couple of days. So, on average in this area you get about five and a half inches of rain and it's not out of the question that it could be more than that falls from the storm as it makes its way through here. Throughout the region, we are starting to see more alerts. We are all just got emergency alerts on our phones because of flooding potential in Los Angeles County, where most of us live, that work on this team here. And so, we are seeing that flooding is starting to permeate into lots of areas, and that's leading to that mudslide. It's leading to some more debris flows. And also, one of the other things we're very concerned about are unhoused populations and that water rushing through areas where they normally can stay because it's dry, but it's now a very dangerous area for them to be. So, we're seeing a lot of this starting to pick up and really feeling the impact here in Southern California, and here in Palm Springs we are expecting to feel the brunt of it and it's just amazing to have this much water falling, falling on us in August. It's just something that does not happen here, Jim.",

Now, this is Baja, California, northwest Mexico, where the storm has just been moving up the coast. And earlier this afternoon, it did make landfall in San Quentin. That was the first landfall for Hilary. And it was pummeling this coastal community, 65-mile-an-hour winds. That's storm surge coming off the ocean there, really treating these towns very, very badly.Of course, there's a lot more Mexico to go through as this storm moves quickly up the peninsula towards California, where it's expected to cross over into the U.S. at around three or 4:00 local time. On its way, you have Ensenada, that's Mexico's important wine region where there's a lot of tourists, not just from Mexico, but from the U.S., coming to visit. And then, of course, you have Tijuana, the very important border city. That's of course a hub for migrants making their way towards the U.S. A lot of concern in Tijuana now. This is a hilly city where there are a lot of mudslides. The infrastructure there is poor. You have residences built into these hills. So, authorities in Tijuana on high alert and across the state they have told folks stay home do not get in your cars. We did have one death earlier in the small coastal town of Santa Rosalia where you saw those awful images. The roads really turned into rivers there. Four inches of rain falling in just a few hours. That's about four times the daily average that this small town gets in August. This was a man who was stuck in his car. It was swept away. Now, authorities said they were able to rescue several other people but they're saying stay home and if you can't stay home there are shelters dozens open throughout the states and at least a hundred people now taking cover in these shelters, according to the governor of Baja, California. Now, it's not that unusual for storms in this part of Mexico, not quite as rare as California, but when storms form in the Pacific, they move typically towards the east. They hit the cold waters of the Baja Peninsula and they'll turn towards the east. This storm, of course, ignoring history, marching quickly towards California and brutalizing Mexico on its way up there. Jim?",

People are trying to drive through these flooded roadways. So, we'll stay on top of that, bring you the latest as it comes in. In the meantime, we are following new developments in the Georgia election interference case involving former President Donald Trump and his allies. There's a new twist involving one of Trump's 18 co- defendants. His former White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, is asking a federal court to dismiss all the charges against him, arguing that his alleged actions should be immune from state prosecution because he was acting in his capacity as a federal official at the time. His request for dismissal comes as Georgia authorities prepare for the surrender of former President Donald Trump at the Fulton County Jail. That's where we find CNN's Isabel Rosales. Isabel Rosales, this is going to be just fascinating as the week unfolds. Do we know exactly when Trump will show up in Atlanta?

And the things he's accused of doing are not official duties. The president of the United States, certainly his chief of staff under the Constitution, have no role in counting the votes in Georgia or pressuring, as they're accused of doing in the D.A.'s indictment, pressuring Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger after the vote had been counted, recounted, certified to just find 11,780 votes. So that makes it tough on the removal standard. Then under the Supremacy Clause, the test is, did Meadows have a duty to do it? Did he do no more than was necessary and proper under that duty? And was it authorized? And the problem there again is no real role for the feds and, of course, allegations of returning the peaceful transfer of power.

Just a few moments ago, we were showing you some footage of flooded roadways there in Southern California, L.A.Take a look at this. This is the latest stuff coming in from KABC. It appears to be one of these coastal areas in L.A. and so much water, storm water, coming through this one section of beach that is washing a lot of this beach away as the shot pulls out. We were looking at this through the commercial break. Um, it looks like it's happening again as we're on the air live right now, but you can see that storm water just rushing through a section of beach there in Los Angeles in the L.A. area and there you see that the path of tropical storm Hilary on the left side of your screen. So, as that chopper shot from KABC widens there, you can see what this -- what this rainfall is doing to Southern California as it picks up, moves into the region, and this is going to continue to worsen over the next few hours. We're going to stay on top of that, bring you the latest as it comes in, so stay tuned. And in the meantime, this is what Hilary unleashed on Mexico's Baja California. If you haven't seen this footage yet, take a look at this. One person in this coastal town was killed when their vehicle was swept away. More than nine million people, including those in downtown Los Angeles, are under a flash flood warning along the coast. Large swells being generated by Hilary are likely to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. So, everybody in that area, please be careful. In the meantime, tomorrow, the president will travel to Hawaii and get a first-hand look at the damage from the deadly wildfires in Maui. The search to find and identify victims of the wildfires has been painstaking and slow. Hawaii's governor today said the process will take several weeks and an army of search and rescue teams, along with dogs, begin to go through larger buildings in the devastated parts of Maui. The governor warned the devastation in some areas is so extensive, some remains may never be found. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH GREEN (D-HI): More than a thousand are unaccounted for, about a thousand fifty. It will take several weeks still. Some of the challenges are going to be extraordinary because of the temperature of the fire. The remains of those who have died in some cases may be impossible to recover meaningfully.

And so, I think in a way, if he continues down this path, it will be a mistake.",

But, obviously, that's up to him. I mean, you're just asking me my opinion, but he will lose to Joe Biden if you look at the current polls. I'm a Republican. I think any Republican on that stage in Milwaukee will do a better job than Joe Biden. And so, I want one of them to win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He is not going to enjoy being fingerprinted, he is not going to like having a mugshot taken, and he's certainly not going to be happy with the fact that he has to go to a jail rather than a courthouse. He has become so used to accommodations being made for him, whether it's, as Olivia said, with the debate and Ronna McDaniel and people just allowing him to do what he wants. I think this one is going to really hit him hard, though he'll never ever admit it. And I will say I agree completely with everything that was said this morning. I think that he should step out of the race. I think there's absolutely no way he will win the general election against Biden. And if he had any love for this country, as he constantly says he does, he would see that and drop out, too. The people around him should be telling him the same thing.",

According to data from the U.S. Geological Survey, at least two aftershocks have also been recorded. According to those officials, measuring 3.1 and 3.6. following that initial quake.Let me go to Jennifer Gray. I know she's in the Weather Center for us tracking tropical storm Hilary.

You know, the rain is going to continue to come down over the next couple of hours as the heaviest bands from this storm continue to push into Southern California.So, we've seen rainfall rates of half an inch to an inch an hour. This is an area of the country, you know, that that's not used to getting a lot of rain. Some parts of Southern California only get about two inches of rain for the entire calendar year. And so, we're definitely seeing at least a month's worth of rain, several months-worth of rain, in some cases more than a year's worth of rain, just in about a 24-hour timeframe. So, we know that the topography there, the soil there just does not absorb the water. So, where a thunderstorm east of the Rockies get two inches of rain, it's not a big deal. You see two inches of rain across the desert southwest. We are going to see some huge problems, you know. And a lot of the topography is mountainous. And so, you have the rain falling in these mountains and then it just all funnels down into the valleys below, it can fill the creeks riverbeds extremely quickly, and we can we can see life-threatening flash flooding just in a blink of an eye. So, it's very dangerous over the next couple of hours across the state and even points north. We're seeing impacts across Nevada. And then as the moisture continues to trickle to the north, we'll see major rainfall across portions of Idaho even. But right now, the biggest threat is across Southern California into Nevada portions of Arizona as well as we just see lots of rainfall across this area, Jim.",
