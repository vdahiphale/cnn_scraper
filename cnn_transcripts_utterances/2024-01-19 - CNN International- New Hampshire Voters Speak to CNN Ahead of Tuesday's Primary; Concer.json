He warned the justices, quote, chaos and bedlam would be unleashed if states exclude him from the ballot. Plus, with New Hampshire's primary now just four days away, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley made her case to voters at a CNN Town Hall Thursday night. Haley said her goal next week is to do better than she did in Iowa's Republican primary, where she placed third.

The test came after joint U.S., South Korean and Japanese naval drills earlier on this week, which Pyongyang described as a serious threat to national security. There are now growing concerns over comments by North Korea that it's no longer pursuing reconciliation with the South. And that is raising fears that the North may be planning to take advantage of conflicts in other parts of the world and the distraction of key players to launch a war of its own.CNN's Will Ripley has the latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Korean peninsula staring down the barrel of a catastrophic conflict. That warning from one of America's leading nuclear scientists, one of two long-time North Korea observers who say Kim Jong-un is sending signals in state media. He may be prepared to take advantage of global chaos to exploit what he sees as weakness and vulnerability between the U.S. and close allies, South Korea and Japan. SIEGFRIED S. HECKER, PROFESSOR, MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: They're talking about war. They're talking about war preparations for their country. And so, we're quite concerned. RIPLEY (voice-over): For years, former Los Alamos director Siegfried Hecker had unparalleled access to North Korea's highly secretive nuclear program, seeing more than almost any American. What he's seeing now, he says, reminiscent of the lead-up to the catastrophic Korean War more than 70 years ago, a chilling shift in leader Kim Jong-un's strategy, far more than the usual saber-rattling.",
