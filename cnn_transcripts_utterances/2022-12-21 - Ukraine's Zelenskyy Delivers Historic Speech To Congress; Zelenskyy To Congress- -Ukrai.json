They asked me to bring this flag to you, to the US Congress, to members of the House of Representatives and Senators whose decisions can save millions of people. So, let these decisions be taken. Let this flag stay with you, ladies and gentlemen. This flag is a symbol of our victory in this war. We stand, we fight, and we will win because we are united, Ukraine, America and the entire free world. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Just one thing, if I can, the last thing, thank you so much.

No. And earlier saying, you know, we're getting this one Patriot missile, but yes, I'm going to ask for more.

They remember, you know, the only thing we have to -- the only thing we remember, \"This will be a day that lives in infamy,\" not the righteous mind awoken and we are going to continue on forever. And that was a line that FDR wrote himself at the bottom of the second part of the draft. He thought that was important.And I think what Zelenskyy did by coming at Christmas, . I don't know that they knew that, but it rings back the thought of when Churchill was here giving his speech to the joint session of Congress, and it brings back World War Two, it brings back the importance of that alliance between America and Britain and now America and Ukraine. And he talked as if the Alliance were already there, you know, together, we will do this; together, we will do that. So he has already established in the American people's mind that we're in this thing together, but then pointing out that the soldiers are not going to -- they are going to do the fighting for us, just give us the tools and we will finish the job. That's what Churchill said. I just keep thinking back to when Churchill came to the White House, it was at Christmas time, 81 years ago now. He was very nervous before that speech. I wonder how Zelenskyy felt tonight? Churchill said that he was new, it was a turning point for history. He was afraid that Japan had attacked us and we would then go to Japan instead of caring about Germany and Europe. And finally, he asked for tumblers of sherry in the morning.

So he was exhausted after Roosevelt and Churchill were together during that time, but it cemented their alliance.

But if you listened carefully between the lines, you also heard his fears here. Obviously, the coming winter; obviously, the fact that the mere mass of the Russian force is beginning to show up. One American military officials, a very senior official noted to me that if those 300,000 conscripts actually get trained and show up and the spring comes, Zelenskyy will be facing a bigger Russian force than he has ever faced before here. So, that's a significant line. And I think the final thing was his invocation of Iran, which was meant to go bridge those Republicans who were still has reservations.",

We are going to look back on this moment, this speech, the way we look back at FDR speeches and some of the others who have been invoked tonight. I think that President Zelenskyy, coming from Bakhmut traveling thousands of miles west to Washington D.C. to thank the American people, to thank the Congress and the President of the United States, but to also say, you know, we can win this war, but we need additional assistance in order to win it. And this is not a charity. This is an investment in the international global order. This is an investment in U.S. security. I thought it was really masterful. And he also combined not only the strategic thinking, but also appealed to our emotions. You know, talking about Christmas in a couple of days and how Ukrainians are going to celebrate probably mostly by candlelight, not because it's romantic, but because they don't have electricity. I think every American can relate to that.

Some people have compared it to when Churchill came 81 years ago and basically asked that the United States continue to stand with them after we'd been attacked. And we did.

That can have an impact. I think information continues, not enough, but still to seep into Russia so that the defeats and the resolve of the Ukrainian people become clearer and clearer.
