Republican lawmakers met on a conference call last night around 8And we should just remind everyone that this is a one-month spending bill. This is not even a larger one-year spending bill, which negotiators in the house and Senate are going to have to come to terms with. But this is just a one-month deal with just the Republican coalition. And even that they cannot get their arms around right now. Now, leadership is vowing to bring this to the floor as soon as Thursday. They are also hoping to put on the floor on Wednesday a separate, stand-alone defense spending bill that came into problems last week. So, a lot of the moving pieces here. But one thing to keep in mind is House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told my colleague Morgan Remmer (ph) that morning that' he's not giving up on this fight to try to pass this Republican-only spending bill. He said that he is going to continue working with his colleague, and he said that some member may not have read it that closely. So, he's hoping that as they get more time to digest this proposal that they're going to come to rally around it. But we're just going to have to wait and see. A lot of problems for GOP leadership this morning as they're trying to find that coalition.",
