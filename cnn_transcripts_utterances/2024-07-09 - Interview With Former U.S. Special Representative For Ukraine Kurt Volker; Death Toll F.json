But there wasn't a clear consensus of how to move forward. A line you're hearing from a lot of Democrats is that they are united against Donald Trump, but they aren't necessarily united when it comes to what to do next. I think one of the complications here is, without Biden deciding to get out of the race on his own, it's unclear exactly what recourse Democrats have in this situation.

You look at their policies. From what I have seen, the policies have worked. We have low unemployment. Our children are getting a better education. They are able -- if they can't afford it, we have created policies to help them. We have alleviated the debt. The Biden administration has been open and aboveboard.

We don't just fall in line behind an iron-fisted cult leader. So that's what you're seeing play out in our Democratic Caucus.

New images show bloodied children, patients who survived after two floors collapsed in the strike. Kyiv's mayor says more than 600 kids had to be evacuated. Now Ukraine's prime minister is vowing that this hospital is going to be completely rebuilt. Let's get the latest from the ground with CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who's live on the scene.

One of the things that came to us just a couple of minutes ago is that the complete death toll for Ukraine has actually now risen from those 39 that you just mentioned to 43 just in the last couple of minutes. So, clearly, this is something that is not over and where the carnage continues to get worse even after these attacks have ended. But I can show you, I'm actually at the impact site of where this missile hit this children's hospital. I will get out of your way for a second here, and you can see over there that the building that was hit by this missile was just completely annihilated by the explosion, or at least large parts of it. You can see there that it's a very small-size debris, showing just how devastating the impact of that missile must have been. And I came a little closer to this area a couple of minutes ago, and you can see that there's also still medical equipment destroyed among that debris as well, so definitely a massive impact of that explosion. I was able to speak to a doctor here earlier, Boris, and she told me that she was in an adjacent building, and it was still a massive explosion and she came running out here. And she saw those scenes that we just saw on our screens of the folks who work here at this medical center then trying to help. And just to give you an idea about how big this explosion was, this is a huge complex. This is the biggest children's hospital in all of Ukraine. You can see there's a really modern building over there, another hospital building. That's also been badly damaged by this explosion as well. You can see that most of the windows there have been blown out, the facade also destroyed. And then, if we look in the foreground here right in front of me, these are actually some of the floors of the building that we just showed you before. You can see that they just completely flat-packed down and were destroyed. And so one of the things, obviously, that President Zelenskyy of Ukraine is saying as he comes to Washington, D.C., for that summit, is that the Ukrainians obviously need more military aid. But one of the most pressing things that Ukrainians say is air defense systems and specifically the U.S.-made Patriots through which they hope they will be able to prevent strikes like the one that destroyed large parts of this children's hospital -- Boris.",

There are other issues as well. And as Beth is laying out, we have China making moves. We have Russia making moves very purposefully at this time. What's at stake here? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR UKRAINE:  Yes. Yes. So what they're trying to do is intimidate NATO. They're trying to show that they have power, they have the willingness to use that power, and so NATO had better be careful, trying to deter us from doing more to actually support Ukraine. I hope that NATO is not cowed into that kind of response. What we have here is an alliance that has lasted 75 years on the basis of the members agreeing to protect each other, and that's great. And I think that commitment to collective defense still stands very strong. But we now face a situation where we have the largest war in Europe since World War II. NATO was created to try to prevent future war. We are now facing that war, and we run the risk now of Russia defeating Ukraine and then moving on to attacking other countries and putting European security at even greater risk. So NATO really needs to step up and make a commitment to helping Ukraine succeed, helping them defeat Russian forces, and then ultimately bringing them into NATO so that we can deter future conflict again in the future.",
