Some of these Americans have been held there for over or all of them, I should say, for over five years, one of them for nearly eight years.So clearly something that was a very high priority for them, but it really started to take shape, the deal itself over the last six-, seven months. That is when the administration began negotiating with the Iranians in Qatar, notably not actually face-to-face. These were indirect talks that the Qataris served as intermediaries for. And just last month, we saw the beginning of that movement, right, when a couple of those Americans were actually moved to house arrest. And then we saw the Secretary of State issue a waiver that would allow those $6 billion that you mentioned to be transferred to Qatar to then be used for humanitarian purposes as Iran requests those funds. Now, the Secretary of State, he is already kind of preempting the backlash that we have heard already from Republicans, from critics of this deal by saying that these funds were never meant to exempt, of course, being used for humanitarian purposes. The U.S. does not levy sanctions to punish the people of the governments under the governments that the U.S. is trying to punish here. So here's what he said in remarks earlier today.

General Assembly, of whether the U.S. and Iran will be talking this week.The administration has said in no uncertain terms, absolutely not, noting that any diplomatic discussions would continue to be held through intermediaries like Qatar and like Oman, with the administration giving particular thanks to the sultan of Oman for his role in some of these talks. Now, of course, the deal is not without its criticism. The fact that there are $6 billion in funds that will be freed up from overseas bank accounts for Iran have drawn the criticism of GOP presidential candidates, like former Vice President Mike Pence, who has said that this will allow Iran to foment terrorism. But senior administration officials have said that they believe that there are enforcement mechanisms in place and that the risk of diversion for Iran to be using those funds for anything other than humanitarian purposes is low. But they are continuing to keep a very hard line on the country, even as they acknowledge that this deal done through humanitarian challenges is a big win for diplomacy.",

He had tried to submit a declaration of what his role was at the Justice Department for Donald Trump after the election, and that was not accepted by the judge. That's a bad sign for Jeffrey Clark, because it was on him and his team to prove that what he was doing for Donald Trump after the election, wanting the Justice Department to send a draft letter to the state of Georgia that prosecutors say had factual inconsistencies in it and was totally outside of his authority. He was going to have to prove that that was something that was in his responsibilities as the acting head of the civil division at this time.He doesn't have that sort of evidence that he's able to submit now. And so instead we heard from Jody Hunt, someone who had served in that role in the Trump administration before, who testified that, no, this wasn't part of his job to talk about the oversight of the election and to even work with the President. And one really interesting thing that came up in this hearing is that Clark's attorney, Harry MacDougald, he argued that not even an iota of Jeffrey Clark's actions would be possible if he wasn't a federal official. And moreover, not just that he was a federal official, but that Donald Trump was directing to do - him to do the things he was doing after the election and gave him authority at the Justice Department. That too, Boris, did not result in any evidence coming into court today. So we're now just going to have to wait and see what the judge does with what was argued today.",

And it's not an easy task to try and recover these bodies. We have been speaking to rescue teams here on the ground in the city. You have had teams that have been working on these different sites that really look like bomb sites, the aftermath of an earthquake, as you have seen in these pictures. And you've got these search-and-rescue teams, some international teams, nowhere near enough to deal with a disaster on this scale. And you also have Libyan volunteers using everything from their bare hands to shovels trying to go through the muddy rubble of these homes to try and find bodies. But what officials are telling us, Brianna, is that the majority of these bodies, the thousands, have ended up in the Mediterranean when that ferocious flood washed their homes, their cars into the sea. And the rescue teams, the international teams that we have been speaking to say it is such a challenging task for them that this is something they have never dealt with before. They say that there were - they believe there are thousands of bodies in the sea, but they have not had enough manpower, enough equipment to deal with the - with a recovery effort on this scale. And it is very difficult to navigate the waters around the shores here of Derna. They tell (inaudible) one team said that they did spot 300 bodies just a few days ago, but they were not able to recover them. And they say, right now, these bodies are disintegrated remains that they won't be able to recover. So you can imagine how devastating this is for the families who just want those bodies to bury, just a final farewell for their loved ones that they might not be able to get right now. And what we're seeing tonight as well is that grief, that shock turning into anger as well. We've seen hundreds of Derna residents protesting in the heart of the city in one of the most devastated neighborhoods there. That's the Derna valley, where you saw those floods over a week ago. They are demanding accountability. They are saying they want officials held accountable for what happened, because they say this is not just a natural disaster. This was compounded by years of negligence, neglect, corruption and mismanagement. And they want officials held accountable for what happened. So we certainly are beginning to see the anger.
