Massive protests and a general labor strike brought thousands back to the streets demanding a deal to bring Israeli hostages home from Gaza. In an extraordinary press conference, Mr. Netanyahu spoke directly to hostage families while defending his controversial approach to the war in Gaza.

And when he says that he is going to essentially doubled down and go after Hamas and has doubled down on his negotiating position, which is hurdle too far for Hamas as well, all of that, I think people are going to read as no change and therefore expect no change in the outcome which pushes all of those people who have been on the streets protesting and the unions that wanted to go on strike that are now barred by law from going on strike. I don't think it is going to change their desire to still get the hostages home. I just think it is going to reinforce their belief that the prime minister is not the vehicle to do that, but I don't think people have really figured out a way. forward other than doing what they are doing, the prime minister is doing what he is doing. It sounds like an oversimplification. Doesn't it? But that's a sort of stalled point everything is at and really the prime minister, I think was emphasizing where he believes he is right and why he is right and why he has been right historically, which just shows the depth of his intransigence, if you will, and the length that he won't go to, to make the deal happy that the majority of people want that therefore what else is there for people to do except go out and protest.",

They have a lot to lose if, if they are not in government with Prime Minister Netanyahu because they are very likely to be in government again, and under Netanyahu, they are able to advance their projects like expanding settlements and these sorts of things. So they are standing with the prime minister. They have nowhere else to stand, indeed they are probably part of what props him up in his position, although the prime minister was quoting his position back when Israel was pulling its troops out of Gaza back in the early notice 2003, 2004, 2005. He was talking about what he told the prime minister then, Ariel Sharon, that he thought that the troops should, Israeli troops at that time, shouldn't pull out of that border area between Gaza and Egypt because then that would be used as a route to get weapons through. So, what he is telling us is that over the past 20 years, he has been saying this, so he is not likely to change it and his supporters are backing him up on that because that's the way they get the policies through they want through this particular government.",
