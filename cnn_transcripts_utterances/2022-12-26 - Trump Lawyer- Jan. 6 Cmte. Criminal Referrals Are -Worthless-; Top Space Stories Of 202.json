Trump's lawyer, you know, dismissing the criminal referrals from the January 6th Committee as worthless and political noise. Do you have any read on how the Special Counsel will or won't act on those referrals, which we know are symbolic in nature?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's the key point right there that you just said, Amara, that these are more symbolic, more political that carry any actual legal weight. The Special Counsel, Jack Smith, will do what he deems as appropriate with the evidence that's collected. But that's another point here. What the January 6th Committee has done, which could be very valuable for the Special Counsel is their 18 months of collecting thousands upon thousands, actually, I believe, more than a million pages of records of interviews, of evidence that then the Special Counsel could use to inform his decisions on his legal thinking. The other thing is, you know, lawyers of Special Counsel, they may not want to have the perception that they're being led by a political body such as a Congressional Committee. So does that lessen the chances of potential charges against Donald Trump? These are all things that we're watching. But in terms of an actual legal weight, the referrals don't carry much, but symbolically, they surely do.",

I mean, for some of these specific candidates, like Kari Lake herself, I mean, this is not serving as a deterrent. We already saw her talking with the judge ruling against her, her saying she's going to appeal it. She's really trying to stay, you know, as the face of election denialism.So there definitely is still some push from within the party to keep this at the forefront.

And, you know, of all the controversies that the former President had caused during his presidential campaign, certainly his time in office, you know, what could be the turning point for many in the Republican Party is that he is a proven loser in a lot of these election results.Obviously, he lost the election in 2020 and he had huge influence in the Republicans doing not as well as they thought they would in 2022. Now, do they want to hang their hats on someone who has had this kind of track record in 2024 and you do see many in the party shifting away from that, looking for new voices. And I think it's not just perhaps the Larry Hogans or the Mitt Romneys of the world who are pushing for a new voice. And it's others in the party that are looking for perhaps a way -- new way forward in 2024. Obviously, we talk a lot about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, but this could be a pretty big field, so a lot to see, a lot of calculations that Republicans will have to make and a lot could change in the coming months.",
