Just ahead civilians told to flee as Israel strikes what it says are Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon. We are live in Jerusalem and Beirut for the very latest.Plus, new polls show signs of strength for Donald Trump in the race for the White House as a campaign spar over the next presidential debate. And deadly floods strike Japan, in a region already struggling to recover from earthquakes, we're going to have a live report from Tokyo. We begin this hour in Kazakhstan, where a Russian Soyuz Spacecraft has just touched down just moments ago. You're looking at the craft touching down now with the parachute deployed about three and a half hours ago, the capsule left separated from the International Space Station. Two Russian cosmonauts and one American astronaut are on board. You heard them say, touchdown right on the money. NASA's Tracy Dyson has been in space for 184 days and traveled 78 million miles. It was her fourth mission aboard the ISS serving as flight engineer this time. We have a live report on the Soyuz mission and its spectacular return home. We'll have that coming up a bit later in the show. Meantime, Lebanon's caretaker -- Caretaker Prime Minister is urging the United Nations and what he called influential countries to deter Israel as it dramatically steps up its air campaign against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon moving the region closer to an all-out war. At least 100 people have been killed Monday, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, this follows the weekend that saw Israel and Hezbollah exchange their most intense fire since the war in Gaza began nearly a year ago. Residents of southern Lebanon are fleeing after getting phone messages from Israel telling them to evacuate immediately. You can see all the traffic backed up on the roads. This is the first time Israel has issued such warnings. The Lebanese Minister of Information calls it psychological warfare. Israel's Prime Minister says no country can tolerate rocket attacks on its citizens. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But at the moment, whatever the IDF's next move is, they're not making that public. They certainly have a lot of capability in their air force to continue these strikes. But what they want to see is for Hezbollah to pull back from the border area, and they said that if there isn't a diplomatic solution, then they'll use a military solution, and the only way to achieve that would be through ground forces. I think if we study the pattern of strikes and look for those that are close to the border, that might be indicative that they could be a ground operation shaping up, but at the moment, there's nothing official from his from the IDF about that.",

They are still able to fire their rockets and drones inside Israel, so they still have a capability despite the intense strikes we've seen over the last few days and particularly today.And it's important to point out that Hezbollah until now, since October 8, when it started firing on Israel, has yet to use its heaviest missiles, its long-range missiles, which are precise, and they have held those in reserve. Now the question is, if Hezbollah, after the crippling attacks that Israel conducted on the group over the last six days. If it really feels it's in a corner, it will unleash those heavier weapons, which have the ability, some of them, to reach the furthest south point of Israel, which is the city of Elat. Now, I'm not saying that that's going to happen, but they have that capability, and they always hold that in reserve in the event they feel that they are facing an existential threat.

I know that the Trump campaign does as well, that they see Pennsylvania as vital to his chances in November.We're going to see a lot of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania between now and Election Day. Later this week, he goes to Georgia as well as Michigan. Really trying to hit the states that they recognize they need to shore support up. Now I will actually note that talking with campaign advisers today, they are feeling very confident about the recent polling that came out from \"The New York Times\" and Siena College Poll, which showed that Donald Trump is doing really well in the Sun Belt State. It showed that he has a lead in Arizona and Georgia, two states he won in 2016 but lost to Joe Biden in 2020 as well as slim lead in North Carolina. [08:15:00] But again, it's a confidence boosting poll for the Trump campaign, because right now -- you know they are still trying to make that push for the blue wall states in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But as always, the South -- the Sun Belt states are -- you know an insurance policy. And so, they're feeling good about that today. But look, I think one thing to keep in mind with Donald Trump right now, and as we have this discussion around whether he will debate or not debate. You never really know. I know that as of now, Donald Trump himself and his team does not want to have another debate. They do not want him to get back up there, particularly just days before election day. But that can always change. I know there's a lot of people in Donald Trump's ear as well, particularly his allies, people like Senator Lindsey Graham, who are saying you should give it another chance. This is a good opportunity to really make the case and contrast your vision for America with that of Kamala Harris. However, obviously we saw how the that first debate went with Kamala Harris with ABC News earlier this month. There are some reasons to believe that that is why he is not agreeing to get back on the debate stage with her.",

What are campaign officials saying about her priorities this week?EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Amara, key to the strategy this week is continuing to talk about how restrictive abortion bans are impacting women. This is part of a larger push of having women really tell their own stories. We've seen this a little bit on the reproductive rights bus tour that the campaign has employed, and new this morning, the campaign rolling out an ad across the country that features a woman by the name of Yesina of Tucson, who details her fear of the implications of a military move and what that could mean for her ability to grow their family. They're putting this fight over IVF front and center, but the Harris team recognizes that while she's gaining in national polls, the former president holds a slight advantage in some of these key states that will decide the election. So that's why she's returning to Pennsylvania and campaigning out west in the coming days. And then needling the former president, goading him essentially into participating in an additional debate, because the campaign feels as though that was one of the strongest moments of her brief campaign, showing that contrast, that seriousness and message discipline, and they're eager for the opportunity to do it again.",

Really a great dream of hers to go up here and work in space. She's done it several times now. As you mentioned, the number of times she was up there, the distance she traveled, pretty remarkable.What she was doing while she was there. She did some research into stem cell studies. She did some 3D printing of tissue that would be used, for example, in heart repairs, things like that. Operated robots on Earth from space, did experiments in fire safety in microgravity. The thing is, they have to do all sorts of things. And very, very experienced in handling of tools.

The strikes appear to be the widest in geographic range since the war began nearly one year ago, and they come after Israel and Hezbollah exchanged their most intensive fire of the conflict over the weekend.Lebanon's Health Ministry says at least 100 people were killed and more than 400 others wounded in Monday's air strikes. That includes women and children according to local media. Civilians there are now fleeing areas of Southern Lebanon, while others are leaving Beirut's southern suburbs and classes in public and private schools have been suspended in several regions.

HELLYAR, MIDDLE EAST STUDIES SCHOLAR, CAMEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: Thank you for having me on your program. So, the quote, unquote evacuation orders are part of Israel's strategy to psychologically engage with the people of Lebanon in quite a mass fashion. So, the entirety of that southern part of the country has already been defined by Israel as a war zone, and the framing of Southern Lebanon as such is meant to give Israel the opportunity to then strike it without any regard for Lebanese sovereignty. So, they're not -- they're not evacuation orders. They're framing Southern Lebanon, in totality, as a quote, unquote legitimate target. Of course, it's not a legitimate target, but that's the point behind these sorts of messages and displacing the people of Southern Lebanon, further to the north, as leverage, frankly, vis a vis Hezbollah.",

History is a good teacher in this regard, but that doesn't obviate the possibility that they might try to do something like that going forward. On the contrary, quite a few numbers of troops have been freed up from the campaign in Gaza. They are freed up, I think, for heading towards the north. So, it would not surprise me if we saw more ground activity, even though the military establishment Israel, I think, is somewhat split on this point. But not split in terms of like 10 to 90, but something far more 50, 50 in terms of how much further they want to go. In the meantime, I think we're likely a lot of strikes, a huge displacement of Lebanese, even more, by the way, than what we've seen in the past. Keeping in mind, people have been talking a lot about how the north of Israel citizens aren't able to live there. There have been scores thousands of Lebanese that have also not been able to go back to their homes in the south as a result of the unending Israeli fire on the south of Lebanon.

I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job. This letter, according to prosecutors, was delivered by Routh to a civilian witness who only opened a box of other evidence that contained this letter after the September incident at Donald Trump's golf course, and then subsequently contacted law enforcement. This is a really interesting new piece of evidence that we did not know about before, because it speaks to Ryan Routh's intent, right? And as of now, Ryan Routh only faces those two, gun charges. One's possession of a firearm while being a convicted felon, and the other is possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. They've still not brought any charges related to an attempted assassination, and that's the case that investigators have continued to try to build, as Ryan Routh has remained behind bars since his arrest at Donald Trump's golf course about a week ago now. And so, this is really an indicator that they have gained some traction in trying to build that case to make those more complicated and more severe charges potentially stick. Now we're going to wait and see if they ultimately do bring any additional charges that something we know prosecutors are actively weighing even ahead of today's attention hearing. But today they will just simply probably argue that Ryan Routh needs to remain behind bars because he's both a flight risk and a danger to the community, but this memo does give us some insight into the broader case they're trying to build.",

You know this.Whatever the new poll is people say, oh, this must be the one. This must be the best. Just yesterday, yesterday, two well respected networks, NBC and CBS, released separate polls, both showing Kamala Harris nationally leading by four to five percentage points. I guarantee you she's not behind that much in Arizona, if she's leading nationally anywhere close to what they have. The Arizona case, I'm glad you pointed it out, because it is particularly unbelievable. They had Harris up by five before the debate, and then the debate which Harris won overwhelmingly, and even the Trump campaign admits Harris won the debate overwhelmingly. Supposedly, Trump is now up five. That's a 10-point shift for no particular reason. Now, who believes that when a poll strikes at the essence of reason, disregard it. There'll be another poll tomorrow. There'll be another 10 polls by next weekend.",
