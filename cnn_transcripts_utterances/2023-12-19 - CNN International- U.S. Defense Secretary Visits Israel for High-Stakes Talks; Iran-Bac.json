Austin sat down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's Defense Minister to discuss current operations as the U.S. puts pressure on Israel to transition to a more targeted campaign in Gaza to reduce civilian casualties. The U.S. Defense Chief says he discussed pathways towards a future for Gaza after Hamas and the protection of civilians in Gaza during his meetings. The Pentagon Chief is also taking up Houthi rebels on Red Sea shipping, which he says must stop, and he's urging other countries to publicly condemn the Houthi aggression. Right now, Lloyd Austin is attending a Red Sea security summit in Bahrain, which is one of the countries taking part in a new U.S.-led initiative to keep this key waterway safe. Houthi forces, who have sided with Hamas, took responsibility for attacks Monday on two commercial vessels that they claim are linked to Israel.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: All countries have the right to move freely and lawfully in international waters. But that foundational global right is under new threat today from the totally unacceptable attacks on merchant vessels by the Houthis in Yemen. That's endangering our common prosperity and the lives of innocent mariners. And these reckless Houthi attacks are a serious international problem and they demand a firm international response.

But then they are also stepping up efforts to try to get Israel to, one, do more to protect civilians, and two, to try to transition to the next phase of the conflict, which would be more sort of hyper-localized. They've called it more targeted, less presumably destructive towards civilians, while at the same time trying to prevent a wider war.And if you do send joint international patrols to the Red Sea, that is also delicate. You know, there is a risk that you could open up another front. So, again, another fine line they have to tread there.",

And he rejected key points of the Trump team's defense, saying the disclaimers on financial statements do not protect him from liability. Oral arguments are scheduled for next month. The attorney general's office is seeking more than $250 million for Trump and his adult sons to be banned from doing business in New York. The U.S. Appeals Court has rejected Mark Meadows' bid to have his election subversion case moved from Georgia to federal court. The former Trump White House chief of staff is accused of violating Georgia's racketeering law as part of a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results. Meadows has pleaded not guilty. The Appeals Court rejected his argument that the case should be moved since it was carrying out his official duties in the Trump White House. Two U.S. election workers from Georgia are suing Rudy Giuliani again. They say the former New York mayor and one-time attorney to Donald Trump is still spreading lies that they engaged in election fraud in 2020. Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss just won a nearly $200, I'm sorry, $150 million verdict against Giuliani for defamation on Friday. Now, in a new lawsuit, they're asking for a permanent injunction to stop him from making false claims, which he's continued to do. An adviser to Giuliani declined to comment on the issue. A spectacular volcano erupting in southwest Iceland after weeks of seismic activity, a crack of about 3.5 kilometers has opened up along the Earth's surface, releasing fountains of lava into the air. 4,000 nearby residents were evacuated last month.

And so, it did.That small village fishing town of Grindavik had been evacuated overnight already since last month. Now it is the entire town that's been evacuated, some 4,000 people waiting to see when they'll be allowed home. The good news is, though, although we've been hearing that that crack that you mentioned, which was growing, in fact, from that 3.5 kilometers to nearly 4 kilometers overnight, was continuing to expand. It does seem now that the lava flows are changing direction towards the north and east and therefore away from the town of Grindavik. That had been one of the big fears, that it might see some substantial damage, although those fears now seem to be allayed. It is instead the fear of toxic gases and the impact they might have on residents nearby or on the nearby region that are now the real issue, with authorities warning people not to try and get anywhere near this very impressive volcanic activity. You can see on the images just how impressive it is. It was about 10 p.m. last night that the first explosions happened, with that lava beginning to flow out, really many hundreds of cubic meters of it flowing out overnight. Now, we've seen over the course of the last few hours people trying to make their way to it. Of course, people are always attracted to try and get a closer look at these things. But it is those toxic fumes that authorities are warning about. For now, Max, it doesn't appear that we're going to see anything like the sort of chaos that we saw back in 2010. You'll remember, for those of us who are old enough to, the 100,000 flights that have been cancelled worldwide, the two million travelers who'd been impacted by this, we're not expected to see anything like that. In fact, for the time being, despite those very impressive images and the proximity of Reykjavik, there has been no fallout to principal infrastructure, and notably to flights either in Iceland or elsewhere, Max. But a close eye being kept on the lava flows and, again, those toxic fumes and where they head next -- Max.",
