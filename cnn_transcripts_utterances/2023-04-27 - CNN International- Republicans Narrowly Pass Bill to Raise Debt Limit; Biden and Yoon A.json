They looked at handbags, hats, and then made their way to the lingerie department on the sixth floor. She testified they teased each other about a bodysuit before theencounter turned violent. Carroll testified that Trump shoved her against the wall of the dressing room, shut the door, pulled down her tights and raped her. Soon after Carroll said she confided in two close friends. Both of them expected to testify at the trial. And one warned her not to go public because Trump, then a New York real estate tycoon and fixer of the tabloids would bury her. Carroll testified that she hasn't had a romantic relationship since the alleged assault because of flirtatious behavior landed her in serious trouble. Carroll told the jury, I'm not settling a political score, I'm settling a personal score. Because she called me a liar repeatedly and it really has decimated my reputation. Carroll testified she was fired from her job. Receive threatening emails and bought bullets for a gun that she owned. Fighting back tears, Carroll said she regretted going public about the alleged assault 100 times. But being able to get her day in court, she said, is everything to me. Carroll is expected to continue her testimony for about an hour, Thursday. Then Trump's attorneys will get a chance to cross examine her. They say the alleged rape never happened.
