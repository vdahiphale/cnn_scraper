And that means harsher consequences for those entering the country illegally. Thousands of migrants seeking asylum made their way to the southern border ahead of the deadline.Authorities have detained a record number of migrants in the past few days. While things appear quiet at crossings right now, one official tells CNN it will get worse. The head of U.S. Homeland Security gave this warning to those seeking to enter the country illegally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: If anyone arrives at our southern border after midnight tonight, they will be presumed ineligible for asylum and subject to steeper consequences for unlawful entry. I want to be very clear. Our borders are not open. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER: And a little while ago, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it will comply with a federal court ruling that temporarily blocks the release of migrants from border patrol without court notices. It calls the ruling harmful and would result in unsafe overcrowding of their facilities. The ruling expires in 14 days and the Biden administration is expected to appeal. CNN's Senior National Correspondent Ed Lavandera has the latest from El Paso, Texas. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The public health policy known as Title 42 has been lifted. It had been in place since March of 2020 during the Trump administration, and it essentially became a de facto immigration policy, even though that's never what Title 42 was intended to do. But, nevertheless, it has been kept in place and kept out about three million migrants from requesting asylum since that time. So now the question becomes what will the U.S. southern border look like now that this has been lifted and what is the future of migration here along the southern border? The U.S. Border Patrol Chief says that he no longer expects this massive rush of people, which at some point the Biden administration was estimating would be anywhere from 15,000 to 18,000 people per day. The U.S. Border Patrol Chief says they've already started seeing in the days leading up to this point a larger influx of migrants. So he thinks that it is not going to be as dramatic as what had been anticipated. And you know, now for migrants requesting asylum, it's become a much more traditional but difficult process. Now that Title 42 is gone, there are stricter penalties in place that can threaten the migrants' ability to immigrate into the United States. So this really does change the dynamic on the ground here. And one of the things to look for will be the number of people trying to evade arrest by U.S. Border Patrol officials here on the ground. We're also starting to see an uptick in the number of people crossing in areas away from city centers where there is a heavily-fortified border wall and that sort of thing. So the question becomes how many more people will be trying to evade arrest and get away from Border Patrol agents here on the ground and continue to enter the country illegally. But you know right now you know we're getting kind of like mixed signals if you will as to what exactly is going to happen here in the days ahead. Many border communities bracing for the worst. But it's a question of just how intense will this influx of migrants be, we just don't have a clear picture yet on this situation. Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now originally, the Big Four, that would be President Joe Biden, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were all supposed to meet again on Friday. That meeting between the Big Four has been postponed.We're told that one of the attendees had a funeral to go to and also that the staff level was making progress. They felt like that was a better way to go in a better use of time for the staff to again meet on Friday instead of the Big Four. And then again, the Big Four would meet next week and hopefully try to make some progress. Now, we also heard from some House Republicans on Thursday, who talked a little bit about the contours of the negotiations that may be taking shape, where Democrats and Republicans may be able to negotiate to find a deal. And there were four core areas. They were permitting reform, unspent Covid funds, work requirements, and spending caps. That's what we were told by some House GOP members who were in the room. And we were also told by Garret Graves, a House GOP member, he called it negotiations. He said that they can call it whatever they want, but that's what's happening right now. Dusty Johnson adding that the last 48 hours has given him some hope that potentially they can get to a deal. But again, just to underscore, they're still pretty far apart. But the fact that they're at least having these meetings is a step in the direction toward a deal. Jessica Dean, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So what we're seeing right now is the Islamabad High Court compound, where there are hundreds of riot police, traffic police, regular police, as well as paramilitary troops with a little bit of the media that's positioned outside. There's a strict ban on people gathering within the Capitol, let aloneoutside the court. There has been a call for people coming in to peacefully gather, but they've been prevented. Many roads are blocked around the capital. There has been this fear of clashes because of what we've seen over the past couple of days. We don't know what's going to happen after this court appearance. Imran Khan appeared before the Supreme Court yesterday, and the Supreme Court had said that Imran Khan's detention was illegal, but had still kept Khan in protective custody and made him spend the night at a police guest house of the Supreme Court. So he's filing a petition against the corruption charges that led to his arrest, a bail petition, so potentially he could be released and then we'll have to see what he does. Will he call for his supporters to calm down, to stand down? Will he condemn the violence that has taken place over the past couple of days? Pakistan's Prime Minister, a couple of nights ago right after Khan's arrest and in the midst of all these protests called his supporters terrorist. Pakistan's military, after various military installations where attacks said that they will not have a zero- tolerance policy for any sort of violence that will take place in the country. The military has been called in to make sure that the law and order situation is calm, but that does set the scene for potential clashes of Khan supporters, not just with the police, but with the military too. So we're hoping that the situation calms down, that all of the people involved call for calm and peace, but while that's happening, majority of the senior leadership of Imran Khan's party has been apprehended and is currently in police custody. It's an election year. Pakistan's economy is in the doldrums and we'll just have to see what happens after this court appearance and what decision the judges make. Kim?",

The U.S. Ambassador to South Africa talking to local media saying that this ship, the Lady R, which docked in Simonstown, a naval port in South Africa near Cape Town, was there to receive arms and ammunition from South Africa that would end up in Russia during this bloody war on Ukraine.Now, that ship was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in May of last year, that already brings problems regardless of the specificity of that allegation. And it was a deeply suspicious moment when that cargo ship arrived in South Africa. It turned off its transponders for several days according to ship -- ship trackers. It then off loaded and unloaded goods in the dead of the night, according to eyewitnesses and opposition members of parliament. And it added to the ongoing speculation that those South Africa claims it is neutral in this war in Ukraine, that perhaps they are less than neutral. And I think it is the bubbling frustration of the U.S. government that spilled out with the ambassador making these claims. Now, a short time ago, I was on the phone with the opposition member of parliament who first brought up these suspicions over the ship. He said there could be legal avenues in South Africa. He also said, in his view at least, it is an indication that the ruling party and the government may be placing themselves ahead of the interests of South Africa. Of course, South Africa has a much larger trade relationship with the U.S. and with the U.K. and Europe. For their part, Kim, the South Africans are saying that there is no evidence yet presented of this, that they were already in discussions about this with the Americans behind the scenes.

Papers were signed, a total of $25,000 was given to Van Der Sloot, and Holloway's attorney flew to Aruba. Van Der Sloot took the attorney to a house saying her body was buried within the foundation. Soon after fleeing to Peru with the $25,000, he emailed the Holloway saying quote, he had lied about the location of Natalee's remains. Extortion charges were filed a short time later. In May 2005, the 18-year old Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub in Aruba with Van Der Sloot and two other men. All three were charged by Aruban prosecutors in 2007 for involvement in manslaughter, but a judge ordered their release, citing a lack of direct evidence. Her body was never found. Beth Holloway said in a statement, she would be 36 years old now. It has been a very long and painful journey, but the persistence of many is going to pay off. Together, we are finally getting justice for Natalee. After the U.S. legal proceedings conclude, Van Der Sloot will be sent back to Peru according to a statement from Peru's judiciary to a Peruvian prison where he is serving time for the murder of 21-year old Stephanie Flores. She was murdered five years after Holloway's disappearance. CNN was allowed exclusive access to Van Der Sloot's cell shortly after his arrest, and in 2012, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison for that murder.
