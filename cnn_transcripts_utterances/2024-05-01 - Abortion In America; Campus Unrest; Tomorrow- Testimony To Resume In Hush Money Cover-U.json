Why haven't you heard more from the President of the United States about all the stuff going on campuses right now? Well, the White House Press Secretary was asked exactly that, not long ago, hear her response coming up. Plus, music legend Jon Bon Jovi here on \"The Lead\" telling us about a serious health issue he had that almost ended his career. Plus, the big new project he has out now.And leading this hour, breaking news moments ago, the Arizona State Senate voted to repeal that state's Civil War era abortion ban, a law that was first introduced in 1864 before women had the right to vote, and when the age of consent in Arizona, according to some historians, was 10. The law bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy except to save the life of the mother. Let's get straight to CNN, Natasha Chen. So, Natasha, what happens next and what does this mean for the ability to get an abortion in Arizona?",

And what we're expecting now is for the House to receive what the Senate just repealed and send it on to the governor's desk where she is expected to sign it. But the repeal wouldn't take effect until 90 days after the legislative session ends. So right now, the earliest this could go into effect is June 27th. The attorney general of Arizona has, however, asked for a stay while her office considers whether to ask the US Supreme Court to review this ruling.So for right now, Arizonans just need to know that the 15 week ban is in effect in their state. And there was a lot of heated debate on the Senate floor today in Arizona. The sound bites you're going to hear our Republican Anthony Kern, who is -- and was actually indicted last week as one of the so-called fake electors, followed by a Democratic Senator Eva Burch who has been very open about her miscarriage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTHONY KERN (R), ARIZONA STATE SENATE: I am just very sad that our Republican Party can't come together on this, and can't work something out. We're pushing this bill through, because we think it's going to win the next election, when I believe just the opposite. EVA BURCH (D) ARIZONA STATE SENATE: I'm not afraid of the abortions that I had, and do not fear for my soul.

Madam Mayor, thanks for joining us.So as of today, patients in Florida may now have to travel as far away as North Carolina, I think that's the closest state where abortion access is legal, to seek an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. I know that a lot of women don't even know they're pregnant until after six weeks. What do you recommend that women and girls in your community who are pregnant do in this case, if they want to get an abortion? What resources are available for them? DONNA DEEGAN (D), JACKSONVILLE MAYOR: Well, I think you just heard a lot of that in the story that you just presented. I mean, at this point, unfortunately, we have to give them other options to go to other states. In the state of Florida, we take our right to privacy very seriously. It's actually written into our Constitution. And I believe that the preponderance of people in this state, especially women, are very concerned about having this government intrusion into their lives. But at this point, they'll have to go elsewhere. In September, you mentioned that you had a good relationship with Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis in part because you worked in television news with his wife, Casey.

So voters will have the opportunity to make their voices heard. You know, for me, someone who has fought for women's health for a very, very long time.

The American policy right now under President Biden's leadership is to fully support Israel monetarily, politically, from a policy perspective. And so, that really says it all. I think when he is prepared to speak what she will do so next week, and he gives remarks that really elevate everyone's humanity, I think that that really leaves him in the best position to not sort of just speak reflexively, which is cost him some political trouble in the past, but really speak in a way that recognizes the widespread suffering. And there are campuses where they have figured out how to have conversations how to deescalate, and that's been the priority, rather than looking at protests on foreign policy issues, whether it be Vietnam or Iraq War, and now more in Palestine, that you get -- this is like 1,600 people have been arrested, but we've had multiple, multiple campuses where faculty and the academics and the institutions have been responsive.
