But then the Fourth of July festivities will begin a little bit later today. The couple will be hosting a barbecue for military families around 5And then there's the big events in the evening when they gather thousands of military families, veterans survivors all on the South Lawn of the White House to watch those fireworks over Washington, D.C. There's also going to be a host of musical performances including the Brothers Osborne as well as Neo. And this really follows a tradition that we've seen from the Biden's since they've taken office, inviting these military families to the White House for Independence Day. Something that presidents before him have also done. And I can tell you, they've been grilling hamburgers here at the White House since yesterday. You can smell the sense of them as you walk around the White House ground. But this evening, they are going to take some time to thank those members of the military, their families for their service to their country. And the President is also expected to deliver Independence Day remarks before those fireworks start. One of the best views in Washington as the fireworks go over of the nation's capital.",

This all comes at a very tense moment and relations between the US and China. But one thing that the administration and the Treasury Secretary have tried to make clear is that they feel the need to ensure that they are working towards this economic competition with China as the two economies of these global superpowers are deeply intertwined. Of course, there has been tension in the U.S.-China relations due to that Chinese spy balloon that had been flying over the United States. Also President Biden recently likening Chinese President Xi Jinping to a dictator. But the Treasury Secretary's focus in the coming days will be meeting with economic officials on the Chinese side, as well as some American firms there while she's on the ground in Beijing.",

And number one, there have been third party and multiple party candidates on the ballot. It's always a Republican or Democrat in modern history, who's been elected president in America. So when you talk about third party candidates, they usually benefit either the Republican or the Democrat. You know, we saw Ross Perot being a spoiler on the other side. So when you think about 70 percent of Americans might say, I don't like Trump or Biden, but that doesn't mean that 70 percent won't vote for either Trump or Biden, if it comes down to a general election. And those are the two candidates on the ballot. It would be very hard. No Labels, I think, also, just logistically, they don't talk about who their donors are. They're not public, they don't have a candidate. So they're running this No Labels campaign without a name attached. So people really know what's at stake.",

The first was a ban on anyone who's not a U.S. citizen from handling or collecting voter registration applications slapping a $50,000 fines against groups for each non-citizen who does that.The second part would make it a felony for these voter registration group workers to retain any personal information from voters. Now, look, the groups who are fighting the law said that this makes it even more difficult for them to do, get out to vote and registration efforts, especially in marginalized communities. But Republicans, especially those who wrote the bill say, it's just about election security. Well, Judge Walker disagreed, saying the state did not prove its case. And in that blistering ruling had passages like this one, quote, \"Florida may, of course, regulate elections, including the voter registration process. Here, however, the challenge provisions exemplify something Florida has struggled with in recent years, namely, governing within the bounds set by the United States Constitution. When state government power threatens to spread beyond constitutional bounds and reduce individual rights to ashes, the Federal Judiciary stands as a firewall. The Free State of Florida is simply not free to exceed the bounds of the United States Constitution\". Now that last bit there could be a dig at Governor Ron DeSantis, and his off use Free State of Florida phrase. We have reached out to the governor's office about this. Dana, we don't know what they're going to do. But I can tell you that in the past, the state does have a pattern of appealing Judge Walker's rulings. The Court of Appeals did overturn a ruling by Judge Walker on the 2021 election overhaul bill that Florida passed dealing with drop boxes.",
