So they're really continuing to go after ISIS here in the region because they say ISIS has continued to plot terror attacks against the U.S. homeland.But also it's important to note that often, and this happens, the U.S. will conduct airstrikes against militants, saying that they are militants when in fact they accidentally kill civilians. And that happened just last year in May of 2023 when U.S. Central Command said that it was targeting getting an Al-Qaeda operative, and, in fact, they ended up killing a farmer in Syria. And of course, we all remember that botched drone strike in Kabul in 2021 when the U.S. was withdrawing and said they were targeting ISIS operatives there when, in fact, they killed a family of 10 civilians. And so while ISIS does -- while the U.S. does say it's going after these ISIS militants, these Al-Qaeda operatives, it is always important to ask the question of how they can be short these are, in fact, Al-Qaeda and terrorist operatives and not civilians. In this case, they say there's no indication that civilians were harmed, Sara.",

First, it's the first debate between a sitting president and a former president. And it is the earliest ever general election debate. With the clock ticking, both President Biden and Donald Trump are strategizing on exactly what they'll say on that debate stage.Later today, President Biden traveling to Camp David where the White House says he's going over potential questions and preparing for personal attacks. And Trump insiders say he's been working with his vice presidential contenders and outside allies with preparations in overdrive. A new FOX News poll coming out this morning shows President Biden with a two-point edge over Donald Trump. That's well within, of course, the margin of error, but a change from May. We've got team coverage this morning. CNN's Arlette Saenz and Steve Contorno joining us this morning. Arlette, we're going to begin with you. What is the president doing to prepare for this crucial, and most early, first debate?",

He goes to Philadelphia on Saturday to hold a rally. Nor is he holding mock debate sessions like Biden or like he has done in the past. Instead, he has been having these informal prep sessions with some close advisors, including some of the people he is considering to be his running mate. Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, for example, Senator Marco Rubio. He has been meeting with his campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, as well as people who have advised them in the past, Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, Richard Grenell.And they have been preparing the former president on a bunch of issues they expect to come up at this first debate -- crime, immigration, the border, abortion, and as well as preparing them to answer questions about -- some of the attacks that they expect from President Biden on issues like January 6th and some of these criminal convictions over the past few weeks. And Trump, interestingly, has been sort of leveling expectations heading into this debate. Listen to what he said in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.

And so we received a briefing alongside New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and met with the new critical incident management team. And right now, the most important thing is preventing the loss of life. What we've seen is that a lot of folks are reluctant to leave their homes. There will be loss of property, that is no question. But what we want to prevent is the loss of life. Now, conditions here are very uncertain. Wind patterns continue to change. And we're unsure about the direction of the fire at this point. What we are sure of is that people are suffering, but we are mobilizing quickly every resource possible, local, state, and federal, to make sure that people leave their homes and have the opportunity to save their lives, their livestock, and their pets.",

And so it is even more difficult for people to leave their homes, their historic homes that have been around for hundreds of years.And so my conversation yesterday with Tribal President Thora Padilla was that we should mobilize all local resources to ensure that the laws are being enforced, that people are checking on people's homes, to make them realize just how important it is. Now, I spoke to an 82-year-old veteran for Mescalero yesterday, who was at one of the shelters and community centers, and all he kept talking and about wanting to go back home and as he held back tears, he thought about the property he might be losing that he would be looking to pass down for future generations. But the most important thing right now is that law enforcement does their job and that we cooperate in an inter-agency way along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the state government, and my job is to make sure that we make sure that people take this seriously because this will be one of New Mexico's most devastating fires.",

There is a really good plan in place. In fact, donations have come in as far as Farmington, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, both for pet food, for hay.We have currently the facilities within the Mescalero Apache Reservation to be able to hold both people's domestic pets, livestock, and as far as the wildlife concern, look, there is going to be a loss of wildlife in the area, and this is an area that is rich in wildlife. Everything from bull elk to mule deer. But we have a large enough Lincoln National Forest that we do believe some of those animals will be migrating into much safer areas. Unfortunately, fire is something that we will have to continue to deal with. It is always been a constant here in New Mexico, but climate change is only exacerbating both the amount of fires that we have, the two largest actually just last year, the amounts of heat and the unpredictability as these fires continue to rage on. And so, it is going to continue to be an issue and it takes an immense amount of resources. That's why it is so important for agencies like FEMA to respond to these incidents quickly, to make sure to compensate and find housing for folks quickly. And frankly, the federal government has to do a much better job of responding to these fires. This is the new normal. We have to get used to it and Congress and the administration has to act as soon as we spot these fires and see the potential for the destruction that they can cause.",

That's what I've been focused on. We need to make sure that we get people back into good paying jobs, that we remind folks that the dollars that have been spent and are being spent and communities like Ruidoso, like Las Cruces or Albuquerque, New Mexico that are now creating jobs, that are putting welders back to work, pipe fitters back to work, carpenters back to work are jobs that we can count on in the future and that they are good paying jobs and that the American people are going to be protected going into the future and that they will have futures that their kids will have jobs, and that folks will be able to go to the grocery store and to the gas pump and be able to see some relief. That is what the next four years of this administration needs to look like, and I am focused strictly on my district. There are a lot of needs here, from agricultural reform in the farm bill that we've been working on today, to support changes for our military service airmen and women at places like Holloman Air Force Base. So we need to hear from the president that he is going to support rural districts, just like ours, in the meantime, I am going to continue to make sure that the bills that I have introduced pass Congress because without Congress, the president can't do much without executive action. [08:20:01]  And so Congress needs to do its job. We need to act. Folks need to stop complaining on both sides of the aisle and we need to come together in a bipartisan way and get the things done for the American people that they are expecting us to do.",

The procedure here is to get on the ground as quickly as possible. This issue really just coming to light now. It signals yet another possible issue with Boeing 737 Max line, a model that has been dogged by design and quality control issues. This stems from two incidents on Southwest Airlines flights where one of the plane's two engines was hit by a bird. In February, Boeing then warned Southwest and American Airlines about the issue, and in turn, those airlines warned their pilots and here is what the alert said: American airlines told its pilots, Boeing received two reports of CFM LEAP-1B engine failures following large bird strikes on takeoff and initial climb that could cause oil to burn. Southwest Airlines then told its pilot that that could cause the immediate presence of smoke and fumes entering the passenger cabin through the air conditioning system. Now company that makes the engine itself, CFM International, told me the engine has met bird ingestion certification requirements, performed as designed though the birds in these incidents were very large, much larger than is required to be given the blessing by regulators. Now, the Federal Aviation Administration says it is still working with Boeing on this investigation into these incidents and will determine if there any new actions that need to be taken. Remember here, that bird strikes are pretty common. Most of them occur in the early morning and sunset when birds are most active, 90 percent of them happen near airports, so that means takeoff and landing is the most risky time. The FAA recorded 17,000 bird strikes in 2022, although very few of them as serious as these two that prompted these alerts to pilots. John, there is a name for what is left over of the bird after there was a bird strike, it is called snarge and is often studied by researchers to make sure that they can better mitigate bird strikes and keep the danger to you on board airplanes down.",
