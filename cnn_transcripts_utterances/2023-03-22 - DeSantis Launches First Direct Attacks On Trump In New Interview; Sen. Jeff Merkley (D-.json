This is in a wide-ranging Fox Nation interview with Piers Morgan where DeSantis criticized Trump's character, his leadership style, the nicknames Trump has given to DeSantis. He also says that he is certain if he does run for the White House he can win.

And these two men have mostly been allies, as you said, but DeSantis drawing some sharp contrast with Trump.We saw him talk about how he ran a tight ship as governor versus the chaos of the Trump White House. He is presenting himself as a family man versus Trump who is in legal trouble for allegations that he made hush money -- hush money payments to an adult film star. And Morgan also asked him about Trump's propensity to mislead and the sort of untruths that we saw from Trump over the years. And DeSantis responded by saying, quote, \"Truth is essential. We have to agree that there's a certain reality to the world we live in. It's not your truth or my truth, it is the truth.\" Now I think there will be some Democrats in Florida and probably some people in the medical community as well who suggest DeSantis may not be the best arbiter of truth.

The recent stress of the banking system is placing huge pressure on what the Fed does today. Investors are largely pricing in a quarter- point -- 25 basis point hike and will listen to exactly how Chair Powell explains this decision. Let's talk about this and a lot more with Democratic Sen.

Officials on the ground say that two Russian missiles hit a residential high-rise building and this is in Zaporizhzhia. You can see the moment of impact blowing a hole in that building.Ukrainian President Zelenskyy posting this video to social media saying, quote, \"Russia is shelling the city with bestial savagery. Look at the flames coming out of there. They're hitting residential areas where ordinary people and children live and they're being fired at.\" That is the quote. CNN international correspondent Ivan Watson is live in Ukraine right now. Ivan, tell us what you're seeing. We understand that rescuers are conducting rescue and search operations and extinguishing the fire where this happened. This is just amazing to see.",

      "sentences": "Well and, you know, as you can see here in Eastern Ukraine it is a sunny kind of late-winter, early-spring day. And that's when at least two missiles, the Ukrainian authorities say, hit the city of Zaporizhzhia, hitting two nine-story apartment buildings.The information from on the ground is that the rescue workers are still working. They're still doing the search and rescue. So we have no information right now about the actual casualties there as they're still trying to put the fires out. But you can see from the video from the scene just the scale of the destruction. You can just imagine what a horror that must have been like for any residents who may have been in that building at that time. Now, this isn't the first time that Zaporizhzhia, which is probably 25 minutes drive from the front lines -- active front lines -- it's not the first time it's been hit by large Russian missiles -- that apartment buildings have been hit by them. But the Ukrainians are immediately calling this a war crime. Don, I think it's important to keep in mind this is one incident. The Ukrainians are saying that there were a number of drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities overnight, and apparently launched shortly after the Russian and Chinese leaders embraced each other and bid adieu to each other in Moscow after having declared that they want to create a more just, and peaceful, and democratic international order. Then there were several missiles launched by fighter planes, the Ukrainians say, at the southern port city of Odesa. That some of those missiles were shot down but at least one got through. Meanwhile, there were -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, I'm afraid, but more than a dozen Shahed drones -- those are manufactured by Iran and given to Russia as part of this military cooperation between Iran and Russia -- fired from north of Ukraine hitting one town in the Kyiv region about 50 miles out of the capital, killing at least four people. Some of those drones believed to have been shot down over the Zhytomyr region. Meanwhile, the Russians are saying that they shot down some kind of drones that apparently they're claiming were fired by Ukraine towards the Russian-occupied Crimean city of Sevastopol. All of this just gives you a sense of the air war that is underway. The civilians who are caught in the middle of it. The innocent bystanders of this savage conflict that Russia launched with its invasion more than a year ago, Don.",
