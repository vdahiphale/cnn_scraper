Well, this our Former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to depart New Jersey to appear in federal court tomorrow in Miami where he will face 37 felony counts related to his handling of classified documents after he left office. And the party is kicking off in Manchester right now as fans prepare to welcome home their European Champions Manchester City. Welcome to what is our second hour of \"Connect the World\". Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has passed away at the age of 86. Self- described as the Jesus Christ of politics his legacy is complicated to say the least. On the international stage, he tried to play the role of statesman happy to be friends with all and forced to try and steer Italy through what was a disastrous Euro crisis. Well, tonight we ask, how do we assess Silvio Berlusconi's legacy in Italy and beyond? Let's kick this part of the show off with Barbie Nadeau who has this reflection. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice over): The Jesus Christ of politics, the best political leader in Europe and the world. That is how Silvio Berlusconi once described himself, and without a doubt he was a powerful political operator and businessman who sparked more than one scandal. And despite a string of legal trouble and dubious friends, Berlusconi always managed to bounce back. He made his name as a business tycoon. He owned the famous AC Milan football club for 31 years. At one point, he was the richest man in Italy.",

And voters brought him back to power in 2022 as a coalition partner with Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini. Charming and with a flippant sense of humor, Berlusconi's off the cuff remarks and missteps with protocol were often criticized. He welcomed the newly elected U.S. President in 2008 by complimenting Barack Obama on his quote \"suntan\", a left German Chancellor Angela Merkel waiting during a NATO summit. And his close friendship with Vladimir Putin got him in hot water after he disclosed he had reestablished his friendship with the Russian President in late 2022 after Putin sent him 20 bottles of Russian vodka for his birthday. He later blamed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting a war, putting him at odds with Meloni. The Prime Minister often surrounded himself with beautiful women. Allegations of a relationship with an 18 year old aspiring model which he strenuously denied triggered a painfully public divorce. And revelations about his so called \"Bunga Bunga\" parties landed him in court on charges of abuse of power and having sex with an underage prostitute. Allegations he also denied.",
