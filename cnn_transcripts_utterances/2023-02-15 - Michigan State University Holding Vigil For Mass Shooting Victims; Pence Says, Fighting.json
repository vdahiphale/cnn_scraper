This hour, I'll ask the Michigan attorney general about the many unanswered questions in this investigation.Also today, former Vice President Mike Pence is speaking out for the first time about his plans to fight a new subpoena from the U.S. Justice Department. He's arguing that his effort to avoid testifying in the special counsel probe of Donald Trump is about the separation of powers. And Republican Nikki Haley holds a rally to kick off her 2024 presidential campaign. She says it's time for new generation of leaders, taking direct jabs at President Biden and veils swiped at former President Trump. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.

There're really two questions. First of all, is he covered by the speech and debate clause? Constitution says that members of the Congress can be covered. Now, he was president of the Senate in his role as vice president and the courts have construed that broadly. They've actually said it can apply to congressional staffers, as well. So, I think it likely will apply to Mike Pence.The second part, though is, will his testimony relate to his legislative duties?

And I don't think anybody really has a handle on that. And by that, I mean, first of all, the generational argument. That was a big, big part of her push in several different ways. She made note of the fact that she is much younger than -- she didn't say Donald Trump's name but it was clear she had it to for Donald Trump and Joe Biden. But it is unclear whether this is a moment that the Republican electorate is ready to break from Donald Trump, is ready to take on the maybe more traditional foreign policy ideas that she put forward and other things that are really still shaking out when it comes to the identity of the Republican Party.

And I think that she's trying to really get out front on a lot of these issues by basically arguing, and this is what you'll hear from people close to her, her entire political biography has involved taking on the sort of this entrenched establishment, the good old boys, so to speak. And that is, as Dana said, a double barreled argument, both against Trump and against President Biden.But for Haley, the challenge is going to be what happens later. As Pence indicated today, she's not going to be the only person challenging Trump in the race for long. So at some point, there has to be more that's there to really differentiate herself from other candidates. And I think at the moment, this speech today didn't really give me a clear sense of what that would look like for her. I think she avoided some real significant issues that Republicans are talking about elsewhere. CRT, you know, what they're teaching in the classrooms, et cetera, and I think it makes me wonder how else is she going to create a lane for herself.

I think her fate is going to be determined by the Fulton County D.A., the Manhattan D.A., and probably Jack Smith and Merrick Garland. She needs Donald Trump and/or Ron DeSantis to implode, because if Trump's at 45 to 50 and if DeSantis is at 25 to 30, there's just not enough oxygen in the tent for anybody else. So, she gets in, makes a great appearance and I think bides her time to see which way those investigations go.

She's charismatic on the stump. She's got a great credential more recently in the foreign policy space, which a lot of governors don't typically obtain prior to running for president of the United States. However, I couldn't help but think to myself the main reason why Republicans have lost seven of the eight past popular vote counts is due to the fact that so many of the policies that they push forward, especially in the area of economics, are not popular with the American people. And I have seen nothing in today's speech to differentiate her to chart a new path forward in that regard. Ultimately, this is rather -- this is about whether Donald Trump is going to be the primary, because we know there are going to be multiple Republican opponents, and she's not going to be able to win that nomination so long if she's competing against Donald Trump and a bunch of other people on the Republican side.",
