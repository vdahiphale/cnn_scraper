The joint appearance comes as Harris prepares to roll out her big economic policy tomorrow in North Carolina.And CNN's Jeff Zeleny joins us now from Asheville, North Carolina. One of the most beautiful swing locations in a swing state that there is. Jeff, North Carolina is interesting all of a sudden. Explain why was Trump there yesterday? Why is Harris there tomorrow?",

States of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania that, of course, we talked so much about as being the center of this presidential campaign. There is no doubt North Carolina is getting a renewed focus as a battleground state. We saw former President Donald Trump here yesterday. Vice President Kamala Harris is going to be in Raleigh tomorrow laying out her economic plan, as you said. And the economy is at the heart of this presidential campaign. There is no mistake about it. Yes, there are other issues, other distractions, but the pocketbook issues are on the minds of voters. That's why Vice President Harris is coming here to North Carolina to lay out part of her economic proposal. But as you said, she'll be making a stop earlier actually this afternoon in Maryland to appear for the first time with President Biden since this change at the top of the Democratic ticket. This will be their first joint speaking event. They'd been together, of course. But -- and this is really going to highlight the fine line that she is walking here over the next three months or so. You know, she certainly owns the record and policies of the Biden administration, but she's trying to put a bit of distance between some of that. Not, however, on what they're announcing today. That is a major savings in Medicare because this is a -- one of the sort of -- sort of fallouts from the Inflation Reduction Act that she cast the deciding vote, you'll remember, back in 2022. And that allows the government to directly negotiate with the drug manufacturers, saving some 6 billion and passing along some $1.5 billion in savings to seniors. So, of course, she will embrace that. You will not hear her talking about Bidenomics. That phrase that was mentioned so often during the first part of this campaign has been all but retired. There is no doubt she's trying to shift her focus to cost cutting. She'll be announcing the first ever federal ban if she's elected during her first 100 days that she said her administration will look into, price gouging, looking at meat packers, the consolidation on that front. So, there is no doubt, John, the economy front and center in this. But it's going to be a delicate balance for her to embrace, and then perhaps move beyond the Biden record.",

I can show you and give you a look in terms of what the Congressional Budget Office do, which they look at the amount of revenues that were lost as a result. Obama's were bigger in 2012. The extension of those tax cuts. Reagan in '81 outstripped him. But size actually in this case shouldn't matter. It should be about who you help most.
