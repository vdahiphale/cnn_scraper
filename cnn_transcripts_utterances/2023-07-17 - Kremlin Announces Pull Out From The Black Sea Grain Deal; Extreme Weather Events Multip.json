We begin with new fears over global foodsupplies and the threat of a shortage that could cause prices to skyrocket worldwide. Just hours before it was set to expire, the Kremlin announced it's pulling out of the Black Sea grain deal. The agreement brokered by Turkey and the U.N. last July allowed Kyiv to export its grain by sea despite a wartime blockade. Moscow now warns it won't guarantee the safe passage of ships in the region. Ukraine is one of the largest exporters of wheat in the world, and Western officials are slamming Russia's decision as utterly immoral. A short time ago, the U.N. Chief said Moscow's withdrawal from the pact will hit developing countries the hardest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: Ultimately, participation in the disagreements is a choice. But struggling people everywhere and developing countries don't have a choice. Hundreds of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost of living crisis and they will pay the price. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kyiv is claimingcredit for two brazen strikes on a vital bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean Peninsula. The Koch Bridge serves as a crucial resupply route for Moscow's military. And Ukrainian intelligence says the damage will create logistical problems for Russia. The attack comes at a critical time, as Ukrainian counteroffensive slowly gains grounds. CNN's Alexander Marquardt joins us live now from Odessa, Ukraine. So, Alex, whenever we see these sorts of brazen attacks against Russia or Russian infrastructure, Ukraine is usually somewhat slow to take responsibility. That's different this time. Just talk to us about the strategic and the symbolic importance of this bridge. I mean, this was a personal project for Vladimir Putin.",

I mean, oftentimes they don't even say that they're responsiblefor these attacks that they so clearly are and will often learn about them or their responsibility from American or European officials. In this case, Zain, that is not true. Ukraine taking clear responsibility for this, rather proud of this strike against this very important bridge. Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU here, they tweeted that the bridge has gone to sleep again. That again, referring to the fact that this is the second major strike on this bridge by Ukraine. The first one was nine months ago. Back then, it was put out of commission for months. And now we are seeing something similar. The roadway that goes that connects mainland Russia, southern Russia, with the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula that is not working right now. There is no traffic. Traffic has come to a standstill. Cars cannot pass. Well, there is a parallel train track that is functioning. Pictures and videos that were posted on social media and in Russian state media show that the roadway was severely damaged. It's bowing in a certain section. Remains to be seen when it will be back up and operational. But for two main reasons this is such a big deal, Zain, because that is a critical logistical artery between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula. It supplies not only civilians who live on the peninsula with food, fuel and other things, but it also has been a main supply route for the Russian military, for equipment, for machinery, for weaponry to go and supply their military that is doing much of the fighting in the southern part of Ukraine. And then it is also a hugely symbolic bridge because not long after the peninsula was taken by Russia in 2014, Vladimir Putin ordered this bridge built. It took four years. It cost almost $4 billion. When it finally opened in 2018, he was there for the opening. He personally drove a truck across this bridge. Crimea, he has repeatedly insisted, is part of Russia. And so, to see Ukraine strike this bridge and take responsibility for it, that is certainly going to infuriate Vladimir Putin, who we expect to hear from any moment now. Major question here in Ukraine is how will he respond? Zain.",

Andthey insisted very quickly that this was not connected to this brazen attack on the bridge, which happened around 3AM local time. We could see any kind of reaction from the Russians, to be honest. I mean, we're seeing almost daily attempts at hitting Ukrainian cities with rockets and with drones all across the country. Many of them, luckily, recently have been knocked out of the sky by air defenses and there haven't been that many deaths. But at the same time, after this bridge was hit back in October, we did see the heaviest Russian attack on Ukrainian cities since the war had begun just months prior in February. So, it is certainly a good possibility that Russia could respond with a very heavy hand. Zain.",

Right after Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal,jeopardizing a key trade route to global markets, wheat prices jumped more than three percent. Let's bring in CNN's Anna Stewart, joining us live now from London. So, Anna, Russia is basically saying the grain deal was unfair, that part of the reason why they pulled out of it was because this particular deal was stopping them from exporting their own food products. The U.S. on the other hand is saying no, that they're just using the grain initiative as pretty much a weapon. Just walk us through what both sides are saying about Russia's decision here?",

      "sentences": "This decision didn't really come as a surprise. This was a U.N. and Turkey brokered agreement last August and there havebeen multiple extensions. But it was due to expire today and an extension wasn't really expected because Russia seems so, well, less than keen, let's say, to resurrect it simply because it has faced issues in terms of exporting food and fertilizer products, issues relating essentially to sanctions. Now, that's what we had from the Russian government person, Dmitry Peskov, earlier today. He said, unfortunately, the part of these Black Sea agreements concerning Russia has not been implemented so far, so its effect is terminated, which suggests there are hopes that perhaps the deal could be resurrected. But then we heard just in the last few hours from the U.N. Secretary General who said he's very disappointed because he says he found solutions to this issue. He recognizes the issues. He's written to Russian President Vladimir Putin, outlining some proposals, and yet the deal is off. So, I think at this stage it does look like perhaps there is a solution, perhaps there is an ability to negotiate here and improve the grain deal for Russia. The question is perhaps whether there's any willingness at this stage for a negotiation to take place. Yeah, and politics aside, I mean, just walk us through what the sort of real world ramifications are for people in developing countries. I mean, what does it mean for food insecurity, especially in parts of East Africa? What does it mean for global food prices, as well, Anna?",

So, this really matters. Now, over 50 percent of Ukraine's exports go to developing countries. So, there's the direct impact that you have there. But there's also the fact that with global food markets, you will see prices rise. And what we've seen largely in response to the Russian grain deal was we had a peak in terms of food prices last year. And once this deal was in place, they dropped. In fact, food prices, according to the U.N. dropped by 20 percent between June of last year and just last month. Today, we are seeing wheat prices rise. So, this is a concern for the whole world, for developing nations and certainly will feed into the big inflation picture around the world.",

So, definitely, Ukraine will continue to export its agricultural crops by trucks, by railroad, but we can't export everything we have by these ways. So, we heavily need this seaway to export our agriculture, our grain. That is the reality. So, the whole world will feel consequences again. So, there is also consequences for Ukraine for the next years. I mean, if this corridor will not be restored, it will mean that Ukrainian farmers will be short in money in financing. So, the next harvesting season will be under great question. And next year, Ukraine will send to the world much less food than it is usually made. So, that will mean a long, long period of high prices for food in the world, which will mostly influence the developing countries. Yeah, you bring up such an important point. Yes, of course, our thoughts right now are with developing nations who rely on Ukrainian grain. Many parts of East Africa are dealing with huge amounts of food insecurity.

So, that is strategic consequences. Also, definitely, there is a political consequences inside Russia because Putin said many times that this is his personal project and that this bridge is so defended that nothing can happen with it. But it's already for the second time. Last time, it was October last year when the bridge was even more heavily targeted this time again. So, especially at the moment when Ukrainian forces are in counteroffensive in the southern part of Ukraine, that creates huge challenges for Russians and definitely that creates opportunities for Ukraine. Yeah, it's interesting you touched on the sort of political consequences for the Russians. I mean, the Russian military is already dealing with so much internal strife, not least because of the failed mutiny that we just saw a couple of weeks ago.

He said what needs to happen is that there is civilian leadership at the table in those talks, but it's civilian leadership itself that led to, in part, this conflagration, which is having this enormous impact on Sudanese civilians when the people with the guns, both the RSF and the armed forces, refuse to hand over power. And so, even he said he sees no room for optimism at the moment.

And to come back to the question of tensions between Tunisian citizens and sub-Saharan African migrants, for a while now, and I mean, since I, for the whole period when I was doing my field research starting 2020, too early this year., the idea was among a lot of Tunisian folks was that the sub-Saharan African migrants are taking away their jobs or are eating away their rice because there is a rice shortage in the country. So, what is happening is that a lot of economic inequalities or employment inequalities are being interpreted by the Tunisians as being linked to this visible other. Instead of saying like, oh, this is a structural problem, this is a state-linked problem. Instead of thinking in terms of the state, they're thinking in terms of the other. And so, what has happened is that the marginalized of the most marginalized, I mean, the Tunisian society is already very marginalized at a global scale. And within this, the margin of the margin is being as great coated in the end. Yeah.",

I mean, obviously, weknow about the EU signing a deal with Tunisia and the sea international saying, look, the E.U. is actually complicit in how migrants are treated in Tunisia. Tunisia is receiving money from the E.U., and they are under quite a bit of pressure to ensure that a lot of these migrants do not make it to Europe, don't end up traveling to Europe. Is amnesty right? Is the E.U. somewhat complicit in all of this? What should they be doing differently?",

So, that dates from starting something around 1990s. So, what we're seeing is nothing new if you look at this long term. But the fact that I think there's a lot more critique now of the E.U., mostly because it is coming in from the far right. It is being supported by the far right and from the Italian state. So, using that, a lot of folks are saying like, okay, yes, this is a far-right discourse. There is a far-right anti-migrant discourse that is behind this deal. But if you just read on the papers, if you read just the memorandum of understanding, it has -- it has this human rights language, which is sort of like human rights washing the whole deal in the sense like, oh, we will bring, we will give you more visas or we will, you know, sort of make cooperations in terms of economic exchanges or in terms of transition to green energy. So, it looks pretty on papers. But I mean, the E.U. has always sort of done that. It has always sort of come into the global south, especially like the countries on which has externalized its borders, comes sort of from top down with this discourse of human rights and sort of tried to wash it away, the oppression and the inequalities that exist between these global south bordering countries and the European Union.",

He made a disclosure via Twitter on Saturday. It marks a stark contrast from what Musk told the BBC in April, that the platform was roughly breaking even and that most advertisers had returned. One of Twitter's cost-saving measures after Musk took over was abandoning its only office in Africa just four days after it opened, and it seems the company also abandoned the staff there, as well. A group of former employees spoke exclusively to CNN about their ordeal, saying that they were literally ghosted by Twitter. They received apparently no severance pay more than seven months later. Let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo joining us live now from Nairobi, Kenya. It's interesting, Larry, because Elon Musk's Twitter, I mean, are -- facing multiple lawsuits from employees and former employees around the world who say that they were not paid what they were owed. Just walk us through what exactly happened with the office in Africa. These former employees basically saying that Twitter left them in the lurch. What is Twitter saying about that, too?",

These former employees in Twitter's only African office, they didn't even beginnegotiating with the company until after CNN reported on their case. So, what happened is they now feel that Twitter kind of forced them into accepting this lowball offer of three months severance pay, repatriation costs, because some of them moved back, moved to Ghana from Nigeria or other parts of the continent, and the legal costs for this negotiation process. So, they agreed on all that back in May. After that, they haven't heard back from Twitter. And every time they reach out, they still hear from Twitter's lawyers, no response from the client. And one of them told me, we feel that they literally ghosted us and they fear that they might not get a cent out of this. Their last day at Twitter was on December 4th, but they had lost contact with Twitter and access to their Twitter systems back in November. So, it's been more than seven months since they stopped working for the company and haven't been paid a cent. Some of them depended on their job at Twitter to remain in Ghana legally or indeed if they're getting paid their repatriation costs to go back to their countries. And it's a real problem here. This is why you hear this statement from the lawyer, Carla Olympio, who's been representing them from the beginning. She says, unfortunately, it appears that after having unethically implemented their terminations in violation of their own promises and Ghana's laws, dragging the negotiation process out for over half a year, now that we have come to the point of almost settlement, there has been complete silence from them for several weeks. And she says they're considering legal action against Twitter in various jurisdictions, including Ghana. We reached out to Twitter for comment on the status of these former employees in Africa. We didn't get back a response. The standard poop emoji is what it got back. So, it's not clear that even after the new CEO, they have a media relations department. But Zain, the big problem here is this is just 11 people we're talking about, not hundreds of people. And they say surely, the world's richest man can afford to pay severance to 11 people.",

Spain's Carlos Alcaraz took down 23-time Grand Slam Champion Novak Djokovic on Sunday to win his first Wimbledon title. There it is. That's the moment that it happened. It took five sets for Alcaraz to beat Djokovic. Some are saying the 20-year-old Alcaraz combines the best aspects of Djokovic's game, as well as Rafael Nadal's and Roger Federer. Don Riddell joins us live now with more. That was quite a moment there where you just saw the crowd really erupt because we'd all had this impression that Djokovic was pretty much completely invincible. He hasn't been beaten for about 10 years. This win, I think, really does send a huge message, a really important message to the younger generation of athletes who are just coming up, doesn't it?",
