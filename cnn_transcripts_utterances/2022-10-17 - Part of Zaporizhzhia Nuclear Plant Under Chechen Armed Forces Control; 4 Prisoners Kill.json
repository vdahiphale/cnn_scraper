While CNN is not able to independently verify what caused the fire, some details have emerged from pro-reform organizations. In footage obtained by activist group 1500tasvir, gunfire and alarms can be heard in the background as flames engulf the prison complex. Meanwhile, pro-reform news outlet Iran Wire reported on Saturday that a source within the prison said a revolt had taken place in part of the facility and that a fire has subsequently ensued. Now, government authorities on Saturday were quick to assert that the situation had been brought under control, with a security official telling state media that the fire had started after a group of thugs set fire to a clothing warehouse in the complex, adding that the so- called rioters' response wall had been separated from other detainees. Of course, while the Iranian regime claims the fire is not connected to the protest movement sweeping the country, it is impossible to ignore the context here. The incident comes at a time when the regime is facing one of its toughest challenges in years, with protests not only gaining momentum, but also morphing into a much broader call for regime change. On Saturday, U.S. President Joe Joe Biden expressed his solidarity with the Iranian people, drawing criticism from Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson, who said Sunday that Iran remains unfazed by the intervention of foreign politicians and would not give in to the U.S. government's, quote, \"cruel sanctions and absurd threats.\" This, of course, as the regime's brutal and deadly crackdown on protesters and any sign of dissent, for that matter, continues across the country.

His key message, make China great again. But above all else, obey and follow his lead.

This is, of course, an indication that he's unlikely to back down from any of his hardline positions and policies, including on zero COVID. And another phrase he used got people's attention, was how he said China is now entering a phase of strategic opportunities and risks with growing uncertainty. Because in the past, both he and his predecessors have always said China is entering a phase of strategic opportunities.

And their people, more than 23 million of them, elected the leaders that Beijing calls illegitimate. And Beijing's communist rulers, while they lay claim to this island, you would be hard-pressed to find anybody here who believes that they -- that the rulers in Beijing have rule over their lives. Now, does it mean that people want, you know, a war with China? No. A lot of people, the majority of people here, continue to want to maintain the status quo, where Taiwan basically looks and acts like a country, without calling itself that, you know, or at least without most of the world calling them that. Because of Beijing making sure that the only officially recognized China is Beijing. And yet, they continue to have their military, their own democracy, and they continue with life as is. But that might be difficult. But it's hard to imagine, Michael, and people here, you know, they just reopened the borders. They're going to have a major, you know, LGBTQ pride coming up in a matter of weeks, something that would basically be unthinkable in China, both open borders and the pride thing. Because, you know, we've seen what happens to ethnic and sexual minorities and feminists in the mainland. They are basically absorbed in silence, whereas here, those differences are celebrated. And there's more color in the streets here. There's also less order. And of course, Xi Jinping has made order his priority. But you look at the polls, Michael, and not too many people here would willingly just reabsorb with the China that they're seeing right now, certainly with the rolling lockdowns. And the military intimidation, frankly, doesn't really phase people here, because they've been dealing with it their whole lives.
