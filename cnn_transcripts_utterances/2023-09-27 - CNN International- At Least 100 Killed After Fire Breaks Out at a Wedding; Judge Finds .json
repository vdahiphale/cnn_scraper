And again, according to eyewitness accounts that I've heard, the moment where the couple were slow dancing, sparklers we're going, off fireworks were going off inside the hall, that caught the ceiling on fire, that was decorated, as you can imagine, with vinyl and other highly flammable materials. And the exterior of the building was covered in something highly flammable and illegal, echo ban panels, those are actually banned according to Iraq's building code.Those were coating the building. It essentially made it a tinderbox. And again, according to Iraq's civil defense, in a matter of moments, the whole building was on fire. Whole parts of it were on fire. People trapped behind these portions, unable to escape, that's why you're hearing from the health ministry that some of those who died, died during -- due to suffocation, they're not able to get out of that building. Very preliminary reports here on the death toll and the injuries, at least 100 people killed, at least 150 people wounded. They're being spread out across multiple hospitals. I mean, this is a massive tragedy, no single hospital can take all of these victims. Iraq's prime minister is on the way to the region, emergency services have been activated. But again, just a massive tragedy, and one that some of these guests are going to feel could've been avoided if building code was followed, if this flammable material was not coating the exterior of this building.",

The judge finding that he engaged in fraud for a decade by inflating the value of some of his marquee properties, on financial statements provided in a number of business transactions, and the judge saying that Donald Trump's explanation for how he came up with the values for his assets. He called it a fantasy world, not the real world.Specifically, he singled out Trump's triplex apartment at Trump Tower here in Manhattan. Trump had inflated the value of that property, including just the mere square footage by three times, something that he did acknowledge. The judge saying that could only mean fraud. Now, he also said that he was ordering that certificates of business to operate New York state canceled. And that he would put in place a receiver to dissolve the business, exactly what that would look like, remains unclear at this point. There's a lot of confusion even among the parties about how that will play out. But it could significantly reshape what the Trump organization looks like and whether it has a footprint in New York City. His son Eric Trump who essentially leads the company on a day-to-day business, said that both the judge and attorney general are trying to destroy their company. Now, Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, who's representing him in this action, said today's outrageous decision is completely disconnected from the facts and governing law. With the full impact of the decision remains unclear. What is clear is that President Trump and his family will seek all available remedies to rectify this miscarriage of justice. They are already appealing before the appeals court, the start of this trial, because they think the judge has not implemented correctly what claims would be covered by this. So, they are hoping that the appellate court could narrow the scope of what the judge foreseen in this case to look at, saying that certain claims fell outside of the statute of limitations. We're expecting the appellate court to rule this week on that. But as of now, this trial is still in limbo, but is currently scheduled to start on Monday. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
