A man charged with scheming to murder, Jews serving in state government. The state Attorney General Dana Nessel says, she is among those targeted.Plus, President Biden rallies Democrats on Capitol Hill this hour. The president warning, Republicans want devastating spending cuts in exchange for letting the government borrow to pay its bills. But the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says, that's not true. And says it's the president dragging things out instead of negotiating. And surprise meeting of the top American and Russian diplomats, but it ran barely 10 minutes. The bloody battle for Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, today said proof there is no end to war in sight. We begin the hour with the arrest of a Michigan man and the frightening outburst of hate that led to it. Authorities say a man now in custody threatened to kill any Jews working in Michigan state government and vowed to use deadly force against anyone who attempted to stop him. Michigan's top law enforcement officer, the Attorney General Dana Nessel says, the FBI told her she was among the targets. Nessel tweeting this morning, \"it is my sincere hope that the federal authorities take this offense just as seriously as my Hate Crimes and Domestic Terrorism Unit takes plots to murder elected officials. CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now. He's following the latest. Polo, what do we know?",

      "sentences": "John, there's what we know about the suspects. And also, what we know about the investigation so far. According to federal court records, FBI agents initially post - noticed on Twitter a message that was posted on a page that's believed to have been linked to Jack Eugene Carpenter III. On that page, he makes that death threat that you just referenced writing, \"he would carry out punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in Michigan's government.\" The very next day the FBI's National Threat Operations Center basically relayed this information to federal agents in Michigan. They eventually were able to search that page that is plenty of messages and postings that are as bizarre as they are antisemitic, including the supposedly establishment of his own country and his community just southwest of Ann Arbor.So, what really though began to escalate this for federal agents is the fact that is what they knew about him, which is that he had been previously arrested for assault in December of last year, that he had a protection order that had been filed against him. And also, would certainly did escalate the situation is that he had at least three nine-millimeter handguns that according to state records, were registered in his name. That combined to what federal investigators and state police were hearing from the suspects mother, led them to believe that he was heavily armed. In fact, his mother telling police that she believed that he was in possession of not only multiple handguns, but a 12- gauge shotgun and at least two hunting rifles. And we know that now Carpenter is scheduled for a court hearing soon. But in the meantime, the investigation certainly does continue and it's certainly something that's heavily concerning for authorities here in Michigan.",

Evan Perez, Polo Sandoval, appreciate you're kicking us off on this dramatic story. We'll stay on top of it.Now back to Washington here for a big hour ahead for President Biden. The president making a trip up to the Capitol to meet with Senate Democrats, and to urge them to stick together in the coming fight over raising the government's debt limit. Yesterday, a similar message from the president to House Democrats, the president asserting that Republicans want painful spending cuts in exchange for allowing the government to borrow more money so that it can pay its bills. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Look at the record, is clear they're not the party who cares about fiscal responsibility, especially not when they're threatening our economic recovery by manufacturing a crisis over whether we're going to pay our debts. They've got no business, playing politics with people's lives and our economy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It stick together, John. And that's something that we heard from the president last night, some version of that phrase, eight different times during his address to the House Democratic Caucus in Baltimore last night. And that's because the president is talking not only about what has been accomplished over the first two years as a result of democratic unity, but also talking about the fights to come.And the number one fight to come right now that showdown over the debt ceiling Republicans, House Republicans in particular, have threatened to essentially not approve a clean debt ceiling increase unless they get significant reductions in spending. And so, President Biden trying to rally the troops ahead of what is expected to be perhaps one of the most significant salvos that the president has fired in this debt ceiling showdown next week. And that is when on March 9, President Biden is expected to announce his proposal for next year's budget. And it's expected to include a $2 trillion of cuts to the deficit over the next 10 years. And that's an attempt to go directly at some of these arguments that Republicans have been making about fiscal responsibility about why they feel it's important to negotiate overspending in tandem with approving the debt ceiling. And so, what you're seeing here from the White House is a very concerted strategy to keep Democrats unified, of course on this issue, and also to try and point out Republican hypocrisy, noting that Republicans have approved clean debt ceiling increases under former President Trump, but now that they're trying to get budget cuts in exchange for approving that debt ceiling. Now, make no mistake, there's the possibility of President Biden and Kevin McCarthy meeting again on this issue in the future. But this is an issue that's going to play out in the public forum and who can win this public messaging battle is the key question. John?",

They had one. The speaker left that actually been pretty positive, saying look, we disagreed on the particulars, but the president promised to negotiate in good faith. So, the president saying, Republicans are the problem. Speaker McCarthy listened, says no, no, the president needs to pick up the phone. We'll meet again and we'll figure it out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): It doesn't follow through and what's worse is the last meeting, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO Director, bipartisan came out and the numbers are even worse.

And the president also says, you know, well, if they won't cut those, what are you going to cut if you're demanding spending cuts?This is an Op-Ed, written by the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Republicans vowed not to cut Medicare, Social Security benefits and debt ceiling talks. So, the president could say, you know, I win, right, you've now put in writing that you won't do these things. But he still doesn't want the meeting yet. Why? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I mean, this is a key pressure point for the White House right now, especially as the president is trying to rally Democrats, as Jeremy said, as they're getting ready for 2024. I was talking to some Senate Democratic aides today, who were saying that they expect a lot of the president's conversation today with them to be focused on 2024. And not just his potential reelection, but also their reelections. And so, this is a key element of that. The White House sees public sentiment on their side and a strong argument on that their side, it also makes interesting bedfellows because right now he and former President Trump are on the same side. And you see former President Trump attacking his own party by saying that he also doesn't agree with cutting any of these programs. And that's something that he was able to avoid doing when he was in power. And he pushed back on people like Speaker Paul Ryan, when he when.",

And something else that Congressman Smith argues in that Op-Ed is that President Biden had more of a capacity and interest to debate the debt ceiling when he was Senator, when he was vice president.But you know, I think that voters sort of have short memories, and they're principally concerned in with the immediate. This comes at a time when voters right now are grappling with a benefit that they received, if they were on food stamps during the pandemic that that is going away. So, that brings into focus the sort of need and the reliance on government programs. And the reality is, John, we are exactly where we were a month ago on this issue with Democrats and Republicans not moving.

Right, so the president wants to lay out his blueprint, then he wants the Republicans to say, OK, you have a different plan, put it on paper. Put it on paper, so the American people can compare. Here's what I want to do. Here's what you want to do. And to your point about politics, this is a Hakeem Jeffries, who's right now the House Democratic Leader. He would like to be speaker, that means Democrats have to pick up seats in 2024. So, he says this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): But one of the areas where we will strongly disagree is around the irresponsible effort by extreme MAGA Republicans to hold our economy hostage. Why are they doing that? Because the extreme MAGA Republicans at their core, want to get Social Security and Medicare. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because there are a number of Republicans that do want to cut the entitlement programs. Former Vice President Mike Pence just said, recently, that cuts to specifically Social Security and Medicare have to be on the table long term.

General Clark, good to see you on this day.Let's start with that, your old NATO hat. You are the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO at a very interesting time in history after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the expansion of NATO, all of the things that make Vladimir Putin mad about the west. When Blinken and Lavrov, the U.S. secretary of state, the Russian foreign minister, they haven't met since the war started until today. 10 minutes sounds like pretty much nothing came of it. What is your view - this has to end with diplomacy eventually? How do you get Russia at the table, knowing that it has to end this war? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I don't think you can get Russia to the table until you threatened something that Vladimir Putin really values and that's Crimea. So, what you're seeing now in Bakhmut, John, is Putin is trying to extend Russian control up to the boundaries of the Oblast the provinces. So, it's very important for Ukraine to hang on and frustrate him in that respect, and then be able to launch a counter offensive that threatens Crimea. If it really threatens Crimea. If Putin thinks he can't hold Crimea, then he will negotiate seriously. He would be willing to stop the war as soon as he gets to the Oblast boundaries, if he can hold on to Crimea and those Oblast, he wants to have to rebuild his forces also. So, we have to be careful. We want negotiations to end the war, but we want them to end the war successfully for the west and for Ukraine.",
