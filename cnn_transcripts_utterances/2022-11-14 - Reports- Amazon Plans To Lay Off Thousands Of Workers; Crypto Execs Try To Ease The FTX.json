Tonight, Amazon is reportedly planning the deepest job cuts in its 28-year history. \"The New York Times\" says that the e-commerce giant intends to layoff around 10,000 people starting this week. The company's founder, Jeff Bezos spoke exclusively with CNN on Saturday, he said that shoppers should hold off on big ticket items, and companies should reduce their risk in the face of a likely recession.

The probability, say, if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon.

I mean, remember, FTX is a huge player. It was just a very popular place for both individual investors, but professional investors as well to invest in crypto. And so the fact that they are now bankrupt, at a minimum, that is tying up billions of dollars in customer funds, but ultimately, legal experts say it is possible that customers end up getting very little or even nothing back in this recovery process, and that can have all of these knock-on effects. There can be this cascading impact, where one party loses money and they ultimately have to sell elsewhere, and it can really be hard to get out of that. But also, the point that you're getting at Rahel here is that this is really undermining confidence in the crypto industry at large. And so, you know, hearing the Binance CEO go out and talk about the need for regulation, launching this basically as a bailout fund, I think it really speaks to the level of concern here.

He said he'd come here to sort of get a sense and a feel for that energy, the energy of liberation, the freedom that people have been expressing because he said that would help motivate him. Motivate him to help lead the country. And he spoke about that, where the country is going that this is a wave of liberation that's continuing that will continue. But it really is against a backdrop here of that sense of celebration, of sense of freedom but also of the price that this city has paid. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) The joys of Kherson's liberation keep on giving. How are you? She says. I survived her friend replies. But the Russians kicked my door in and stole everything. This city once home to more than a quarter million people is still celebrating its freedom. But beginning to count the cost of the eight-month brutal occupation they endured. The city's phone and internet connection cut, residents crowding around soldiers communications in desperate hope of contacting loved ones. On their way out, the Russians crippled almost every vital service, electricity off and water too. This pump close to the river bank, giving water to polluted to drink. The water stopped when the power went off, he says. This is the fourth day without water. But what can we do? We need to survive somehow. The Russians even felled the city's main T.V. transmitter. ROBERTSON (on camera): They blew it up just before leaving. A final act of punishment for a population that until days earlier, they said was part of Russia and would be forever. (voice over): That same message, Kherson and Russia together forever plastered on hundreds of billboards around the city is already being torn down. Wai Platton (ph) says because eight months of occupation is not very nice. I didn't feel very good living in fear that any moment a car could pull over near you and bring you to a very unpleasant place. Olexander (ph) was unlucky enough to be taken to one of those unpleasant places and shows us around the jail he was in. He says the Russians beat him daily. They abused everyone, kept us hungry, use this as free labor to repair their military vehicles, he says. They were beating us whenever they wanted. (on camera): This is where they say Russians kill people for simply shouting out Slava Ukraine, glory to Ukraine or having tattoos saying the same thing. And over here in this room, this is where they used to torture people. (voice over): The fire Alexander says started by the Russians as they left to cover up their crimes. But it is across the road in Katarina's (ph) church, Russia's oddest brutality was perpetrated. The grave of Grigory Potemkin (ph) fabled in history for building fake villages was looted days before the Russians left. Father Vitaly (ph) takes us into the gloomy crypt, shows us where Potemkin's coffin was stolen from. He here for 240 years through many wars, he says. We honored him as a founder of Kherson, and they took him without permission. Repairs of souls and city have only just begun. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We are not -- we were not being cut off from the electricity completely, but we have to significantly lower our consumption and use our own generation to support the system.
