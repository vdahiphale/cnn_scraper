And later, the new evidence raising serious questions about a death row inmate's guilt two decades after his conviction. Good evening, everyone. John King here in for Anderson. Thanks for your time tonight. South Carolina's Republican primary is tomorrow. This is the scene right now in the state capital of Columbia where Donald Trump is expected to speak any moment now. The question tonight, will he keep talking about the issue that has upended the Republican Party this week, that being the recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos created through in vitro fertilization, IVF, are children and those who destroy them, the court says, can be held liable for wrongful death. The decision has already halted IVF at three Alabama facilities, left couples in the state scrambling for alternatives and even raised concerns among anti-abortion advocates who may have cheered the end of Roe v. Wade, but did not anticipate this. This also sent Republicans, including Trump, his rival Nikki Haley, struggling to respond to an unwelcome and to many voters unsettling election year surprise. Trump, of course, loves to brag about appointing so many staunchly conservative judges, including to the Supreme Court. But he is making clear tonight he disagrees with what Alabama's staunchly conservative high court now says about IVF. His first statement was online, but tonight he also criticized the ruling in South Carolina, that criticism coming on the eve of that state's Republican presidential primary. It was in Rock Hill that he delivered that criticism and CNN's Kristen Holmes is there for us. Kristen, tell us exactly what is the former president saying now about this Alabama ruling.",

So I think it can be a charging factor, not just for the top of the ticket, but down the ballot, elections of state Supreme Courts. Guess what states have Supreme Court races this year, Ohio, North Carolina, Montana, Michigan, guess what else most of those states are, battleground states and have Senate races. So it can definitely have a long shelf life. A lot of those states also have prosecutor races in it. So it could be a winning factor for Democrats up and down the ticket.",

Records Team Trump says show several visits, including late at night by Wade to Willis' neighborhood before the two say they were romantically involved. Remember, she and Wade testified last week that their relationship began in early 2022 after his hiring and that he only visited her sporadically prior to that.

It's an entertaining one for everyone but Mr. Wade and Miss Willis, of course. But the reality is, is that we have to remember that the citizens of Georgia to a grand jury felt it appropriate to indict. It doesn't mean guilt as to Mr. Trump and the 14 other defendants, I don't say 18 because four pled guilty, at all.But it means there's sufficient reason to believe they engaged in various misconduct, so there are safeguards there. With respect to a trial, there are safeguards in proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Why do I say that, John, in the lead in to directly answering your question? Because we have to know that there's integrity built into the process. Now, to your question, this is meant to undermine that integrity. Was there an undermining of it? Was there a relationship? Was there a quid pro quo with respect to financial relationships and conditions? I think the response is true. In the event that there's cell tower data it doesn't pinpoint the specific location, that's densely populated area. There are many businesses, et cetera, around that area that are open late. It does raise questions with respect to when a relation began, whether or not there were fabrications with respect to that relationship, and did it in any way impair this proceeding. That's the open question. So I'll conclude with this. I think at a minimum, John, what could happen is that on March 1st, instead of hearing closing arguments in terms of what the evidence means, they could be the reopening of this evidentiary hearing. And if the D.A. is responding, it doesn't improve the content. Maybe we get to see the underlying texts that will communicate it to see what they show with respect to the relationship.",

He could say that, and I think what will be interesting will be how far he takes this hearing if it does go from a summation, an argument hearing, what he's sort of set to actually go open and the evidence I have to look at this. Remember that these phone records are coming in about the same time that he's going to be talking to Mr. Bradley, the former law partner and friend of Mr. Wade, who apparently has some information.It has communicated by text and e-mail with the defense attorneys about that. So if these records back up something Mr. Bradley tells a judge in chambers and camera in private, or if Mr. Bradley tells him something that backs up the records in private, I think they've become particularly critical. I mean, this is about like watching, you know, somebody on the Titanic say, well, the iceberg is really not that big. This is a big deal in the sense that it could very well undermine the credibility of the district attorney and Mr. Wade. That's a problem going forward because the judge has got to make a decision on whether or not there have been some appearance of conflict or has there been some false filing or statement made to the court. If that's the case, then I think she's got a problem. I don't know yet, but I do know that prosecutors and law enforcement use this type of cell phone tracking data all the time, and so it's interesting to hear now the district attorney's office coming and say, well, it really doesn't prove anything. It's not a big deal. That's just not the case. I mean, that's how they use it to track people in cases on a routine basis and to say 12,000 interactions, and remember, Mr. Wade said, well, maybe he was at the Porsche Experience? Well, that's a driving track down there. I don't think he's doing that at 3:00 or 04:00 in the morning after getting a text or call from Miss Willis.
