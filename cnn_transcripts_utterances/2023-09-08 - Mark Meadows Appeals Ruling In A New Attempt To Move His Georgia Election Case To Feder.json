      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.A big decision, in the Georgia election interference case. Former Trump White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, cannot move his case, to federal court. And it comes as a bombshell report was made public, revealing a sitting U.S. Senator was among those recommended for charges. Any minute, former President Trump, will kick off a rally, in South Dakota, alongside Governor Kristi Noem. She's expected to endorse him, fueling speculation that she's eyeing the number two spot, in Trump's third bid, for the White House. And at least eight confirmed sightings, of an escaped murderer, with nearly 400 officers now on the case. A prison guard has been fired. And still, the convicted killer, who busted out of a prison, near Philadelphia, is on the lam. I am Brianna Keilar. And this is THE SOURCE. Good evening. Kaitlan Collins is off tonight. We are watching a major decision, in the Georgia election case. A judge just denied Mark Meadows' bid, to move his case to federal court. He testified, just days ago, in his own defense. But that clearly did not move the judge, who says Meadows failed to meet even the quite low threshold for removal. This can't be welcome news, for former President Trump. Just yesterday, he said he may try to get his Georgia case moved as well. And moments ago, we learned that Meadows has already filed notice to appeal. With me now, former federal prosecutor, Shan Wu; defense attorney and former Georgia prosecutor, Sarah Flack; and former Assistant Special Watergate prosecutor, Nick Akerman. So Nick, the court, here, concluding that, Meadows has not met even this quote, \"Quite low\" threshold for removal. How are you reading this decision? NICK AKERMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT SPECIAL WATERGATE PROSECUTOR, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: I think I read this decision as bad news for all of the defendants. Part of their strategy was to try and break up this case, as much as they could, getting some of it, into federal court. And this strategy, tonight, has failed. If you read this opinion, it doesn't spell good news, for Donald Trump. He is not going to be able to meet that threshold. Jeffrey Clark, who was a government employee, an Assistant Attorney General, in charge of the Environmental division, he's not going to be able to meet that threshold. All for the simple reason, that trying to undermine a state election is not anywhere close to within the scope of duties of these federal officials. So, I think, no matter what they do, they can appeal this, to wherever, it's not going anywhere, at this point.",

That's given the trial court judge a very strong factual record. And the appeals court is not going to reexamine facts that way. They're not going to take new testimony. They're ruling on the law.

All of that language that applies to Meadows is going to apply in spades to Donald Trump.

So that's going to be the priority. What happens with these other defendants? We already know they're not filing these speedy trial demands. They want to be severed. But we will see -- we'll see what happens. But certainly, these four or five, who have filed this speedy trial demand, they are going to be tried first.

Now, they were not indicted, ultimately.But here's Graham's response, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): This is troubling for the country.

And then, the D.A. can go through that.And the D.A. ultimately is the one, who decides what she wants to go forward on. But it helps though, because she understands sort of what the issues are, what the jurors are interested in, what maybe more evidence she needs. Knowing Fani Willis, she is very, very thorough. She has tried multiple RICO cases in her career. In fact, she's made a career of that. I can guarantee you, she's been in her office, in her war room, so to speak, and has called each and every one of these defendants, and looked at \"What evidence do we have? How can we prove it?\" Because it's not about also what we think. It's about what we can prove. \"Do we have the hard evidence to prove this?\" And Fani is not going to indict somebody, if she doesn't believe she can prove it in court. So, I think that's why she ultimately used her discretion, in not charging these other defendants, because she's not going to try a case that she doesn't think she can win.",

Again, none of the senators, here, who were recommended for indictment, by the special grand jury, ultimately had charges pursued against them, by the D.A. But he's talking about this is criminalizing the work that politicians or senators do. Where is the line, do you think, between politicking, and criminal act, when it comes to the behavior of these senators?",

He took that all the way to the Supreme Court, claiming congressional immunity. That was his thing, to try and keep out of testifying. And for good reason. I mean, we can see now that the grand jury did suspect that he committed crimes.If you listen to Raffensperger's testimony, the Secretary of State of Georgia? You compare what was said by Donald Trump to Raffensperger? And you compare what was said by Lindsey Graham, to Raffensperger? It's almost the same playbook. It's as though he was part of the team, trying to influence the election, in Georgia. Now, I think, the problem with Lindsey Graham was that there just wasn't enough evidence. Basically, with respect to Graham and Raffensperger, it was a he-said, he-said. It was not tape-recorded, unlike the call with Donald Trump, so that there really wasn't something, for a jury, to listen to, and to sink their teeth into. And there wasn't much other evidence, beyond that phone call, as far as we know. So, I think, what Fani Willis did, in that circumstance, was really make a decision, that she just didn't have the evidence, that was sufficient, to convict Graham, beyond a reasonable doubt. Now, it doesn't mean that if someone down the line doesn't turn and cooperate, that he couldn't find himself in hot water, again.",

We have these votes. And looks like those people in the special grand jury wanted to indict people like Graham.But she has to look at the whole picture. And the votes alone aren't necessarily dispositive, on that. She's got to look at all the evidence she has. And even though you might have a majority of votes, there, it doesn't mean that you don't have some weaknesses in the case. So, I think she's really shown herself to be a very independent prosecutor. And obviously, this really flies in the face of what Trump's saying. I mean, she could have easily have taken this recommendation, and say, \"Hey, not me. These people wanted to do it.\" But she exercised her discretion. And I think that shows a very evenhandedness.",

Let's talk about this now, with CNN Political Commentators, Bakari Sellers, and Alice Stewart, with us as well. All right, guys, is this a VP tryout? What do you think? ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, HOST, \"HOT MICS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT\" PODCAST: Of course, it is. And look, a lot of people say, \"Wow, it's so early. It's too soon to be talking about this.\" It's never too early, for Donald Trump, to launch a race, to vie for his attention, or to kiss the ring. And that's exactly what he's doing here. And look, the way that Donald Trump works is loyalty is key for him. And blind loyalty is even better than that. And Governor Noem fits that bill perfectly. She has been very supportive of him, along the way, certainly reaping praise on him. And I talked with her campaign, tonight. She will, in any minute now, she will formally endorse him. And that really does set her, in a good path, to be one of the many people that he will probably consider, for VP. And look, in terms of the policy, she is right on board, with a lot of the policies, he stands for. And she certainly is someone that will continue to be as supportive of him, if she does continue this. BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: It's not too early, because this race is over. I mean, this race will effectively be over, on King Day. I think it's January 15th or so. But whenever the Iowa primary is, or Iowa caucus is, this race will be over. Donald Trump will trounce the rest of his opponents. I don't think Kristi Noem is in the top tier, however. But what Donald Trump does very well is he goes out and brow-beats the rest of his opponents. He pushes people, into submission.

You can't describe it as completely rural. But there are a lot of vast rural pockets, in this area. A lot of properties here, homes, that have a ton of property on them, like this field that you see behind me, a lot more property than you see here. They have outbuildings. They have streams, hills, forests, in these properties, a ton of places for this man to hide. That's one of the reasons that they've not caught him yet. Another reason, the surveillance cameras that have picked him up, over the past few days, two in particular, these were trail cameras, in an area called Longwood Gardens, again, another very vast rural-type area, right behind me. These are trail cameras that were put in place, by private operators, maybe months or years ago. And these images, at least two -- on at least two occasions, were the ones that captured Cavalcante, on the move, at night. The problem with those was that they were not transmitted, to law enforcement, in real-time. Those images of him, captured on those surveillance cameras, were not transferred, in real-time, to law enforcement. That is unlike the cameras that law enforcement itself operates. So, it took almost a day, in each case, for law enforcement, to actually get those images. So he seems to have been kind of one step ahead, at every juncture, Brianna.",

So, in a sense, we're back to seeing the transmission we saw, in that 2020-2023 time period.But what we're also seeing is a much milder illness. You mentioned hospitalizations. For example, we hit a peak of 150,000 hospitalizations, a week, back in January of 2022. Now, here we are, at 17,400, a week, a far, far cry, from the 150,000. And so, while it's up some from where it was in July, it's still low. Same as with deaths. If you look at deaths, in January of 2021, we had 25,000 deaths, in one week, in this country. Today, we're about 722 deaths a week. So, it's still an issue. I don't want to minimize it.

I call it a seasonal virus because it occurs in all four seasons of the year. And I say that tongue in cheek.So, I think that we still have to look at the issue of how do we vaccinate? I'm happy to report that the data that we have, even as late as this afternoon, shows that this new booster that's coming out, actually provides fairly good protection, against the strains that we see now, and this new one, this 2.86 that everyone's been talking about. So, I'm confident with that. The challenge, I think is, is that immunity wanes. And that's what, I think, we're seeing, right now, is that if you get six to 12 months out, from when you were infected, or when you were vaccinated, your protection begins to diminish, substantially, against getting infected, and even potentially against developing more serious illness. So, what should you do? Get the booster. I hope that CDC makes it permissive, for everyone, over six months of age, to get with a strong recommendation, for those 65 and older, or those with immune- compromised conditions. Because we do know that the booster can provide many extra months, avoiding serious illness, hospitalizations and deaths.",

We know that's not the case. Like influenza, you can get infected over and over again, and multiple years. So part of the issue, right now, is we have this battle going on between our body's immune systems and the virus. And what's happening, I think is, is that that's what's resulted in a milder illness. If none of us had pre-existing immunity, from previous vaccination, or infection, I think we'd be in a much, much worse shape, right now. So, that's what we're trying to understand, is that why we're seeing milder illness? I don't think you can say it's just the variants itself.",
