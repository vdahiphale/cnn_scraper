This gives you a sense of just how quickly this can happen.The homeowner actually watched this happen through a security camera while they were away in New York. And in the meantime, fire officials say the Eaton fire, which is burning near Pasadena, has exploded in size. It's grown to more than 10,000 acres. It's also being blamed for at least two deaths.

And with us now is Sue Kohl, who evacuated from Pacific Palisades where they're dealing with another fire, the Palisades fire. She is also the president of the Pacific Palisades Community Council. Sue, thanks for being with us. Can you just tell us a little bit about what it was like evacuating and what the status is right now of your neighborhood? SUE KOHL, PACIFIC PALISADES RESIDENT: Well, the status of my neighborhood is that it's pretty much all gone. I live in the village, in an area called the Alphabet Streets. And from the videos and reports that I've had, it's all gone. Typically, these fires start in the hills, and the fire department gets on it, and they usually get it contained. And usually, the flatlands down below consider themselves pretty safe. In this case, what they're dealing with now, the biggest enemy, are these huge, you know, 50- to 80-mile-an-hour winds. And no matter how many firemen you have, no matter how many people are battling these fires, there's nothing you can do about that. So, the embers and the fire traveled all over town to all of the blocks, to every single neighborhood imaginable. And we evacuated yesterday as soon as we could, as soon as we got the notification. And we evacuated pretty easily going east out of the Palisades. The people that really got into big trouble are the people that were trying to go west and get to the ocean. They - a lot of them came down a street where there's only one way in and one way out. And that's why the cars got all stuck and people were getting out and walking. And then there was a fire impeding even their walk. So, it was treacherous for all the people in the western part of town to get out. But I pray that they all did.",

But like I said in the past, we've always come back.So, what I neglected to take really was clothes. So, I think today the focus is going to be on trying to get to a store and buy something to wear. Knowing how to go forward, I don't know, because also I'm a real estate agent. And obviously, you know, our business is going to be pretty much closed down for the near future. At least that's what I think. The devastation is everywhere. The homes are gone. And I hope the town rebuilds. I know it will. I've heard about people thinking about leaving. But we don't know where we're going to go. We don't know where we're going to be living for the next year or two. It's just hard to know.

And you have to understand, too, where they're coming from.Look at some of these peak wind gusts that we know of, 80, 90, even a hundred miles per hour. So even if you cut those numbers in half, you're still looking at 40 to 50 mile per hour wind gusts. That is plenty to be able to continue to spread the fires and keep the firefighters from really being able to make advancements in the containment. Because they have not one but four separate fires. You've got the Eaton fire, Hurst, Woodley and also Palisades. Now, for those who are not familiar with this area, we've put some landmark spots on here so you can kind of understand the area. So, here's where the Hollywood sign is, Dodger Stadium a little bit down here, the Rose Bowl Stadium, just to kind of put that in perspective. Now, the Palisades fire specifically, we've been able to kind of map out where the fire has actually burned through this particular area. So, all of this red-shaded area, that's where the fire has spread through these particular regions. And the one thing to notice, look at all of the structures here. You're talking buildings, businesses, homes that it's kind of crossed over, even some pretty decent roads. But notice it also comes right up to the water. You know, places that you don't traditionally think of, of where you would see these fires, especially just raging up to the point of making it to the water. And it's thanks to that wind. It's been so strong for so long now, 24 hours in some of these areas have had winds at least of 40 to 50 miles per hour and sometimes gusting stronger. As we go through the rest of the afternoon, we're finally going to start to see them coming back down below 60 miles per hour, then below 50, below 40 and below 30, especially as we get through the overnight hours. This is when the firefighters will really be able to make the most advancement in those containment numbers as once these winds can finally come back down. And that is going to happen just not really until later tonight and into the overnight hours.",

I do wonder whether you ever heard Trump express interest in taking over Greenland during his first term. Was this something that you discussed with him directly? CARLA SANDS, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO DENMARK UNDER TRUMP: Well, you know, we had really been absent the whole high north for decades. We hadn't had a diplomatic relationship for 67 years with Greenland when I got to Denmark as the ambassador. And so, I said that my number one goal was to open a consulate in Greenland to reestablish those diplomatic ties. So, I was able to work with the Trump White House, the State Department and the Department of Defense to get this done and we did. So, we put a consulate there. And President Trump, while I can't talk about the conversations that we had that were private, I will tell you that I admire the fact that he wants to secure our country and make sure the American people are safe and also not let our big, dear neighbor, Greenland, just off our northeast coast, that's big, it's one third the size of the continental U.S., so it's the world's largest island.

So, in 2017, the Chinese Communist Party flew the then Greenlandic premier, his government, his top CEOs over to Beijing, rolled out the red carpet, had the C-suite meetings and tried to pull them into their Belt and Road Initiative.No American company, no American government was doing that. China was doing that, and so they were on it. When I tried to get a high-level visitor in 2018 to go to Greenland for a ceremonial occasion, one of their big anniversaries, I couldn't. I couldn't get any interest from the State Department. But when President Trump focused on it, he said, we cannot have this. Denmark can't afford to develop or defend Greenland. So, I really am excited about this next step for Greenland, since they have been talking about going independent for decades. Finally, their premier has said it from the podium, so they are looking, I think, to fast- track this. But with 57,000 people living on the world's largest island, they will never be able to defend themselves or develop themselves. So, they'll need a partner like the United States, in my opinion.

They were owned by the king, the island and the people, until not that long ago. They got - they became semi-autonomous about 75 years ago, and now they want to go independent. But they don't control their defense or their foreign affairs. Everything else they have control of.But as a matter of fact, if you look at Denmark, it can't defend itself. And I'm talking about little Denmark in northern Europe. They have an economy and a population around the size of the state of Colorado. Greenland is a gigantic area, and it's out there in that huge sea. They're in the GIUK gap. There's only a handful of countries that could actually secure that region, the U.S. being the predominant country, and certainly the one that, you know, is part of the rules- based order that's not going to use undue influence and go down the road that the Chinese Communist Party has gone down in so many African and South American countries, where you see they're taking over, and basically - and they're - it's very corrupt. So, we want Greenland to have opportunity, just like every country wants. President Trump has the right idea to secure Greenland and to bring business opportunity, to have good-paying jobs. That's what Greenlanders want, and Denmark can't provide it. It hasn't ever provided it, so why would it happen now? I know that they've suggested putting toward their defense in - or their awareness in the Greenlandic area around $1.5 billion Denmark has, but that's over multiple years, and that's ...",
