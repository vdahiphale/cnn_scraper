The pair discussed climate change, a cause the monarch has long been passionate about. also met with U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, hailing the rock-solid friendship that the U.S. has with Britain. The two leaders discussed the upcoming NATO summit, as well as their firm support for Ukraine. CNN's Max Foster joins us live now from Windsor. So, Max, just in terms of President Biden's meeting with King Charles, obviously the King isn't really supposed to sort of comment on current affairs. He's not really supposed to give his political opinions but you were saying to me earlier that no doubt the issue of Ukraine, in addition to climate change, the issue of Ukraine would have come up at least superficially.

      "sentences": "Well, you wonder what the debate would be, but certainly King Charles has spoken quite forthrightly onUkraine, saying it was an unprovoked invasion. Maybe they'll discuss a bit of that. I think that was really the focus for the earlier meeting in Downing Street with Rishi Sunak because there, in recent weeks, there have been some quite sharp divides appearing between the U.K. and U.S., particularly about cluster bombs, for example, U.K. not agreeing with America's decision to send them to Ukraine. Also, a bit of a row about who should be the head of NATO because President Biden reportedly rejecting Britain's choice. So, there's some tension there. I think that probably would have been reserved for the meeting with the Prime Minister. The meeting with the King would be about long-term relationship building, you know, showing that the U.S. is still a great ally of the U.K. I think there are very many similarities to how the Queen would have handled these trips in the past, you know, an inspection with the guard there and then tea in the castle. But then, something different, Charles went in for briefing from environmental leaders and heads of banks for discussion on how they can tackle climate change. And actually, John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, was in that meeting, was a key part of it. I had a chance to speak to him afterwards to see if there had been any progress in that meeting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE:  All of them agree that we need to accelerate the deployment of capital, money, investment in the new energy economy. I think there were many people who had very good ideas about different ways to approach that, and I came away from it feeling like it was a time very well spent. I hope the President and His Majesty feel that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thank you so much. All right, on the battlefield in Ukraine, local authorities are calling a Russian strike on a residential area that killed at least four people, a war crime happened in a frontline town in the southern eastern Zaporizhzhia region on Sunday. Police say a guided bomb hit a school where civilians were receiving humanitarian aid. Rescue workers continue searching for survivors who may be trapped beneath the rubble. Meantime, we're learning details about a stunning new twist following last month's failed mutiny in Russia. The Kremlin says Yevgeny Prigozhin met with President Vladimir Putin on June 29. That's five days after Wagner Chief's short-lived rebellion. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us live now from Berlin. So, Fred, I mean, I guess it sort of begs the question, why on earth would Vladimir Putin host a meeting with the very man who essentially tried to stage a march on Moscow, a mutiny, a rebellion? Just explain the calculation here.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it is a very interesting question, certainly, Zain, especially since he did that indefiance of Vladimir Putin. He talked about wanting to get to the defense minister and to the chief of the general staff of the Russian military, as well. So certainly, that was a very dangerous moment potentially for Vladimir Putin. And, you know, he went on in a message, in a video message later Vladimir Putin did, and he called this a betrayal. So certainly, this seems like a big deal. And now just a couple of days later, it turns out that Vladimir Putin actually hosted Yevgeny Prigozhin, among others, at the Kremlin for a three-hour meeting. And it's quite interesting. We were looking at what the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, said about this. He said that there were 35, as he put it, commanders who were there inside the Kremlin, including Yevgeny Prigozhin. It's unclear and the Kremlin refused to comment on this, whether these were all Wagner commanders or whether or not there were also people from the defense ministry there, as well. That is completely unclear. But one of the things that also stood out to us, Zain, was that Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said, talked about the mutiny, talked about how the special military operation, which is of course what the Russians call the war in Ukraine, how that is going, they also said that apparently the commanders that were there, including Yevgeny Prigozhin, pledged their allegiance to Vladimir Putin and to defending the motherland, as the Kremlin put it. But what they also said is that Vladimir Putin apparently talked about possible future engagements and future combat engagements for this group. So, that could indicate that possibly a return to the battlefields in Ukraine is something that might be in the cards for the Wagner private military company. Whether or not Yevgeny Prigozhin plays some sort of role in that is obviously very difficult to ascertain at this point in time. But of course, we've seen the narrative really shift at a huge rate in Russia on this. The Kremlin itself saying after that mutiny, that failed mutiny, that Yevgeny Prigozhin would have to go to Belarus and the Belarusian leader said that, as well. And then he said that actually Yevgeny Prigozhin was still in Saint Petersburg, and now it turns out that he even managed to get into the Kremlin and speak to Vladimir Putin there. So, right now, certainly a lot of uncertainty there as far as that is concerned. And one of the things that we've been keeping an eye on, which is very interesting right now, is Kremlin-controlled media, who, you know, they were hyping Wagner for a very long time, then did a complete 180 and were essentially trashing Yevgeny Prigozhin, the last time was late last night on Kremlin-controlled TV. And now we're going to have to wait and see how they try to sell this now. So definitely, potentially a significant development and certainly also one that does beg the question for many Russians what exactly Vladimir Putin's calculation in all this is. And it certainly seems to indicate that possibly the Wagner private military company and their fighters are extremely important to Russia's war in Ukraine.",

I would like to live under normal conditions, says Olga, retired school teacher. Retired. I'm 78 years old. She's been living like this since shortly after the war came to her town of Siversk, battered to smithereens by months of Russian bombardment. Five hundred days of war have left this town and so many others a wasteland of wreckage and rubble. Despite that, some people refuse to leave. We met 70-year-old Nina last March when she told us happier days seemed a world away. What do we feel, she asks? Pain, pain. When you see something destroyed, you tear up. We cry, we cry. Summer has improved her mood. I show Nina and her friend Valentina pictures of the potatoes I grow back home in Italy, prompting Nina to show off her tiny garden of herbs and onions. Still, emotions flood back when I ask what she hopes for the most. We're waiting for the day, she says, the minute when the war ends. On this day, Siversk was quiet. All we heard was the occasional faint thud of distant shelling. Russian lines are six miles away yet the air of tranquility is deceptive. It's not quiet, insists Valentina. They were firing all-night long. Those who remain are an eclectic group, like Sasha, an aging rocker, a great fan of 70s classics. Bee Gees, all right. \"Staying Alive\".

Chinese media said emergency crews were quick to act but unable to save six of the victims. They all died at the scene. Police arrested a 25-year-old man from Lianjian County. He's from the same place as where the kindergarten is located. He's been taken into custody, and an investigation is underway. Authorities have released very few details about the fatal stabbings, other than to say the attack was intentional. Guns in China are strictly controlled and out of reach for most people, but knives have become a common and accessible weapon. In recent years, there have been a spate of mass stabbings at schools targeting children across China. In August last year, three people were stabbed to death and six wounded at a kindergarten in China's southern Jiangxi province. In April 2021, two children were killed and 16 wounded in a stabbing attack at another kindergarten in southwestern Guangxi. And in the same province a year earlier, 37 children and two adults were wounded in a knife attack at an elementary school in southern China. China has very low rates of violent crime compared to the West but these horrific knife attacks often targeting young children are incredibly disturbing. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong.",

The announcement comes after the coalition government collapsed on Friday over immigration policy. Mr. Rutte is Europe's second longest serving leader coming to power in 2010. Northern India was slammed with heavy rains over the weekend as the country's capital saw the wettest day in July in more than 40 years. Heavy rains spurred landslides and flash floods killing at least 22 people. Rescue efforts are still underway. When NATO allies meet for a high-stakes summit on Tuesday, Russia's war on Ukraine will top the agenda. That much is certainly clear.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated he may not attend unless there's more clarity on whether his country will be granted membership and he's calling for a united response.

For example, if you did that, then, you know, and I mean what I say, we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It's a commitment that we've all made no matter what.

Second, having Ukraine inside the alliance means you have much better cooperation and in a way control and scrutiny about how Ukraine actually builds its defense, trains its forces. plan its exercise. Now, Ukraine is outside the alliance, and as a sovereign country, can obviously make certain choices that maybe one day will not be exactly compatible with what the NATO members would like. So, I think the best way to have a powerful and sovereign Ukraine is to have that inside the alliance.

That was after her defeat by Ukraine's Elina Svitolina. Belarus, of course, supports Russia's war on Ukraine. Azarenka called the booing unfair. And just to bring you up to date on some other news on what was in as well, American Chris Eubanks is headed to the quarterfinals after upsetting Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas in a five-thriller. Joining me live now is CNN's Patrick Snell. So, Patrick, certainly a great story with the Ukrainian win, but all eyes on Christopher Eubanks, who has been playing some unbelievable, unbelievable tennis.",

And also, I want to tell you on the men's side in the last few minutes, Novak Djokovic,defending men's champ, Zain, is through to the quarterfinals after beating Hubert Kurkacz of Poland. Djokovic going for an incredible fifth straight Wimbledon title, a 24th Grand Slam crown. That would be a record equaling 24th Grand Slam crown and a record equaling eighth Wimbledon title overall to match the great Roger Federer, as well. Another remarkable Wimbledon playing out, Zain, as I send it right back to you.",

Now, Rena Gonoi issuing both the government and her alleged abusers in hopes of changing the system for all women. CNN's Marc Stewart reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Rena Gonoi is a fighter on the judo mat and for women in Japan. RENA GONOI, FORMER JAPAN SELF-DEFENSE FORCE OFFICER (through translator):  -- I hope I'm able to give hope and courage to people in Japan and across the world with the same problem. STEWART (voice-over):  Rina was a soldier in the Japanese military. She quit after she said she was sexually and verbally harassed. Now she's waging a different war, suing the government and her former assailants. In response, the state would only say that harassment can't be tolerated. Japan's big earthquake and tsunami in 2011 was Rina's call to serve after female officers came to her rescue. GONOI (through translator):  I thought they were really cool and admired the way they worked to support others. STEWART (voice-over):  Years later she enlisted but found herself a target. GONIO (through translator):  They'd comment on my body and the size of my breasts or they'd come up to me in the hallways and suddenly hug me in the corridor. That kind of thing happened daily. STEWART (voice-over): She says after enduring this for months, she asked for an investigation. Prosecutors dropped the case due to a lack of evidence. Rina quit. Rina fought back, taking her battle to social media. An online petition generated more than 100,000 signatures, a call to action that forced the military to re-examine her case. The review found Rina was a victim enduring physical and verbal sexual harassment daily. Rina's entire saga prompted a wide-sweeping defense ministry investigation on sexual harassment. It led to this remarkable moment. Military officials bowed in apology. UNKNOWN (through translator):  This resulted in so much public outrage, surprising many people in the defense ministry. Without the power of public opinion, the chief of staff's apology wouldn't have been possible. STEWART (voice-over):  In addition, several officers have apologized, but were dishonorably discharged. Three officers face charges. But now, as Rina pursues a civil suit, four of the five officers have denied ever abusing her, despite their previous apology. The fifth has said he wants to reach a settlement. GONOI (through translator):  I felt like the perpetrators hadn't properly reflected on their actions. I want a sincere apology from the heart and for them to admit responsibility for what they did. STEWART (voice-over):  Rina's case sparked so much anger here in Tokyo and across Japan, the prime minister publicly committed to root out harassment in the military. GONOI (through translator):  I felt it was a little too late. When I joined the GSTF, I had a lot of dreams of what I wanted to achieve there. Had the GSTF fully investigated what happened to me, I feel like I could have stayed on there. Everything came too late. STEWART (voice-over):  Yet undefeated, Rina seeks strength as she fights for other women. Marc Stewart, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The ban does not apply to professionalpyrotechnics like these, which were on display during last year's Bastille Day festivities. But everyone else will be prohibited from selling, possessing or transporting fireworks until the 15th of July. Last month, demonstrators used fireworks to protest the fatal police shooting of a 17- year-old boy. And over the weekend, hundreds defied a ban to march against police brutality in the heart of Paris. Police dispersed the crowd from a public square and sent them to a wide boulevard where they marched largely but peacefully. You've probably heard of method acting where actors immerse themselves completely into their characters' minds to prepare for their roles, while the stars of the upcoming \"Barbie\" movie did it their own way.
