So, you could have just charged him with a minor violation and misdemeanor. In this case, they actually went the route of involuntary manslaughter.Now, interestingly enough, and again, on your show yesterday, we heard for the first time since charges were announced from the district attorney, and she told us that there's a host of evidence that includes the patterns and practices of unsafe practices on that set, as well as actor Alec Baldwin firing that weapon. And, of course, he has maintained that he never pulled the trigger but I asked the district attorney what she thinks. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we absolutely believe that the trigger had to have been pulled in order for that gun to go off. The trigger was pulled. Live rounds were there and they weren't checked. They should have been caught. Three people should have been -- should have been checking those projectiles and should have caught them. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAMPBELL: Interestingly here, Kate, also one new piece of information we learned on your show yesterday in that interview is you know there's this question about is an actor actually responsible for ensuring the safety of a gun. The district attorney told us that they actually went and consulted with actors including A-list actors who said that they always check the gun or at least have it checked in their presence. So, that was interesting information, obviously to learn. Now, as far as what happens. The next step is the charges will be filed by the end of this month. And then Alec Baldwin will receive a summon, and then he will enter some kind of plea. We, of course, expect that he is going to put up an aggressive defense, Kate.",

Thank you for doing that. Thanks for the hustle. Great work.Joining me now for more on this is Elizabeth Wagmeister. She's a chief correspondent at Variety. And Bernarda Villlona, a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor. Thank you both for being here. Bernardo, when you're looking at the statement from the district attorney, the evidence that is put before us so far, how hard is it to prove criminal negligence? How steep is the hill do you think it -- to prove this case? BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: It's going to be very difficult to prove criminal negligence at least when it goes to Alec Baldwin. It's different for Hannah Gutierrez because she was operating as the armorer, as the expert, as the person in charge that was supposed to take a look at this weapon before it was passed on to Alec Baldwin. She was supposed to make sure that there were dummy rounds that were in there. And she did it. That's why it rises to level -- to the level of criminal negligence. So, I don't think it's going to be difficult, as to her, Ms. Gutierrez but it's going to be difficult as to Alec Baldwin, that actor. Because they're charging that he should have looked and checked in the gun to make sure that it was a dummy, but that's not his job. That's not what he's trained to do. He's going by the word of the person that passed a gun to him. So, this is going to be a long fight and Alec Baldwin, he has a good chance of beating these charges. And that's what the information that we have, as of today. Because remember, not much information has been released, aside from that charges will be filed.",

Have been prosecuted thousands of cases involving guns, there is no way that gun could have gone off without pulling the trigger. Since the FBI expert already did the examination of the trigger pole, meaning how many pounds is required to put on your finger onto that trigger for that gun to go off?

I mean, practically nothing and certainly not what they were holding out for. So, I think it's just a question of how far to the brink are they going to go. You know, one thing I'm looking at is there are 18 Republican members who are in Biden seats. That sounds like a lot, but it's actually a very small number. It's a small number of moderates.

And if Congress is doing things that make that problem worse, that's going to be a disaster politically for both sides.But I do think, again, history has shown that the American people are able to distinguish who is -- you know, the -- who they are going to blame for a crisis like this. And last time around, Republicans were blamed. Last time around, though, Kate, there were 87 Republicans who voted to increase the debt limit. Do you see what I mean?
