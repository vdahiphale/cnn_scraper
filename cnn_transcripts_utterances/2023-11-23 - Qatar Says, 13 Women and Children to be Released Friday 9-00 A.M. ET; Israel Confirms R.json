That is really what we're going to see this even go into effect and see how smoothly the transfer of these 13 hostages does go.Oren, when you were listening, you know, you heard Becky Anderson asking there multiple questions, multiple really great questions, and we'll speak to her in just a moment, but she talked about what path these hostages are going to take, the 13 women and children who are going to the first to be released as a part of this temporary truce. He said he didn't want to go into details but he did talk about making sure that they are safe and secure, also you know getting that aid into Gaza as quickly as possible, which we know is expected to include fuel, which has been not something Israel has so far allowed to go into Gaza in a large quantity and has been you know very concerned about Hamas getting their hands on. That is expected, though, to be part of this significant aid shipment into Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. He was asked, would fuel be part of what was going in? And he said all types of aid would go in.Now, I don't know if he said specifically including fuel, but, clearly, that's the implication that fuel will be part of what's going in. And that's very much needed, for example, to power the hospitals, to power the sewage and water treatment facilities. So, that is a critical part of this agreement, even as we have focused, understandably so, on the hostage release and the Palestinian prisoners released. He did say, and he was confident when he said this, that the plan is, quote, concrete and ready to create a safe environment. So, you're right, that as even as he wouldn't go into the routes that would be taken out, he did say that the overarching goal here is to make sure that there is a safe environment and surroundings in Gaza for the hostages to be moved and for the Israeli hostages to come out of Gaza. It will be the Red Cross that takes them into custody from Hamas and then transfers them to the IDF. He was asked how many of the hostages are still alive. He did say we have no verifiable information on the number of hostages who are alive. So, that still remains very much an open question, even as we look at the first 50 here, the first 50 women and children to come out.",

Thank you, Becky Anderson.And, Kate, obviously, this is the news that so many of these families have been waiting for, that at midnight Eastern tonight, this temporary truce is going to go into place and that, based on what we just heard, if everything goes according to plan, 24 hours from now, we will see 13 women and civilian hostages released by Hamas in Gaza.

But after saying that, I can't really believe anything until I see them free and home.

One is that Carmel's mother, Kinelet (ph), was murdered that day, and we're going to have to tell her about it.It's going to be one of the first things we're going to say to her, I guess. And we didn't really plan how, and I think we're going to have -- I hope we're going to have help from health services or any other services in Israel of how to tell her that news. And the fact that many other hostages are going to stay there for longer than Carmel, hopefully not a lot longer, but longer, I really -- I hope it doesn't get that long, and I hope that this happy picture of people coming home is going to make the next deal come faster in a way so that finally, finally, all of the hostages are coming home. And I know I'm saying that a lot, but it's just -- it's so important for us. We are a really -- 240 hostages were taken or kidnapped October 7th. We're not letting go and we're not going anywhere.
