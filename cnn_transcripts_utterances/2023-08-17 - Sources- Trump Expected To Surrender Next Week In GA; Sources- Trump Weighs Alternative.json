And the bargain in that situation is that you can take the cases to court. You have every right. But in going to court, you also have to abide by the decisions of the court. Donald Trump failed to do that. Al Gore conceded the election, rightly and properly.

It's been going on for quite some time.That decision last week to appoint a special counsel means it will be going on for much longer. It also means it's likely to get trial unfolding in the midst of a presidential campaign. So of course, that raises questions with voters. When we talk to a variety of people inside the Biden orbit, they say, look, voters are concerned about the economy, they concerned about inflation and other matters, but is there a worry about this? That This is not something that is discussed with President Biden. A few advisers, who are very supportive of the president, are wondering if this is a blind spot for the president, is this a blind spot for the campaign? Right now, they do not believe it's a problem. Right now, they do not believe the voters will hold the president accountable for stuff his son may or may not have done because there is no link. However, we know Republicans are going to bring this up. Next week, at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, this will be a central debate. So the question is, has some of the moral high ground that President Biden has had against former President Donald Trump, will that be eroded some? This is something we will have to keep an eye on. Democrats are keeping an eye on it because they know this is very unusual. It's going to be unfolding at the same time as the presidential campaign. It's certainly not the same as the situation involving the former president, but it certainly raises questions in the minds of some voters, Republicans at least. Will that spill over to Independents and swing voters? We'll see.",

      "sentences": "A new push for accountability after the racist mass shooting at a grocery store in Buffalo. Attorneys representing survivors and a family member of one of the 10 people killed have filed two lawsuits.They named social media companies, gun manufacturers and a gun store, and the shooter's parents, alleging they facilitated and equipped the gunman who was sentenced to life in prison in February. According to one of the lawsuits, quote, \"Just as the shooter is being held to account criminally for his actions, the defendants named in this lawsuit must answer for the critical roles they played in facilitating this reprehensible mass shooting.\" Let's discuss with a legal expert. Areva Martin joins us now. She is a civil rights attorney and legal affairs commentator. Areva, thanks so much for being with us. So of all these defendants, the shooter's parents, the social media companies, gun makers and gun companies, which do you think is most likely to be found liable? AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; CNN LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: I think there is a good chance that the gun manufacturer has some responsibility and could be held to be accountable for the emotional damages that the survivors of the Tops market lawsuit have claimed in this action. This is a little unique because, in typical cases against gun manufacturers, it is the victims themselves or the family members of the victims, like we saw in Sandy Hook. But here, these bystanders, these witnesses are saying, look, we're traumatized by having to witness this mass shooting. We saw the Sandy Hook case. They sued the gun manufacturer. The Supreme Court refused to allow them to escape responsibility. That was true to state law in Connecticut. But ultimately, that case resulted in a $73 million settlement for the victims' families of the Sandy Hook shooting. So there is precedent for these losses. Even though there is a shield in federal law for gun manufacturers, that's starting to change.",

Because what we have seen over the last couple of years, in particular, with respect to school districts, school districts have been suing social media companies claiming that the content on these various Web sites is causing increases in anxiety, depression and even suicide rates among students.So there is a big push to hold social media companies responsible for the content on their sites. And, again, by federal statute, these social media companies have enjoyed a great deal of immunity and haven't been held accountable. But in this lawsuit, they're saying this shooter was radicalized on social media. Passages from his diary and other statements that he made where he said he hatched this idea to shoot these African- Americans based on what he saw online.",

And particularly, I think the plaintiffs may have a difficult time with respect to the parents because the shooter was 18 at the time. So he was of legal age. He's an adult. So I don't see a court holding these parents responsible. But I do think this lawsuit and others like this, where there are mass shootings, are really, really important. They're drawing what we saw with litigation against the tobacco companies, where tobacco companies were held accountable. We saw nuclear verdicts against those companies and those verdicts had an exponential impact on smoking, decreasing smoking because of the liability that tobacco companies eventually started to face in the courts.",

We're not sure what happened to that class-action lawsuit. It was closed in 2020. Possibly there was a settlement and a confidentiality agreement was entered into. But I would not be surprised if we didn't start seeing more class- action lawsuits filed, again, not just by the victims or the family members of the victims. But by bystanders that have to witness the kind of trauma that we can only imagine, you know, happens when you watch someone get gunned down in a way that these witnesses did and these bystanders at the Tops market.",
