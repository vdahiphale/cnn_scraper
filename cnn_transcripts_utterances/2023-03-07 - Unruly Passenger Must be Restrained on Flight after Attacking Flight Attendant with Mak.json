And he started rambling about his father is Dracula, the Nazis, just a lot of rambling. And he was just getting louder and louder.A couple of passengers tried to talk to him to calm him down. It was only making him more agitated. A woman tried to approach him and say that he was scaring the passengers. He didn't care. He was getting louder. And then a very large, like built guy started walking from the back of the plane up to him, and when he saw that, he kind of jumped out of his seat and got in the aisle and started to like fight him, or attempt to kind of pretend to fight him. I didn't see a weapon in his hand at that point, but he was -- my husband was in the aisle seat, so he was standing like right next to my husband. I didn't see the spoon shank until I saw the video after, after that. And then he turned and ran towards the front of the plane. The United crew was amazing. They locked the first class entrance which led to the cockpit. The flight attendants were there. Many men from the plane jumped up, followed him, tackled him to the ground, and there were probably about four to six of them that sat on top of him to restrain him. The flight crew immediately had zip-ties to zip-tie his feet and his arms. He was still screaming. And he somehow escaped from the zip- ties. They put new ones on him, and as the men were getting tired from retraining him, they kind of swapped out, and the ones that were tired would come back to sit down.

I just also wouldn't be able to work in America. Well, because if you went over Tucker Carlson, if you give Tucker Carlson everything he wants. He's never going to say a bad word about you. And I got to tell you, between Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson, they're even more powerful than Donald Trump. I mean, Donald Trump gets his talking points from Tucker Carlson.",
