So far, the GOP is trying to convince you that she is a DEI hire, a San Francisco liberal, the border czar, crazy, nuts, dumb as a rock. Democrats aren't very impressed with all of that, and neither is her husband, the second gentleman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because I remember I read that book and my thought was if this were a black person writing about black people, I would hate this dude's guts. There's no way around it. And that is what the pushback against it is. That's Andy Beshear saying he ain't like us.It's everybody pushing back on this idea that somehow Vance had insight into these people when these people are actually saying he hates us and we hate them back. It feels to me like the vice presidential nominee for the Democrats needs to be somebody that can speak to the median voter in those swing states. That seemed to be the value that Joe Biden provided to Obama more than anything else was the ability to speak to that median voter who we think of as a working class white man and be able to say I speak your language and this guy is okay with him. It seems that Harris would be somebody who needs something similar. And that's part of why all these people auditioning, are looking at J.D. Vance like he is food. They are going to eat every time they see him because it's like dunking on an eight-foot goal. It's the easiest target in the world.",
