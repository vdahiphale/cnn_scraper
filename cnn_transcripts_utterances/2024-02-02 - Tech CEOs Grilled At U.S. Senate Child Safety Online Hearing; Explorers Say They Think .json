Answer is fewer than 10%, according to a recent Women in Aviation Advisory Board report for the Federal Aviation Administration. A team of underwater archeologists and marine robotics experts believe they found a clue to what happened to aviation legend Amelia Earhart, who`s plain mysteriously went missing 87 years ago. Earhart was a pilot who broke both gender stereotypes and aviation records, becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, and first pilot to fly solo and nonstop across the U.S. Her final flight on July 2nd, 1937, became one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in American history. She had an ambitious goal to become the first woman to fly around the world and made it two thirds of the way. Then Amelia`s plane went missing. But as CNN`s Jeremy Roth explains, a group of deep-sea explorers believe they found the plane. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Members of the local Groundhog Club, yes, they`re such a thing, dress in hats and tuxedos and await the hero of the day. Punxsutawney Phil. The crowd gathers to see whether Phil will see his shadow upon arising from his burrow. According to old Pennsylvania Dutch superstition, if he does, it means six more weeks of winter. If not, it`s said that spring will come early. Our meteorologist Allison Chinchar is here for more details. And you may remember, Ms. Alli always matches her graphics or the weather theme of the day and for this special day, she breaks out her famous Punxsutawney Phil hat.",

Now, in the past he has had a wide variety of predictions, but here`s the thing. He has seen his shadow way more times than he has not. You`re talking over a hundred times. He has seen his shadow just since 1887. About a fifth of that he has not seen his shadow, meaning we would have an early spring. But the real question is, is he accurate? Is he even right when he makes these predictions? Technically speaking, statistically Phil is only right about 40% of the time, so not exactly a great forecaster, but the good news is, regardless of what Phil actually picks, if you don`t like it, chances are there`s another groundhog across the country somewhere that will give you the prediction you do want to hear, including some pretty colorful names like General Beauregard Lee in Georgia, Staten Island Chuck in New York, Illinois, Wisconsin and Ohio also have some very interesting name groundhogs, which will also make their predictions later today.",
