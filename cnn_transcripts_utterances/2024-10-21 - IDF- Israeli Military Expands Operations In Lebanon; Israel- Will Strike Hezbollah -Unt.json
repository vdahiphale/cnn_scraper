As the humanitarian crisis deepens, Israel is stepping up its military operations in Lebanon and in Northern Gaza as well. Across Lebanon, the IDF says it is broadening its attacks to include financial institutions linked to Hezbollah. Since Israel ramped up strikes against the Iran-backed militant group last month, more than 1,800 people have been killed in Lebanon, with a fifth, a fifth of its population now displaced. At the same time, the U.N. is warning that Israel may be destroying the Palestinian population in Northern Gaza. All of this has America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, heading back to the Middle East today. The U.N. secretary of state -- U.S. rather, secretary of state, will try to kick start stalled ceasefire talks to end the Gaza War and bring the hostages home. His visit follows the death of Hamas' leader, Yahya Sinwar, just last week. CNN's Kylie Atwood is standing by at the U.S. State Department. We've also got Paula Hancocks who is live for us in Abu Dhabi. Paula, let me begin with you. Israel has been targeting what it says are Hezbollah's financial institutions in Lebanon. Meantime, the U.S. is desperate for some kind of diplomatic institution. Just give us the very latest here.",

This idea that Amos Hochstein is, of course, in Beirut meeting with the Speaker of Parliament, just trying to see if there's a way to bring the hostilities in Lebanon to an end. We also know that Antony Blinken is on his way to the region as well. And U.S. officials, American officials, have really been pushing for Israel to use the killing of Yahya Sinwar as some kind of an off-ramp. Very few people believe that is likely to happen, and that is likely to signal the end of this war. So, what exactly is the American strategy going to be in order to push for some kind of a diplomatic solution here, Kylie? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, U.S. officials aren't being explicit in describing what that strategy actually looks like other than to really drive home, as you said, this message that this should be a moment of opportunity, a moment to drive forth and end to the conflict in Gaza. The secretary of state, his top priority item as he heads to Israel and then on to other states -- countries, excuse me, in the region, is to discuss that and to figure out how to galvanize not only the Israelis, but the other countries that the U.S. has been working on, post-conflict plans with, to really cement those plans and see what is possible here. So, as we watch, this is a trip that really tests their proposition that this is a moment of opportunity because they can state it, but whether or not they're able to capitalize on it will really be dictated by what the Israelis are saying to them, of course what the other countries in the region are saying, and then also the question of who is negotiating on behalf of Hamas going forward. With the death of Sinwar, obviously, the U.S. had said that was the major impediment to getting a hostage release deal, a ceasefire deal in place, but they also don't have a clear answer today as to who is the decision maker for Hamas going forward. And so that's something that they'll be discussing with, of course, Qataris and Egyptians, potentially, who have been in touch with Hamas throughout the ongoing efforts over the last year to try and drive forth a solution to this issue. And so this is a pivotal week for the secretary of state heading back on the road, of course, while the backdrop is that U.S. elections here, presidential elections, are just two weeks away from tomorrow. So time is truly of the essence for the Biden administration, and they are highly aware of that.",

The U.S. presidential candidates are turning up the heat in the last 15 days of their campaigns. Right now, Kamala Harris and former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney are sitting down for a moderated conversation in the key state of Pennsylvania. Harris has enlisted the conservative politician to help in the so-called blue wall states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. And Donald Trump is in North Carolina at this hour. Of course, that state still recovering from Hurricane Helene. He's answering questions for the media. And then will hold a rally and meet with faith leaders in that state as well. Kevin Liptak is joining us live now from Washington, of course, with details. So just in terms of Kamala Harris working alongside Liz Cheney, I mean, we've seen Kamala Harris work with quite a few anti-Trump Republicans. How important are these figures?

This may well be the last seniorofficial under the Biden administration to visit Ukraine now that we're just over two weeks out from the election. And 400 million is certainly good. That's the third aid package promised of that type of size in the last month and it's bigger than the ones that we've seen in the preceding months. Aid definitely has been ramping up. The Biden administration has really been, I think, frontloading it, trying to accelerate it ahead of the election. But obviously that is the elephant in the room here. Ukraine is incredibly concerned. This election is existential for it. At least that's the way it sees it. President Zelensky just in the U.S. had to contend with being entangled in partisan politics and the rhetoric from former President Trump becoming increasingly negative towards Ukraine, as well as the fact, of course, that his running mate, J.D. Vance, has actively opposed aid for Ukraine. So I think messages like this one from Lloyd Austin will be welcomed, but also will be tinged with the shadow of that upcoming election. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We've moved heaven and earth to help Ukraine, and that inspiring coalition of more than 50 allies and partners continues to stand united to provide your country with the security assistance that Ukraine needs to prevail. Under President Biden's leadership, the United States remains committed to keeping up this support. And so I'm pleased to announce today the commitment of a $400 million presidential drawdown package to provide your forces with additional munitions, armored vehicles, and any tank weapons.

Aerial attacks have gone up exponentially in the past few months. And just overnight into this morning, just hours before Secretary Austin's arrival, Russia fired some 116 attack drones and three missiles at Ukraine, roughly half of which Ukraine was able to shoot down. So it is really in need of more air defenses. I think one thing that didn't come out of this that Ukraine is very much watching for is that issue of long-range Western-provided missiles, including the U.S. ATACMS and whether restrictions will be lifted so that Ukraine can use them to hit military targets inside of Russia. That did come up in the discussions, but as yet, we don't see any change in U.S. policy on that.",

They would like to join the E.U. As you say, a razor thin majority. I think it equates to just 11,000 votes or somewhere in that region, which means they don't really have the overwhelming mandate that they were hoping for to continue with these E.U. talks. As you say, so much controversy here.  CNN was reported just last week that a kremlin-linked organization, spearheaded by a Moldovan oligarch, was effectively buying votes for cash. All of this feeding into it and the incumbent president speaking in the last few hours said, the Moldovan authorities had clear evidence that these criminal groups aim to buy 300,000 votes, a fraud of unprecedented scale.

Professor, thank you so much for being with us. Let's just talk about what's happening in Lebanon right now. We're seeing these Israeli strikes targeting financial institutions that they say, the Israelis are saying is linked to Hezbollah in terms of financing Hezbollah.

I mean, it's only the widening of the Israeli air bomb campaign that has been started maybe two months ago with, you know, the killing, the targeted killings and then the pager operations and then the ongoing striking campaign. I think we could have seen it coming. Israel is widening the circle of its targeting. I think it's now targeting the civilian infrastructure of Hezbollah. And then probably later on the civilian infrastructure of the country itself. The aim is actually very obvious. It's to really push the Lebanese government and then the Lebanese society to, quote-unquote, distance itself and maybe rebel at some point against Hezbollah in order to obtain a ceasefire or a completely new security arrangement the like of which the American special envoy today, Amos Hochstein, was bringing on the table to the Lebanese officials. So I think that we have to expect for the coming two, three weeks, until at least the American elections, a widening of this Israeli campaign that is now hitting, as you said, the financial infrastructure of Hezbollah, maybe tomorrow the civilian infrastructure, not only of the party, but of the country itself.",

A lot of people are saying that you have the likes of Netanyahu, who really deep down is not interested in any kind of ceasefire because it doesn't benefit him politically.

I'm not sure that, first of all, this attempt is very serious, I would say, because it included some conditions that I think the American party knew the Lebanon -- the Lebanese government could not accept, at least until now, with the prevailing balance of powers between Hezbollah and Israel. Second, I think Hochstein, I mean, the U.S. administration knows very well also that Bibi Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu, is really not interested today in a ceasefire in Lebanon, unless or until he has succeeded in radically changing the balance of power and the conditions on the ground, which are far to be actually changed. So I think that this was an attempt to be saluted and to be commanded, but I think that this attempt will unfortunately join other attempts at ceasefires that were vain and non-conclusive.",

The theory of the Harris campaign is that theremoderate Republicans, people who are old-fashioned Republicans who can't stand Trump and conserved to be leading independents who might be out there for Kamala Harris to pick off and add to her column. And in these swing states which you mentioned, which are very close to these blue wall states that helped Biden win the presidency four years ago, you know, a few thousand votes could be very important. This is particularly interesting because Liz Cheney is a deeply conservative former member of the House. She basically sacrificed her career in the House leadership to campaign against Trump, who she sees as a massive threat to the Constitution. So this is pushing forward Harris' argument in the last few weeks that Trump is a great danger. He would threaten American democracy and that he's unfit for the Oval Office.",

Whether this will actually come to anything in the last two weeks, I think we could see some legal challenges. The governor of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, basically said that this needs to be looked into. Of course, if they did try to block it, the Pennsylvania authorities, they'd be accused by mask of election interference was exactly what he wants because he's supporting Donald Trump and he's attacking the institutions of the U.S. government and backing up Trump's claims in that regard that, you know, the election system isn't fair. So I think he has them in a little bit of a trap here. But it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out, whether it really makes a big influence on the outcome of the election in these key swing states is a little bit doubtful. We've seen tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of new registrations taking place.

It was a break in the alliance and perhaps thefirst public sign of a power struggle between the two men. Erdogan later outlawed Gulen's movement and branded it a terror group. But it was the events of July 15, 2016 that would change the country for years to come. F-16s bombed parliament in the capital city, and armored tanks rolled into positions on the main bridge connecting Asia to Europe and Istanbul. Erdogan quickly blamed Gulen for that failed coup. And his government began a major crackdown. Thousands of people suspected of having links to Gulen were fired from their jobs and arrested. Gulen, meanwhile, lived a quiet life in Pennsylvania despite multiple requests to the United States to extradite him back to Turkey, leaving behind a devout following and a controversial legacy that made him one of the most influential men in Turkey's modern history.

Now, as you said, Combs is denying them, but theseare the seven latest lawsuits to add to this deluge of lawsuits that Combs has been facing for the past year. This is the 26th civil suit that he is facing. And what is different about this group of lawsuits, Zain, is that it's the first time in print in a lawsuit that other celebrities are also accused of wrongdoing. We know that in the indictment that federal prosecutors had said that they do not believe that Combs acted alone. Remember, that they have accused him of running a criminal enterprise, but this is the first time that actually in lawsuits it is in print that celebrities also allegedly sexually assaulted some of these accusers. Now none of these celebrities are named. The lawsuits actually point out that they are unnamed at this moment. But one of the accusers, Zain, alleges that she was a 13-year-old girl at the time that she was allegedly drugged and raped by Combs. She says that this happened in the year 2000 at an after party for the MTV Video Music Awards. She said that she was brought to the party by a limousine driver who said that he worked for Combs and told her that Combs allegedly liked younger girls. Now, I want to read you part of her lawsuit, Zain. It says, quote, after drinking just one drink, plaintiff began to feel woozy and lightheaded, making her need to lie down. Soon after, Combs, along with a male and female celebrity, entered the room. The lawsuit then goes on to say that she was sexually assaulted, both by Combs and by that unnamed male celebrity. This is not the only accuser today who is alleging that a celebrity was also involved and a active participant in the alleged sexual assault. There is a male John Doe, who is a personal trainer who says that in 2022 that he was also allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs and a celebrity.",
