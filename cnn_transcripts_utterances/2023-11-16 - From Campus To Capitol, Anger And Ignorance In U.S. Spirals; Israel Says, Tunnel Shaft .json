Go to TikTok right now and try searching Letter to America or Osama Letter or Osama bin Laden or bin Laden Letter and you won't get any hits. But if you had searched those terms before midday yesterday, you would have seen something strange and something hateful. Americans reading from a two decades-old screed from the Al Qaeda terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks that murdered nearly 3,000 people. Not just reading the letter, but celebrating it. Influencer types saying their entire world view had changed. 14 million people watched other Americans essentially say a homicidal maniac sounded like he made sense. The letter was warehoused on The Guardian's website, and as you can see, it has now been removed, but not before TikTok pushed droves of viewers there. The White House felt obligated to say the obvious out loud. There is never a justification for spreading the repugnant, evil and anti-Semitic lies that the leader of Al Qaeda issued after committing the worst terrorist attack in American history. Violence is as old as Cain and Abel, but hate and anger seem to be becoming a regular feature of American life, on college campuses, like Brandeis, like George Washington and elsewhere, like Cornell, where some students now live in fear.

The influencers were reckless and ignorant. And, you know, Osama bin Laden didn't die enough for me. You know, I have five tattoos dated on my back. And the day he died is tattooed on my back. This is the most evilest man to ever walk the Earth and he killed over 3,000 family members that didn't go home that day, that didn't go home to their families. Those people still, many of them, haven't had closure. But it's not just those innocent lives that were lost. It was the 343 firefighters, the 23 NYPD, the 37 Port Authority. And then the following years, of all those veterans who went to war, who died in combat, or lost their leg, or has PTSD, or has a brain injury. Osama bin Laden is still being felt today, his violence, his evil, his pure hatred for mankind is still being felt today. And now it's being picked up recklessly on -- listen, I get social media, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, everybody, most people. You know, look at me, look at me. I did this, I do that, I did this. Good for them. I do it too on Twitter. I'm not on TikTok. But we have a responsibility. You know, I'm a kidney donor to a complete stranger. That's how you influence others to do good.

A unilateral ceasefire without providing any response where Hamas has to implement a ceasefire, where Hamas has to turn over the Israeli civilians who they've taken hostage, that's meaningless. It only means it gives time for Hamas to regroup.And for the performative kinds of protests that we saw last night at the DNC, you know, I was on the National Mall on Tuesday when there were nearly 300,000 supporters of Israel peacefully marching, not really marching, just standing in unison, quietly listening to the speakers. That was the kind of demonstration of support for Israel. Clearly, there was an attempt to change the media narrative, and we saw that last night from a small group. But the American-Jewish community stands firm behind the idea of ensuring that the security of Israel is real. In the United States, we're taking the right position to ensure that they have the time and space needed to protect their southern border. And I'm glad that President Biden is articulating a very strong point that we must ensure that Israel is protecting civilian lives. And he is pushing Israel on that. But all of that comes together.

And this is brought about because of the Adult Survivors Act which allows cases involving sexual assault in this window to be brought no matter what the statute of limitations was on them.But in this case, what Cassie Ventura is alleging is a cycle of violence, that there was abuse, that there was cruelty, that there was actually sexual abuse, rape, sex trafficking in New York and California, and sexual battery. She says that employees of Sean Diddy Combs would watch or they would have knowledge of what was happening, that she was so bruised that she would be kicked and punched to the ground, blood everywhere, and they wouldn't say anything out of loyalty. She also says in regard to the sex trafficking that Sean Diddy Combs himself recorded it on his electronic devices and told her he was going to keep them. She also says that the head of security saw how bloody she was at one point and together they cried but he did nothing about it. At one time she says she went home to her mother in Connecticut. Her mother took pictures of her bruises. She talks about a hotel in Los Angeles and she had been with him in a room and she was so bruised and she left. But then she decided she needed to come back and apologize to him. The hotel wouldn't let her back in their facility saying you just leave. You go home. She says the age difference had to do with why this all happened. She was 20 -- she was 19 when they met. He was 37. She also says that his empire, his status, allowed this to happen. Now, there are two sides to every story and this is the response we got from Ben Broffman, the attorney for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. He said for the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura's persistent demand of $30 million under the threat of writing a damaging book about the relationship which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail. Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs' reputation and seeking a payday. So, the next step in all of this, an answer will be filed by the defendant, Mr. Combs. We'll see how they answer this complaint and this will proceed in the Southern District of New York.",
