But CNN is learning so many House Republicans are furious about it. See how this plays out. Plus, can the President sell voters on Bidenomics? We're waiting President Biden's speech on the better than expected jobs report, and I'll talk to Republican Congressman Larry Bucshon who does he wants to be Speaker does Trump's endorsement matter and more that's ahead. Hello, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world is 11 am here in Washington Friday, October 6. Now been three days without a Speaker of the House. There are 101 days until the Iowa caucus and we are just 395 days from Election Day. This is today's \"State of the Race\". We are tracking new developments in the race to be the next House Speaker. Congressman Jim Jordan says he will not be participating in that joint debate. We just mentioned with fellow Republicans Kevin Hearne and Steve Scalise on Monday because he wants to meet with the conference on Tuesday first. Scalise and Jordan have declared that they are running to replace Kevin McCarthy. And there's speculation that Hearn might also run. Jordan's apparent withdrawal or at least rescheduling comes after some Republicans responded angrily to the news of the debate. Words used to describe it to CNN include insanity, a circus, horrible idea, not productive. All of this, of course, coming after President Donald Trump endorsed Jordan to be the next Speaker that came overnight. Trump called Jordan a STAR and said he'd be a great Speaker. Jordan spoke with CNN's Manu Raju about being Trump's pick. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Look, I like the job I got now. I never wanted to do this job. But someone has to who can bring the team together and can go communicate to the country and that's why I'm running.",

I don't really know what else to say about it. Kristen, let me start with you, because first of all, Fox News is going to do this as they're calling it a joint interview. But it feels like a debate. The reason these Republicans are angry about it is because it would pre-empt them being set to hear from these members themselves behind closed doors, they want that prerogative I think we'll see how this plays out. But I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility. That basically it just gets pushed until later in the week, once many of these Republicans have had a chance to hear from them, themselves. But the fact that it's happening at all is so Trumpian to me, right? Like the idea that all of a sudden the race for the Speaker of the House of Representatives is something that we're going to see play out on television is crazy. And on top of it, you have the Trump endorsement. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes.

You know, who are, if we're thinking about it as being a human being first, are sympathizing with, empathizing with people who have lost their homes, right? Democrats were kind of leading with that messaging in 2016, saying this is inhumane, we can't possibly do this. But this is getting to be more and more difficult. And do you think that there is a path to figuring out how to solve this issue in a humane way? Or are we going to be stuck in this, like vortex of, you know, accusations of xenophobia and racism, you know, for time eternal? BARRON-LOPEZ: I think that for the foreseeable future, we will continue to see xenophobic attacks from primarily Republican candidates for President, in the way that they talk about migration, and in the way that they call it an invasion. Repeatedly, that's from Texas Governor Greg Abbott. That's from Ron DeSantis. And we know that similar language has also been used by mass shooters who repeat the great replacement theory, which is an anti-Semitic racist theory that migrants are coming into the United States to replace white people and white culture. But on the Democratic side, I think that the President can certainly and the Vice President can certainly attempt to talk about how they want to make the system more humane. But the reality is, as Ashley said, right now, it's very much they continue on with a maybe more hardline harsh policy. And then they open up work permits for Venezuelans, and then they try to launch a parole app, but then they also build a section of the border wall.
