But we're now learning about a possible navigation issue. Stand by for our live team coverage of this milestone event.And we'll get reaction from two icons, former astronaut, Mae Jemison, and Star Trek actor and real life space traveler William Shatner. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. The breaking news this hour, a very suspenseful attempt to try to return to the moon. We're standing by for a U.S. spacecraft to try to land on the lunar surface, a challenge that hasn't been successfully accomplished by anyone in this country for half a century. Our space experts, Kristin Fisher and Miles O'Brien, they are both here along with the trailblazing former astronaut, Mae Jemison, and Star Trek legend William Shatner. Kristin, let's start with you. We just learned there has been a last minute adjustment of problem. What do we know? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, the NASA administrator just said that this is essentially an Apollo 13 moment, although there are no astronauts on board this lunar lander. This is just a robotic lunar lander. So, of course, there is a lot less at stake here. But still, what the NASA administrator means by that, Wolf, is that, essentially, there's been a big problem with the navigation system on this Odysseus lunar lander. And so right now, the company that made and is operating this spacecraft, Intuitive Machines, is trying to come up with a fix on the fly. And what they're trying to do is use a NASA instrument, an experimental payload, to try to salvage this mission. And Bill Nelson was just on our air talking about this. That's the NASA administrator and the former senator from Florida. I'm going to let him explain exactly what's going on right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, Wolf, this is really a make-or-break moment for the first U.S. lunar landing mission since the end of the Apollo program in 1972.Just to get a little bit technical here, you know how radar works, right? Radar is radio waves bouncing off things. You're able to tell how far something is away from you. LiDAR is using light instead of radio waves. So, that's how this works. It's trying to bounce light off the surface of the moon so that the spacecraft and try to find a safe place to land and avoid all those craters and boulders and dead volcanoes that are all over that south pole of the moon in particular. So, two key milestones here, we've got two more possible attempts for Odysseus. First attempt is at 6:24. If that doesn't work, then it's going to take place at, or they're going to try at 8:24 two hours later because that's how long it takes to orbit the moon. And then the big question is if it doesn't happen at 6:24, what happens at 8:24? Do they crash it into the moon or does it just perhaps drift off in space? The NASA administrator said he did not know. And then finally, I should just point out, you know, we're talking about the NASA administrator a lot here. This is not a NASA mission. This is a private mission. NASA essentially sponsored this mission and is a paying customer with six payloads on board.",

This is all they got. These laser capabilities, the one that's on board, the Nova-C, Odysseus spacecraft, when it failed, they had this one other option. There's no way for them to know how quickly they're approaching the surface or their horizontal speed as well.

And we've always known that failure is an option when you're dealing with something like this.You know, Wolf, this would be the second failure of NASA's brand new Clips program. What this is is an initiative where they're trying to outsource all robotic landings on the moon to allow NASA to focus on the human landings on the moon through its Artemis program. But just last month, another private company called Astrobotic Technology, its lunar lander, tried but failed to land on the surface of the moon. It failed just a few hours after liftoff. One month later, we have our second attempt, Intuitive Machines. And now, as the NASA administrator just said, this is a white-knuckle moment for this mission. And so what happens next? It could either crash on the moon. It could drift off into space. We just don't know yet. Intuitive Machines, this is a really small team. This is a small company. They're operating on a shoestring budget, just $100 million. And they have put so much into this. You have to imagine that that Mission Control right now is just on the edge of their seat trying to scramble and figure out a solution to this.",

This is a really sensitive moment indeed.Miles, how would a failure tonight -- we hope there isn't a failure, but how would a failure tonight impact future missions to the moon? O'BRIEN:  Oh, they'll keep pressing on, Wolf. This is part of a long- running program, this commercial lunar payload services program that NASA is doing, to try to create a robust, you know, commercial enterprise on the moon. Everything they do up to possibly landing or not tonight will be chalked up as a learning experience. There are four missions ahead for this company and others as they try to land robotic systems on the moon. And as time goes on, they're going to figure this out. But as Kristin pointed out, they're doing it for pennies on the dollar. It cost us an inflation adjusted dollars, but a trillion bucks to get to the moon. It was 4 percent of the national budget. And this is a private enterprise. NASA is the main customer, and so it's speaking on behalf of Intuitive Machines a lot. But, basically, this is a smaller company trying to do something that is very bold, and each time they do it, they're going to get a little smarter. So, it's not going to be a cataclysm in that respect. I'm sure there'll be a lot of sad faces in Houston if it doesn't work out, however.",

Whether or not you can do this autonomously makes a difference as well. What does that mean? Autonomously means that everything that happens is right there.And I think Miles O'Brien used the example and I was going to be used is that when you have a human in the loop close up, you have the opportunity to make adjustments that you didn't have before. The real challenge that we have is to find out now whether or not we can connect systems together on the fly. NASA has done that before, we've done that before as humans. And the other challenge is not to be deterred if something doesn't go absolutely correct because we learn every time. And I also heard that the comments about how much it cost to go to the moon in adjusted dollars in the past versus now and working with commercial, we have to remember that right now commercial is building up on everything that we learned through the 60s, the Gemini, the Mercury, the Apollo programs, other countries landing. We have new technology like LiDAR and other things that have been built into this much more computing power. So this is just, again, a way of understanding how we can do this, really checking this through. So, the challenges are, yes, let's make sure we have these connections and it's integrated and it's able to work, but at the same time, don't lose faith, don't lose hope or think that this is not worth it.",

But you also have to wonder, and you heard the flight controllers wondering what sort of condition the spacecraft is in. Did it successfully soft land, or did it perhaps tip over, which is what happened to Japan's lunar lander, the slim lander, the Moon Sniper, as it was called. It did successfully soft land, but then it kind of tipped over. So, that's something that the team is watching for right now. But if this is a success, and it is too soon to say that it's a success, let's just think about some of the firsts here. First time a private company has ever done this, the first time an American-made spacecraft has landed on the surface of the moon since 1972, if indeed it is a success. And then the other big first, this would be the first time that any spacecraft has successfully landed in that spot on the south pole of the moon. And that is significant because it's a more treacherous spot where a lot of the Apollo missions tried to land. But it's also potentially a much more significant spot because that is where scientists believe you can find water in the form of ice.

They also want to use it to perhaps build a base there. So, for the folks at Intuitive Machines, this is a moment that they just hoped would happen. But you have to think these last few hours, when they switched the landing time two or three times. First, it was 5:30, then 4:30, then 6:30. They were really scrambling, trying to troubleshoot that navigation issue. And I thought Miles O'Brien brought up such a great point. During the Apollo 11 missions, obviously, those spacecraft had to be rated to fly humans. That's a totally different class of spacecrafts. But it had the advantage of having not just any human's eyes, but Neil Armstrong, the very skilled pilot's eyes, looking out the window and being able to find a safe landing spot. If it weren't for that fact, Apollo 11 would never have made it. It was coming down right on a boulder field.

And the -- these men who had worked for year -- and women who had worked for years to make their mission possibility, land and they're filled with the joy of this, this work. We're doing something that has never been done before.Here, there's a small group, some desultory applause. We landed. But it's huge. It's -- this is a huge event. How many nations, count them, landed or attempted to land on the moon and failed? We were possibly failing but through a series of technical, technological advancement and also, I'm sorry to say it, a great deal of human luck which should be important to note because luck has many aspects. I was thrilled with the fact that this beginning is a success",

All of us were thrilled to hear that because we knew that would be the first really official sign that things are moving in the right direction despite this last-minute problem that developed.The exact wording. And I just want to make sure we have that exact wording. Our equipment is on the surface of the moon. So when will we really know id get pictures of all of that and the details?",

And that'll be a picture that was taken by the lunar lander itself.And then if everything goes according to plan, if all of the equipment is functioning and intact, between an hour, and three hours after landing is when Intuitive Machines has said that we will get the first picture of the lunar lander on the moon. And the way they did that was they actually had a little pop off piece of technology, a little piece that was on the spacecraft that pops off so that when Odysseus was landing, it was able to get a shot of Odysseus, you know, with the moon in the background. So that would be even better confirmation for what exact kind of shape this lunar lander is in. You're right. It's important to point out the language that they used. Our equipment is on the surface of the moon, of course, there are still questions about what kinds of condition it's in given their communication issues, given the issues that they had with that navigation system. But the fact that you have the CEO of Intuitive Machines coming out and saying, Odysseus has a new home, you have the control room down in Houston, Texas, applauding. I think there's a certain degree of confidence that this mission has been a success. But, of course, there are some questions. And like I mentioned before, Japan's moon sniper, it was dubbed a success in terms of the fact that it made a soft landing, but then it did tip over. So there's questions about that with Odysseus as well.",

The Justice Department obtained a new warrant for his arrest from the judge that is going to oversee this case eventually in Los Angeles, Alexander Smirnov is charged with lying to the FBI and falsifying documents.But those charges are actually filed in Los Angeles. He was arrested in Las Vegas where that detention hearing happened just a couple of days ago and where that judge decided to release him, saying that the political ramifications and all the issues that the justice department had raised were not sufficient to keep him detained. I'll read you just a part of what the lawyer said to us today. He said: Despite Judge Albregts's prior ruling, denial of the state request, and Mr. Smirnov's prior release from custody on the morning of February 22. Mr. Smirnov was arrested for a second time on the same charges, and based on the same indictment, while he was meeting with his lawyers, Wolf. So, that's what the status at this moment. Just a few minutes ago, the judge in Las Vegas just issued an order for the Justice Department to respond to a request by Smirnov's lawyers for an emergency hearing. So at this point, he's going to be remained detained while this works itself out, Wolf.",
