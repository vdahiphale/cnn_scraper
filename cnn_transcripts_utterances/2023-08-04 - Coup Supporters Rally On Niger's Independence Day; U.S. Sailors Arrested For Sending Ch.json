Pro-military supporters turned out in force for the country's Independence Day on Thursday protesting the recent sanctions against their country. The regional and international pressure has increased against coup leaders pushing for a return to democracy.CNN's Stephanie Busari joining us now from Lagos, Nigeria. Hi, Stephanie. You know, we're also finally hearing from the ousted president. In a Washington Post op-ed he says, quote, \"If this coup succeeds it will have devastating consequences for the country and the entire world.\" Bring us up to speed on the latest, Stephanie.",

      "sentences": "Amara, a crucial deadline is looming this weekend.The regional body here known as the ECOWAS has given the nation's military ruler until Sunday to reinstate President Bazoum or else they have threatened military action. And there's a very real threat that could go ahead as latest attempts at diplomacy have failed in the past hour. A delegate -- a delegation that ECOWAS sent to Niger has returned -- has left the country, we're hearing, without even seeing the military ruler. So it's looking very likely that troops will be deployed to Niger on Sunday when this deadline expires. And what people are saying here -- what people are telling me is that ECOWAS does not want to be seen as weak. They want to show that they are going to be very tough against coup leaders and people who oust democratically-elected rulers. Don't forget, Niger is bordered by Mali and Burkina Faso, just two of five countries who have also pushed out -- taken over power by force. And so, this is a very fragile region. There are real fears here that a region that's already beset by extremism from al Qaeda, from ISIS, from Boko Harem will now face a very real prospect of combat in this country. And Mali and Burkina Faso have already said that if this military action happens it will be a declaration of war, Amara.",

Forty-one years old in her 19th season, but she's still out there just dominating. Last night, Taurasi, yet another milestone becoming the first WNBA player ever to reach 10,000 career points. How incredible is that feat? Well, no other WNBA player even has 7,500 points. Taurasi -- a big night, scoring 42 -- the first 40-point game for her since 2010. The Mercury would beat the Dream easily 91-71. Here is Taurasi after her big night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DIANA TAURASI, WNBA ALL-TIME LEADING SCORER: When you do something you love and you obsess with it, you just always want to push the limits, and sometimes pushing the limits have gotten me in trouble. But I just love the game. I just put everything into it. And to have a night like this in front of our fans and people that I've known for a long time that have really helped me get here, it couldn't have been any better. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

According to multiple reports, Arizona is expected to soon announce a move to the Big 12. The Wildcats would be the second Pac-12 school to announce its departure for the Big 12 in a week, joining Colorado. And with USC and UCLA going to the Big 10, that leaves the Pac-12 with just eight schools. The news gets even worse for the conference as the Big 10 also hasstarted to explore adding Oregon and Washington. All right, to baseball where Angels superstar Shohei Ohtani pitched four shutout innings against the Mariners last night before finger cramps forced him off the mound. But he stayed in the game as a designated hitter and delivered in the eighth inning a Major League- leading 40th home run of the season. Ohtani -- he still has a chance to threaten the American League season single home run record of 62, but he's slightly behind Aaron Judge's pace. In the end, though, Ohtani's homer went to waste after Seattle's Cade Marlowe launched a grand slam in the ninth inning to win that game for Seattle 5-3. All right. And finally, football is officially back. The NFL preseason kicking off with the Browns and the Jets in the Hall of Fame game in Canton, Ohio. And as the teams were getting ready for the fourth quarter the lights on one side of the stadium completely went out, leaving Aaron Rodgers there in the dark. So instead of the quarterback's four-day darkness retreat this delay only lasted about 20 minutes. The Jets then go on to lose that one 21-16. Funny seeing Aaron Rodgers there in the dark. But, Amara, good to have football back. We now have football every single week until February.",

Thank you so much for joining us.So based on what we know about these two defendants -- these two sailors and their positions and what kind of information they had access to -- I mean, what concerns you the most? And how will the Chinese government use this information? SHAWN TURNER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATION, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSOR, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY (via Webex by Cisco): Sure. Good morning, Amara. Thanks for having me. Well, I think we've seen a few of these cases over the past couple of years but this case is one that does concern me a little more. Because while it's classic Chinese tradecraft, what people need to understand is that you don't have to have a lot of information in order to form a picture for intelligence agencies like the Chinese. What concerns me is that these individuals may have been lower-ranking individuals in the Navy. They provided information that helps the Chinese government paint a picture. In the case of the Essex, that's a picture of ship operations. It's a picture of potential weapon systems and a picture of procedures that happen aboard that ship. In the other case, a little bit of information about military installations is enough to help the Chinese understand how the U.S. military operates and give them advantage as they seek to be competitive with the U.S. government and U.S. military.",

And this is all about -- for the Chinese, it's all about that competitive advantage and trying to compete with the United States, and that's what's particularly disturbing about this. Again, it's about taking a little bit of information and seeing if you can understand our capability so that you can match our capability.
