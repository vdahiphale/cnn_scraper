Three of them all related to his purchase of a firearm back in 2018 at a time when he has said that he was addicted to drugs. That is a legal violation, a federal law violation. It's a felony. And as a result of that, he's going to be coming in here. We expect him to plead, not guilty. And then he's going to go get processed by the U.S. Marshals. Now, you can see there's a long line of people already waiting to go into the courthouse. This is a historic day, obviously. The son of the sitting President coming in here to be -- to be processed for a federal crime, something that doesn't happen at all. So we expect, however, that this is not the end for Hunter Biden's legal problems. The Special Counsel David Weiss, who has been overseeing this investigation for almost five years, he's still investigating a Hunter Biden for possible tax crimes.

He is single-handedly uprooting the Republican Party, which is already hanging on by a thread. And this is just a symptom of the greater problem with the Republican Party right now, too.
