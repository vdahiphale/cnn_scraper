Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin this hour with new details in the case against a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman. He is accused of leaking top-secret Pentagon information. Jack Teixeira was charged under the Espionage Act during his court appearance yesterday, and his arrest follows an intense weeklong search for the source of the online leak of secret documents. He is accused of posting documents that exposed sensitive intelligence the U.S. has on both allies and adversaries. CNN senior national security correspondent Alex Marquardt joining us live from Washington with more on this. Alex, what more we learning about the suspect and the road ahead for him?",

Now, sure enough, they did find him after just a week, arresting him in his parents' home just south of Boston.But what we know about the 21-year-old now is that he signed up for the Air National Guard back in 2019. Two years later in 2021, he got his top-secret security clearance. And the reason that he was able to get that clearance and needed that clearance and then able to access all this information is because he works for a military outfit out of Massachusetts called the 102nd Intelligence Operations Wing. They prepare classified intelligence products for senior military commanders all around the world. And Teixeira himself was what is known as a cyber defense operations journeyman. That is essentially military speak for an I.T. specialist. On the on the networks that that he was working on, because there was such classified information, you had to be a specialized I.T. person, essentially. He needed to have those clearances in order to be able to do his job. But Fredricka, now there will be much bigger questions about who can access what kind of information, because this really does highlight the fact that so many thousands of people, including very junior people in the U.S. military, have access to extremely sensitive information.",

This reveals, and this was reported by \"The Washington Post,\" U.S. assessments about a potential invasion of Taiwan by China and the fact that China, the U.S. believes, would be able to quickly establish air superiority in an invasion of Taiwan, which is very important, would be very important for China.They go on to say in these assessments that Taiwanese officials doubt that Taiwanese air defenses can accurately detect missile launches, and that Taiwan, that barely half, barely more than half of Taiwan's aircraft are fully mission capable, and that moving Taiwanese jets to shelters would take at least a week. So Fred, this kind of revelation shows U.S. thinking into China, reveals the honest us intelligence assessments of Taiwan and China, and it also exposes U.S. intelligence vulnerabilities. These assessments say that the U.S. is having a hard time gathering intelligence on China because, for example, China is using civilian boats in some of their military activities. And so, therefore, the U.S. intelligence is having a hard time gathering information on China. That is a vulnerability, Fred, that the U.S. certainly would not want China to have. Fred?",

Two people killed at Khartoum airport, another person, a different part of the country.And now we're not just seeing the physical violence in the streets, the fighting, the heavy artillery, the fighter jets patrolling the air, but also war of words between the two men who are at the top of this power struggle. Sudan is run by a sovereign council, which is a combination of military and civilian leadership. The Rapid Support Forces is this paramilitary, powerful group that is parallel to the official Sudanese armed forces. And the two military groups kind of came together back in October, 2021, to overthrow civilian rule, and they have been in this uneasy relationship since then. This month, they should have handed over power back to civilians. But these tensions have been building over the past couple of weeks, and they all came to a head this week. And now this unprecedented situation that people worry could escalate into full blown civil war, which Sudan has seen before. And now we've seen a statement, an interview from General Hemeti. He is the leader of the Rapid Support Forces that are supported by Russia, and he's called his opposite, his rival, General Burhan, a criminal, a liar, a thief, and a corrupt man. So this is not going to ease any tensions. If anything, it's going to escalate these tensions in what is already a tense situation. And the U.S., U.K., the United Nations, the African Union are all calling on these leaders to cease fire. They are calling on them to go back to the negotiating table and work out that timetable for a return to civilian transition that's been delayed for so long. It is the wish of many Sudanese who have gone through a lot of instability, but also in recent years, a lot of economic hardship because of these difficulties in the country, Fred.",

We know that the special counsel's office, Jack Smith, his team has been looking very closely at whether there's been obstruction in that case, and new reporting from Sara Murray and I shows that investigators are also asking about how witnesses have been handled as they are becoming people who saw things and are testifying to a grand jury in that case.Now, the question that the investigators are asking is about the role that lawyers representing these witnesses are playing. Do the witnesses know how those lawyers are being paid? Do they know that Donald Trump himself is being paying -- is paying for those lawyers to represent those people? And are they being coached or persuaded in some way to answer questions and participate in the investigation in a way that could benefit or protect Donald Trump? Those are all questions that are being asked. We don't know what the findings are yet, but this is another piece of this obstruction investigation around the classified documents that is ongoing right now. We also know that investigators are interested in the lawyers for witnesses in the January 6th probe who are being paid by Donald Trump. And there's more than $16 million that Trump and his PAC Save America have put towards lawyers that defend people around him as well as him himself in these investigations. And so all of that is being looked at in the probe, and there's clearly some piece of following the money to the payments of lawyers that is being done right now by the special counsel's office in this probe. Of course, Donald Trump and his team have been trying to paint an us-versus-them culture of Mar-a-Lago and the people there and trying to say that his aides are being pressured by Special Counsel Smith, especially in this documents in boxes inquiry. But at this time, no one has been charged, and it's unclear exactly where this fits in the investigation.",

I should say it differently -- that individual's loyalty is to the individual solely, not to the corporation.And so in this case, if the prosecutors have a belief that these lawyers are not representing their individual clients, but rather trying to shape their testimony to favor the Trump Organization or Trump individually, that could be a problem.",

With the prosecutor Jack Smith now handling the former president's Mar-a-Lago documents case, could Trump be looking at similar charges, because he allegedly took classified documents, and a Trump aide somehow had classified information in a laptop?

Those cases tend not to really be prosecuted unless it was purposeful.But what makes these cases different is if there is a sharing of that information with a third party. So in the case of the intelligence leak that you just referenced, there was social media sharing of it, and that's what's going to get him in the deepest trouble. In the Trump case, yes, the information, if it was shared, there's reporting that it was on the laptop of a third party, that there may have been showing of a map or other information to third parties. That sharing of classified documents really takes it to a very different level than the simple mishandling that we see in the Biden and Pence and first step of the Trump cases.
