We begin today here in Israel, where the country is marking one painful year since the worst terror attack in its history, as well as one year into a devastating war in Gaza. Both of which have left indelible marks on the Middle East. At 6:29 a.m., Israel lowered its flags to half-staff to mark the very moment Hamas terrorists unleashed sheer horror, slaughtering more than 1,200 people. Men, women and children, dragging Holocaust survivors through the streets, raping. Pain, the grief and frustration are still raw as families remembered those lost, even returning to the site of the massacre. Those are the moments of silence on the grounds of the Nova music festival. A memorial, a family and survivors disrupted by a bone chilling scream. That is Israel today. Across the border in Gaza, the war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. It has prompted famine, an outbreak of polio, an unparalleled refugee crisis, one displaced Palestinian reflected on the year of war telling CNN, quote, we are bodies without souls. And the war is now widening into Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Israel now weighing retaliation against Iran. International efforts for a ceasefire in Gaza led by the U.S., it failed time and time again, as did a U.S.-led effort for a ceasefire in Lebanon. Hamas, we should remind you, still holds more than 100 people hostage. With me now to look back on October 7 and forward in this ongoing wars in an international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. And, Nic, you went to that Nova festival site, which was one of in a day of horrors, one of the most shocking horrors -- all those young people, the hundreds of dead, those burned-out cars along the road leading to tell us what it was like as you interacted with families and survivors there today?",

So many parents, just emptying their pain and they were empty and they been empty for a year and you could see that there was at the site there you have these little stands and memorials for each individual person with the picture and there was one, there was a man standing by the picture and I can see from the face of the on the picture and his face, this was the father. Of course, he stood that red-eyed for two hours.There was another father so broken, who came and showed us pictures of his son who was a police officer who'd come to try to help the people at the festival, but he died and he showed us eulogies about his son and he showed us it is a police station have been named after his son and the mother who was kissing the image of her daughter. And you just you got the sense that their lives are so ripped apart and in no way put back together. And that was really the takeaway that so much grief and pain and other family members telling us we don't feel that we've moved on and that was -- yeah.",

You know, let me quote my sister's post earlier this morning when she asked people not to ask how she's doing, not to ask how our girls are doing. We are in a pretty -- we are frustrated and we're angry. We're sad because it's been a year and our loved ones since captive by Hamas terrorist organization because our government doesn't seem to prioritize bringing home the hostages over other objectives and international community keep tolerating Iran, Qatar, Turkey, who funded and sponsor Hamas and allow the October 7 atrocities to even happen in the first place.

I think they're not operating in a rational, neorealist way, but rather through an ideological radical lens. And I tried to emphasize that to decision-makers two weeks ago, I was here in New York with the UNGA 79 out and I met some relevant regional and other countries and we told them back to the Iranians, understand your interests are at stake because you keep -- we're not willing to push Sinwar to a deal, speaks to the Qataris.

Nasrallah attacked Israel on the 8 of October, a year ago, and both of them refuse to stop the war.So everybody who has complaints -- everybody in Lebanon want to have a safe place have to remove himself from any Hezbollah position in Lebanon, and all these people used to live near Hezbollah, used to give their homes to missiles and rockets and all Hezbollah terror military. So the fact that Israel finally decided to destroy Hezbollah should not surprise anybody because you have to remember who is holding hostages and refuse to release them for reaching notices for the end of the war. This what we want to achieve. And now to Iran -- yes, Israel has to decide what is the strategic goal of its operation against Iran, because Iran fired twice hundreds of ballistic missile. No country suffered from such an attack in one night in April and the second night in October 1st. So our singling again to Iran that it is vulnerable as we did in April, all its now a real retaliation but retaliations that need to achieve deterrence, that the Iranians will not think again about doing it. All, we prepare the battlefield for going against the head of the octopus because Elon used to help forces, Hezbollah, the Shia militia in Iraq, the Shia militia in Syria, the Houthis, against Israel.

And most of them hate the regime.When I'm saying go after the head of the octopus, I'm saying that Iran developed two very formidable military tools against Israel. One is Hezbollah in Lebanon, with hundreds of thousands of missiles and rockets and drones. And the second missile that they -- missile force, ballistic missile force that they fired against Israel. Israel destroys Hezbollah in last September. Hezbollah is not the kind of strategic sweats that will destroy Israel that Iran planned. And its also prove that its can stand 200 of ballistic missiles without a serious strategic (INAUDIBLE). So maybe its the time to show the Iranians that bigger plan to encircle Israel with a fire from all over the borders and to collapse Israel from every direction is now over.",

Milton is expected to make landfall in Florida Wednesday evening where it could potentially weakened to a category three but still bringing with it dangerous storm surge, heavy rain, high winds, and flooding. Florida residents are preparing for their second hurricane less than two weeks. Evacuation orders are in place already in some counties.Meteorologist Elisa Raffa has been tracking it for us at the CNN weather center. It looks bad on the radar. Tell us what -- how bad it's going to be.",

I mean, look at this satellite, it as that perfectly symmetrical eye that buzzsaw shape, that donut. It is textbook the way it looks on satellite right now, with 175 mile per hour winds sitting us south and west, about 700 miles of Tampa.The intensification today has been one for the record books. This was a tropical storm yesterday, I went to sleep. It was a category one hurricane, and we're up to 175 miles per hour. The winds have come up 100 miles per hour in just 24 hours. It is just incredible the way this has intensified. It will scrape the Yucatan peninsula as that massive category five storm. Then it heads towards Florida. We are expecting it to weaken some as it gets there because we have dry air, we have some wind shear that can chip away at its intensity, where were still looking at a massive category three or four hurricane that will also by the way, get wider. So the impacts could span for more miles. Pink is the hurricane watch and were worried about this along the Gulf Coast where we could be looking at winds over 110 miles per hour from Tampa down towards Fort Myers, tropical-storm-force and hurricane-force winds across its the peninsula. We're very closely watching the storm surge forecast if it gets to eight to 12 feet or more in Tampa Bay, that would be the most surge that they've ever seen. They broke their records just a couple of weeks ago with Helene and this could be even worse than that, especially if that eye goes to the north of Tampa, that will funnel in all that storm surge into the bay. We'll be looking at storm surge on the entire west coast of Florida, up to 10 feet, even down to Fort Myers. This could really be something that the Tampa area hasn't seen before. They haven't had a major hurricane pass this close since 1921 -- Jim.",
