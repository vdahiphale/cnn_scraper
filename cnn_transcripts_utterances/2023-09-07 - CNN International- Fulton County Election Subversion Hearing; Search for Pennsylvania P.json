Targeting civilians, targeting civilian infrastructure is something we've investigated here at CNN throughout since the beginning of this conflict. And it is continuing despite Ukraine's gains. Despite this positive news, the past few weeks, the counteroffensive is making progress. They're gaining land in the south, in the east along this frontline. Perhaps this is Russia's retaliation. That is what Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is claiming. But it's also worth noting that Ukraine's progress is not just on this frontline. There were reports this morning again of drone attacks. This time in the Rostov-on-Don region. Two drone attacks, one very near to a military base in that area. This is a sense of unease it's creating in the Russian population. There are 100 people over 100 people temporarily evacuated from this area. That creates a lot of disruption, a lot of unrest as well for the civilian population in Russia. Now, of course, this is nowhere near the kind of toll that it's having on the Ukrainian population. But it may be part of the motivation here from Russia. They feel they're on the back foot.

      "sentences": "We learned in a court filing this afternoon that special counsel David Weiss says that they are going to seek an indictment related to the gun case this month. Saying that because of the Speedy Trial Act that they would need to make a decision on this case by September 29th. They are saying they are going to do so before that date. You know, and the remember this is part of this pretrial diversiondeal that he had reached last -- back in July. And under that deal he would have avoided prosecution on a gun possession charge. Possessing a gun while he was under the influence of a controlled substance. He's been very public about his cocaine addiction. You know, that was a -- that's a felony that faces a statutory maximum of 10 years in prison. So that was going to be diverted if he met certain conditions, including not using drugs and not possessing a gun for 24 months. That deal fell apart. What we don't know from the filing is exactly what they will try to seek an indictment on. If it will be that same felony or if it will be, which we know something that we're looking at, falsifying the form in which he filled out to get that gun. So that remains an open question at this point. But certainly in this case is looking like it's going to move forward with a felony charge against the President's son. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
