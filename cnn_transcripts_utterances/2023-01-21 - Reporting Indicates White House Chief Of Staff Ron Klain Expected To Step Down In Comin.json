There has not been a successor that's been identified just yet according to \"The New York Times,\" and that announcement of replacement likely would not come until after the State of the Union address.But Ron Klain has really been one of the president's closest advisers since the start of this administration. And really there has been very little turnover when it comes to the senior staff at the White House. So this would mark a pretty big shift. Now, Klain has overseen a host of issues and accomplishments for this White House, including navigating through the COVID-19 pandemic, getting infrastructure passed up on Capitol Hill, as well as one of the largest investments in climate change initiatives that was passed earlier in the fall. But this would certainly mark a big moment of change for the White House, as President Biden is entering his final two years of office, and potentially launching another re-election bid. Ron Klain has worked with Biden for a very long time, dating back to his time in the Senate, also as vice president, and advising his campaign from the outside back in 2020. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on this and has yet to receive comments specifically. But \"The New York Times\" today is reporting on a very significant development as they say the White House chief of staff Ron Klain is expected to step down in the coming weeks. FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR:  So Arlette, is anything being said about the timing? Is he stepping down, does it have anything to do with the recent classified documents, handling of from the White House? Is it instead, as \"The New York Times\" is reporting, that it's a grueling -- it has been a very grueling pace, and that may be a contributing factor? But is anyone else commenting on either of those scenarios?",

It is very rare that you have someone stay all four years of a presidency as chief of staff.

But we are still waiting to learn more exactly about when this departure will be. \"The New York Times\" indicates a likely replacement would not be announced until after the State of the Union address, which is February 7th.",

Thanks so much.Here's another breaking story that we continue to follow, this one out of Florida where police say a woman is barricading herself inside a Daytona Beach hospital room after shooting her husband who is terminally ill. This according to police. CNN affiliate WESH is reporting that officers were dispatched to AdventHealth Hospital over reports of a person shot, and police are asking for people to remain clear of the area. CNN has reached out to hospital staff, some of whom are currently on lockdown inside the hospital, and the status of the woman's husband, unclear at this time. Joining me right now is CNN's national security analyst Juliette Kayyem. Juliette, good to see you. So what is happening likely in that hospital right now to, of course, reach out to the suspected shooter while maintaining safety for patients and staff?",

We also don't know if he was alone in the room. So all of these questions will be known to the hospital right now, and obviously to law enforcement.They are going to be reaching out to her and very likely have family members trying to reach out to her to talk to her. This is now a relatively secure facility, and so they're probably near the door, trying -- especially because they want her not to harm herself, or obviously they want to get to the husband and to try to save his life, if that's still feasible. And so this is now exactly what you said, this is now trying to bring her back from the situation she is in safely, and then let the legal proceeding begin after that. There is no reason that this needs to turn more violent. You have an individual woman with a gun now secure behind locked doors. And I would suspect that hopefully that this ends peacefully, and that then the hospital will be able to continue with its work.",

The arrests this week of these three Marines, it's a good reminder that it's been two years since the January 6th attack on the Capitol, and federal investigators are still looking to track down everyone who went inside the Capitol and breached those walls that day. Now these three Marines, Corporal Micah Coomer, Sergeant Joshua Abate and Sergeant Dodge Dale Hellonen, they are facing charges, including disorderly conduct in a Capitol building. And we learned from court filings just how these Marines were found,including one, Micah Coomer, who posted photos to his Instagram. He included with them the caption that he was, quote, \"glad to be a part of history.\" The federal investigators also tracked down his Instagram messages that he sent after January 6th in which he said, quote, \"Everything in this country is corrupt. We honestly need a fresh restart. I'm waiting for the boogaloo.\" \"What's a boogaloo?\" the associate he'd written to asked. \"Civil war 2,\" Coomer replied. That's a reference A rallying cry used among some far-right groups. Another of the three that were arrested, Joshua Abate, he was discovered because he admitted during an interview for security clearance that he had gone into the Capitol on January 6th along with two of his friends. He said during that interview after he saw the riot was being portrayed negatively, he decided not to say anything about it. Now, according to court filings, these three marines, they went into the Capitol and into the rotunda, and they took a photo with a MAGA hat of one of the statues there. We should also note that these three men, they have not yet entered a plea when it comes to their conduct. The Marines said in a statement to CNN that they are cooperating with authorities in this investigation, and they are aware of those three -- the allegations against those three marines. Fred?",

And it's important because authorities have not given us a connection between the two parties, essentially. They have not confirmed whether or not Bryan Kohberger knew the victims, whether they had interactions.And now \"People\" magazine is saying that, yes, Bryan Kohberger followed at least the three girls on Instagram. They did not follow him back, but they say that they looked at this now-deleted Instagram account, and not only did they see that he was following the victims, but that also he messaged one of the victims repeatedly. She did not answer to these messages. It's unclear if she even saw them or she just chose not to answer these messages. In addition to all of the Instagram stuff, \"People\" magazine also talking about the restaurant where the two girls worked at. It is a Greek restaurant in Moscow, Idaho, and they're saying that they spoke to a former employee who says that Bryan Kohberger went to this restaurant at least two times leading up to the killings. Again, it's unclear if the girls had any interactions with Kohberger at the restaurant, and the restaurant coming out and denying a lot of this, saying that the magazine report is not true. They released a lengthy statement, and I want to read part of it, where they say, \"We all decided collectively to support the families and not share anything that could potentially harm the investigation or cause the families more stress.\" And they're not the only ones that are either choosing or not allowed to speak about all of this. There is a broad and sweeping gag order that does not allow essentially anyone that has close ties to this case to speak publicly about it. And there are a couple of things to remember here. Bryan Kohberger is expected to go to court in June. It will be the preliminary hearing. He has not yet entered a plea deal, so we'll have to wait and see what he decides to do moving forward. But if there is a trial, one of the biggest pieces of evidence that police have is essentially him being inside the house. There is a surviving roommate who says that she saw Bryan Kohberger the night of the killings. So it is going to be difficult for Bryan Kohberger. But of course, we'll have to let this entire legal process play out as we will likely not hear from anybody because of this gag order, Fred.",

Just listening to her honesty, really, of so many things, right, saying, you know what, I'm pooped. I don't have any more in the tank, and also saying what she wants to make time for, her children and now getting married. How do you evaluate all that she shared so publicly, and sometimes a little tearfully. It was hard for her to share, but she did.EMMA HINCHLIFFE, SENIOR WRITER, \"FORTUNE\" MAGAZINE:  Yes. Listening to her share that, you can really see that she's kind of changing what it means to be a woman in a position of leadership. There's so much pressure not to show emotion, not to let people see you sweat. And she's really up front in saying I don't have enough to do the job anymore. My family is important to me. And there are reasons besides those locally in New Zealand for her to step away at this point.",

That was a really big moment in New Zealand and locally. And we saw controversies at that time when she took her baby with her and brought her baby onto the floor of the U.N.And so, things have really changed since then. Maybe it would be different five years later, but she really has shown that you can choose what's important to you at different points in your life, and at one point that was her job, and that was really important. And now she's making another choice.",

The holiday comes as Chinese officials say COVID infections have peaked in many parts of the country. Yet there is concern about a COVID spread as testing is required to still enter some countries around the world. As China begins to reopen to the world, the tourism ministry will now allow tour operators to resume trips overseas beginning next month.

But Apple grew a lot more conservatively during the pandemic than some of its peers. Apple grew its staff from 2019 to 2022 only 20 percent. And again, that's in comparison to an Amazon or a Meta that grew more than 100 percent over the last couple of years.And so I think that's one of the things that is coming into play here is Apple just was a bit more conservative. And so maybe they don't have quite as many people that they need to lay off at this point, as many investments that they need to scale back. But again, I don't think it's necessarily out of the question. Apple is also expected to grow in a really sort of small rate at this point. So we'll see what happens.",
