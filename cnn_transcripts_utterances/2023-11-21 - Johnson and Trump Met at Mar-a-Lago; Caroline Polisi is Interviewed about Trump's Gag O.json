I was told that he has been fundraising in Florida, and so that's why he made the trip over to Mar-a-Lago. I'm told that him and the former president met briefly. But as you said, it's still unclear exactly what was discussed.But, look, Mike Johnson has very quickly learned that he needs Donald Trump's backing if House Republican have any hope of retaining their slim majority in the House. And that's also true with just his maneuvering within the conference itself. We know that many of the most hardline conservatives in Congress wield so much power because of that slim majority. And, remember, they wielded that power by helping oust Kevin McCarthy earlier this year. And so Johnson knows that Trump's support is very much necessary here. And I think that's also why you saw him come out very early and endorse Donald Trump. He said on CNBC last week, quote, \"I am all in for President Trump,\" and said that he expects him to be the nominee. Now, just having discussed Johnson with many of Donald Trump's advisers, they told me that, look, they are very happy he endorsed him, he's always seen to be very supportive of the former president, but the two were never particularly close. So, I think this is a lot of relationship building on part of the speaker. Kate.",

During what was sometimes a tense hearing, the three judges signaled they may be inclined to keep the order in place but narrow it. Listen to this exchange between Trump's lawyer and one of the judges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D. JOHN SAUER, TRUMP ATTORNEY: The order is unprecedented, and it sets a terrible precedent for future restrictions on core political speech. JUDGE PATRICIA MILLET, D.C. CIRCUIT COURT: This is only affecting the speech temporarily during a criminal trial process by someone who has been indicted as a felon. No one here is threatening the First Amendment broadly.

You heard there John Sauer, he was the lawyer for Trump, really coming hard saying essentially that any speech that President -- former President Trump says, because he's a candidate for presidency, is what's known as core political speech, which receives historically the highest level of protection. Now, the judges pushed back really hard on that, saying, well, there has to be some limit on that. There are competing interests here. I think you're right.

Sources tell CNN that a deal to release hostages taken from Israel into Gaza in exchange for a pause in fighting could be announced in the coming hours. Now, multiple sources say the deal would call for the release of 50 women and children and a four to five day pause in fighting. Three Palestinian prisoners in Israel would be freed for every civilian hostage released.So, joining me now is CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Sderot, Israel. Jeremy, look, we expect the Israeli war cabinet to meet in the coming hours. If it gets through that meeting, what are the next steps that we should be expecting, and is there a sense that this is a done deal or something that could fall apart?",

But, that being said, the Israeli cabinet would not be convening if this were not in the very final stages of this negotiation.And in about an hour and 20 minutes, the Israeli wartime cabinet is set to convene at the prime minister's request to review this potentially deal. An hour from that, the security cabinet will meet. And then an hour after that, the full cabinet, which is known as the government here, will convene to potential approve this deal. And I'm told that in following that, this could be as little as 24 hours before this deal officially goes through as there is a period of time for the Israeli supreme court to review any potential appeals, particularly on the side of Palestinian prisoners being released as a component of this negotiation. So, again, we are very close to the finish line, it appears, but nobody's going to call this game until it is fully done. In the meantime, though, what is clear is that these families of hostages are very anxious about these negotiations. They have been watching anxiously for weeks now as there have been reports about the potential release of dozens of women and children as part of this deal. And now they are waiting to see which ones, which names of those hundreds of hostages who are being held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza will actually be released. In the meantime, though, what we are still seeing, though, Omar, is continued fighting in the norther part of the Gaza Strip. We just saw several explosions, bombing happening in northern Gaza. The city of Betanun (ph) is right behind me here. And that thick cloud that you can see kind of settling down in the distance is a smokescreen that was deployed maybe about 15 or 20 minutes ago, indicating the movement of troops and materiel, potential movement for battles. One thing that we do know is that before ceasefires, truces, pauses in fighting actually go into place, what you typically see is an escalation. So there could be tonight, before this pause in the fighting actually kicks in, there could be an escalation in the fighting on both sides potentially. So, we're going to stay here to continue to monitor that. But that's certainly something to look out for.",
