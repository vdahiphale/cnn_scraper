And we begin with this breaking news. Tropical Storm Hilary starting to batter Southern in California, but the worst is yet to come. This was the scene in Baja California, Mexico as the storm lashed the peninsula yesterday. This street now a rushing river from the intense rainfall. Strong winds are also hitting Cabo San Lucas. Mexican authorities say at least one person died in the storm further north on the peninsula. Hilary is expected to hit the U.S. later on today. And officials warn that it could bring catastrophic flooding. Some areas could get up to 10 inches of rain. The storm already causing a travel headache in San Diego. Nearly 40 percent of flights have already been canceled according to data from FlightAware. And in Los Angeles, residents filling sandbags ahead of Hilary's arrival. Emergency teams are now pleading with residents not to panic. The mayor says the city is prepared. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency in much of southern California and says thousands of responders are on the ground. CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray is tracking the storm for us. Jennifer, a new advisory was just issued moments ago. What does it say?",

      "sentences": "Yes. The latest advisory was just issued. We have winds of 65 miles per hour, still a tropical storm and it has made landfall.So that is new as well. Across portions of Baja, California, moving to the north-northwest at 25 miles per hour, so the storm has increased speed not with this latest advisory but throughout the morning it has steadily increased speed. That is going to be good news when all of this is said and done because you want to get this rain in and out as quickly as you can. Of course, We are going to see major flooding across not only Baja, California, but as well as southern California and points north. So we are expecting this to maintain tropical storm strength by the time it reaches southern California around 5:00 p.m. local time. So we are going to see that within the next six hours or so. Looking at the radar, you can see very heavy rain pushing into southern California, Nevada, even points well to the north in Idaho seeing rainfall. A lot of moisture with this system, but the heavy rain is going to continue over the next several, several hours on into the evening, overnight hours into the first part of Monday. Right now, we have rainfall rates (ph) right outside of Los Angeles, it's half an inch to an inch an hour. So flash flooding is imminent. We are going to be looking at potentially catastrophic flooding across portions of southern California. The terrain there, the soil, we cannot absorb much water at all. So when you have a years worth of rain, and some areas will have more than a year's worth of rain in just a 24 to 36 hour timeframe, there is nowhere for that water to go. And so we are going to see some of those images that you saw out of Mexico could likely be very similar images across portions of southern California and even into Nevada. So we are looking at the rainfall simulation, widespread amounts. We are looking at two to four inches. But keep in mind -- some of these local National Weather Service offices in southern California are forecasting as much as 10 to 12 inches of rain for some isolated locations. And so that is significant when you're talking about this region. That's why we have high risk of excessive rainfall across portions of southern California and Nevada. You can see this entire area, no matter the color, could see the potential for flash flooding throughout the overnight tonight into tomorrow morning, Fred.",

Really powerful images coming out of the Mexican state of Baja California on the Pacific Coast, northwest Mexico.The whole area has been getting pummeled for the past several hours as Hilary has made its way quickly up the coast of Baja California. It's a skinny peninsula that runs all the way up to California. We now know that the storm has made landfall in Baja, California so residents -- these are a lot of coastal beach towns -- these residents are going to be feeling 65 mile an hour wind. They're going to be feeling the strength of storm surge, the strongest part of the storm as it makes landfall in this strip of land, Baja California. There are several hours left for the storm to go before it hits California. That's expected around 3:00 local time, and a lot of Mexico to make it through first. We know there has been one death so far in the city of Santa Rosalea. That's a coastal city that has just been dumped on by rain, at least four inches, that's four times the daily average that this city sees in August. This was a man who is caught in his car as the streets there literally turned into rivers. He was swept away. We know rescue operations have been underway in that city, but as I said, all of Baja California, the eastern states in Mexico of Sinaloa also dealing with the storm as the storm continues northward. It's going to hit Ensenada -- that's Mexican wine country. It's going to hit Tijuana. That's an important border city that we know has had a significant history as a way station for migrants as they make their way into the U.S. Now, storms are unusual in this part of Mexico. Not quite as rare as they are in California, say. That's because as storms form in the Pacific Ocean, they make their way northward. And once they hit the waters around Baja, California which are significantly cooler to than the waters to the south, they will typically turn toward the east towards the mainland of Mexico and start slowing down over there. Now, the storm, of course, ignoring history, pushing through, pushing northwards towards California where it's expected to make a historic landfall in just a few short hours, Fred.",

Maybe not at all.They certainly wouldn't plead prior to, you know, the first initial appearance. But there are other sort of more minor players -- not lawyers -- who will lawyer up, who may either before the initial appearance or shortly thereafter, at least have their lawyer go to the prosecutor and say, you know, what are the possibilities? That is usually how RICO cases work, is that you want -- and I've prosecuted one with 13 defendants, it was a human smuggling case. And what I wanted is to put those sort of lower-level defendants to plead out. I almost hung a plan on that. The other thing, Fred, is that there are 30 -- 31, maybe -- unindicted co-conspirators. So my thinking as a prosecutor is, what's going to happen to those unindicted co-conspirators.

You can see my shoulder, a group of volunteers here coming out to provide support to members of the community. They're so meticulous. But they're up to doing right now is receiving training in the administration of Narcan, in case they happen to, God forbid, come across some opioid overdose. But again, leaving nothing to chance here, they're providing food for the community should people feel the need to come here to the assistant center if we see additional evacuations. There are also animal control specialists here as well. This is a rural area, in parts. If people have livestock, if they have animals, officials don't want that to be an impediment to people actually seeking assistance. And so, all those services are here and ready, once this influx they're expecting comes here. I talk to one resident here who was evacuated last night. Take a listen to what she told me. She really could not say enough about the professionalism of these volunteers themselves who are worried about their own community but also coming to help people. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
