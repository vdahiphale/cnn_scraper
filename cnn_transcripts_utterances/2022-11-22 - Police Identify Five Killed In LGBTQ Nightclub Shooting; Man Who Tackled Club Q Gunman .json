The 27-year-old was shot and killed by Atlanta police in a Wendy's parking lot more than two years ago when officers responded to complaints of a man sleeping in a car in the restaurants drive-thru, and then a struggle ensued.In August, a special prosecutor announced murder and assault charges against the two officers involved, but being dismissed saying that they had acted reasonably in response to a deadly threat. Also in Georgia, a missing toddler's mother has been arrested and charged with murder. Police found what they believe is, Quinton Simon's remains in the landfill on Friday. The 20-month-year-old was reported missing by his mother in October. But police say she was the sole suspect in the case. She's charged with murder, concealing a death, and making false statements. The remains have been sent to an FBI lab to confirm that they are the toddler's. The U.S. Coast Guard says that it's rescued at least 100 people from an overloaded vessel before it hit a sandbar in the Florida Keys. The rescue operation began on Monday after a Good Samaritan reported the ailing (ph) vessel. Many of those rescued are believed to be migrants. The Coast Guard didn't immediately know how many people were on the boat, or their nationalities, telling CNN they were dealing with rough conditions. Rescue efforts were still ongoing for anyone who might still be in the waters as of late Monday. Rescue crews are combing through the debris in West Java, Indonesia, looking for survivors of a devastating earthquake. At least 103 people have been killed, but authorities fear that number will rise. The quake triggered landslides which are making it difficult to access rural areas. The government is putting up tents and shelters for more than 7,000 people forced from their homes. Indonesia's location on the so-called ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean makes it prone to earthquakes. This one was a 5.6 magnitude. CNN's Anna Coren is following developments live this hour from Hong Kong. Anna, what more can you tell us about the rescue efforts, and also the areas that were so badly hit.

As you mentioned, I was there at Ariane last night, a brilliant atmosphere with two very vocal sets of fans, both making the most of their national anthem moment.But just disappointing with how U.S. defender Tim Reim put it. Really a feeling of missed opportunities, despite some real positive for Gregg Herhalter's side. It was a fantastic night, though, for 23-year- old Timothy Weah, with -- a man with one of the most famous names in football for people of a certain generation, the son of legendary player George, who is the only African player to have won the Ballon d'Or in the 1990s. He's now President of Liberia. He was there watching on with the rest of their family as Timothy scored the goal -- the U.S.'s first goal at this World Cup -- in his first World Cup game. But Gareth Bale for his part, the Wales' captain, had put off his international retirement to make it here to this tournament. He wasn't going to give up that result without a fight. He scored that late, late penalty to see the points shared. Speaking of retirement, though, as you mentioned, we are now gearing up just less than an hour away to the start of Lionel Messi's what we very much expect to be his final World Cup in an Argentina shirt. The Argentinian fans have been flocking in in their numbers over the last 24 hours or so, very much making their presence felt. The atmosphere has been brilliant. And they have high hopes that this could be their year to reclaim that first World Cup since 1986 to send their seven time Ballon d'Or winner out of the international game on a high. Not many people giving Saudi Arabia a chance. They are just hoping they do better in their opening game than four years ago in Russia. They were thumped five nil.",

And it kind of makes a mockery, I said it yesterday of all those FIFA claims that, you know, we just want this to be focused on the football. That is not the case.And we very quickly yesterday got an answer to whether or not Iran's players would take a stance against their government. Show solidarity to the antigovernmental protesters at home. When the players walked out onto the pitch, lined up for their national anthem against England and all stood in silence, they didn't sing. Their captain had said in the run up to the game that he felt that he and his team needed to be the voice of the victims, the people affected back at home. He said, we sympathize with all the bereaved families of Iran. There is no anger amongst the European teams. They have been unable to wear the one love armbands that they were hoping to show support against discrimination and for the LGBTQ plus community, that has been taking place. At the same time, there's reports of people going into the game last night having rainbow hats taken away from them. And we're expecting more protests today. Denmark showing for the first time their shirt specially designed with no logos, no different colored trim.
