But U.N. experts have accused Israeli leaders of \"intentionally starving\" the Palestinian people in Gaza. With over half a million according to the U.N.'s World Food Program now at risk of starvation. While this is being welcomed by many aid agencies as a positive development, there are still many unknowns as to how this maritime corridor will work in practice and how exactly the humanitarian aid being transported by the ships will be transported across to Gaza, and, of course, distributed on the ground and the message that we are still hearing from aid organizations is that while this is a positive development. They still want international partners including the United States to pressure Israel to allow more aid in via land through those crucial land border crossings. We are not seeing enough aid getting in. It is a drop in the ocean in comparison to what is needed.

And here are the sectors that led the way in terms of job gains in February. Health care added 67,000 jobs, government adding 52,000 jobs, and food and drinking places adding 42,000 jobs. This is historically where we have seen jobs added over the past year or so.Interesting though, in this report, we got revisions for the months of January and December. In January, we saw a blockbuster jobs report, 353,000 jobs added, but in this report, we're seeing that actually 229,000 jobs were added, less than February's number. So, still very good job growth, just not as strong as we initially thought. Also, worth pointing out that wages have cooled on an annual basis, 4.3 percent in February. That may sound a little scary to Americans who want more wages in their pocket, but that's actually encouraging news for the Federal Reserve who wants to see wage growth cooling a little bit, so that it is not outpacing inflation by that much because if people have more money to spend that means prices go up. It's a weird conundrum that people have to try to grapple with. But ultimately, at the end of the day, you have 4.3 percent of wage growth with an inflation rate of 3.1 percent. So, still covering the bills. But good news for the Fed that it's not pushing inflation higher at the moment. But this jobs report is considered to be a Goldilocks report. Not too hot, not too cold.

When you do an investigation, when the NTSB does one or the FAA does one. They go in and they interview the people. Who we sit down at the desk, and we talk to anyone involved, ask for names of other people that may have been on the shift that weekend. I am confused as to why that depth of investigation hasn't already been completed by the NTSB.But as far as sanctions, your question about sanctions and what should be done here, the FAA can charge sanctions for up to $25,000 per passenger for any violation of safety. In other words, they put that aircraft in the air with people and put them in danger. So that could be looking at severe fines of $25,000 per passenger and not just for that flight, but for every flight that occurred since they left those bolts out. So, we can be talking hundreds of millions of dollars at this point.",
