You can absolutely expect legal challenges there. There are other moves that they might have to make to preserve their eventual opportunities for appeal. Like, for example, Joe, I believe, has said that they're not even thinking about a change in venue right now, but they may need to actually file a motion just to preserve their options later on.

He will be booked, so he'll be fingerprinted. He'll get a nice number, which is the New York State tracker that shows you've been arrested and charged with a felony. He will be taken through a back route internally through the building to the courtroom where a judge will be ready to arraign him. And at that time, as Paula would agree, they will enter a plea of not guilty, reserve all rights to challenge it on all levels. But here for the first time that the details of that indictment because they'll be handed that piece of paper when it's unsealed. Typically, in a case like this, they say, does the -- it's a legal requirement. Does the defendant waive the reading of the indictment in court? I'm assuming with as many counts as there is, that's a lengthy document. Everybody usually waives it, especially because they have it already. And then he will leave the way he came, go straight to the airport, straight back to Mar-a-Lago.

They're certainly not pleased with this move by OPEC Plus, and that's because cutting oil production means higher oil prices, which we're already seeing being reflected in the market, and that could lead to higher gas prices. Gas prices, of course, have been such an important driver of inflation here in the United States, and that's where the major concerns come in from U.S. officials.Now, this production cut of over a million barrels per day isn't expected to kick in until May, and it could last until the end of the year. It adds to a 2 million barrel per day cut that OPEC Plus announced back in October. [07:15:04] And so this is a significant concern for the White House. Saudi Arabia says that this is intended to try and stabilize oil markets. But the White House just doesn't see things that way. This is the same in from the National Security Council. They say, quote, we don't think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty, and we've made that clear. We will continue to work with all producers and consumers to ensure energy markets support economic growth and lower prices for American consumers. Now, you'll recall that back in October when OPEC Plus announced that two million barrels per day cut, the White House was furious. PRESIDENT Biden vowed that there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia. Those consequences, though, they never really became a reality. And now we come to this point where this new surprise cut is being announced, similar concerns being expressed by the White House. Now, how is this going to affect gas prices remains to be seen, but right now, gas prices are about $3.51 a gallon. That's about ten cents higher than they were last month but still down from a year ago when they were at $4.20 a gallon. But, again, concerns about gas prices and also the broader inflation picture, which we know has been a top priority, a top issue here at the White House trying to combat that much. Don, Kaitlan?",

This is a trumped up charge of espionage, and I think they're trying to set up a trade of some kind.I hope the administration doesn't fall for it. I think instead of begging the Russians to let him go, if they don't produce pretty quickly, I would try and take more decisive action, for example, going to our NATO allies and saying, look, we ought to expel Russian ambassadors from all of our capitals, because if they've arrested the journalist from one country, they could do it from another as well. It's one more step in Russia becoming completely rogue state. And I think if we don't draw a line here very clearly, very quickly, it's only going to get worse.",

Well, I mean, everyone is hoping for Evan's release obviously and for his safety while he's there.Also this week, we saw -- last week, we saw General Mark Milley of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff warning about this access between China, Russia and Iran, and the threat that it poses not just to the United States but also more broadly to the world.

In addition to Iran, I'd certainly had North Korea as a partner country.And I think what it demonstrates is why the United States has to think globally when it thinks in terms of its international strategy and why it is that the, sad to say, increasing calls for isolationism in the United States are badly misguided. So, this is a challenge to us. Hopefully, our political leaders will wake the population up to it to the to the dangers we face really in Europe, in the Middle East, in South Asia and East Asia, and this should be something that people pay more attention to. The idea that arose at the end of the cold war that we're at the end of history, that there are no more threats in the world, you'd think that would have been dispelled long ago. It hasn't, sadly.

So much of the focus, though, this week is obviously on your former boss who is going to be arraigned here in a New York courtroom tomorrow. But I wonder what you make of how he is benefiting politically from this.

The other is what happens outside the courtroom. And it is normal in cases that draw a lot of attention that judges do imposed gag orders.Now, this is this is sensitive, in the sense Trump is a candidate for president, and it doesn't really matter much what the judge says, Trump is going to say he's being persecuted. But I do think that a defendant can be restrained from attacking the judge, attacking the D.A., basically trying to pollute the jury pool. That's what Trump's public strategy is, to so rile public opinion that he can later say, you know, it's just not possible for me to obtain a fair trial, of course, largely because of what he's been doing. So, I think the judge can take preliminary action to try and make sure that doesn't happen. I think he probably should.",
