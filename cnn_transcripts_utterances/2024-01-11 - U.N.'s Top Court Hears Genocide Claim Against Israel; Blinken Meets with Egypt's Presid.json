Well, Israel is facing accusations of genocide in front of the world court. Today, the South African government presented its case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It is accusing Israel of engaging in genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza, and it is urging the court to order Israel to stop its military campaign in the enclave. Israel will formally present its defense a day from now, but it's always said it's actions in Gaza are in self- defense. Melissa Bell joins us live from The Hague. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv.

We know that the secretary of state was discussing all of these issues with Israel as well as other regional partners, but I think it is not clear yet exactly what the concrete results of those negotiations have been.

He talked about how the ten minute eating window was given -- into a experience with boiling hot water's in this place of ten minutes. This is on top of what we already heard from him in another hearing on a social media post on Wednesday that he is back in the punishments of, a strict solitary confinement.

That did not happen. So I have to say, I'm a little surprised at how the markets are taking this very much in stride. When the numbers hit, we saw futures dip, but they didn't dive, and U.S. stocks are open in the green, slightly higher, so investors are basically shrugging it off for better or for worse. Let me bring you through some of the numbers here. So, these latest reports show that consumer prices increased by 3.4 percent on an annual basis. Now, that is, of course, is a massive improvement from the peak above 9 percent in the summer of 2022. But this is an acceleration from the month before, and it is hotter than expected. Core inflation, that, of course, strips out food and energy, that cool to 3.9 percent. That is the best since May of 2021. And when you zoom in and you look up prices move month to month, the CPI report showed that prices increased by 0.3 percent between November and December. Again, that is hotter than expected, and it's not really consistent with getting to 2 percent on a sustainable basis. A few reasons why inflation was higher than expected -- energy, rents, and airfare, all of them increased. Becky, I think when you put all of this together, it is a reminder of how yes, inflation is gotten so much better than it was, but that last mile of giving it back to the 2 percent the Fed is targeting, that last mile is not going to be easy.

For that, we need stronger fiscal frameworks and we need ultimately much better institutions, better environments for private sector.",

And Trump is not expected to speak at the proceedings after a ruling by the judge, but we could hear from him before he goes in. So, these are the live pictures for you. Trump, his sons, and his company artist of overstating in financial papers how much their properties were worth. He says that he did not do anything wrong. This is one of a myriad of cases that Donald Trump is juggling as he campaigns for reelection. Let's bring in defense attorney Misty Marris and Republican strategist Doug Heye. Misty, from a legal perspective, as we take a look at the images there and if we do hear Trump speak then we will go to it, but from a legal perspective, what do we expect Trump's lawyers to argue in the closing today?",

That's a completely different analysis that could result in a guilty verdict and ultimately, in some cases, could be jail time on the penalty aspect. But this particular case, it's important to recognize is civil and ultimately the result will be some amount of money. Now, again, this case is also noteworthy, there is going to be an appellate proceeding. It will have finality in the courtroom at some point in the near future with respect to the fraud case. It will go up to the appellate division. His lawyers have guaranteed this case will make its way up the appellate chain.",

And we tried to over the past year or so separated into a \"what's legal and what's political\"? But for Donald Trump, this isn't a Doctor Jekyll versus Mr. Hyde. It's sort of a Mr. Jekyll and Dr. Hyde. Donald Trump is symbiotically in both roles at once, he understands the value and the power of imagery, he's gone to court proceedings he didn't necessarily have to. It's why he's made remarks when he didn't necessarily have to. And the language that he uses outside of the courtroom is very similar to the language that he uses, let's say, if he's an Iowa appearing in a campaign rally. The same language because the same intent in the same purpose.",

Butthen to do so when you are under a criminal conviction, criminal indictment, multiple indictments, something we've never seen before. Donald Trump is also a politician that we've never seen before and very bizarrely for Trump, he is able to turn what is otherwise a weakness into strengths for him, at least in the primaries. And so, if you see the language that Trump has used the first-time, second, time, third time he's been indicted, he says this isn't about, me it's about you, the voters. They're coming after me to get to you. There's a two tiered system of justice. Things like that. And what is also unprecedented, I've never seen this in American politics, whether you're running for mayor, senator, congressman are certainly president, Trump's own opponents for the better part of a year now have not only defended Donald Trump or declined to go after him, they use Trump's own rhetoric. Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley both say Donald Trump is right, he's a victim here, was a two tiered system of justice, the Department of Justice has been weaponized. So, it gives voters no place to go ultimately, whether you're talking about Iowa or New Hampshire. They made their own jobs harder by their own rhetoric and backing up Donald Trump almost every step of the way.",

There are other pending criminal cases whereDonald Trump is facing that potential issue. Now, what is funny, there's a lot of unclear questions with respect to the Constitution in this sphere of Donald Trump, whether a sitting president or a former president can be convicted of a crime, all sorts of constitutional issues. What is interesting is there is one that's very clear cut. Nothing in the Constitution that would preclude Donald Trump from running for president, even if he were convicted of a crime prior to -- prior to the election. So, that's interesting component, because we're dealing with a lot of issues that are likely to go up to the supreme with respect to many of these cases. That's one that is pretty much resolved. He could actually still run for president. Now, what would it mean if these cases are delayed, which seems to be a part of the Trump team's tactics, delayed so that none of them go forward before the election, hypothetically, he wins? Well, the federal cases would likely go away but their state cases as well in New York and Georgia, those may remain. So, this is a really unprecedented loan from a legal perspective.",

Last night was a moment but not a mistake, not an accident that, just before the run debate featuring Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley alone, there is a hot mic that catches -- not an accident, Chris Christie criticizing both candidates, who he declined to endorse. So, ultimately made no impact directly on that debate, on to what's going to happen in Iowa or New Hampshire. Not a surprise. What we heard from Chris Christie, I admire Christie's passion and I certainly admire his truth-telling over this campaign where a lot of Republicans have been hesitant to do so. But ultimately, he said, I'm pure and virtuous, everyone else is terrible, this is actually all about me at the end.

I don't think I've ever seen a -- We have a situation where the statute was use that doesn't get me a jury so I have no jury. I really have no rights and nobody thinks it's constitutional. Legal scholars are writing about it like it's something they've never seen before. So, it's interference, it's political interference and something that shouldn't be allowed. So, I am hoping to speak to -- my lawyers reveal all of the defects of this case which should have never been brought. Very, very strong financial statements. They thought it was the opposite and they had no idea and then they saw it and it knocked our socks off and they couldn't believe it. But great financial statements. Everything is good. We have a level of deep law in our defense that nobody has ever had, this is the case that should have never been brought and it was broad and it's fair and it's pretty unfair and it is very bad for New York state. Companies are fleeing, people are fleeing, streets are crime-ridden. And, Letitia James, that's all she thinks about is get Trump, she's been dreaming about it for years. It's not the way stay should be run because this is a state that's been in a big trouble. You have all the businesses fleeing and the people fleeing. People that pay taxes and people that don't pay taxes are coming in, and that's not what you want. So, I want to think -- we could have a news conference today, don't have the time. We'll notify you let sometime in the early afternoon at 40 Wall Street. So, we'll give a news conference where it will actually speak and have the microphone, because even that, they don't want to stay really don't want speak too much.

Trump, with his sons and his company are accused of overstating in financial papers how much their properties are worth.
