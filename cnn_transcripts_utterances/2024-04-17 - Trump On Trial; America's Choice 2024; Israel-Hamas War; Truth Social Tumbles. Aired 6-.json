So far, four men and three women have been selected to serve on the 12 person jury. Six alternates will also be picked. The trial is adjourned until Thursday morning with a tight window to finish jury selection. Judge Juan Merchan is hoping to wrap up the process by the end of the week.My panel is back and CNN political analyst David Sanger joins the conversation. And we know some vague details about the seven jurors selected yesterday. You know, what do you guys think? Feel free to anybody wants to chime in, what we see so far from the jury selection process. And, I mean, David, you've covered so many presidents over the years. It's still kind of amazing to see a former president of United States going into a criminal courthouse, no matter how you slice it for jury selection.",

One, I think what was accomplished this weekend was, in a sense, American engagement in the world at its best. You had a multilateral, multinational defense, that included, obviously led by the United States, and included Saudi Arabia, Jordan, France, the UK and, of course, Israel.And the scale of the Iranian attack, I think, is understated. We have a lot of pundits and experts saying, oh, you know, it was a symbolic attack, it was performative, it was designed to send a message to Israel without really doing damage to Israel. I can tell you, Jim, from the Israeli perspective, particularly the decision makers in the War Cabinet, that is not how they see it. They are -- they believe their defense was effective, and they also had a little bit of luck, 99 plus percent performance in terms of heading off, 99% of what was sent, the cruise missiles, the Scuds, the unmanned drones. But if any of those had gotten through, I mean, you look at those ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, if any of those had gotten through, you would have had thousands of casualties. And so from the Israeli perspective, after October 7th, they can no longer just \"take the win, return to the status quo.\" Look, here's the reality, Israel is going to have to go back into Syria. They have to conduct further operations, like the one they did on April 1st that provoked this Iranian response. And the Israeli Defense Minister saying, if we cannot establish the new normal is every time we go into Syria, Iran gets to drop what they just dropped on us last weekend. So we have to respond. And David Cameron, the British Foreign secretary, was in Israel just this morning their time. And he came away from his meetings, thinking Israel is definitely going to respond. So I think that they won't -- they'll try to do it in a way that doesn't really escalate. Obviously, these things can spiral out of control.",

Because, I mean, what we saw over the weekend, I mean, there was a real fraying of international support for Israel when you saw that devastation, mounting in Gaza, the human suffering mounting in Gaza.And then when this Iranian attack happened over the weekend, you saw coalition forming around Israel to sort of make this protective barrier that avoid a lot of the casualties that you're talking about.

And if Israel doesn't respond, it runs the risk of further -- inviting further Iranian attacks.So it's really, you know, which cause are you willing to absorb? I think that the US and the international community are coming to terms with the fact that Israel's going to respond. And so now it's a negotiation, as you said, about how to do it. And I think it can be done in a way that sends a message to Iran that they cannot do something like they just did without there being a response, and yet not doing in such a way that we're in a full on regional war. But, look, as you know, the best of intentions, best of planning. I mean, I don't -- I honestly don't believe Israel policymakers thought that their operation on April 1st would have provoked the response they got this weekend. So it is hard to predict how these things go.",

The two prong strategy is to privately, in a low key way, give Israel all the defense capabilities and needs -- that it needs, that Israel needs. And you've seen this even before the operation, this defensive operation over the weekend. You've seen it in the form of all the munitions and arms that the administration has been consistently supplying to the Israelis since October 7th.But at the same time in the last few weeks, it is included a public strategy that is quite critical of Israel. This was much more the case in the -- before this weekend in the lead up to a possible operation by the IDF in Rafah and Southern Gaza. But there was this sense that they could green light a UN Security Council resolution that the Israeli strongly objected to for good reason. Public statements about red lines and about humanitarian assistance that were highly, and I personally think I'm fairly critical of Israel. So they thought they could publicly have some distance with Israel, very critical of Netanyahu. There's the Schumer speech about Netanyahu that President Biden clearly supported. So it's not like they have this public approach to sort of mollify their political base to deal with the left of their political coalition here and say, look, we're beating up on Israel. We have some separation from Israel, while privately providing Israel everything it needs. Not the least of which was the defense capabilities of this weekend.",
