Russiasays Ukraine flew two drones towards the Kremlin in what it calls an attempt to assassinate President Vladimir Putin. We'll tell you what Kyiv is saying in response. Plus, any moment now, the Fed will make a decision on U.S. interest rates, we'll bring you that in just a moment. And shock and sadness in Serbia after nine people, including eight children are killed in a rare school shooting. Topping the headlines tonight, accusations from Russia that Ukraine tried to attack the Kremlin with drones in an attempt to assassinate President Vladimir Putin. Now, videos are circulating on social media purporting to show the alleged attack. Speaking earlier in Finland, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied Ukraine had any involvement.

The U.S. interest rates are going up again. Just moments ago, the Federal Reserve announced it is raising the Fed funds rate by a quarter point as it continues of course, to fight persistent inflation. Analysts expect that, that hike, even though some economists say raising rates just days after the failure of First Republic Bank may be a bad idea. I want to go straight to CNN business editor-at-large Richard Quest who joins me now from Budapest. So, Richard, 25 basis points very much in line in expectations. What stood out to you? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  What stood out to me is that they decided to do this, because it tells me that inflation is stickier than they would like, and that it is more robust than they wish. And so, that they're going to take these extra measures as their own insurance policy, if you will, against or to bring inflation down. Now, what happens next? That's the key question. Because looking at the Fed's statement now, they keep -- they say there are lags of monetary policy. The cumulative tightening that's taking place so far, the banking crisis which will in itself slow things down as banks become more hesitant to lend. So, the Fed I take today is basically going on pause. Now, that shouldn't be a pause with a bias to cuts. I think this is a pause, do we need to do more? And I would look forward in the next few months to the Fed as they say, be data dependant, we're up 5 percent and 5.25 percent, much higher than we thought it was going to be at the beginning.",

That there is no other First Republic waiting out there, there is no other SVB that they're aware of at the moment. Of course, Isa, raising rates and continuing to raise rates does make a bad situation worse for those banks that have screwed up their interest rate, hedging. But the fundamental issue is, there are mega banking crisis waiting to tip over that doesn't seem to be the case. What's interesting is how the banks will slow lending, and how much this will feed into the slowing economy. By the way, just to put this in perspective, U.S. inflation around 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent.

Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March and the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode. And we will work to prevent events like these from happening again. As a first step in that process, last week, we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr's review of the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank. The review's findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system and I'm confident that we will do so. From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remained squarely on our dual mandate, to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Since early last, year we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we will take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy forming may be appropriate. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 0.9 percent. The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest at 1.1 percent despite a pickup in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains very tight. Over the first three months of the, year job gains averaged 345,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate remained very low in March at 3.5 percent. Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming back into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing and job vacancies have declined so far this year. But overall, labor demands still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent. Excluding the volatile food energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad -- (CROSSTALK)",

The reason they aredoing this, of course, is to you keep a lid on inflation. The target of inflation is 2 percent. Jerome Powell said that they have lifted raise rates by 5 percent since last year. But he did talk about the banking system, of course, on the heels of what we saw of First Republic early this week. He said, the banking system is sound and resilient. He hopes to prevent events like this from happening again. Of course, the failure of First Republic making headline concerns over the fragility of the banking system. In terms of interest rate decisions, the FOMC, he says he understands the economic hardships that high inflation is causing Americans. But that this is very much data dependent. So hinting that there we could be looking at further interest rate hikes. We will keep on top of what he says if there are any more developments, of course, we will bring them to you. And Richard Quest and QUEST MEANS BUSINESS will have the very latest in about 20 minutes or so. Now we want to get back to our top story, Moscow's claim that Ukraine tried to kill Russian president Vladimir Putin overnight in a drone strike on the Kremlin. Russia is calling the alleged strike a terrorist act and says it reserves the right to take retaliatory measures. The allegation has met forceful denials from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who says Ukraine was not involved in any way. Meantime, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken has cast doubt on Moscow's claims of an attack against the Kremlin. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins me now from Washington with more on the U.S. response to those developments. Alex, what are you hearing from the U.S.? How are they analyzing what we heard today? These extraordinary claims, I should, say from Moscow?",

We know from several sources that they areporing over intelligence, intercepting satellite imagery, trying to figure out what exactly happened here. The administration does not appear to be any closer to actually figuring it out. We have heard from a number of administration officials today. We heard from the White House press secretary just a short time ago, saying that it is too early to say whether what we saw in Moscow was a false flag by the Kremlin. The White House press secretary pointing out that Russia does have a history of false flag operations. But again, that it is too early. And then we heard from the secretary of state Antony Blinken, who says that, whatever we hear the Kremlin in general, in this case, it is this accusation that this was an Ukrainian attempt on Putin's life, should be taken with what he called \"a large shaker of salt.\" Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I can't in any way validate them. We simply don't know.

And that would imply they've not completely closed the door on the possibility that it was Ukraine who was behind the attack. Of course, they heard the forceful Ukrainian denials but if it were Ukraine, it would be a highly brazen attack and something that the U.S. has feared that Ukraine might do, because the U.S., for the entire stretch of this war, has been afraid of anything that could be seen as too provocative against Russia. Anything that can give Russia a pretext for escalation, that's why we haven't seen the U.S. offering Ukraine the longest range rockets that Ukraine has repeatedly asked for. That's why we've seen the U.S., press Ukraine, essentially to promise that they wouldn't use U.S. made weapons inside Russia in those attacks, which we don't believe that Ukraine has. So. Certainly a lot of nervousness here in Washington when you hear the Kremlin say things like, this was an attempt on President Putin's life because that would give the Kremlin some kind of a pretext for escalating the conflict in Ukraine. We should point out that it isn't beyond the realm of possibility that Ukraine could do something like this. We have seen these hundreds of leaked classified documents come out in the past few weeks. One of them pointedly said that Ukraine did want to bomb Moscow back in February on the anniversary of Russians invasion but they backed down under U.S. pressure, that they didn't do that in the end. So this is certainly something of concern for the U.S. The U.S. has said that Ukraine does have the right to defend themselves but that the U.S. is not enabling or encouraging Ukrainian attacks inside Russia.

Police did release these photos that you're seeing here on your screen. One of them seems to show the suspect holding a pistol and opening fire inside this hospital. A source said the suspect, in his mid 20s, was at the hospital along with his mother for some type of appointment. He eventually, according to the source, got agitated and decided to open fire for reasons that are currently unknown. That launching this massive police hunt. We have seen well over 100 law enforcement officers now staged in and around the area. Authorities have not announced whether they have any leads at this hour. But they are warning the public to be on the alert. This area has apartment buildings, hotels; it's a highly populated area. So all of these people are sheltering in place right now, as police try to contain the situation. The gunfire has since stopped for about 45 minutes to an hour. So we haven't heard any shots or reports from police. But if the suspect is on the loose and has a weapon and he is confronted, that is something the police are concerned about.
