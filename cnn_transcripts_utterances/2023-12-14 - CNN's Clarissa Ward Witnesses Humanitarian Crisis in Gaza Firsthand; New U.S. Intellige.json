We'll have that report from a field hospital in just a moment. Plus, a new U.S. Intelligence assessment finds nearly half of the ammunition that Israel has dropped during its war on Hamas are unguided. We'll have more on that for you. Plus, a victory for Kyiv. The EU will open a session talks with Ukraine. We are live for you in Brussels off the back of that surprise announcement. But first, this evening, we are getting new developments about a suspected terrorist plot on European soil. German authorities say they have detained multiple alleged Hamas members, and they say, they were planning an attack on Jewish institutions in Europe. Much of the region has been on edge since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, with officials warning of an increased risk of attacks by radical Islamists. So let's go straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Israel. And Jeremy, what more do we know at this hour about this plot? What are Israeli officials telling you this hour?",

Four people were arrested for terrorism offenses, three of which were arrested in Denmark, one in the Netherlands by Danish -- by Danish authorities. And then separately, and we're told by the Danish authorities that there is no connection, no direct connection, at least, between these two sets of arrests, that the German federal prosecutors said that four people were accused of being suspected members of Hamas. They were arrested, three of those in Germany and one in the Netherlands. Now, Israeli security services in relation to the Danish arrests, they say that those acted in Denmark were, quote, \"acting on behalf of Hamas.\" The Danish authorities have yet to actually confirm that, but what we did just hear moments ago from the Danish Prime Minister is that he did make a reference to the war between Israel and Hamas, as he was talking about these arrests. He said, quote, \"it is completely unacceptable for someone to bring a conflict from somewhere else in the world into Danish society.\" So that may give you some indication here --",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You don't have to search for tragedy in Gaza. It finds you on every street strewn with trash and stagnant water, desolate and foreboding. (on camera): So, we have just crossed the border into southern Gaza. This is the first time we've actually been able to get into Gaza since October 7th, and we are now driving to a field hospital that has been set up by the UAE. (voice-over): Up until now, Israel and Egypt have made access for international journalists next to impossible, and you can see why. (on camera): Since October 7th, the Israeli military says it has hit Gaza with more than 22,000 strikes. That, by far, surpasses anything we've seen in modern warfare, in terms of intensity and ferocity, and we really, honestly, are just getting a glimpse of it here. (voice-over): Despite Israel's heavy bombardment, there are people out on the streets. A crowd outside a bakery. Where else can they go? Nowhere is safe in Gaza. ABDULLAH AL-NAQBI, UAE FIELD HOSPITAL: It used to be -- WARD (on camera): Right -- AL-NAQBI: A stadium. WARD (voice-over): Arriving at the Emirate field hospital, we meet Dr. Abdullah Al-Naqbi, no sooner does our tour begin when -- AL-NAQBI: Our ambulance -- that's a real life.

But 20-year-old Lama(ph) understands it all too well. Ten weeks ago, she was studying engineering at university and helping to plan her sister's wedding. Today, she is recovering from the amputation of her right leg. Her family followed Israeli military orders and fled from the north to the south, but the house where they were seeking shelter was hit in a strike. \"The world isn't listening to us,\" she says. \"Nobody cares about us. We have been dying for over 60 days, dying from the bombing and nobody did anything.\" Words of condemnation, delivered in a thin rasp. But does anyone hear them? Like Grozny, Aleppo and Mariupol, Gaza will go down as one of the great horrors of modern warfare. It's getting dark. Time for us to leave. A privilege the vast majority of Gazans do not have.

And experts say that dumb bombs are less precise than precision-guided ammunitions and pose a greater threat to the civilian population on the ground, particularly, as you say, in densely-populated areas like Gaza where it's a matter of feet that can be the difference in-between life and death. It's part of the reason why the United States has gradually and intentionally phased out its own use of unguided munitions over the past decade. Now, there are ways to make dumb bombs more precise through the application of a guidance kit. But it's not clear at this point whether or not Israel is -- has enough of those kits, is using them, and what their rules of engagement are, right? What their threshold is for an acceptable level of potential civilian --",

This is something the U.S. has been saying for a long time now, but they really are stepping up the pressure. Now, when Katie Bo and Natasha were doing this reporting, I took those figures to the IDF to ask them for a response. Initially, they told us, we don't talk about the munitions that we use in Gaza. But when they saw the impact of this reporting, they came back to me with a bit more of an explanation, certainly not denying that they are using these so-called dumb bombs, these imprecise bombs. I heard from a spokesman for the IDF who told me that they use high quality munitions that they say are operated by skilled pilots and advanced systems, and that when they use these variety of high quality munitions, they verify that the strikes are directed at military targets. So again, no denial there. Isa, I would note that tonight, after his meeting with Jake Sullivan, the prime minister said thank you to the U.S. for all of the munitions that the U.S. has been giving to Israel. We know that there have been thousands of these imprecise dumb bombs, but really notably, you could really sense the discomfort on the American side with how Israel is prosecuting this war. We just learned that in the meetings with Jake Sullivan and top Israeli leadership, he made clear that he really hopes that Israel will shift from what they're calling a high intensity phase, which is what we're seeing right now, to a low intensity phase in the coming weeks. But a very big question remains to be seen whether that is something that Israel intends to do, whether they are getting that message. Isa?",

That's certainly what I found, that there'sjust confusion on the ground, and there's panic now, because that critical lack of water for people is becoming one of their primary concerns along with the bombardment. So, there has been a constant narrative that they go to safe places. Now, a safe place has to have two things. One, not be bombed. That's obvious. The other is, it must have essentials to life, water, sanitation and shelter. They don't have those. They're not lacking in them, they don't have them. So, this thing that we -- UNICEF and other agencies have been saying for weeks about, we are fearing just as much of deaths from the sky as we are from disease on the ground, this is that reality.

Disease will take hold. It's impossible now not to. Children are having like less than a liter of water a day, sometimes to a family. That's below a survival rate. There's desperate lack of sanitation, not few toilets, no toilets. And that's including adolescent girls. They're outside, the rains are sweeping through. This is, as that doctor said, this is the perfect storm that we are in that storm. My hope was that we hit a week, we could start to have a proper humanitarian response. That's not possible because of the bombardment. If they are talking about -- I'm sorry, it takes me a moment to capture that. If they're talking about two or three months, then we will see tens of thousands of children killed and those mental scars take deep root for every child who survives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

European Union leaders have decided to open a session negotiation with Ukraine and that is despite Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban's promise to block Ukraine's path to a session. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meantime, is seeking more wartime funding from E.U. while much-needed aid packages stalled, as you know, in U.S. Congress. All of it, amid the backdrop of attacks by Russian forces on Ukraine in the south. One person was killed when a missile hit a residential building. Ukrainian officials said it shot down most of the 42 drones launched by Russia. Well, European Union leaders are meeting as a summit in Brussels that could have huge implications for the war. Our Bianca Nobilo is there. And Bianca, this latest news on the accession talks is already being celebrated by President Zelenskyy. I think we've got a tweet from him, from X. I think he wrote, this is a victory for Ukraine, a victory for all of Europe, a victory that motivates and inspires and strengthens. Talk to the significance of this moment because at the same time, I just saw a message from Viktor Orban saying, starting the session negotiations with Ukraine is a bad decision.

All from the same hymn sheet in terms of withholding some aid to Ukraine. Orban has long been a proponent of stopping it. He's been a thorn in the side of the E.U., when it comes to Ukraine unity for sometime now. He's obviously Putin's closest ally within the European Union. So there is a commonality there. One of the next stages of the discussion, we might get a conclusion to it today or it might be tomorrow morning, it's about this 50 billion euro fund to Ukraine for the next year to help sustain its economy. And that's notwithstanding another lump sum of billions which would be for more lethal aid for Ukraine. Now whatever the E.U. decides to do, individual nations are still stepping up. Germany, for example, has reiterated its commitment to Ukraine. Second to the U.S., they donate the most to Ukraine's lethal aid and they've doubled a new allotment of funds to Ukraine. So it's not just the E.U. Of course, it's what domestic budgets decide to do as well. But this news today will be a huge boost for Zelenskyy, because that trip to the U.S. was disappointing. We've had Putin doing his annual Q&amp;A today after foregoing it last year, seeming to have a renewed sense of confidence, when it comes to the invasion. Whether or not that is justified is another question. So this, symbolically, at least, is a real win for Zelenskyy, an important day.",

Thank you, Bi.On that point that Bianca was mentioning there, Russian president Vladimir Putin held his end of year news conference for the first time since the start of his war on Ukraine. A marathon event that saw President Putin fielding questions from invited journalists, uniformed soldiers and so- called average citizens. Topics included the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the Russian economy and national unity. Although most of the time, softball questions were asked, there's a glimmer of public discontent and some text messages flash briefly in the background. We will get to those in just a moment. Steve Hall is a CNN national security analyst and former CIA chief of Russia operations and he joins us now. Steve, great to have you back on the show.

End of year conference back after two years of war, engaging, as he normally does, in a four-hour marathon. What does that tell us?

We get to watch Putin. This is, of course, highly orchestrated. Very, very little of actually what comes through is actually legitimate questions. I mean, they were all screened or preprepared. And in that sense, it's interesting to see what those questions are because they're essentially reflective of what the Kremlin wants to talk about. So you had some cases where you had, you know, little old ladies out in the countryside, complaining about the price of eggs, which allows Putin to say, you know, well, I had these bad economic advisors but I have your own interests at heart.

That's completely controlled by the Kremlin. But now you've got a lot of these Telegram channels and all these other online capabilities. So he's got to consider both of those things. He has to speak to both Russians or he addresses their very basic issues and he's got to address a more sophisticated audience in St. Petersburg, Moscow and maybe places like Yekaterinburg, where he's got to talk about how the war is going.

So they are meeting. We understand still continuing to talk and if the diplomats who are there are leading these discussions can accomplish lowering the temperature, some of the warlike rhetoric, then that will be a win here. Because, of course, Nicolas Maduro is facing election next year and there's been a lot of saber rattling in his comments of the last couple of weeks. Of course, that plays well back home.
