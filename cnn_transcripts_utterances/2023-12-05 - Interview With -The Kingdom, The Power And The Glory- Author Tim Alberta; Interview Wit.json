The risk of America becoming an illiberal democracy and even a religious republic. Author Tim Alberta joins me with his new book about Evangelicals and MAGA politics. Next, an apocalyptic situation, U.N. officials say, there is no safe place for civilians as Israeli tanks descend on Southern Gaza. New York Times reporter Ronen Bergman tells me about his exclusive reporting into Israel's intelligence failures before the October 7th attacks. And, how is Houston fighting homelessness? Columnist Nicholas Kristof tells Hari Sreenivasan. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we begin with the rising threat to our democracies. For the first time in decades, there are more autocracies than liberal democracies around the world, according to a European university that tracks these things. And fears about America are growing, if Donald Trump wins a second term to the White House. Just six weeks before the Iowa caucuses, here's what former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney says. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): People who say, well, if he's elected, it's not that dangerous because we have all of these checks and balances, don't fully understand the extent to which the Republicans in Congress today have been co-opted. One of the things that we see happening today is sort of a sleepwalking into a dictatorship in the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It doesn't just happen. So, I wonder what the Evangelicals who you know and who you've, you know, been writing about for this book say when you hear, you know, about him completely openly talking about his authoritarian impulses. Here's some of the current headlines. You know, \"The Washington Post,\" Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable. That's Robert Kagan. \"The New York Times,\" why a second Trump presidency may be more radical than his first. And your own magazine, \"The Atlantic,\" the threat of a second Trump term poses, you know, to the American democracy. So, how did, with this base, did America get to this place and does this religious base condone the -- I guess, the thoughts behind these headlines?",

And we're seeing something similar happening in the United States today, specifically, when Donald Trump faces these piling criminal indictments, and when he goes out on the campaign trail and says to these voters that, really, they're coming after you. They just have to come after me first. But ultimately, you're their enemy. They're coming after you. They're coming after your churches. They're coming after your religion. That is connecting and resonating deeply with an Evangelical movement in America, Christiane, that has been marinating in that sort of end times rhetoric for generations. In other words, it may be unfamiliar to those outside of the church, but as someone who grew up listening to that sort of talk, this idea that Christianity was in the crosshairs and that to defeat God and to defeat God's purpose for the world, that they would have to first defeat America, that has effectively convinced millions and millions of people that fighting for the United States and fighting for their version, a conservative Judeo Christian Republican United States, is every bit fighting for the almighty himself, and Trump instinctively understands this much in the same way I would say that Vladimir Putin has weaponized similar religious justification for his invasion of Ukraine.",

So, the idea of what you say, you know, the church has been marinating in this. Trump himself, very, very early on, way before he was a political, you know, figment of anybody's imaginations, you know, said to \"Playboy\" magazine, when the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak. So, this was highlighted from an old, you know, \"Playboy\" magazine interview. So, he's been telegraphing this stuff for a long time. Has the religious base been following this for a long time?",

We were thinking about religious liberty. We were thinking about the court appointments. I think some of these headlines you were referencing a moment ago speak to what might come in the future. When Donald Trump just recently on the campaign trail in New Hampshire floated the idea of a religious litmus test for people entering the country, this is beyond the Muslim ban that we saw in his first term. Trump is now saying explicitly that if you are a Muslim, a Jew, a Hindu, an atheist, if you are anything except a professing Christian, we might not let you into this country anymore as an immigrant. And I would add that that is just the scratching of the surface as far as what Donald Trump and some of the people around him in a second term have in mind for an agenda as it pertains to almost a marrying of church and state. Not because Donald Trump is personally religious, not because Donald Trump is in any way guided by the dictates of scripture, but simply because he views power and his ability to consolidate power as a matter of the state as inextricably tied to the power of the Evangelical Christian movement in this country.",

But actually, he's got a bunch of adults around him. He doesn't really believe this stuff. And the adults will, you know, keep the parameters and the guardrails on. Do you think that there's a little bit of that that still exists? Do you think Trump is just saying all this stuff or do you think that we should pay attention to what he's actually saying, and certainly what his aides and campaign staff are saying?",

McMasters in the West Wing trying to get Trump to sort of step back from or talk him out of the things that could be most damaging to the country, you will now have people actively encouraging those worst basic sorts of primal political instincts. And I would add, Christiane, in the context of what we've been discussing around Christian nationalism, around the marrying of church and state, there will be people in a Trump White House in prominent positions who are self-described Christian nationalists, people who very much view themselves as existing, you know, in a world where theocracy is not a dirty word, and people who are going to take every opportunity in a second Trump term to make sure that Christianity is promoted at the expense of other religions at the expense of other traditions, faith or otherwise. And so, these are individuals who I think have a plan in place for another Trump term that it would I think be unprecedented in the scope and in the sweep of how they envision the state's relationship with the church, but not only that, the church's relationship with the broader culture.",

So, from the secular culture, from the secular media, from the secular government, from the deep state, all of these are the externalized threats that many Evangelicals are worried about. But there is also an internal threat as they see it, and that internal threat is people who are unwilling to recognize the apocalyptic stakes here. People who are unwilling to realize that Christian America is on its knees and that its last days are here unless we fight back. People like Mike Pence, people who, in his case, were unwilling to cast aside the constitution in order to keep Donald Trump in office, that makes him a coward, that makes him weak, that makes him not a Christian in the eyes of many of these folks. And I don't think that we've begun, Christiane, to fully grapple with that sort of purge now happening inside the Evangelical church, where people who adhere to all of the conservative theology, all the conservative biblical doctrine, people who themselves are politically and culturally still quite conservative, and yet, they're not radical enough to remain a part of this Evangelical movement that they have called home for so long.

So, food is running short. I mean, some people we've seen are basically eating dry, stale bread that in the past was fed to livestock, but now, people actually have to eat it. So, on top of everything else, you have the specter of famine, which, is at the moment, it doesn't appear anybody's dying of hunger, but certainly malnutrition could become a problem in the near future, if aid does not get in.

Forgetting to mention what Mark Mazzetti, my colleague at \"The New York Times,\" and myself published just a month ago, that Netanyahu received many verbal warnings and four different letters during the last year saying to him, the enemies of Israel, the so-called axis of resistance, Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and others, the Houthis, they see Israel as weak because of the political crisis that started because of the judicial overhaul that Netanyahu was igniting. They said to the prime minister, if you continue with this, they might attack Israel because they believe that Israel is weak with the disassemblement of the reserve military.

As the sort of question -- the sort of comment you got from Mark Regev. But as long as they are fighting, people don't start to demonstrate again. People do not demand the immediate resignation of Netanyahu. The inquiry, the investigation don't start. And so, I believe that they are talking about one war.

It's a weaker mayor system. It's -- execution just did not work. And I guess really what struck me was that while Dallas was full of compassion and full of good intentions, you know, good intentions are not enough. And it is about evidence-based policy, it's about execution. In the early 2000s one city after another all around the country introduced 10- year plans to eliminate homelessness. And looking back, those 10-year plans to eliminate homelessness were really just symbolic. They really didn't achieve anything. And I think around the country and in Dallas, there were a lot of those, you know, announcements, a lot of talk about how housing is a human right, but none of that actually got people into housing. There is a little bit of a postscript. The folks in Dallas, when I was asking about this, they were -- you know, it was kind of a prickly conversation to be the contrast to Houston. But a few years ago, Dallas really just got fed up with the homelessness. They saw Houston's success and they began to copy the Houston model. And so, as a result, now, the last two years, Dallas has made real progress against homelessness using that Houston model. Now, Dallas is really excited that they've turned the corner, that numbers of people who were homeless in Dallas are going down. And so, they're -- you know, they're kind of excited that now they've got it right and are quite full of optimism. Houston, on the other hand, while it has been very successful, I think faces some real challenges. Houston has done this on the cheap, which is impressive that they haven't spent the hundreds of millions of dollars that the West Coast cities have, but Houston has essentially used federal money, typically COVID money, and that is now running out. And so, the challenge will be, you know, will -- you know, Houston has developed a model that works, but will it be willing to fund the model with its own money rather than just federal money coming in? And that is unclear. I think there is some real anxiety among Houston civic leaders about whether they can sustain the momentum when they're forced to rely on their own resources.",

And it's not just the bills, but it may mean that somebody no longer has the ability to work. We have so many Americans around the country who are just living right on the edge, paycheck to paycheck. And, you know, the moment that paycheck doesn't come in they're in a crisis. They're also an enormous number of folks who might be able to afford, you know, $700 a month, $800 a month for rent, but they have bad credit or they have an eviction history. And if you have an eviction history in the last seven years, it is very, very difficult to get anybody to rent to you. You know, likewise, if you have a felony conviction, very, very difficult. And so, all those are factors. But, again, I think there is a risk of focusing just on the population that is homeless and not on the structural factor of not enough housing. The metaphor that is often used as musical chairs, and if you have a game of musical chairs, and there is one seat too few, there is going to be somebody who lacks a chair. And in the same way, if we don't have enough housing, there are going to be some people who -- you know, who are out of housing. And in that scramble, it's going to be people who are -- is competent, least skilled, more disabled, and, you know, very often that is people with addictions, with alcoholism with various other issues, but the fundamental problem is not enough chairs or not enough housing.",

I've always believed in it. And when I was driving into Houston for this story, I saw this endless urban sprawl, and I'm feeling kind of smug that, you know, back in Oregon, we don't have that kind of sprawl. But I mean, the uncomfortable truth is that that lack of zoning also makes it cheap and quick to build. And it's one reason why the cost of housing is a lot cheaper in Houston than it is in Oregon or in California. And so, there are real tradeoffs there that I think my world of liberals has to wrestle with that, you know, we try to preserve neighborhood character, we try to preserve while spaces, and those are important goals, but the upshot of that and also is effectively that we often give a veto to communities over building new housing, and that raises housing costs. And when you have a higher housing costs, then you end up with people who are often homeless. We got rid of SRO housing around the country beginning in the 1960s, and that was intended as a way of improving neighborhoods. And in fact, one of the upshots was that we ended up with more people sleeping on sidewalks.",

You know, one is simply that we -- there are about 35 million unused bedrooms in America. And it used to be common in the United States to have, you know, a basement flat that one would rent out or occasionally to take in a border. There are a lot of four-and-five-bedroom homes reflecting a housing stock that served a much larger nuclear family structure that are, you know, hugely underused, those could be turned into rooming houses, which used to be very common and now, have pretty much vanished. And I think that also, you know, I'd love to see cities like Portland or San Francisco learn from Houston and have this kind of coordinated approach of nonprofits to support -- to reach people. You know, in Portland, there actually was a survey of people who were homeless. And two-thirds had not been ever contacted by an outreach worker in ways that would lead to housing. And of the one-third who had been contacted, most had -- there'd never been any follow up. You know, one thing that Houston has done with that outreach also is find - - is to ask people, you know, is there any relative who might be able to help you, to be in touch with you, to take you in, to provide support if you're trying to get off of drugs, or is there any source of income? Are you a veteran who -- is there any disability possibilities or any income stream you might be eligible for? And all these things, you know, at the margin, they help.",

I mean, is it as simple as justsaying housing or sheltering people, or is there a difference or distinction between, say, homeless shelters and giving somebody an apartment, a set of keys so that medical services or other social services can show up at a centralized location?

And for example, West Virginia has an enormous problem with addiction, but West Virginia does not have a substantial homelessness problem because in West Virginia you can, you know, rent a small apartment for $500 or $600 a month. You know, try doing that in California. And so, I do think that providing more housing, lowering the costs that's making it more accessible helps a great deal. I think we have to tackle this issue of people with bad credit or with eviction histories. One of the, you know, problems is that if you -- if you're facing $1,000 rent, you don't just have to pay $1,000, you have to also pay, you know, a month security deposit, for example, you have to pay various fees. And so, there are a lot of folks who might be able to pay that monthly rent, but can't afford all these fees to get them off the street. And then, you know, outreach work. Good outreach just makes such a difference in trying to help people make that move into housing.",
