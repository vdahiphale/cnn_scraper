      "sentences": "Tonight, is Kamala Harris stealing some of Donald Trump's populist thunder? Plus, new numbers could change the political calculus on the other hot topic of the 2024 election. And from the campaign trail to the Everglades, a contest to wrangle as many pythons as possible for the grand prize of $10,000. Wildlife expert Jeff Corwin is here to talk about it.Welcome to \"Laura Coates Live.\" I'm Audie Cornish, in for Laura tonight. Vice President Harris delivers what has long been promised, an economic policy of her own. And the stakes could not have been higher. Republicans are trying to tie the economic anxiety of Bidenomics to Harris by pinning her to the inflation spike that happened under President Biden's watch. So, she went to hotly contested North Carolina, she pitched her vision, and many of her proposals sound a lot like Bidenomics. Others appear kind of like a more amped up version geared towards converting the economic frustration people are feeling into populist enthusiasm. So, for example, her plan calls for constructing three million new housing units, a new tax credit for families with newborns, and a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She made her case by emphasizing her personal story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I grew up in a middle-class household for most of my childhood. We were renters. My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home. Later in college, I worked at McDonald's to earn spending money. Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck. They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food. That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up. When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And lastly, how do the merits of her plan stack up?Trump tonight seized on Harris's proposals. He claims Harris wants -- quote -- \"Soviet-style price controls.\" But while he knocks her agenda, Trump has yet to release details of his economic plan, despite holding two speeches this week on the economy. He's going to give it another shot on Monday when he counterprograms the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. So, perhaps, the third time is a charm. Joining me now, congressional reporter for Axios, Juliegrace Brufke, Trump 2020 press communications director, Erin Perrine, and CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona. So, thank you all for coming in tonight. And first, I want to start with our reporter because you have seen some of these proposals before, right? So, it's not as though a new Congress would be like, what, expanding a tax credit for, you know, families. What does it mean for whether or not this is more or less just Biden policies? Does it actually feel new?",

Since 2000, the Democratic nominee for president has received at least 90% of the vote from Black women, according to exit polls. But they often only play a supporting role in the party infrastructure, until now. With a woman of Black and Indian descent leading the ticket, Black women are lining up to support the vice president. The first Zoom fundraising call for Kamala Harris was organized by Black women, and hours after ascent to the top of the ticket, raising a million and a half dollars.At the DNC in Chicago next week, Black women will also play a prominent role. One of those voices joins me now, Bishop Leah Daughtry, who was CEO of the DNC in 2008 and 2016. And Bishop, it's important to note that you were there for those years because you are like so many of those women who have been part of the backbone of the party infrastructure. Does it feel like there's a shift? LEAH DAUGHTRY, CEO OF DNC IN 2008 AND 2016:  Good evening, Audie. Thank you for having me. It feels to me less of a shift than an ascent, a continuation of the work that we've been doing for a very long time. You mentioned that I was the CEO of 2008 and 2016, but before me, in 1992, was Alexis Herman, who was actually the first Black person to run a convention. So, it's a continuing arc of history that we're glad to be a part of, but really, it's not because someone has given it to us, but because Black women have earned their seat at the table.

The issues of Black women are not necessarily the issues of Black men and vice versa. Understand the impact of the voter, the issues of the voter, talk directly to them, then come up with policies and procedures, and get out the vote strategy that meets men where they are to gain their vote.
