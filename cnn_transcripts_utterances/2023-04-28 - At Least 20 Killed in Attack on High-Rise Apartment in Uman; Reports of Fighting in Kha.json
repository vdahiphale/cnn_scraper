At least 20 people are dead in Ukraine after Russia launched a barrage of lone rage cruise missiles early this morning. A high rise apartment building is among the targets hit in the Russian airstrikes. Regulators in the U.S. are releasing their report on the Silicon Valley Bank collapse officials have already described it as a quote textbook case of mismanagement. Iranian activists in the UK are calling for a rally on Saturday demanding that the British Government designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization. Welcome to our second hour of 'Connect the World' smoke is still rising from Khartoum and other parts of Sudan food and water are running dangerously low and thousands of trapped civilians are desperate to find a way out. One American teacher has been describing her harrowing escape. She's also expressing frustration with the U.S. Embassy in Sudan. So tonight we ask has the U.S. failed to protect its citizens in Sudan. CNNs. Kylie Atwood is with us the USAID departments in Washington. We have Larry Madowo in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, where nearly 200 more evacuees have arrived just today and consular services are trying to help fleeing Americans from a fight. Larry, I want to get to you and here's the thing. This has become a very important point for people trying to leave Sudan getting through to Saudi Arabia, what is the latest in terms of evacuations?",

And thescale of evacuation we're seeing out of Sudan compares in recent times, only to the evacuation out of Afghanistan as the Taliban were taking over. And one of the main landing points is here in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, because so many people are ending up in Port Sudan after enduring a harrowing journey from Khartoum that's about 500 miles away, in the best of times, that's about 12 hours of a trip. But right now, that trip could take up to 30 hours, at least one person told CNN, and when they get there, they hope that they can get on one of these Saudi ships that's coming, who over here, the King Faisal naval base where they can then go on to whatever country that they need to go to they get free hotel here to get free food. A warm welcome, after a terrifying journey to get across Sudan, from the capital Khartoum, to Port Sudan and then across the Red Sea we saw one ship, may be two ships arrive this morning. From Port Sudan, we're expecting more we don't know exactly why we're on the port. If there's an arriving ship, we will be told and they'll get close and we can speak to the people who are coming in. But Saudi Arabia is a key diplomatic player in Sudan. It is part of what is called the quad. The quad includes the UK, the U.S. Saudi Arabia and the UAE and even the latest ceasefire was negotiated by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. So it's not just helping evacuate nationalities of different origins from Port Sudan. It's also actively trying to get people, the two warring generals to agree so far. It says from here in Jeddah, they've brought in almost 3000 people have 80 nationalities.",

But it just firms people's resolve here to continue with the fight that the defense minister today has indicated that the counter offensive is pretty much ready to go. I'm not saying we're not saying when. But when we look at the recovery and rescue effort here, I have to say compared to six months ago compared to compared to the beginning of the war, when Ukraine was grappling with the situation. Down here there are dozens upon dozens of firefighters of Police of soldiers in the apartments here. There are repair workers already going in, pulling out broken windows, putting up plastic sheeting and woodwork over those areas that are broken. They don't live here. They've come here to help. There was a there was a pizza van passing by here. Relief effort from Scotland, they stopped and handed out pizzas. There is a Police DNA team here already helping do DNA to trace and track relatives. Ukraine has become sadly incredibly well organized, and deeply resourced in these situations to help their civilian. So there's an area down there where people can go and get psychological help they can get plastic for their windows, they can get one to repair their doorframes. This is all about resisting Russia. So astray like this, does it change the government's calculus? No, it just makes the Ukrainians, some of them more heartbroken, many of them just more willing to resist for longer.",

Even though a ceasefire was supposed to be extended at the same time, the White House is urging Americans to leave Sudan within the coming hours. But the U.S. government says it can only help its citizens from afar. My next guest writing in The Washington Post says, \"The marriage of convenience between the two warlords built on a shared contemptuousness of Sudanese civilian's democratic aspirations collapsed into a winner-takes- all battle for supremacy in which civilians are the collateral damage. We've got Jeffrey Feltman, former U.S. Special Envoy to the Horn of Africa, and visiting fellow in international diplomacy at the Brookings Institute joins me now. Ambassador, great to have you on! Thank you so much. Look, American citizens that are trapped in Sudan basically feel abandoned. It has been an ongoing theme since fighting broke hearts. I know you can't speak to why the U.S. has taken this approach. But I'm curious to find out what your thinking is, and what you believe is right in terms of helping to evacuate diplomats, and not allocating resources in the same level that the other Western allies have done in terms of getting their citizens out. JEFFREY FELTMAN, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO HORN OF AFRICA: Well, I think for one thing we have to keep in mind is that the scale of the size of the U.S. community in Sudan seems to be far, far larger than the size of the communities that other countries have had. But I think that the government, the U.S. government is doing the right thing in emphasizing and building support for a sustained ceasefire. Now, you as you mentioned, the ceasefire has not been honored completely. There's still too much fighting, but the emphasis on a ceasefire is absolutely essential, not only to allow American citizens, no nationalities to leave to have safe passage out of the country. But because you've got 46, 47 million people who need to resupply themselves who need to get to safety. These people have been taken hostage by these two generals less for power. And so the ceasefire being the priority of Washington and other governments, I think is the right thing for the right approach to the right direction to go.",

It was as a balance against the traditional army, the Sudanese armed forces. So these guys, these institutions have been rivals since well, before Omar al- Bashir was overthrown from power. They had, as I wrote a marriage of convenience, a marriage of convenience, because they had a shared interest in preventing the civilian aspirations for democratic rule to death for civilian oversight of themselves for accountability of past atrocities, they have a shared interest in that led to that marriage of convenience.

A Russian airstrike on a highrise apartment has killed at least 20 people in the Ukrainian city of Oman.

Separate air strike Friday killed a woman and a child in the City of Dnipro. More fighting that's coming through in Sudan after the warring sides agreed to extend the latest temporary ceasefire. Artillery fire and airstrikes are reported in densely populated areas in and around Khartoum. There's also fighting in the Darfur region. Sudan's health ministry reports 460 people killed and thousands more injured in nearly two weeks of fighting. Now, Sources tell CNN that former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has testified before a grand jury. This is part of the federal investigation into the 2020 presidential election and Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the results. It's the first time an American vice president has testified about the president he's served beside. This hour U.S. regulators are revealing the results of their investigation into the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month. The Federal Reserve has now detailed what it calls serious management failure by the executives of Silicon Valley Bank. The Fed also took responsibility for its own lapses in supervision of the bank. One possible solution may be rolling back rules that allowed medium sized banks like SVB to skirt around specific capital and liquidity requirements. Now it appears that two Russian comedians in the meantime succeeding in making a prank phone call to one of the most important officials in the U.S. government. The Russians, who are known as supporters of Vladimir Putin pretended to be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a video call with the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. A Fed spokesman says nothing confidential or sensitive was discussed on the call. Now the Russians have also claimed making prank calls to other world leaders.
