President Biden preparing for his State of the Union Address. His campaign hoping Super Tuesday doesn't reveal more vulnerabilities. And will Super Tuesday be Nikki Haley's last stand or is she going to try a different path to the presidency? (MUSIC)",

It's wonderful to be with you. Welcome to Super Tuesday. It's maybe the last day that Nikki Haley can really make a credible claim of any kind to the Republican presidential nomination. Voters in 15 states with about a third of it delegates at stake head to the polls this morning. All signs point to a tough day for Haley. Donald Trump likely to take an overwhelming share of the vote and of the delegates. The contest comes just a day after the Supreme Court issued that unanimous decision that Trump should not be disqualified from Colorado's 2024 ballot under the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban. Yesterday, Haley held two rallies in Texas and she underscored Trump's role in a series of Republican losses and said again that he cannot win a general election against Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We lost in 2018, we lost in 2020, we lost in 2022. But look, two weeks ago, Republicans lost the vote on Mayorkas. They lost a vote on Israel. The RNC chair lost her job, and Donald Trump's fingerprints were on all of it. How much more losing do we have to do before we realized maybe Donald Trump is the problem?

Now they say a Marga V5 drone was able to hit the Sergei Kotov, sorry, Magura V5 drone, was able to hit the Sergei cut off Russian patrol ship, which they claim was worth about $65 million. Now in their words, it appears to have sunk.This is another instance in which Russia's Black Sea fleet has been successfully targeted by Ukraine. An unexpected development, frankly, in the war, because after the annexing of Crimea in nearly 10 years ago, now, in fact, 10 years ago now, Russia felt it essentially they had dominance in the Black Sea, that has since been altered. A strategic change in the war and is forced basically, many of those ships back towards the Russian inner coastline. A number of longer range successes that Ukraine has touted over the past days. They said they hit a bridge 500 miles in side of Russia and, two, President Zelenskyy in his address yesterday said that in February alone, they'd hit 15 jets, Russian jets take him out of the skies and just seven in the past week. Unclear if that's from some new capability or whether they're simply exploiting the fact that they appear to be more use of Russian airpower along the front lines here. But all of these events showing different trends in the war, showing unexpected strategic success by Ukraine deeper inside Russia, shouldn't detract from the fact that Ukraine is having a very bad time here along the more earthy, difficult front lines we're seeing in the east here. They pulled out of Avdiivka, a town they've been fighting over for months, two weeks ago. They said they would hold the defensive line and the reporting were hearing around those areas as the new line they're trying to hold is heavily contested by Russia. Airstrikes an almost inexhaustible supply of Russian military personnel and a huge tolerance to pain, frankly, by Moscow as to who they're willing to lose. And at the same time, a shortage in Ukraine ammunition, it's a very perilous time indeed. And while we talk about headlines have sunk Russian ships, it's frankly near where I'm standing here on the front lines that it feels like the war is changing in Russia's favor -- Kasie.",

A U.N. official says her team found evidence of sexual violence, including rape and gang raped during the October 7 Hamas terror attack. Max Foster joins us live now from London on this. Max, good morning to you. This was really, really tough stuff. It's the most definitive findings so far by the U.N. on allegations of sexual assault during and after October 7 and Hamas has denied the allegations, but the U.N. special envoy on conflict says sexual violence is listed a range of challenges that her team faced trying to get evidenced, trying to get that testimony.

Max, let's also talk about the hostage question broadly. I mean, you and I have been talking about the talks, to try to find a solution for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange. There are going to be family members of American hostages that are going to be in attendance at the State of the Union on Thursday. What kind of message do you think that sends?",

I think if we see a lot of that is going to be a very poignant reminder that there are hostages in Gaza still all these months later and if you look at some of the elements of that U.N. report, there were suggestions as well that there's still suffering some sexual violence, has suggestion that they are. So it's a big reminder of what those people are suffering.I don't know if it causes any wider issues. I mean, everything around this is so sensitive. Does that show more sympathy for the Israeli side or not? I don't think it does. It just highlights what hostages are going through and the families of hostages are going through in this moment. Hopefully adding some momentum really to anything that America can do towards a ceasefire, which is obviously what the Biden administration is pushing harder and harder for, but its struggling to convince Israeli, the Israelis to do.",
