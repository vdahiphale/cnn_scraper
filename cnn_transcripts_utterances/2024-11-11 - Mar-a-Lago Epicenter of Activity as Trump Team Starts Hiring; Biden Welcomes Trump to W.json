And sources tell CNN Donald Trump also wants New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as his U.N. ambassador. Trump's mass deportation plans and his global agenda possibly soon in their hands.

Our Kristen Holmes reporting yesterday that people are trying to get in the door, getting as close to power as they can, hoping to rub elbows and secure themselves positions in Trump's new administration. Members to Mar-a- Lago right now are very popular because there are no checks on who they can bring in the door. So, people trying to ingratiate themselves to the former and president-elect. Donald Trump has been trying to get through the door through these members so they can get his ear or at least try to get in close to someone who might be able to hook them up with the job.But we have been told that Trump's process for building out his cabinet and his administration is proceeding in a more orderly fashion than perhaps it did eight years ago. And that starts with who he has put at the top. That is Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff, the first woman to ever hold the title. And she is orchestrating this entire effort to build out his government. And so far, as you said, we know that Tom Homan will be a border czar. He was the ICE director under President Donald Trump previously. A border czar would not require him to go through some sort of vetting process through. He would instead just sort of be at a more 10,000- foot level. And then Representative Elise Stefanik has been reportedly offered the role to be Trump's U.N. ambassador. Homan over the weekend discussing exactly how he intends to go about orchestrating Donald Trump's plans for mass deportation. Take a listen to what he told Fox on Sunday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(END VIDEO CLIP) SAENZ:  Now, one area where Biden could potentially try to exert some influence with Trump is over the issue of Ukraine. Sullivan said that President Biden would spend the next 70 days trying to make the case for why U.S. aid to Ukraine should continue beyond this administration. Biden has said that he will dole out the remaining funds that have been approved for Ukraine by the time he leaves office. And it comes at a time when President-elect Trump has cast doubt on what future U.S. support for Ukraine could look like. So, that is likely a topic that could come up in this Oval Office meeting. Now, President Biden in the coming weeks will also be really focused on trying to implement the key legislation that was passed during his time in office. That includes the infrastructure law, the Chips and Science Act, and also that health care and climate law known as the Inflation Reduction Act. Sources across the administration said that they are really racing to implement those pieces of legislation, and that includes focusing on doling out money across various sectors, so, for instance, the Commerce Department working with major companies on potential subsidies for chip manufacturing. There could also be grants and awards for climate initiatives, and, of course, that aid for Ukraine. So, that is one of the areas where President Biden will focus on in the coming weeks as he's trying to shore up the initiatives from his presidency. But the president also has said that his team will be very focused on this transition, making sure that the Trump team has the resources they need for this orderly and peaceful transfer of power to occur.",

That's 500 more than at the same time period last year.Now, the northeast is not typically an area where we hear about these brush fires, but there's been incredibly dry drought conditions here in the past few months, and that has created these sort of perfect conditions for brush fires. Now, 7,000 acres of land have already burned between New Jersey and parts of New York. And the fire chief in New Jersey told us over the weekend that they have not seen conditions as dry as this since they started keeping record. Now, as you mentioned, that first responder tragically lost his life. He was fighting one of the fires in New Jersey, the Jennings Creek fire. That fire is still only 10 percent contain. Now, one thing that also is sort of incredible to hear about here in New York City, New Yorkers have been asked to conserve water because of this drought watch that we are in the middle of. The city mayor has banned the use of outdoor grills in city parks. And on Friday, we saw Prospect Park in Brooklyn County. actually catch fire, an area the size of about two football fields was burning. Firefighters were able to put it out that night. But it's just incredible to see this major city park actually on fire. It really gives you an idea of just how dry the conditions are. Now, New Yorkers being asked to conserve water. So, don't run the tap, run the dishwasher and the washer when they're full. Take quick showers. And the mayor just trying to ask everyone to do their part because we have not gotten a whole lot of rain, we got a little bit last night, but it really didn't do much to improve these conditions. SIDNER:  I was going to ask you about that because there was some rain last night, but this is just so unusual to see these fires burning on both coasts. People used to hearing about in California, but in New York, New Jersey, not so much. What an incredibly dangerous situation it's created. Thank you so much, Gloria. I appreciate it. Kate?",

He's proposing reverting to a structure of government that existed 141 years ago, when political parties gave government jobs to their supporters, and that's what has federal workers who I'm speaking to so anxious and so scared about Trump's plan known as Schedule F. Now, it would give him the power to start these mass firings of nonpartisan career employees perceived as disloyal, who may get in the way of his policy actions that these agencies. As you know, Trump has obsessed on the campaign trail about the idea of federal workers being agents of the deep state working against him and his agenda. Now, some of the employees who lived through the first Trump administration say they are experiencing PTSD, one saying, quote, we are absolutely having conversations amongst ourselves about whether we can stomach a round two.
