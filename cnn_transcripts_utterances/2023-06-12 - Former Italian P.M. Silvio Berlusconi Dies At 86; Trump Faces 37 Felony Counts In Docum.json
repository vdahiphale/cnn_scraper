Ukraine claims new battlefield gains amid reports of fierce clashes in the south and east. President Donald Trump prepares to face federal charges in Florida. And it's party time in Manchester as city fans get set to celebrate their treble winning team. We begin by remembering a complicated life that dominated Italian politics and culture for years. Silvio Berlusconi, a flamboyant billionaire and former prime minister has died at the age of 86. Long regarded as Italy's most colorful public figure, the media mogul and politician served as the country's leader longer than anyone since fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Allies remember him as a fighter. Critics, well, not so much. Berlusconi was also Italy's most prosecuted prime minister. We're live in Rome with CNN's Ben Wedeman. As I've suggested, this is a man who will be remembered in different ways depending on what your politics are at the end of the day. Ben?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Hi there, Becky. This is -- a this is a region of Ukraine where a lot of thoseoffensive operations that the Ukrainians have been conducting over the past couple of days. And certainly, it seems as though today as well. That's where they're taking place. That's where many people believe that this counteroffensive that so many have been talking about here and Ukraine might already be unfolding. Now, the Ukrainians over the weekend have hinted that that is the case in the form of the president of the country. However, there are others who are saying that they are not going to talk about whether or not this is the real counteroffensive. Nevertheless, what we've definitely seen is a big pickup in kinetic activity along the very long front line here in the Zaporizhzhia region but also a little further east in the Donetsk region as well. And here in the Zaporizhzhia region is also where the Ukrainians are saying that they are making some pretty significant gains. At least on one of the front lines in -- on the battlefield where they say they've taken back several villages throughout the course of the weekend. And today, as well, we've seen some videos emerge from official Ukrainian sources showing their troops going into some of these villages, raising the flag of Ukraine in some of these villages and saying that they are continuing to push. That push seems to be going in the southerly direction, obviously the Ukrainians trying to get to the Sea of Azov to cut off Russian forces. They still are at a very early stage, but certainly believe that they are making some headway. At the same time, Becky, that is coming at an immense cost. That also seems obvious as well. The Russians are saying that in many of the places where the Ukrainians have been trying to advance, they have stopped those advances, destroying a lot of Ukrainian army -- armor and a lot of that armor being Western supplied arm. This includes German-provided Leopard 2 main battle tanks, but also open- source intelligence shows some 16 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles supplied by the United States. That's a pretty good chunk of what the Ukrainians got from the U.S. in the first place. So big battles going on along the front lines, especially in the region where I am right now, some games by the Ukrainians but the Russians certainly also, you know, making a big deal out of the fact that they are destroying a lot of those Western weapons, as those battles seem to be picking up while the -- as the Ukrainian say they are going to try and go as far as they can, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, President Biden in the White House have really adopted this business-as-usual quietstrategy when it comes to former President Donald Trump's indictment. We have yet to hear any substantive comments from President Biden relating to this indictment. He simply had some no comments on Friday as he was travelling and was peppered by questions from reporters that day. But it's very similar to the approach that Biden took when Trump was indicted back in April, back in New York State on state charges. You did not hear very much from the president regarding that case. And advisors say that that is all deliberate. And part of the reason is because President Biden does not want to give any further fuel to President Trump's claims that this is all part of a political witch hunt. He doesn't want to get baited into answering questions or making any comments that then the President or his supporters might try to use against this case. Additionally, President Biden has long held that there needs to be independence in the Justice Department and that a sitting president does not need to be weighing in on legal matters. On Friday, he was asked whether he'd even spoken with Attorney General Merrick Garland after the indictment was announced and the president said he hadn't spoken with him and has no intention of speaking with him. The last really substantive comments we heard from Biden relating to this matter was before the indictment broke. That very day, Thursday afternoon, he was asked how Americans can trust the Justice Department to carry out this case and the President pointed out that he has never and never would direct the Justice Department on what they should or should not do. So, for the time being the President really is trying to just go on with his schedule. Part of that today includes hosting the NATO Secretary General here at the White House where they'll talk about Ukraine, the Secretary General also expected to be winding down his term soon, and they're waiting to see who might serve as his replacement. But this is all part of a very deliberate strategy for the president, from his spokespeople all the way over to the campaign to just simply not engage in these questions relating to former President Trump's indictment. And they are very well aware that this will be in the headlines for the coming days. But for the White House, that strategy is just to keep quiet.",
