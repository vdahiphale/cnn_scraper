We expect that to continue to worsen throughout the day. And we are hearing a number of reports of accidents and rollovers all over roadways across north Texas.So emergency officials, traffic officials really urging the public to stay off the roadways. If you don't have to be out, they are telling, asking people to please stay off the roadways, because what you see behind me is many of these people taking those warnings to heart. This was 7:00 a.m. normal rush hour traffic time of day. But you can see the traffic very light here on the roadways in the Dallas area where we are this morning. And that is in large part because so many school districts across the region canceled schools well before this morning in anticipation of the worst of this storm. So right now, the area is expected to see sleet and freezing rain falling off and on sporadically throughout the day but sustaining for perhaps well into tomorrow as well.

And then of course Don asking that question to Ben Crump about all the rumors that have been flying around about these investigations, and Ben Crump pretty much saying there is no connection between Tyre and any of these officers so far they've been able to find out.But going back to this investigation, we have seen this move at lightning speed in terms of the police department looking at the videotape, of firing the five officers and then charges coming, and now we see two additional officers being relieved of duty. Preston Hemphill, his is the white officer who fired his taser and can be heard making a comment on that taser, hoping that they stop him. That was the person relieved of duty yesterday. So we are starting to see investigators make those further moves, and three EMTs have been released. There's one thing that's still under question that we will have to ask investigators and police about today is that seventh officer who has been relieved of duty, that person's identity hasn't been released just yet.

And so, the prosecution has their theory, and we see Dick Harpootlian, asking these questions about the two-shooter theory. Is that enough to convince the jury that there's doubt here?",

What's key here is that they are saying there are key pieces of evidence, but what prosecution is not saying is that this was -- or these were the murder weapons.
