So how much money has Mike Lindell poured into the fox empire? It's a story you'll see first OUTFRONT. And a chilling discovery. The FBI arresting a man for trying to bring an explosive onto a plane. The explosives were said to be lining or hidden in the lining of his suitcase. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, taking it directly to Putin. Russian soldiers whose comrades are dying en masse are tonight appealing directly to the Russian president for help.

And we understand that the students are in tenth grade. I want to emphasize the significance of the fact that these boys are in Moscow, which is the region that has sent the least fighters to the front line, the region that has been kept the most isolated from the effects of the war, where more elite live.This is the video of what's believed to be a Wagner fighter, his face is covered, he's in a classroom, and he's lecturing students on so- called contract service. Now, the students were forced to fill out, we understand, this survey, showing it to you on the screen. It asks for their personal information, also the contact information of their parents. It also asks, do you have any relatives who are living in hostile countries, and what is your level of physical fitness, do you possess any basic military skills. Those are elaborated as tactical first aid or shooting. Now, I want to mention, CNN can't independently verify the claims, but this push for more recruits for the Wagner Group comes as Putin is continuing to crack down on dissent. Today, a former top deputy of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny appeared in a Russian courtroom. Her name is Liliya Chanysheva.  She's already been in jail for a year and faces another 18 years if convicted after opening a regional headquarters for Navalny's anticorruption foundation. That foundation has uncovered example after example after example of corruption from Putin and his inner circle. In a moment, I'm going to speak to Anna Veduta. She is the vice president of Alexei Navalny's anticorruption foundation. She can't go back to her home in Russia or she'll be arrested upon her arrival. I want to begin, though, with Fred Pleitgen. He is OUTFRONT live in Moscow tonight. And, Fred, both Russia and Ukraine now are -- it's the focus, the obsession, the day-to-day death on this fight in Bakhmut. What is the latest there?",

This is of a Wagner fighter at that school in Moscow.Now, we haven't been able to verify this. But these are boys being recruited to fight.

So either one of two things is going to happen -- these boys in Moscow are going to be recruited into the Wagner Group, and at least some of them will be. And the idea is in two years' time when they will be 18 two or three years' time, they will be ready to replenish the forces that will be decimated in the intervening area.So this is a very important move on their part and very interesting that they're doing this in Moscow because they think that they will need that population to replenish the forces that have come from the provinces, from other parts of Russia, and it's very significant that they are doing this at this point.",
