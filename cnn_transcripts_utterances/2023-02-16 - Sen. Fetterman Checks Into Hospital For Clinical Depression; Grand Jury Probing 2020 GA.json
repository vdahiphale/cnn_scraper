      "sentences": "Yes. John Fetterman was not in the senate today during votes. The freshman Pennsylvania Democratic senator who suffered a stroke last year during the campaign season was out for some time, was in the hospital last week after feeling light headed. He checked himself into Walter Reed Hospital in Bethesda over concerns about suffering from clinical depression. This is according to a statement from his office.[14:35:16] His chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, released a statement saying that last night, Senator John Fetterman checked himself into Walter Reed National Medical Center to receive treatment for clinical depression. While John has experienced depression off and on throughout his life, it only became severe in recent weeks. Now, the statement goes on to say that on Monday, Fetterman talked with the attending physician of the Capitol, Dr. Brian Monahan. Monahan recommended that he go in for inpatient care at Walter Reed. That's why he agreed to go in on a voluntary basis yesterday. Now, he said he agreed to go on a voluntary basis. It didn't say the time that he agreed to, but it did say that he did check himself in to Walter Reed Medical Center. Now, it did say, the statement also says that after examining, John, the doctors at Walter Reed told us that John is getting the care he needs and will we soon be back to himself. Now, it has been a struggle for Fetterman as he has come to the Senate and is still recovering from that stroke. He's had a difficult time communicating with senators because of the processing issues that he's still suffering from this stroke. I've observed many times that senators have talked to him. He's had a hard time communicating with them, and clearly a major adjustment here. But making this revelation just moments ago, saying that he will, that in fact, he has checked himself in to receive treatment for clinical depression, according to his office. So we'll see what happens when the senator returns and how long this treatment will take, how long it will take place.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, this is really just snippets of what this special grand jury concluded after their months of work. We got the introduction, we got the conclusion. And this part you guys are talking about perjury concerns. You know, they say in a part of the report that was released that a majority of the grand jurors believed that one or more witnesses may have committed perjury. They say the D.A. should seek indictments where there is compelling evidence of that. They also point out that they had unanimous agreement after hearing from 75 witnesses, after hearing from Georgia officials, poll workers, technical experts, unanimous agreement that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election in Georgia that would have overturned the results. They also pointed out that they still heard from witnesses who were going before this special grand jury claiming that there was fraud. You know, we know, obviously, that's been a talking point of the former president and a number of his allies.What we did not see, of course, in this release is who, if anyone, this special grand jury recommended should face criminal charges. You know, ultimately, the final decision on whether to pursue criminal charges rests with District Attorney Fani Willis there in Fulton County. She has said those decisions are imminent. She said that last month. They still haven't happened. So we'll see what imminent means. And we are getting a statement from a Trump spokesperson today. Here's what Steven Chung had to say. The President participated in two perfect phone calls regarding election integrity in Georgia, which he is entitled to do. Between the two calls, there were many officials and attorneys on the line, including the Secretary of State of Georgia, and no one objected, even slightly protested or hung up. So, of course, they're referring back to that call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, asking Raffensperger to find the votes, as well as another official who was in the Secretary of State's office at the time. Of course, we still don't know whether Trump is going to be free and clear or whether the D.A. is going to be pursuing indictments against him or others in his orbit. Guys?",

It repudiates him. It also establishes a basis for bringing charges. You couldn't bring charges without this kind of a conclusion on solicitation of election fraud and other possible bases to charge Donald Trump in Georgia. And it knocks the stuffing out of his defense that, no, there were improprieties, there -- he at least reasonably believed that there were.So I think together with other tea leaves and the fact that we were coming into this knowing that there was a mountain of evidence of possible criminality by the former president, amassed by the January 6th Committee and others, this is another nail in a coffin that was already full of them.",

It was a very intense room to be in. I mean, think about walking into a room with 23 jurors you've never met before, with no legal counsel, and you answer questions as long as they want to ask them. So it was a very, very intense process. And music to my ears to hear that all 23 agreed that the election there was no widespread fraud in the election and it was as spoken by myself and several others here in the state. But, yes, certainly there are, I mean that, you know, insinuating that there was some sort of perjury during this process.

Inside, they discovered loaded magazines, eight of them. But that's not all. They found a pencil sized pouch containing what police called 50 loose rounds of ammo, as well as empty magazines.
