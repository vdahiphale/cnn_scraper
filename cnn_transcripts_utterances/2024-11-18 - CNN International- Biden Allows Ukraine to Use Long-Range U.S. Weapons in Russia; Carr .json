Also coming up, U.S. President Joe Biden, who is there in Rio, taking a controversial step, authorizing long range U.S. weapons for Ukraine, in a move that could escalate the war with Russia. And renewed ceasefire talks between Hezbollah and Israel amid Israeli air strikes on Beirut. Meanwhile, U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump continues rolling out his cabinet nominees with some unconventional picks. And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. The picture, as far as futures are concerned, indicating a mixed open back there at 09:30 a.m. local New York time. We begin this hour with a provocative move from the United States on the war in Ukraine, after repeated requests from Kyiv. The U.S. now allowing Ukraine to fire American long-range missiles into Russia. The Kremlin reacting tersely as you might expect, saying This shows the Biden Administration wants to quote, throw oil on the fire on its way out of the White House.

Now it's not, apparently, and it's an escalation they seek to make, albeit one that has potentially a clock ticking on it of about the two and a half months left of the Biden presidency. Is it going to change the battlefield overnight? Well, as Oren was pointing out, there aren't that many of these around. Frankly, we don't know how many Ukraine currently have or how many they can lay their hands on. And indeed, their drones have been doing probably a more efficient and cheap job of hitting deep inside Russia in the past months. But it is that essential symbolism of the Biden Administration saying at this point, we're frankly willing to take this move. We're willing to chance whatever Russia may do in response, they say because of the implementation of Russian forces using North Korean troops potentially in operation to retake that part of Russia, Kursk, that Ukraine moved into in August. But I think you have to remember here too that we are dealing with the twilight days of the Biden Administration, this has been something they have been pretty strident and concrete on for much of that term. And I think they are looking to possibly drag the United States into a deeper place in this conflict. Remember, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has said that if these missiles are fired by Ukraine, U.S. made U.S. supplied as they are. That is essentially NATO joined the conflict when those missiles hit targets inside of Russia. We haven't heard from him today. He may wheel back on that, as he has in the past, but that fear of escalation, it's one, it seems, that Biden is willing to take in the months ahead, most likely because it's potentially short lived, and it will indeed complicate or give extra leverage to President-Elect Donald Trump when he takes the office on January the 20th.",

The source tells CNN, one sticking point is Hezbollah's opposition to a clause that would allow Israel to take direct action in Lebanon in response to any ceasefire violations. Well, talks may get a boost when U.S. Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein returns to Beirut. It is unclear when that will happen, though Reuters reports he is expected to arrive Tuesday, tomorrow. Well, meantime, the bombing goes on in Lebanon. Israel's military killed another high-ranking Hezbollah official, the media spokesperson, in a strike in Beirut on Sunday. And for the first time, the IDF is acknowledging, it's using artillery batteries inside Lebanese territory to attack targets. Paula Hancocks is here with me. Look much talk about the potential for a ceasefire on this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in the next couple of weeks or so. But clearly, the Israelis feel at this point that ratcheting up the efforts on Hezbollah will put this ceasefire in a better place. That seems to be the perspective from the Israelis.

The defense minister saidlast week that they were going to expand what they had originally called a limited ground operation. Of course, there was skepticism, even when they said it at the beginning. But what we're seeing now is with these artillery batteries, the fact that they have military equipment based inside southern Lebanon to help their effort they say. These were these were based along the border on Israeli territory, and firing across the border, that is a significant move. It shows that they are expanding what they are trying to do. And in the same breath, you're hearing about this potential ceasefire and optimism from American, from Israeli and from Lebanese officials that this ceasefire could reap some rewards. The fact that we've heard from Lebanese official diplomatic efforts are on fire now. They're optimistic that Hezbollah may agree to these the ceasefire proposal on the table. It's a 60-day ceasefire. It's temporary. It's supposed to form the basis of the permanent ceasefire. But as you mentioned at the beginning there, one of the major sticking points is Israel wants to be able to go back into Lebanon or to fire on Lebanese, and Hezbollah targets if they think that ceasefire is being violated, that's unlikely to be something Hezbollah will agree to.",

Young women were making statements under oath. The same women who were also participating in a criminal inquiry into Matt Gaetz. So, these women were at a party in 2017, where an alleged sexual encounter with an underage girl took place. And they have never spoken publicly about what happened. In a deposition, though, of the man who brought the lawsuit, a deposition we can see in court transcripts a friend of Gaetz. He was speaking to attorneys, and the attorneys asked him what the women had to say about a then underage girl having sex with Gaetz while the friend watched and about an array of drugs at the party. This friend of Gaetz, Christopher Dorworth, suggested in his testimony, that the women made up their stories. And of course, Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. He was never charged with any crime. But one source familiar with the Congressional investigation, Becky, told CNN that if the House Ethics Committee work includes information from this litigation, presumably the part that's still secret, what the women were saying under oath, it would be, quote, highly damaging for Gaetz. Of course, the House wasn't able to get access to records from the separate Justice Department Criminal Investigation into Matt Gaetz now closed. So now there's pressure mounting in Washington on the House Ethics Committee. Their work ended whenever Gaetz was announced as Trump's nominee for the Justice Department last week, and then very quickly resigned from Congress, meaning the release of that report. What their findings were, what those women were saying, even in that lawsuit that the House Committee now has, that all is jeopardized.

Now the U.S. economy has been incredibly strong. President Biden reclaimed the mantle of leadership in many of these conflicts. But once again, that's become the narrative, and that's become the conversation here. We've seen President Xi Jinping of China meeting with many other leaders here in Rio de Janeiro to try to foment China's position in the world. And we've also seen them touting their economic role here in Latin America, with a $1.3 billion port in Peru and many investments throughout this continent. That's something that the U.S. has been trying to counter, although their effort is still much more nascent than the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative that's now been more than a decade in the making. So, this has been a position by the Chinese. It's been a fear by the West, and only time will tell how that plays out over the next term of Donald Trump, Becky.",

The risk isthat they could go even higher if there are these mass deportations that the President-Elect has talked about. The problem is that this is a sector that relies heavily on foreign labor, including undocumented workers. And the logic is simple, fewer workers means less food and higher prices. Let's just look at one example, U.S. crop farm workers. The USDA has found that a plurality of workers in this job, 41 percent are undocumented. I talked to a farmer in Michigan who told me that if there were mass deportations, it would be devastating to the ag economy, because there just would not be enough people to pick the crops. But it's not just about farmers, right? This is an issue across the food supply chain, tens or even hundreds of thousands of workers in various parts of this industry are undocumented, including in food production, in grocery stores and of course, restaurants, a total 1.7 million people are estimated to be undocumented workers. And so yes, that is why economists and farmers and ag experts have told me that if there are mass deportations, it could send grocery prices higher, perhaps significantly higher. It's true, there could be a loss in demand if there's millions of people who are no longer here, but economists say that, that would be completely overshadowed by the loss of workers.
