It's also 05:00 a.m. in Wilmington, Delaware, where the Biden campaign is waking up to new data that may give them renewed confidence since in their campaign strategy. A new national poll shows President Biden pulling ahead of Donald Trump with a six-point lead in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup. This, of course, represents a snapshot in time. There are nine months to go before the general election. But it's still a notable shift from December when the same Quinnipiac poll found a Biden-Trump race to be too close to call. This comes after Republican voters have started to weigh in and Biden has started to engage more aggressively on the campaign trail. It could give us a glimpse into how voters are reacting as the likelihood of a Donald Trump, as the Republican nominee, becomes more real. It's also notable that the gender gap has grown significantly here since that December poll, when Biden was favored over Trump by 12 points among women voters. At the end of January, Quinnipiac found it was 22 points. Let's bring in Eugene Scott. He is \"Axios\" senior politics reporter. Eugene, good morning. It's always good to see you.",

U.S. central command says the strikes are meant to destroy the capabilities of the Iran-backed militant group before it can attack international shipping lines in the Red Sea region. The strikes also follow another close call in the same area when one Houthi missile came within a mile of a U.S. warship, the Gravely, before it was shot down. Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us live now from London. Elliott, good morning. Always good to have you. How much of a threat are these back-and-forths strike to global commerce. And how does this play into tensions around the questions of wider escalation in the region? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST:  Kasie, when you've got one of the worlds most important shipping lanes being menaced by the Houthis, its inevitable that there is going to be an economic impact and an impact on global trade before the Houthi started firing drones and missiles and the like towards shipping in the Red Sea. It accounted for about 10 percent of all global trade -- trade would pass through the Red Sea and head on up often to the Suez Canal, which has also being impacted. That's being a crucial source of revenue for the Egyptians, which made about $9 billion from it last year. And if that goes down, it could push the fragile Egyptian economy in -- over the edge, it could end up defaulting or something like that. So, a lot of shipping is now having to go the long way round, around the Horn of Africa. That's increasing freight rates, the cost of shipping goods by about four fold in some cases. And for those ships that are brave enough to continue going through the Red Sea, their insurance premiums have ballooned as well, and all this is going to add to the cost of everything from food to your IKEA furniture, and, of course, this is just after the world economy is trying to get over the hump in inflation, that it experienced in the wake of the pandemic. So, it's having a big impact on trade and certainly regional economies. There globally, China not very happy a lot of its goods will go thanks through the Suez Canal, India not very happy because a lot of the crews on the ships are Indian and let's not forget the China and India are both allies of Iran as well. In terms of the escalation, I suppose for now, the U.S. is limiting it when it's attacked by the Houthis to Yemen. I suppose the bigger concern is what its response will be to the killing of those three U.S. servicemen in Jordan, and Iran has already said that any attacks on it will not go unanswered. For now though, the U.S. is just retaliating to these Houthi strikes on the Houthis themselves. And I suppose the hope is that there will not be a broader escalation. The U.S. and Iran don't seem to want a war and were not there yet. But obviously, there's always a danger when you have Iranian proxies effectively at war with us -- Kasie.",

So a lot of things really haven't changed. If anything, they've gotten much worse according to many American experts and officials pointing to that growing sophistication than what they say brazenness of these alleged Chinese cyberattacks used to be more about commercial secrets, intellectual property. But now as we just heard from Wray, they carry real-world implications even with military implications. But the timing of his revelation is interesting. Of course, it's election year in the U.S., but also, this is when the Biden ministration is working hard to ease tensions with Beijing following that summit between Biden and Xi last November, we have seen a growing number of bilateral exchanges and visits happening again. So it seems for now, there's enough political will on both sides, not letting these dramatic revelation to derail this process of a thawing in this relationship -- Kasie.",

And, you know, the state of California can receive about 50 percent of its precipitation from these atmospheric river events, which typically occur this time of the year, but sometimes it's just a little bit too much too quick, right?So, the first one that we've been discussing now impacting Central and Southern California. You can see that direct stream of moisture coming off of the Pacific Ocean. There just so much energy associated with it. That's being translated into very powerful winds, especially in the higher elevations. Check that out, over 90 miles per hour clocked in some high elevation points of Southern and Central California. Wow, that's amazing. That's equivalent to a low-end category one hurricane. I mean, just incredible. High wind warnings and advice as we still dotting the landscape over the Western U.S. and with that long fetch coming off of the Pacific Ocean, we have really large swells impacting those West-facing shorelines across California. High surf advisories, waves between 10 to 20 feet, depending on where you're located, and then there's the rain. This is where it becomes significantly impactful for large population area, the Bay Area, down to Ventura and Santa Barbara Area. This particular region just getting battered by precipitation right now. Los Angeles, not included within the watch for flood watch. Flood watch at the moment, they believe the National Weather Service believes that this will move on rather quickly and just creates some nuisance flooding and within the urban areas. But nonetheless, be careful for ponding on the roads, lots of snow associated with this system, will be measuring that in feet and, Kasie, I need to end with this.
