We are following the very latest developments here in the Middle East, following the Israeli airstrike in Lebanon that killed Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah.There are no signs of a let up in Israel's strikes on Lebanon, despite new fears of a wider war in the region. In recent hours, Israel conducted new airstrikes in the south and east of the country, killing at least 10 people, according to Lebanese state news agency. That's on the heels of a series of strikes that reportedly killed more than a thousand others over the past week. But the U.S. says Israel is also moving troops to the border with Lebanon. That's the border in the south of Lebanon, of course. A possible sign of preparations for a limited cross-border incursion. Israel says a ground operation is only one of the options it is considering. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  We need to understand there's a huge amount of different tools that we have in our toolbox. Ground operations is one of them. We are preparing for that if it is required, if we receive the instructions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's some of the infrastructure that Hezbollah operatives are using. And also, it is the weapons caches, which Israel claims are being kept in civilian houses, in civilian areas. So, this is what the Israeli military say that they are targeting at this point.And it's what they've been targeting for days now, this aerial bombardment, trying to take out as much of the Hezbollah infrastructure as possible, as Israel does consider whether or not it wants to carry out this ground invasion. Now, one senior Israeli official has told CNN that it is not the preferred option for Israel to actually go in on the ground in into Southern Lebanon, but vocally and very publicly, the IDF is saying that they are preparing for that and they would be ready for that eventuality. Now, of course, the big question is what happens elsewhere in the region as to whether or not this does become this wider conflict that everybody has been so concerned about for months now. We have heard from Iran, we've heard from the supreme leader saying that the fate of the region will be determined by the resistance forces at the top of which is a victorious Hezbollah. We've heard from the Iranian U.N. ambassador saying he's calling for an emergency meeting at the U.N. Security Council about this Nasrallah assassination. We also heard from the foreign minister.

You argue in a recent piece that Hezbollah is in a bind as the conflict with Israel escalates the path forward for the party as one fraught with obstacles and will need to contend with a complicated domestic dynamic likely to challenge its political power in Lebanon.

Look, the Hezbollah historically has played an important role, particularly after Israel's 2000 unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. And then, after the -- where they decided to maintain their arms and then after the assassination of Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, for which five members of Hezbollah were indicted a string of assassinations. I won't go through the history.But in 2006, Hezbollah was seen by many as a hero, particularly Hassan Nasrallah for having defied Israel and withstood Israel's onslaught on Lebanon. After that, through a series of actions within Lebanon, it increasingly was being perceived as a sectarian figure. As you know, there were -- there was a sit in, we had a string of assassinations in Lebanon, for which -- many of which Hezbollah was accused of, but also, you know, obstructing the port explosion. The port explosion itself, the material that was there was assumed to be there at the request of Hezbollah. So, there were many factors that came into play where Hezbollah in Lebanon became the face of protecting the status quo. But at the same time, its support as of 2011, 2012 for the regime of Bashar al-Assad also alienated a large -- you know, large swaths off the Arab population who, until then, saw him as a hero standing up to Israel and standing up for the Palestinian cause, standing up for the under trodden. So, the domestic dynamics notwithstanding, his broader Arab appeal remained until 2011, 2012. I'm talking about Hassan Nasrallah, but also Hezbollah. As of 2012, the support for Bashar al-Assad, and frankly, I think Bashar al-Assad would not have stayed in power without the military and political support of Hezbollah and Hassan Nasrallah specifically, turned much of the Arab region, the broadly Sunni Arab region, against him. He was seen to be supporting a mass murderer, someone who was inflicting -- using chemical weapons on his own population. So, in a sense, he went from being -- he remains a hero to -- as you said, to large groups of people, but to a broader public. And we've seen this in the reaction to his killing, he's seen as a villain.",

But it's unlikely to retaliate and get dragged into an all-out -- an even more larger regional conflict.We've seen the reactions from the Houthis and the PMF, they have been, you know, modest at best in terms of what they could be doing if they really wanted to react and kind of activate this Axis of Resistance, this unity front strategy, which was the key reason why Hezbollah got involved in the Gaza conflict to begin with. So, I'm not seeing any kind of -- any significant reaction at that point. They're still very careful about not wanting to trigger an all- out war. And I think it's this understanding that prompted Netanyahu's calculus and pushed him to, you know, keep pushing the envelope and carry out this assassination. There's no doubt in my mind that the loss of Hassan Nasrallah -- I mean, he was an iconic figure and his loss will be felt for quite some time, for a long time, I think. He really was a pivotal actor in this Axis of Resistance. It wasn't just his charisma, his leadership, but it was also his personal relationships with all the different groups.",

Israel says it carried out new airstrikes in Lebanon today, hitting targets in the east and south of the country. At least 10 were killed according to Lebanon's state news agency That is happening amid fears of a wider war in the region following Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader in Beirut.Well, the U.S. now says Israel is moving troops to the border with Lebanon, a possible sign of preparations for a limited cross-border incursion, although Israel says a ground operation is only one option that it is considering. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, killed in an airstrike on Friday. The announcement of his death made public about 24 hours ago.

Well, Miri Eisin is a retired colonel of the Israel Defense Forces and a senior fellow today at the International Institute for Counterterrorism. Miri, it's good to have you.

MIRI EISIN (RET.), SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM AND ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES (RET.):  First of all, we need to be sure that the threat that Hezbollah has posed with the enormous arsenal that Hassan Nasrallah oversaw both before 2006 and certainly, since the second Lebanon war in 2006, that that arsenal, which is right on the border, it's not just underneath the domestic urban areas of Beirut or in the Beqaa Valley, they put it on the border. They were planning to do a kind of October 7th attack. We need to be sure that threat is removed. And I think that that is the most immediate next aspect for the IDF.",

So, it's not that they haven't used the arsenal. But what we're looking at right now, when we're looking at the bigger threat, is the chance of how we bring Israelis back home.The City of Kiryat Shmona that you've been in, you reported from there in the past, and that city has been pretty much empty from October 8th. That's when Hezbollah joined into Hamas' attack. And so, in that sense, I think that what the IDF and here Israel is trying to do is not just giving a message, and this goes hand in hand with diplomacy, but it's doing an action. Because I, Becky, don't know any other way right now to move those arsenals, Radwan Forces that were there on the border, out of there. I don't know any international force that will do so.

They have an enormous amount of weaponry that they've built inside the towns and villages.And in that sense, it's going to be booby traps, entrapments. We can be very aware of that.

And the disappearance of the main orator of Hassan Nasrallah himself, the degrading of Hezbollah's capabilities, which are far stronger than Hamas' capabilities, the degrading, not the disappearance, impacts Hamas' capabilities down south.
