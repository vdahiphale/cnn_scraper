That system of justice must be fixed and due process must be restored for all Americans.\" He went on to say that that is something that Donald Trump will do.But again, I think this does also provide an opening for some of the sweeping changes we know Donald Trump has been talking about, both publicly, but also really, I'm told, it's been ramped up behind closed doors as well in his conversations with those around him, that he wants big changes. He wants to root out what he keeps calling bias at some of the biggest departments, including the Department of Justice and in the FBI. And perhaps this is the opening they need to try and gain more support from the public for some of the things that he really wants to do.",

But look, that is playing exactly into what I was just mentioning. I mean Patel is someone who has called for shutting down the bureau's Washington headquarters for firing FBI leadership and also for rooting out bias that they believe agents have really permeated the bureau, I should say, over the last several years. This is something that is very important to Donald Trump.I was told when he was making this decision, he was between two candidates. Patel and Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. And the reason he didn't like Bailey, I was told he was not impressed with his in-person interview with him, but also because he didn't believe that he had the personality traits or fit the mold that Donald Trump is looking for, which is really a legal pit bull and someone who will carry out his agenda and really reform and disrupt the agency that Donald Trump has really been gunning to do for several years now.

I would argue he's clearly not. He doesn't have the experience and knowledge of the law enforcement community. He has a fairly undistinguished legal career. He doesn't really have a fraction of the qualifications that any former FBI director chosen by any president has.But that's really not my main concern. My main concern is what it says about Donald Trump's intention for the FBI and where Kash Patel might take the FBI if he's confirmed as director. And that all points in one direction. And that is back to the FBI's regretful history of acting as essentially the enforcement arm for the president's political activities. That's where we come from as an institution. That's who we were under our first director, J. Edgar Hoover. But it is something we've gotten away from in the last 50 years, the post-Watergate, post- Church Committee, Pike Committee investigations. And we, the FBI today, is an independent entity that the nation relies on to enforce its criminal laws and protect it from national security threats. So, I think it's a really - a really concerning pick.",

They are scientists and computer specialists and analysts and secretaries and professional support staff who aren't - clearly wouldn't be sent out around the country to work as cops, as he has threatened.But it would be a significant disruption to pursue any, you know, any portion of that.

There are - there - you shouldn't even think about accepting a nomination like this unless you're someone who has spent a lot of time thinking about understanding the FBI, knowing its people and how it works, and having a clear, articulable vision about where you intend to take the organization. Every new FBI director takes it in a different direction, makes it something it wasn't before. That's a good and healthy process.But we've heard nothing about that from Kash Patel except these insane rants about the footprint is too big - I don't even know what that means - sending people out to work as police officers and turning the headquarters into a museum. None of that will actually happen. But what sort of burn it all down damage is he going to do because he really has no other credible direction to take the agency?",

Really, the largest territorial gains we've seen in the Syrian civil war for eight years. Effectively, Bashar al Assad had managed to quell the rebellion with the help of three key backers, the Iranians, Hezbollah, and, of course, Russia. Now perhaps because Russia is distracted with Ukraine, Iran is facing strikes of its own and the losses on the battlefield of its various proxies. Hezbollah, of course, has been battered by Israeli strikes. The rebels appear to have thought this was the moment to launch a renewed offensive. They were able to take complete control of the city of Aleppo. They are in complete control of Idlib. They are now knocking on the door of the central city of Hama. But as you mentioned, we are now seeing the regime punching back with the help of Russia. Those airstrikes. You just showed that harrowing clip. According to the White Helmets, the civil defense group, at least 25 people were killed in those strikes in Idlib and also Aleppo. Among the dead, women and children. These are the kinds of scenes, Kate, that you may well remember, we all grew very accustomed to seeing during the height of the Syrian civil war, but had not seen for at least four or five years. So, the question now remains, what happens with this rapid rebel advance? Do we continue to see a doubling down on airstrikes from Russia and the regime? And what will be the future fate of Syrian President Bashar al Assad? Kate.",

So, there's no way to bring it back to the United States.What some companies are trying to do is move to other factories and other South Asian countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, et cetera. But most of those factories have been set up in those countries by the Chinese manufacturers who just set up - set up production in these other countries so they move their equipment, let's say, to Vietnam. They send the raw materials from China to Vietnam and then they use the Vietnamese labor. So, it just - and for the price point, the kind of shoes that we make, again, moderate price shoes, these other countries prefer to make higher priced shoes, like you mentioned in your opening about athletic shoes, sneakers retailing for $90.
