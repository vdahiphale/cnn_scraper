      "sentences": "And ladies and gentlemen of this congregation, it's true. She didn't do that. She chose to deflect and to do two things that are referee for any lawyer, but particularly for a prosecutor. She chose to pull out the race card and the god card. That's what she did, and she wrote it out. She went on to deflect away from the allegations in the Wade motion, and she said she's saying why, and in her public discussion with God, why, are they only attacking one in reference to Mr. Wade.And then she goes on to say, God, isn't it them playing the race card when they only question one? Now, if she had been truthful with that congregation, truthful with the community, she would have said, I had a relationship with him, good, bad, forgive me, whatever. That's what she should have said, but she chose to deflect and say the them, the reference to them and the others and they. It's obviously a reference to the motion filed by, um, by Miss Merchant. They, choose to go after, the black man, and she then goes on again deflecting away and deflecting away from I call the third rail in American society, choosing somebody on the other side of being a racist? So and so is a racist, they're racist. She was the one playing the race card in a way to try to deflect from her own conduct. She goes on to say, in her discussions with the Lord God, is that, is it that some will never see a black man as qualified, no matter his achievements? Again, the deflection. What is she saying? The listener is not necessarily in that audience in that church. The listener is at Fulton County. The potential jurors who will come into a courtroom and say whether or not they can fairly judge the evidence or judge the defense in this case. She chose to inject race into the minds of the listeners and virtually everybody in this community and literally everybody in this country has reviewed and analyzed her speech that she made in a premeditated way. And in bringing in not only the race card, but also in bringing in the religious matter, this is exactly what Hammons v. State and our Supreme Court talks about. Condemning is an inflammatory appeal to the jurors' private religious beliefs. Why would she do that? To deflect. But now, not only is she deflecting, but she is then going forward and in a way telling the community, telling the congregation that God is on her side, not on the side of these people. God, she said, and when she's talking and she's saying, God, pray for their souls, I, meaning God, qualified you, I qualified your imperfect, flawed self, I see you in every hour, do my work. As though she's telling the folks in her very, very, very implicit way, injecting into the minds of the jurors, God wants me to win this case. God wants me to prosecute this case. And why is he going, and why are these others going after the black man? Well, the answer is very simple. As we said in our brief, we didn't mention Mrs. Cross, Mr. Cross, the white female, or Mr. Floyd, the white male, because there was absolutely no evidence, and is no evidence, of a personal romantic relationship with them in which he obtained these benefits. That's the reason why we are -- we did not do that. So, she goes forward with her, with the deflections. That's exactly what she does when she goes forward and she talks about a planned interviews time and time again with authors of a book, Find Me the Votes, where she's talking about a case that's going to be tried in this courtroom. It's reprehensible.",
