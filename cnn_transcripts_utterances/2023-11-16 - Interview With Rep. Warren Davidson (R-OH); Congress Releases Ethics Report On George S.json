Yesterday, Biden sat down with Xi in an effort to ease those tensions and to gauge Beijing's posture on global flash points from Ukraine to Gaza, the leaders vowing to reopen high-level military communications and to combat the illicit fentanyl trade. But it was this exchange after the talks between Biden and our senior White House correspondent, M.J. Lee, that made headlines. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) M.J.

The president fielded questions about the hostage negotiations. He said that he remained mildly optimistic, but stopped short of offering any details about why he thought this. On the Al Shifa Hospital and Israel's claim that there is a Hamas command center under it, I pressed him a couple of times on that, and he said he was absolutely confident, based on everything he knows, that that is the truth, though, obviously there have been questions about what kind of intelligence the U.S. actually has to back that up. And then just on the duration of the war, he said he simply couldn't predict how long this was going to last, but he said, how this will end, have to end with a two-state solution, and that he had told the Israelis that what isn't acceptable is for the Israelis to reoccupy Gaza.

That is what the Palestinian Ministry of Health said today, citing medical sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.Now, in the meantime, the pressure is growing for Israel Defense Forces to release proof of the Hamas command center they say is behind -- underneath, rather, Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa. IDF troops raided the facility yesterday, and a spokesman says Israeli forces remain active today in and around the hospital. Now, the IDF released video from inside the hospital, saying it shows military equipment used by Hamas. Gaza's government media office, which is run by Hamas, said Israel is lying. CNN cannot verify either side's claims. Let's bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann in Tel Aviv, Israel, for more on this. So what is happening inside the hospital right now, Oren?",

You just saw there that was IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus showing weapons he insists were found inside the hospital, as well as ammunition, protective vests. But that's a far cry from what the IDF has for years claimed and has even published 3-D renderings of, and that is a Hamas infrastructure underneath the hospital, a Hamas operation center. That is something we have not seen any evidence of to this point. A senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that will take time, even as doctors and health officials inside the hospital insist that Hamas doesn't use it for its own purposes, that it is a medical facility, the largest in Gaza, that has effectively been knocked out of commission for several days now because of IDF operations. It's important to note it's not just the IDF's credibility and Israel's credibility that is at stake here. You heard from President Joe Biden just a short moment ago, and we have also heard John Kirby from the National Security Council say it. The U.S. has very much backed Israel up on this claim that Hamas has facilities underneath the hospital.

In American history, there have only been five members who have ever been expelled from the House. Two of them were convicted in court, the latest being James Traficant in 2002. The other three were because -- were kicked out because of their ties to the Confederacy.
