Just because it's Friday, though, doesn't mean the news has taken the day off. So let's get to it. We begin with President Biden set to make a 2024 election bid official. He's been hinting at it for a while. But now four sources are telling CNN that he will formally announced his bid for a second term with a campaign style video as soon as next Tuesday. The timing could still change pending on foreseen events, which is typical in that job. But one senior Democratic official telling CNN, it is no longer helpful or necessary to avoid stating the obvious that he's running. Here is more from chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly.

What they wouldn't make clear what exactly he was going to announce that. The president repeatedly saying he intended to run in Ireland last week, saying that he'd made the decision and announcement would be forthcoming soon. But when is very much something that people couldn't literally figure out. Very small group of advisers kind of in control of that timeline of that process of building a reelection campaign, a campaign officials now say is likely to be announced next week.Next week, marking the four year anniversary from when President Biden launched his first campaign for presidency to defeat Donald Trump. He was successful in that endeavor, and in the years since he has these, based on the view of White House officials, based on the president's political advisors built a very real very substantive agenda, legislative accomplishments -- accomplishments that are now being implemented across the country, and that more than anything else. So they say the president is going to be focusing on in the months ahead. The model is kind of out in the open. The president has been making very clear those priorities. These accomplishments and also a very clear contrast between Republicans that he knows he will certainly be running against, whether or not that's Donald Trump or somebody else, advisors don't necessarily want to weigh in, but they feel confident that based on that agenda, and based on those contrasts, they have a winning formula. But it's a formula that will certainly take developing over time. And they also underscore when you talk to White House officials and the president's political team that this will be a year of building -- building up on their campaign, whether or not that's the president's travel, how they try and focus things but also building behind the scenes. The infrastructure of the campaign has largely been put together behind the scenes over the course of the last couple of months, but they will spend 2023 testing digital strategies, testing data strategies, testing voter messages and watching the Republican primary play out, and that last point is a critical one, because it was one of the drivers behind the president's decision to wait until next week to launch that campaign, recognizing that there's no real pressure on the Democratic side from any potential primary opponent, there's a recognition that the president was likely to run again. And certainly there was plenty of fighting that they were happy to watch from the sidelines on the Republican side of things. But now, the president ready to engage. Major donors are expected in Washington at the end of next week to meet with the president's senior team. This is all building towards what people knew it was coming. They just didn't know when. The when appears to be next week. Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, it's hard to assess at the moment, its impact as a recruitment tool, but it's very clear that this is designed to recruitment directly into the war in Ukraine. The ministry of defense uses the tagline which in Russian translates roughly as join your own and plays on the Russian acronym for special military operations.So there's no doubt there. Look, I think to be fair, a lot of armies do use recruitment videos that play on the ideas of confidence, of strength, of manhood in some ways, but this also speaks to Russia's challenges that it's having in recruiting trained personnel for the battlefield. We saw with that recruitment drive back in the autumn, they recruited 300,000 untrained personnel. I think this is an entirely different kind of recruitment that we're seeing now, using the special military operation, the war in Ukraine as a recruitment drive, in itself. We know they're trying to swell the ranks of their professional army by about 400,000 men. So, clearly, they are committing also these kind of PR resources to that. Obviously, it's jarring looking at it from outside of Russia, knowing what we know about the kinds of casualties they're facing on the battlefield. The latest leaked Pentagon documents suggesting that about 43,000 Russians have been killed in combat. That's just an estimate. But I think inside Russia it's worth noting that, A, public service announcements are pretty common, and secondly, that it is a country with very defined gender roles. So I think that play on the idea of manliness may be more effective than hat it seems from the outside.",
