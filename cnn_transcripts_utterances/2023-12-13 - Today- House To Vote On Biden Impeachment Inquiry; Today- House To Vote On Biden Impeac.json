How they plan to make the tech as standard as seatbelts?We are following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Well, we are following the day-long clash on Capitol Hill over House Republicans' escalating probe into President Biden. A couple hours from now, the full House will vote on formalizing a Biden impeachment inquiry. The GOP's probe so far has failed to show any clear links between Biden and his son Hunter's questionable business dealings. Republicans think this resolution will give them more investigative leverage. This morning, Hunter Biden showed up at the Capitol right outside, as you see right here, offering to testify publicly in the probe. But Republicans want a closed-door interview first. So now they say that they're going to pursue a contempt of Congress referral against Hunter Biden. CNN's Manu Raju is following all of this. Manu, you have been a busy man up there on Capitol Hill today. What do we expect to see in the coming hours?",

In fact, the inquiry has been going on since September when then-Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy unilaterally announced that this investigation would go forward.They actually don't need a vote to authorize an inquiry, but Republicans are trying to show some forward momentum. They argue that they can have more power if this gets dragged out into court, as they're trying to get documents and try to enforce their subpoenas and the like. But the reality is that they want to show momentum. They want to show Republican unity behind the idea of an impeachment inquiry. But what's clear in talking to so many Republican members is that there is not unity about whether Joe Biden should, in fact, be impeached because of the fact that they plainly acknowledge they do not have proof yet to show that Joe Biden acted corruptly on behalf of his son, to benefit his son Hunter Biden's business dealings. They say that that needs to be gathered during this impeachment probe. Now, the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, believes that they do have the votes today to go ahead, and he made clear that this is an issue that he believes his party will get behind.

They argue that today's vote is going to strengthen their legal standing against the White House and fortify their subpoenas of key witnesses.Now, we want to dig into one of the central claims against Biden, that in 2016, as Vice President, he abused his powers to pressure Ukraine to fire this top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. He was allegedly investigating the Ukrainian energy company Burisma and Hunter Biden, of course, served on the firm's board at the time. Republicans are arguing that Vice President Biden forced him out to protect his son. Now, the fact is, Biden did push for the prosecutor to be fired, but that was consistent with bipartisan U.S. policy at the time. Multiple Republican senators called for Shokin to be fired, including Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Shokin's firing was also applauded by European Union allies, who saw it as a way to root out corruption in Ukraine. Even back in 2019, Donald Trump's own special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, testified that Shokin's firing was widely understood internationally to be the right policy. And this, David Holmes, a former diplomat in Ukraine testified that in his understanding, Shokin was not at that time pursuing investigations of Burisma or the Bidens. This is just one example of why several Republican lawmakers have emphasized caution over the impeachment inquiry, believing that it could potentially backfire, while others are ready to go full steam ahead.

Congressman, the impeachment inquiry resolution is expected to pass. What are you hearing from some of your moderate Republican colleagues on this vote? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (R-FL): Well, listen, I think they're making a grave mistake. I've talked to some of them, but they're afraid of Donald Trump. This is what Donald Trump has demanded of the Republican Party. He has 50 percent of the nation's impeachments in American history, and he's got a hundred percent of the indictments. All hundred percent of the indictments in American history are against Donald Trump and Joe Biden has none of those. And so they're trying to run up the score. And so, look, this is going to rally Democrats and I think Independents around the president to see them do an impeachment with no evidence. Chuck Grassley, who's leading the investigation, Sen. Chuck Grassley is leading the investigation in Senate, came out today and said there is no evidence, based on everything they've seen. All of the tens of thousands of documents that have been turned over by the Biden administration, something the Trump administration did not do in their investigations. Their - the Chairman Comer's own witness, the Republicans' own constitutional witness in committee said of everything we know, there's no evidence to impeach Joe Biden. It doesn't rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.",

Where do you think they got those documents from?You can't claim that you're not getting compliance when you have 50,000 pages of documents that have been turned over to you. You've done a half a dozen depositions. You've taken all of this other testimony. You've held hearings. You've brought government witnesses in during those hearings. And so they have gotten tremendous compliance from the White House. The problem is the evidence doesn't show that Joe Biden did anything wrong. And so, look, the chairman has worked very hard at trying to convince the American people that Joe Biden did anything wrong.

I'm sure the chairman regrets his invitation.But this is the first instance in which we have a witness taking the chairman up on his invitation to testify publicly. Transparency, right, for it to be transparent in front of the cameras, for Hunter to tell his side of the story and answer all of the questions. Remember, Republicans control the committees. They control the rules in committees. They can keep Hunter there for 10 hours in front of the cameras. And now, the chairman is scared of Hunter Biden. He's running away. And what he's going to do, he's going to try to hold someone in contempt who's trying to come and testify publicly. Look, Hunter, obviously has been indicted. There are some things he's got to deal with. And if the - if he's found guilty, he'll have to deal with those penalties, right? Democrats believe in justice.

And we know, since Roe was overturned, abortion has been a really hot issue on the campaign trail. Now, here specifically, we're talking about access to the most commonly used abortion medication, Mifepristone, that when used with another drug, it accounts for a significant number of abortions in the United States. Now, some lower courts have tried to restrict access to Mifepristone. Right now, those decisions are on hold, while the Supreme Court looks at this issue of the nationwide access. Now, this drug has been approved by the FDA for 23 years. They approved it back in 2000, and in the past few years, they've actually made it more accessible. You can now get it through telemedicine appointments. You can even get it delivered by mail. But opponents, abortion rights opponents, have argued that the FDA did not sufficiently vet its safety here and didn't adequately account for risks when they made it more accessible. Now, some people have said that that's just a Trojan horse to further restrict abortion nationwide, but this, as you said, Pamela, this is going to be one of the biggest cases of the term, so definitely one to watch.

AVRIL BENOIT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS-USA: Yes, the infectious disease situation is galling because, of course, in a context of a total siege where people lack medicine, they lack drinking water, clean water. We are seeing an increase in skin rashes, skin diseases, lice, things that are exacerbated by the unhygienic conditions. We're seeing a lot of diarrhea. We are seeing fevers.

We've had colleagues killed. We've had colleagues unable to move because of all the violence and the fighting.And so what happens in the hospitals also is that people who are there are unable to receive care because even the medical staff cannot always reach the hospital in due time when they're coming and going between, checking in on their families and so forth. In the hospitals themselves, it's a continuing catastrophic situation. Too many patients, insufficiency of medicine, not enough space. A lot of people sheltering in hospitals, still no water, no food, and a lot of things are going on outside of the hospitals as well. In the last month, we estimate that there are 5,500 newborns, babies born in these kinds of horrible conditions, often in the rubble or in the camps. And the pregnant and lactating mothers lack enough nutrition. So they are famished, they're thirsty, they are getting sick and unable to look after these newborns through breastfeeding. And of course, there aren't any other options because of the total siege.
