Colombia's president has announced -- first, he announced then he retracted a claim that the young children had been found alive, but rescuers -- they still have hope.CNN's Stefano Pozzebon has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST (voice-over):  A glimmer of hope. Colombia's president tweeting that four children on board the single- engine aircraft that crashed in the jungle on May first had been found alive and well. Rescuers using scattered debris to trace them. But on Thursday, the president's tweet was deleted, saying that information, quote, \"could not be confirmed.\" Government officials blaming poor communication. And the head of the country's children welfare authority later saying she was, quote, \"very confident about their rescue.\" She said, quote, \"We are still missing that very, very last link that confirms all our hopes. Until we have the photo of the kids we won't be stopping. We are not underestimating the information we received but we want to confirm directly ourselves.\" The Colombian Armed Forces have been using dogs to search for the children. The plane had taken off from the remote area of Araracuara bound for San Jose Del Guaviare. Rescuers from the military and local indigenous communities are not giving up hope to bring home the little ones as they follow a trail of small objects, such as hair scrunchies and baby bottles, even bringing a recording of the grandmother to at least one of the children to help in the search. But efforts are difficult given the rainfall in the dense part of the jungle.",

Obviously, as I said, the rivers are kind of the highway so they're going to be using those waterways to get to and from places, obviously, to extract the survivors out and things of that nature.POZZEBON (on camera):  And later on Thursday, the Colombian authorities confirmed that they recovered the bodies of three adults. That would be the pilot and two adult passengers from that fateful flight. But still, no words on the whereabouts of the little children, which makes this epic search and rescue operation even more frantic. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon in Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Christine. So the Lakers -- they are in trouble. Teams that fall behind 0-2 in the conference finals are 6-56 all-time, but LeBron does have two of those comebacks so there is still hope. But it was a rough night for LeBron. I'll tell you what, he did not shoot the ball well in the fourth quarter. He missed a layup at the end of the game. And Jamal Murray was just red-hot for the Nuggets. He scored 23 of his 37 points in that final period as the Nuggets ended up getting the win by a final 108-103. They now lead 2-0 in that series. Here was LeBron afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But you've got to see what happened to Tom Kim on the sixth hole yesterday. The 20-year-old hit the ball into the mud but he was determined to hit it out. So he went in after it, got stuck, and had to crawl his way out. Then he was just covered in mud. He then went back into the creek to wash himself off. Then he ended up taking his shirt off because he was just a complete mess. And Christine, he said he thought it was a good idea at first -- trying to save that stroke -- going into the mud, but when he got in there he said it was a very dark place -- is where he went.

Republican and Democratic leaders -- OK, so they're growing a little more optimistic they can reach a compromise on lifting the debt ceiling -- a deal that would avert the U.S. running out of money to pay its bills. I want to bring in Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Maya, I'm so glad you're here this morning. Thanks for getting up early for us here. I want to ask you if you think negotiators have the right focus in these negotiations because what we're hearing is this profound feeling, suddenly, of we need to have some fiscal responsibility. Is what we're seeing right now in Washington discipline or is it drama? MAYA MACGUINEAS, PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET (via Skype):  Well, the good news is that it appears that we are going to avert default without even going to the very last minute -- I'm knocking on wood -- and that would be great in terms of breaking the massive dysfunction that exists there. And the second piece of good news is that they would have a package of savings because if you look at almost all budget deals at the end of the year or whenever they get them done, they almost all increase borrowing. And just to save some money would be a big pivot in the right direction. But I think the main point here is the fiscal situation in the country is really bad in terms of our debt to GDP about to be at record levels. Our interest payments eclipsing. Spending on children and defense in the next few years. All sorts of metrics that give us something to worry about. But we're still not talking about the real issues. The things that drive the debt, which are our retirement programs, Social Security, our health care spending, Medicare, and other programs, and the fact that our revenues are too low. None of those things are part of this discussion and I think to your point, it's troubling that with all of this drama we're still not really getting at the underlying issues of why our fiscal situation is in such bad shape.",
