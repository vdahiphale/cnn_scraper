But this is a perfect example where if you're the Peterson Institute, you're not actually interested in thinking about this very difficult issue seriously, you're interested in putting out a paper that makes tariffs sound scary, and then having it reported that way on the news.

So when you hear these kind of comments or when voters hear these kind of comments, it often goes to the worst place imaginable. Now it seems as though the campaign and Donald Trump himself believe that this could harm him in some way, because we've actually seen Donald Trump now try to clean up these remarks twice. He posted on Truth Social. He also just talked about it with reporters, saying that what he was trying to say is that she is a war hawk, that she is a war monger, that she herself would never go to war, but make decisions so that other people could go to war. They have argued to me all day starting at about 5:00 AM this morning, that these are comments that other people have made. They were just made in Donald Trump's speech, essentially saying that he went too far because he talked about the violence, but that he was making an argument that she herself would not want to be in war. But again, we go back to this idea that Donald Trump has often used violent rhetoric, has often used dark rhetoric, which is why people are seizing people, being Democrats on these comments and making them, blowing them up for what they are, violent, dark rhetoric. So this is not the kind of messaging that Donald Trump or his campaign want in the final days. They want to be focused on other things like the economy, like immigration, but instead they are talking about this. And it really has been a ping-pong ball between the Trump campaign and the Harris campaign. I think the real thing to watch here is just how closely everyone is watching every single thing that not just Kamala Harris and Donald Trump say, but anyone in their orbit says, because we are just so close to the election and it is such a tight election, every single vote matters and there is concern on both sides about any kind of rhetoric that might do some damage as voters head to the polls.",

Very close to the Fed's target level. And on top of that, extraordinary public investments in infrastructure, which are going to increase productivity and also in manufacturing.
