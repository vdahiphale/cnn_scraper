He decided not to use a teleprompter during the speech. He lashed out at the judge, the Manhattan district attorney, immigrants, and what he called quote, \"a group of fascists\". Trump also repeated the false claim that President Biden and the Justice Department were behind the prosecution. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (R) AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is a case where if they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone. These are bad people. These are in many cases, I believe, sick people. When you look at our country, what's happening where millions and millions of people are flowing in from all parts of the world, not just South America, from Africa, from Asia, from the Middle East. And they're coming in from jails and prisons. And they're coming in from mental institutions and insane asylums. They're coming in from all over the world into our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just to recap, on Thursday, Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to cover up a sex scandal that might have threatened his 2016 campaign. His lawyers, as you might expect, are vowing to appeal. CNN's Brynn Gingrass is live now from New York. Boy, what a press conference. He came out swinging against the judge. He described the judge as a devil, said he has the face of an angel, but is really a devil. And just in terms of what he said to sort of try to exonerate himself, he said, listen, he couldn't testify. It wasn't a good idea, even though he wanted to testify. He couldn't. He was biased against it. But you got the impression, Brynn, that everything he said in those 35 minutes was what he would have said had he been able to testify. BRYNN GINGRASS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, of course, Zain. And there are no questions being asked of him, right? So, a little bit easier to go off on ramblings about what he could have done. Of course, he did have that option. He could have testified in his own defense at this trial. His lawyers advised him it wasn't a good idea because they believe they would have brought -- the questions would have gone into his past and that might have hurt him. Also, just his demeanor. We know from watching him on the stand for the short time that he was on the stand for the civil fraud trial last year. I mean, it was quite an event with the way he was sort of answering questions and defiant to the judge and the courtroom sort of, you know, overall courtroom, how you're supposed to act. So, well, you know, that's just Donald Trump. What we saw just right there in his speech was quintessential Donald Trump. Nothing really new to come out of it when he has been angered about this trial for ever since the indictment came. But look, he's got a sentencing ahead of them, as you said, in his sort of speech. He's brought up a number of points that aren't really true, but you certainly can see where his defense team might be going after some appeals process, which they fully we expect that, right? They're going to file a bunch of motions ahead of this July 11th sentencing date. And then after that, likely a number of appeals. They've been talking about wanting to appeal on the basis of not having a fair jury, that this jurisdiction wasn't fair. Of course, they tried to get a change of venue before the trial started. They in during the trial tried to file for mistrial based off a Stormy Daniels testimony. So, likely that will be an appeal. So, we'll see what is coming onto the docket. As far as the D.A. is concerned, we don't know yet what he is going to recommend to the judge when that sentencing date happens. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was very coy about that, said, let our filing speak. So, we'll be looking for those ahead of the 11th -- July 11th date, as well.",

Welcome to you both. Joe, let me begin with you. Donald Trump is the first former president ever convicted of a crime and now running again for president and the Republican nomination. However, Republicans and his allies try to spin this as a witch hunt. The fact that you have the majority, the vast majority of the party and some of the most prominent figures in the party rallying in his defense, slamming this case and the process and then the conviction date coming just days, the sentencing coming just days before he is going to be officially nominated at the Republican convention as the Republican nominee. What does that tell you about the state of the party right now? JOE WALSH, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN:   Well, clearly the same old story. It's Trump's party, period. But it also tells us a lot, I think, about this case. Trump's a lucky guy when you think about it. Three and a half years ago, he tried to overthrow an American election, and yet he's not standing trial for that. Instead, he's standing trial for paying off a porn star. And I think - and you alluded to this. It's not just his base. Many Republicans and independents who I've heard from over the last 12 hours are really outraged at what they see as the unfairness of this case, of this indictment. Trump breathes and thrives when he can be the victim. And I think this verdict politically is going to help him.",

What are the different factors the judge needs to weigh when he decides or during the sentencing hearing? Obviously, age is a factor. First-time offender is obviously a factor, as well. There are lots of things in his favor, the fact that it's a Class E felony. But also there were gag order violations, too.

His violation of the gag order is the fact that he's contemptuous of the system, both in his public remarks, as well as what he said that's in violation of the gag order. Judge has to sort of weigh that against the conduct that was committed here. Remember, the sentence is punishment not only for him, but it's also to serve a deterrent effect on others who might be thinking of doing the same thing. And from all reports, this judge is pretty harsh on even white- collar defendants who have been convicted of crimes there. You've got the number of counts --34. You've got the course of the conduct. How many years it took place over, the other people who were involved, the efforts he took to cover it up and the efforts he undertook to do it both at the time it was occurring and then after the fact. And while no one is going to expect him to admit that he was guilty of what's going on here, he has to show some contrition and some remorse. That's something the judge is going to be considering here. And then in terms of incarceration, how difficult will it be to incarcerate a former President along with the secret service protection that he's entitled to? Does that mean he's going to consider house arrest as an alternative or a longer term of probation? Is he going to be looking at a fine, significant, or some sort of community service? Again, not only as punishment, but to send a message. So, there are a lot of factors that the judge has to consider, and he's going to be assisted in the pleadings that are filed by both the prosecution and defense, as well as the pre-sentence investigation report.",

I found you in contempt 10 times and next time it's going to be more severe. You know, is a judge going to hang his head on the technicality? I think that he's going to be leery of doing that because that's just going to have an effect outside of the courtroom. The judge needs to control his courtroom. I think if the former President goes after the witnesses specifically by name, if he starts targeting jurors by description, by specifically saying things about individual jurors as opposed to his lack of trust in the jury system itself, I think that's where the judge is going to bring him in and have another contempt hearing and given the due process before he decides to hold them in contempt again.",

Look, I say this as someone who doesn't want Trump to win, who believes Trump is an existential threat to our democracy. This verdict, sadly, I think is going to help Trump. And I think the rest of the country really needs to wake up to that. We're going to have to beat him in November, because as you say, if he wins, there's going to be one thought on his mind, and that's retribution and that's getting revenge, using the powers of his office to get revenge against anyone who spoke up against him or stood against him.

So, we are seeing some nations in Europe and, of course, the United Kingdom biding their time when it comes to a response with regards to this verdict. But then again, we are seeing some somewhat predictable responses from nations in Europe and indeed in Russia, as well. Nations that have been friendly in the past with President Trump and, of course, nations where there is a significant far-right political presence. Now, further to that comment you heard there from Dmitry Peskov speaking to journalists earlier today, the Kremlin spokesperson, he went on to say that it is obvious that political rivals are being eliminated there through all legal and illegal means. We did hear from the State Department, Secretary of State Antony Blinken who responded to this saying it is a classic case of projection. In his words, we've also heard from the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban saying, \"Let the people make their verdict this November, keep on fighting, Mr. President.\" And we had a similar message from Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini who called this verdict a case of judicial harassment. In his words, saying in Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the left who he said for years has tried to eliminate political opponents through legal means. Now, there have been other nations which have declined to comment, including Germany. A question was put to the Foreign Office spokesman earlier this morning. He declined to comment. Rishi Sunak specifically said that he cannot be expected in the United Kingdom, of course, to respond or comment on the domestic politics or judicial processes of another nation. But this has been a case which has taken the front pages of some of the U.K.'s newspapers, of course, some of them catching up. The news came in quite late last night in the United Kingdom, it has to be said. But the key message on those front pages, Trump found guilty. Of course, we'll be waiting to see more reaction from nations across the European Union and, of course, here in the United Kingdom, whether we'll see any further comment from the Prime Minister, who is himself fighting an election this year.",

So, he repeated his familiar claim that thiswhole case was done by Joe Biden and his White House, not a shred of evidence for that. The case was brought by a locally elected prosecutor who does not even report to the federal government. He repeated a claim he's been making this week that the judge completely barred the testimony of a leading expert in election law. Also not true. The judge did limit the scope of the possible testimony of this expert, but did not, contrary to what Trump said, say he could not testify at all. He repeated his claim that a key witness for the prosecution, Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, went to prison himself for stuff that Trump said had nothing to do with me. It was his own crimes. Misleading at best, because while there were some Cohen crimes that were not directly related to Trump, others were directly related to Trump. But among the things Cohen went to prison for were campaign finance violations about this very same hush money scheme that Trump's trial centered on. So, directly related. And he also repeated this claim that he keeps saying that, you know, while prosecutors in New York were focused on him, you know, a senior citizen, a non-violent person, crime is running rampant in New York, and indeed, he said, is at unprecedented levels. That is not even close to true. As people may know, if they visited New York in the early 1990s, crime has plummeted over the last couple or few decades in New York. For example, New York had 2262 murders in 1990. Last year it was 391 -- so way down. You have similar declines for other forms of crime. So, this claim from Mr. Trump, not even close to correct.",

So, we're seeing some of Trump's biggest allies on the Hill use their positions of power in Congress to try and play defense for Trump. This is a familiar playbook that we've seen as Trump has faced multiple cases in the last year and since Republicans have taken over the majority. But more broadly, since the verdict, guilty verdict came in, we saw very quickly Trump's allies kind of just blindly jumping to his defense and trying to undermine the verdict and really try and paint this as a political persecution of the former President who are they supporting for re-election. And what's interesting to compare this to is where we see maybe some silences from other Republican leaders or even kind of delayed responses. If you compare when Speaker Mike Johnson put out that statement that you read, that was moments after the guilty verdict came in. It took Mitch McConnell, who's the Republican leader in the Senate, hours to put out a statement. And it's no history, the frosty relationship between Trump and McConnell there. So, while we're seeing Trump's allies full steam ahead, like Jordan, like Stefanik, like Speaker Johnson, using their positions of power and trying to play defense for Trump and undermine this guilty verdict, there are some others, Republicans in Congress who know that this is a litmus test in their party who are, you know, being much more careful about how they handle this.",
