It is the first state visit that has been hosted at the White House since President Biden took office, obviously because of the pandemic. Biden and Macron are expected to meet and talk about Ukraine, Iran, China, space. They're also going to hold a joint news conference this morning before a black tie dinner tonight.As you see here, the two leaders and their wives had a little informal dinner in Washington last night. CNN's M.J. Lee is live on the White House for us this morning on the South Lawn where they are getting ready to have this. I love these state visits because they're so fascinating, with all the pomp that we have not really seen in the last several years. But there are some really serious issues, M.J., for these two leaders to talk about. M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Kaitlan, as you mentioned, you can see that it is a very different setup this morning. We are coming to you from the South Lawn of the White House where any minute now we are expected to see the French president, Emmanuel Macron and his wife, the first lady of France, arrive here at the White House for President Biden's first state visit that he is hosting at the White House. We will begin with the morning arrival ceremony. That will be a big deal. You can hear the band playing behind me. And then of course the day will end with the big state dinner where hundreds of guests are expected to attend this formal dinner. There will be a tent set up outside here on the south lawn. If you are anybody who is anyone in Washington, D.C., you want an invitation to this dinner. But I should talk about the middle portion of the day. That is the working portion of the day where the two leaders are going to have a lengthy bilateral meeting followed by a press conference. And as you said, there is so many things for the two men to discuss on the agenda, including things like the ongoing war in Ukraine, challenges posed by countries like China and Iran. So it is going to be a very busy day, Kaitlan.",

We are, of course, talking about the fact that China poses an economic competitive issue around the world, how China has been dealing with the war in Ukraine, and also how the two leaders are dealing with Chinese President Xi Jinping. You know that a couple of weeks ago President Biden himself had a very lengthy bilateral meeting with Xi Jinping.But we are told that the two men are going to be trading notes on how they deal with Xi Jinping, especially because Macron himself has said that he might making a visit to Beijing sometime soon.

And there are approximately 1.2 million people living in the U.S. with HIV today, many of them restricted on when they can donate blood. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now considering revising their donor criteria, moving away from blanket assessments about donors, ones they consider a risk for transmitting HIV. This is fascinating. Our Dr. Tara Narula is here. What's changing? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  So let's take a little bit of a look back historically. And so in the early 90s, around 1985, is when we first saw this ban on men who have sex with men. So from 1985 until 2015 they were not allowed to donate blood at all. And this was really born out of the beginnings of the AIDS episode. And then in 2015 the FDA changed its plan and said actually you can, if you're a man who has sex with another man, donate blood as long as you've been abstinent for a year. Fast forward to 2020, the height of the COVID pandemic when were saw a lot of shortages, they then amended it to say as long as you've been abstinent within three months, you can donate blood. A lot of groups, the America Medical Association, the Red Cross, in fact 500 doctors and health care petitioners wrote an open letter back in 2020 saying, look, these polices are based on stigma, not science. The ability to test for HIV has changed dramatically in the last 20 years, and so now we can actually find out if someone is infected within seven to ten days of active infection. We also know that other countries have changed their policies, either eliminating these bans completely, or using more of a questionnaire based screening. And the issue really comes down to the fact that a lot of these groups are saying this should be a targeted screening approach based on your individual risk, whether you are high risk and how you have sex, what are your sexual practices, not based on how you identify and who you have sex with. So for example, there are a lot of men who have sex with men who are at low risk. They use prep. They're in monogamous relationships. And they're not allowed to donate blood compared to men or women who have sex with the opposite gender unprotected, multiple partners. They are allowed to donate blood. So there's a lot of issues here and a lot of groups saying this needs to change.",
