On the phone with - he was on the phone with Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito the day before Donald Trump's lawyers petitioned Alito and the other justices to step in and delay his upcoming sentencing. Now, Justice Alito says the call was about a job reference for a former clerk of his who wanted a position in the Trump administration.CNN's Steve Contorno picks up the story for us from here. What are you hearing this morning, Steve?",

      "sentences": "Kate, as you said, Justice Alito saying this call was relatively benign, that he was simply making a job recommendation on behalf of a former clerk, something that Supreme Court justices often do on behalf of the people who work for them. But it is not very often that they make those calls to an incoming president of the United States.And the timing of this call is certainly a note because it came just a day before Donald Trump petitioned the Supreme Court to intervene in the sentencing of his New York hush money case, which is scheduled to be tomorrow. Now, Justice Alito saying that he had no idea that that petition was coming. Let me read to you what he told CNN in a statement. Quote, \"we did not discuss the emergency application he filed today, and indeed, I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed.\" Now, this comes at a time when there are already questions and concerns about the politicalization of the Supreme Court of late, especially some of the conservatives on the court. Samuel Alito, for example, was the subject of controversy in recent years for some of the flags that were flown outside of some of his properties in Virginia and New Jersey, including an upside down American flag that neighbors spotted outside of his Virginia home around January 2021, Kate.",

Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENT-ELECT: It's very sad because I've been trying to get Gavin Newsom to allow water to come.
