I'm Abby Philip in Washington. Tonight, the sights and sounds of war caught on CNN's cameras lighting up the sky over Gaza. The rockets put two questions front and center for President Biden today. Can the United States tell its ally how to fight a war? And can the leader of the free world stitch together Democrats viscerally torn apart by Israel's campaign? Just in, sources say that President Biden and his administration are all warning Israel that it has weeks, not months, to uproot Hamas from Gaza. And that every image of a dead Palestinian child is tipping public support away from its war. The president got on in your face challenge to tell Israel that enough is enough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA):  Well, Abby, what I have called for is a ceasefire or, at minimum, a cessation of hostilities. Because a ceasefire does take time to negotiate, it does involve all parties. And I think what has to happen is a cessation of hostilities so that we can get the hostages out, we can get humanitarian aid in and we can have a real discussion of how to move forward in this very, very, very, tragic and complex time. And so, I think it is still possible. You see countries around the world continuing to call for a ceasefire or cessation of who hostilities. You see more and more people because, Abby, the death toll is just increasing of innocent civilians in Gaza. We're up to 9,000 now innocent civilians dead in Gaza. And over 3,000 of those are children and another 6,600 kids injured. And this is not in accordance with international humanitarian law, which the president has very rightly called for Israel to follow.

What I think is really very salient in this moment is how many innocent civilians are dying. And what we know is that the number of casualties, according to international law, the number of casualties of innocent civilians has to be minimized.And if you recall, there were 1.1 million Gazans who were told to go from North Gaza to South Gaza. They got to South Gaza and the IDF continued bombings in South Gaza. There have been this bombing in the refugee camp and close by Al-Quds, 12,000 people who are sheltering there, this is where these airstrikes are taking place. So, the idea that we're going to minimize the civilian casualties as we continue these kinds of strikes simply doesn't make sense. And I think what we have to understand is if we want peace and security for Israel and if we want it for Palestine, but certainly if we want it for Israel, this is not the way to go. And experts in war and terrorism are saying that this kind of bombing is simply going to turn more Palestinians towards Hamas or whatever the next iteration of Hamas.

And our young voters who are out there, and, frankly, the majority of the American population believes that Israel has a right to self-defense. They abhor what Hamas has done.

So, think of doing this for over 300 miles of tunnels. That's the difficulty of this operation.

We could have provided all this aid faster, more aggressively, that would have saved Ukrainian lives. We still have the opportunity to do that. President Biden, I think, in his recent speech, brilliantly connected Israel and Ukraine because he saw this as a systemic threat from illiberal regimes, whether it's radical terrorist groups or Russia that are looking to upend U.S. leadership, upend kind of norms-based rule of law and good governance, global governance. And I think the fact is that there's an opportunity to move forward with a very large appropriation, the $106 billion that the president has asked for, $60 billion towards Ukraine, about $40 billion for Israel and Palestine. And that could make actually some significant differences. It could provide the resources that Ukraine needs to continue to kind of chip away because I think these doom and gloom scenarios don't make a lot of sense to me. The fact is Russia does not have endless resources. It's a vast country, but it does not have endless resources. It's relying on antiquated equipment, poorly trained troops.

And most importantly can't win in November so you know he doesn't want to be called to the carpet on all this stuff what will it take I think what a you know as the polls get closer and they will as the field keeps winnowing down which it already has started, he's gonna have to start really facing the music he's going to do everything he can to avoid having to talk about him and himself as record in the future. But that's what this is about. This is about a party coming together, a country coming together, kind of healing where we are today and moving forward in a really positive way and getting past the Biden agenda, which as a conservative Republican, we all want to see. PHILLIP: I mean, you're saying that the polls are going to tighten, but they really haven't. I mean, the candidates at the bottom of this race have been trading votes. Trump has been staying where he is in the mid 40s. Aren't you running out of time to make a decision? Perhaps even before Thanksgiving when things might really get locked in.",

So naturally things are getting tighter and tighter. It's really gonna come down to, I think, two or three candidates when you hit Iowa and New Hampshire. And if you can get to a one-on-one race before Super Tuesday, That's the real race. If Trump runs the table on Super Tuesday, you're absolutely right, he's got it. But that's really the deciding day. And if you get to one-on-one, as you said, if he's in the mid-40s, well, that tells me the other candidate's gonna be in the mid-50s and Trump's gonna be in trouble.",

He also warns the weaponization of my addiction by partisan and craven factions represents a real threat to those desperate to get sober but are afraid of what may await them if they do.Now, Hunter is currently facing multiple charges, including three federal gun charges, which allege that he lied in 2018 on a form that he used to buy a gun. With me now is Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton and CNN political commentator and former Obama White House staffer Ashley Allison. Shermichael, your take on what he saying here in this op-ed which is about addiction, but it's also about him and what he's been through in terms of how it's been handled by conservatives.",

And people spend their entire lives, every single day, trying to battle it, some with great success, and unfortunately, some with not such good success.But the same compassion and empathy that he's calling for, Abby, I would have wished and hoped that his father, the chief architect of the '93 crime bill, would have had that same compassion and empathy for the 1.5 million black men that were imprisoned because of that legislation. I would have wanted the same empathy and compassion and the lack of politicization that black mothers and families and community leaders asked for when those same black men were going before judges who said, you're absolutely going to prison. I'm not going to have compassion for your addiction. And so while I understand the point and the politics of it, this to me goes a whole lot deeper and falls a bit on deaf ears.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the way we are dealing with addiction now has changed drastically over the years. It is a disease. I will say that some 20 million Americans in this country suffer from addiction, which means that most Americans interact with a human being that has an addiction. And it is a trying experience. It is hard for the person who is addicted and really hard on friends and family.So to go after Hunter Biden as a political ploy, I don't think falls well on voters, because if you have compassion for your family member who is addicted, you would also have compassion for a father who has sympathy for his son who has struggled. To the '94 crime bill, though, I would say that the Biden administration has done a lot of things to right the wrongs of that bill, descheduling marijuana, working to, I mean, the first step back was passed under Donald Trump, but making sure that this Justice Department actually does decrease the sentencing disparities, commutations. Those are things that this administration has done to right some of the wrongs of the '94 crime bill. And I think that is important to recognize as well. SINGLETON: It is. And I give significant credit to the president and the Justice Department for doing those things. I just think that Hunter Biden should not be surprised by this, Abby. We're living, Ashley, in hyper-partisan times, hyper-tribal times. Some people may be of the belief that anything is to go. I don't necessarily agree with that politically. But again, I think here's this guy who is the son of the President of the United States of America. I own a lot of firearms. I can guarantee you if I as a black man somehow made an error or did not put the proper information on that document, I would not have been given a sweetheart deal before the judge came in and said, wait a minute here, this isn't what would occur for the normal person. I could assure you that if I didn't pay my taxes, like Wesley Snipes, then I too would probably be in prison for almost three years. And so look, I don't like to use the term white privilege all the time, but this is certainly a case of a white male privilege, because if this guy wasn't white and wasn't named Hunter Biden, I absolutely guarantee the charges against him will be very different. He would be in prison, maybe under the prison.",
