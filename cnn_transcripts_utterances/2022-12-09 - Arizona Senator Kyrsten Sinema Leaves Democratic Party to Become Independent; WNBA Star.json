As we've seen in recent years, both parties have created this kind of requirement or a pull towards the edges that you just unthinkingly support all of one party's viewpoints. It's made it difficult to find folks who are willing to work together and solve problems. Now, as you know, Jake, we've been able to do a lot of bipartisan work over the last couple years, and I'm incredibly proud of that. And I think it's important for folks across my state and, frankly, across the country to say, yes, there's someone that's kind of like me, doesn't fit neatly into one box or the other but is standing up for their values, for what they believe in, and is doing it without trying to get one over on the other party or beat the other guy.",

And I've never fit neatly into any party box. I've never really tried. I don't want to. And I think that's reflective of how most Arizonans live. Arizonans who aren't affiliated with either party are often the largest group of voters in Arizona. And even those who are affiliated with parties often find they don't fit 100 percent into that box. The reality is when we get up in the morning, we don't really thinkabout partisanship. Most people don't wake up and think, OK, I've got to get this Democratic breakfast on the table. I've got to get in my Republican car and go to work. That's not how real life is. I know it is in this town, but in the rest of the country, people are just living their lives. And so they're not thinking about who is winning and who is losing, but that's what the parties are thinking about, is how do we get one over on this guy? How do we ensure that we're punishing them? How do we continue to win? And what I'm focused on, and I think the proof is in the pudding of the work I've done in the Senate, I'm really focused on getting results, like actually solving problems. And so removing myself from the partisan structure, not only is it true to who I am and how I operate, I also think it will provide a place of belonging for many folks across the state and the country who also are tired of the partisanship.",

She gave us a lot of time, and we have much more of this interview that's going to air on \"THE LEAD\" today and then on \"STATE OF THE UNION\" on Sunday, talking about her political work, talking about her very humble upbringing.So I've been thinking about what this actually means, because, as she said, she doesn't think much is going to change. She's hoping that she will keep her committee assignments. She doesn't really spend a lot of time caucusing with Democrats as it is. She didn't vote to make Chuck Schumer the majority leader last time, so her not doing it again this time isn't really going to have an effect. He's still going to be the Senate Democratic leader. So what does this actually mean if she doesn't think it's going to change how she votes and it's not going to change how she does her job? I think there are two ways. One is that she no longer will be feeling a sense of obligation to do things because she is a Democrat. In other words, she won't feel the need to -- of course she has to endorse Joe Biden if he runs for reelection. So it's really about how she feels about the job she's doing and how she feels about whatever sense of obligation the Democratic Party puts on her, that's one. And then two is the idea of her reelection. There's been a lot of noise about her being challenged from the left in a Democratic primary. Congressman Rubin Gallego, a veteran, and somebody who is more progressive, has talked for a while about possibly challenging her. That challenge now goes away, at least in the primary. She can't be primaried because she doesn't belong to a political party. Does that make her reelection harder or easier? I don't know. I guess it depends on whether or not the Democratic Party puts up a candidate to challenge her. They don't do that to Bernie Sanders, who is an independent from Vermont. I don't believe they do that to Angus King, who is an independent from Maine. Both of those are reliably Democratic votes. I think she probably will be a little less reliable a Democratic vote than Bernie Sanders and Angus King, but generally speaking her politics are fairly progressive on most issues. So maybe this makes it a little easier for her to be reelected if the Democratic Party doesn't challenge her in Arizona, but that remains to be seen.",

He's notorious. Griner landed in Texas, her home state, a few hours ago. Her release is being celebrated as a major win for the Biden administration. There's still a lot of questions, though. What would it take to bring back another American who is still wrongfully detained in Russia, Paul Whelan? He is a former U.S. Marine who was arrested in Russia on espionage charges in 2018. A senior administration official told CNN the Biden administration has a few ideas about new forms of offers that they're going to try with the Russians in an effort to potentially secure his release. So joining us now is President Biden's National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. I first just want to start with Brittney Griner, seeing her touch down this morning, first time in 10 months.

That is really significant. Because while the big issues get covered, every single day, we grind through these votes on judicial nominees, on appointments and the like. If she were to say, no, I'm going over Republican, I am not voting with them anymore, that's a whole different thing. That is nowhere near what she said.And she has tended not to go to the caucus meeting, something she said, so I'm not like telling something out of school, except for rare moments where she's advocating for something she cares about. And that's not going to change either. So, I just point out, we have been living with Independents. I don't think people think of it that way. But that has been going on for quite a while.",
