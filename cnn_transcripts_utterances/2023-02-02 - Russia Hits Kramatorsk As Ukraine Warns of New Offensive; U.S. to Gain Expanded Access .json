It is the latestRussian strike inside Ukraine, and Ukraine is warning that a new, even more intense Russian offensive is right around the corner. The U.S. Defense Secretary is in the Philippines announcing new military footholds in the region, and China is already reacting. And record profits for the energy giant Shell have inspired this green peace protests. We'll look at the massive numbers and the global backlash. But first, this hour, as Russia fires more missiles on Ukrainian cities, President Vladimir Putin is threatening the western nations providing defensive weapons to Kyiv. Mr. Putin is saying those who sent tanks are dragging themselves into a new war with Russia. He says it will not end with the use of armored vehicles or tanks, but with something which he left unspecified. Although, he has made vague threats of nuclear retaliation in the past. He spoke his Russian forces waged another brutal day of war in Ukraine's soil. The battle for the city of Bakhmut continues. And earlier on Thursday, Russia fired a barrage of missiles on the city of Kramatorsk, wounding five people and damaging several buildings, you can see there, including a children's clinic and a school. Frederik Pleitgen and his team saw the attack unfold, and he tells us what they witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  We were going basically to the scene of where that missile strike took place last night, on that residential building that killed several people, because of course, there is still a big rescue operation going on there. And we had just arrived at the scene, left our vehicle, when the house in front of which our vehicle was parked was hit by a missile strike. It was a really heavy explosion, very close by. I would say maybe 40 or 50 yards from our location. So, we then went -- trying to go into shelter, trying to go into a sheltered building, and as we were doing that, I turned around and you could see the second missile hitting the exact same area. We already know that there were people who were severely wounded on the ground there, it's unclear if and how many people were killed. Of course, right now, there's a big rescue operation going on there, but I think it's important for our viewers to understand that this area that this was in, it was an active search and rescue operation in a residential area, and today, the Russians targeted exactly the same area with two very heavy missiles. And this was -- as there were a lot of civilians there on the street, we didn't see anybody in the way of military on the streets or any sort of military installations. It was right in the heart of the town of Kramatorsk. And then, of course, we then decided to leave that area as fast as possible after we realized the coast was clear. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, we've seen a change. We've got the new Russian military commander, Gerasimov coming. He's doubled down on Bakhmut. So I think now what we're looking at is the potential is, is this the beginning of the long-awaited Russian attempt to push back? They've got hundreds of thousands of troops in this part of Ukraine, now perhaps up to 300,000 or more, another 200,000 in reserve in Russia. They've been building them up during the Winter, so the feeling is that this may be perhaps the springboard to try to take Kramatorsk, which is what their main target will be.",

So whetherthat's still being worked out or whether they're being cautious about this, that remains to be seen. But a few months ago, a Philippine military official did say that the U.S. was interested in a number of different areas, some of those in the northern Philippines. And that's what puts them so close to Taiwan, that's part of what's raised China ire here. And that's where you get the statement that we just heard from Mark, accusing the U.S. of having a selfish agenda here. More importantly -- and this is perhaps from the broader perspective. The previous Philippine administration under former Presidents Duterte moved Manila in the direction of Beijing. He even threatened to kick U.S. forces out of the Philippines. So, although, the current Philippines administration is still being very careful vis-a-vis China, and trying to thread that line carefully, it is also clearly a realignment in the U.S., and the Philippines moving back towards the U.S. So that's another larger context, reason of why you see such an angry reaction from China. And this, on top of the beefing up of the security in Okinawa, on top of the Marine Corps base in Guam, all of that means that China is not at all pleased about what's happening, as the U.S. very clearly continues that shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific and on China.",

As not only the U.S., but other countries as well. Look at what China is doing, and viewing that as aggressive action. For example, when it comes to the Philippines, just a couple of months ago, there was an incident where what was suspected to be Chinese rocket debris landed in Philippine waters. The Philippine Navy was going to retrieve it when a Chinese coast guard basically cut them off and forcefully retrieved it themselves. It's those kinds of actions that have alarmed not only in the U.S., but in this case, the Philippines as well.
