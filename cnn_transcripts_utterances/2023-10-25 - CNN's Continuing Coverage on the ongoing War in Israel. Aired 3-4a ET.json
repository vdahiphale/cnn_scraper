I'm Lynda Kinkade.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is telling troops the next stage of the war, the ground offensive, is coming with just one mission, in his words, to smash Hamas. His comments come amid concerns over the hostages and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the death toll is still rising. At the United Nations Security Council Tuesday, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres drew backlash from Israeli diplomats when he appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians or the launching of rockets against civilian targets. It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas, and those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. Excellencies, even war has rules. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A response to the deadly terror attacks by Hamas on October 7. On Tuesday, only eight of the 20 aid trucks scheduled to enter Gaza made it through the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border. While some food, medicine and water is being delivered, residents say it's not nearly enough to meet the urgent needs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHMOUD SHAMIYEH, DISPLACED GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): This thing that is being distributed cannot be called aid at all and it should not be referred to as such because these items do not cover any of the people's needs. People in Gaza are dying in two ways, a fast death or a slow death in refugee camps. We are asking for the simplest and most essential element that allows every person, young or old, child or adult, to stay alive. Neglecting our lives like this is unacceptable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we often get reports that airports in Syria, in Aleppo, Damascus, have been hit and the finger very much being pointed at Israel, but Israel not saying that it was responsible, the assumption being that Israel is taking out those targets because it is trying to prevent weapons from getting from Iran to its proxy Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon.But overnight Israel says that it did strike Syrian targets, it said it hit in response to two missile launchers fired from Syria towards the Golan Heights on the border between Israel and Syria, saying that it hit military compounds, artillery posts of the Syrian army and also radar systems as well. So we've already, it's not the first time since October the 7th that we've seen missiles being fired from Syria towards Israel and Israel retaliating. The bigger worry, of course, is a bigger flare-up between Israel and Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon and that has been simmering for the past couple of weeks as well. But even in the more broader region we saw Houthis who are aligned with the Iranians in Yemen firing rockets towards Israel, those being intercepted by the United States, which is sending, which of course is sent already two aircraft carriers and other warships and many other military assets to the region, including additional missile defense systems. So there are still concerns. We heard this morning as well that Australia is beefing up its presence in the region as well for fear of a wider conflagration in the region. So there are concerns. For now, it's mainly restricted to Israel and Hamas and militants in the Gaza Strip, but there are still very real concerns that certainly with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and perhaps other actors in the region could turn this into a broader war.

Will the Republicans go with an institutionalist, Emmer, or will they go with a Trump populist, a MAGA-Republican? And that battle will determine the future of the Republican Party.

Now according to Chinese state-run media, Li Shangfu has been removed as defense minister, as state counselor, and as a member of the powerful Central Military Commission. And you know, you also keep in mind that Qin Gang, he was the one who was ousted as foreign minister in July was also removed as state counselor. That was announced on Tuesday.[03:45:07 No explanation was given here. No replacement appointed for Li Shangfu. And that leaves China without a defense minister. Before his dismissal, Li had been missing from public view since late August. He was reportedly under investigation for corruption, for the corrupt procurement of military equipment. But when the defense ministry was asked about the allegations in late September, a spokesperson simply said that He was not aware of the situation. Now, this ousting comes after a surprise shakeup in the military when China revealed two new leaders of its PLA rocket force. It also comes after the unexplained removal of Qin Gang, who was dramatically ousted as foreign minister in July after he vanished from public view for a month. And let's say that these events raise serious questions about the governance of China's core leader, Xi Jinping, as he continues to concentrate and consolidate power in an ever-opaque China. And we were monitoring today's Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing, and when asked about the sacking of Li Shangfu, this is what we heard from the spokesperson. She said, quote, \"I don't have any additional information to provide on this.\" Back to you.",

These images were taken by Maxar Technologies Tuesday afternoon. They show an unbroken shadow of cement. A slab wall, which Egypt constructed after Israeli strikes, bombed the roadway on the Gaza side. The images come as eight aid trucks out of the expected 20 entered Gaza Tuesday. The United Nations once again warning that the enclave needs more aid. Residents also say they desperately need more assistance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHMOUD SHAMIYEH, DISPLACED GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): This thing that is being distributed cannot be called aid at all. And it should not be referred to as such because these items do not cover any of the people's needs. People in Gaza are dying in two ways, a fast death or a slow death in refugee camps. We are asking for the simplest and most essential element that allow every person, young or old, child or adult, to stay alive. Neglecting our lives like this is unacceptable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Jake Tapper spoke with one of the organization's representatives to find out how the Hamas attacks on October 7th and the Israeli government's response has shaken up its mission.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR, THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER (voice-over): Peace activist Vivian Silver lived on Kibbutz Be'eri and was a former board member of B'Tselem, a progressive group that monitors the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians. Its name B'Tselem means in the image. It's from a Bible verse. It means in the image of God. All of us, all of humankind are in the image of God. On October 7th, Vivian Silver disappeared, she's thought to have been kidnapped by Hamas. Today I spoke with B'Tselem's Roy Yellin. ROY YELLIN, B'TSELEM DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC OUTREACH: Part of the shock and horror that we all experience is the fact that a lot of our supporters, immediate circles, even family members, were killed, kidnapped, or affected in other ways in what happened on Saturday. TAPPER (on-camera): B'Tselem is an organization that worked very, very hard to advocate for Palestinians for human rights, to provide overwatch of the Israeli government, to criticize the Israeli government. Does what happened on October 7th make your job tougher?",

There is a change in the balance of power. In addition to that, because extremism and fundamentalism feeds extremism and fundamentalism on the other side, we're also going to have a much tougher job of getting to the hearts and minds of people in Israel and around the world.TAPPER (on-camera): So what do you say to somebody, an Israeli who comes to you and says, this proves there cannot be any peace with Hamas. This proves they just want to wipe out Israel. They want to kill Jews. There can be no peace with Hamas. Maybe there can be peace with the Palestinian people, but not with Hamas running Gaza.",

Civilians are paying the price, and that's never a good thing. I don't think that we're kind of creating a different narrative in which Hamas is culpable and responsible for what is going on. I think we're breeding more hatred and anger towards Israel.TAPPER (on-camera): But what about the argument from IDF that Hamas embeds itself within the populace? The IDF, Israel, has a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks. And if Hamas hides among the Palestinian people this is Hamas' fault, what do you think of that argument?",
