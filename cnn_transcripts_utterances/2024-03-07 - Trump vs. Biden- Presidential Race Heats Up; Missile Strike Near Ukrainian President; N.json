While both are yet to receive the majority of delegates need to be their party's presumptuous nominee, that is now a mathematical formality after both dominated voting on Super Tuesday. The U.S. president has the opportunity to come out swinging when he delivers the State of the Union to Congress Thursday night.Earlier, he released a statement saying Americans have a chance to move forward or allow Trump to, quote, drag us backwards into the chaos. And for Donald Trump, now that his last rival Nikki Haley has suspended her campaign, there's been a string of high-profile endorsements with many calling for party unity. But for now, it's not clear if those who voted for Haley will hear that call and support Trump come Election Day. Or can they be convinced to vote for Joe Biden? With 243 days until the election, CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more now on the challenges facing both Biden and Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The curtain finally goes up on a historic presidential rematch. Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Emerging from Super Tuesday primaries as the effective nominees of their parties. But there are warning signs in winning, with both men facing distinct challenges of rebuilding their coalitions.

Alongside larger minorities, majorities rather, of Republican voters in North Carolina and California, those voters overwhelmingly supported Trump. So, Trump's legal troubles have often been a reason why many were backing Haley.Even though they knew she couldn't win, they still lodged a protest vote for her, which seems to indicate just how deep their opposition to Trump is.

Look, I think the reason you're seeing so many Republican voters say that even if Donald Trump were convicted of a crime, they would still vote for him, that's because his base and the core members of the Republican base thinks that all of these legal issues are all the same and they are weaponization of liberal justices. And Donald Trump is a victim of overzealous liberal prosecutors and justices. And all of the legal issues are simply going after him because he is the main challenger to Joe Biden. All that's not true, but that's what his base thinks.And so, a conviction isn't anything more than the product of him being a victim of weaponization of the DOJ. That's why you're seeing many Republicans say, if he's convicted, I'm still going to vote for him. But I think there's more to it than that as to why many voters supported Nikki Haley. And look, in many states, she got 30, 40 percent of the electorate in these states. And that's not insignificant. There are a lot of people in the Republican Party that were looking for something different than Donald Trump. And a large part of that, some of it is the legal issues. Some of it is they're tired of the drama and the chaos that follows him. Many of them were really frustrated and disgusted, quite frankly, with what he did on January 6th in the attempt to stop the certification of the election and the insurrection we saw at the Capitol.

He talked about common ground. This was just after Super Tuesday and after she essentially ended her campaign. While on Truth Social Trump pointed out that Haley got trounced last night in record setting fashion.He then went on to invite her supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our nation. I'm wondering if there's a choice here for the Biden campaign. Do they invest resources in going after and trying to win over those voters who supported Haley, who are essentially Republicans, or do they take that time, and do they focus on turnout? On the coalition, which effectively sent Biden to the White House back in 2020? Try and motivate those voters and get them to the polls rather than trying to win over new ones? [00:10:09] The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee has a massive war chest, John, and they can do some of both. And they're going to do polling. They're going to do research and see where's the best allocation of the resources. But we can tell based on how he responded to Nikki Haley suspending her campaign and doing an outreach to her voters goes to show that that is a priority. But another challenge he has is there's a lot of division and fracture within the Democratic Party. We're seeing that with Gaza and what we're seeing with concern over the Israel situation. So, he needs to also bring about his base and his party. And we're looking at a lot of polls. The enthusiasm surrounding Joe Biden is not quite as high as Donald Trump. So, their best investment is to try and go after the Nikki Haley voters, but also secure their base.",

A source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN that the impact of this missile appears to have been about 500 meters away from the Greek prime minister, which is essentially also the same area that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was as well.The Greeks are saying that the prime minister of Greece was in Odessa on a surprise visit, that he had been getting a tour of the port of Odessa from Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Greek prime minister of the importance of that port for Ukraine, of course, for goods that the Ukrainians continue to want to import and export. And the Greek side said that as the leaders were getting back into their car, that at that point they heard a very loud explosion. The Ukrainian president, for his part, is going a step further even than that. He said that they saw the missile and they even felt the impact because the impact was so close. Originally, Volodymyr Zelenskyy had said that he knew that there had been killed and wounded in the attack, but he said at that point he didn't have more information than that. Well, the Ukrainian Navy has since then come out and said that five people were killed and that there were people wounded, even though they have not given specifics as to how many people exactly were wounded in all this. Of course, Odessa, that port town in the south of Ukraine, has been taking a lot of hits from Russian drones and Russian missiles for the past couple of months. And just on March 2nd, there was a big drone attack that killed several people in that town. The Russians, for their part, have acknowledged that they did strike Odessa and the port area. They claim that they hit a warehouse in which were, unmanned sea drones. Now, all this comes not very long after the Ukrainians said that they had sunk a Russian warship using sea drones. So, it's unclear whether or not this was retaliation by the Russians, but it certainly does appear as though this was a very concerning situation for the Ukrainians. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.

But it doesn't mean that others should also follow us if they think that they can express their disagreement with the Putin regime in a different way.

For more than 20 years, China ignored competing claims from smaller countries, occupying and eventually building man-made islands on top of several contested reefs and shoals. In 1999, an unusual step from the Philippines. It grounded the Sierra Madre, a rusting World-War-II-era ship, on Second Thomas Shoal. Filipino marines have been guarding it ever since. Our convoy is supposed to resupply those marines. But a much larger ship swerves dangerously close to the BRP Cabra and eventually pulls in front, stopping it in its tracks. Meanwhile, this resupply boat doesn't stand a chance.",
