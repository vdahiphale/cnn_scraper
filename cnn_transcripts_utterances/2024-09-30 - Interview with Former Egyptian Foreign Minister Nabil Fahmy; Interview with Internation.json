Sarah Smash talks to Michelle Martin about her new book,\"Bone of the Bone.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The next stage of the war against Hezbollah will start soon, those are the words of the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, while his country conducts reconnaissance and other ground raids inside Lebanon right now, according to the United States. Washington says any ground invasion could be more limited than originally thought. Of course, the U.S. had confidently announced a 21-day ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah last week, just days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the IDF to assassinate Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah. The Israelis attributed this disconnect to an honest misunderstanding. But will Israel's decapitation of Hezbollah in Lebanon actually ratchet the war down? Not if the past is anything to go by, while Israel has dealt blows to many of its foes since it was attacked by Hamas a year ago, it also has had a long history of assassinations. Just look at some of these figures taken out since Benjamin Netanyahu became prime minister in 1996. Targets in Gaza, in Syria, in Beirut, and the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran just this past July. And yet, war continues to flare periodically and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict at the heart of all of this remains unresolved. Joining me now on this situation is Nabil Fahmy. He's the former Egyptian foreign minister and only one of two Arab countries that have a peace treaty with Israel. Foreign Minister Fahmy, welcome to the program. Could I just start by asking you what goes through your mind when you hear the IDF or the defense minister say that the next stage of the war against Hezbollah is at hand?",

And basically, the Mossad agents had tried to inject a poison into his ear, and apparently did. But when King Hussein, the king of Jordan at the time, got wind of it, he demanded Netanyahu send the antidote to Jordan because that's where Meshaal was, and that actually saved Meshaal's life.

How does it understand the elimination of its main regional ally, Hassan Nasrallah? The U.S. is raising the alarm about a possible revenge attack by Tehran on Israel. For more now, I am joined by Ali Vaez. He's director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. Ali Vaez, welcome back to the program. So, let me just ask you flat out, you know, everybody's been waiting for the so-called Iranian response after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on Iran's territory itself.

In the same way that it faced similar options when Haniyeh, it was killed in the sense that if Iran does respond directly or even indirectly, it might actually provide justification for Israel to expand the war, which is one thing that Iran has not wanted. And if it's directly involved, Iran is directly involved, and causes death and destruction on Israeli soil, then it has provided cause a spell eye for Israel to strike Iran directly. And this is a much stronger, superior military power backed by the world's number one superpower militarily. And so, this is a big risk for the Iranians. But if they don't respond they also, first of all, risk losing face and credibility. Their alliance system basically boils down to all for one and one for none. And that's also very dangerous for the Iranians. And I think they -- looking back at the pattern of the past few months and the fact that they didn't respond to Haniyeh's killing and decided to demonstrate that restraint has clearly demonstrated that Israel has got the wrong lesson and has continued to push the envelope.

But none of this changes the fundamentals, Christiane, which is that, at the end of the day, Hezbollah and all of these other groups were supposed to be the shields that would protect Iran, not the other way around. And that is why, I think, the optional preference for Iran, even under the current circumstances, would be to try to regroup and rehabilitate Hezbollah. We know, of course, Hezbollah's capabilities have been diminished as a result of Israeli strikes. We don't know if they have been completely depleted. But whatever remains of Hezbollah's formidable capacities, if they want to use it, probably Iranians would come to the conclusion that it's a question of now or never.

And it looks like there's going to be an actual ground war in Lebanon, which the U.S. is basically confirming and so, have the Israeli defense minister. Is this a rare time?

And Israel has ignored the U.S.' advice and has continued to escalate tensions. It is true that Israel has been able to get away with it, and some of the warnings that the Biden administration had about the adverse consequences of Israeli actions have not materialized. But that is exactly the circumstances that create overconfidence and result and overreach, which would then eventually backfire. And remember, Israel is historically very good at winning tactically, but the Iranians are very good at winning strategically and playing the long game. And there's another consideration here that I think is really important to take into account. The more Prime Minister Netanyahu succeeds in weakening Iran's regional deterrence, the more he fails by pushing Iran towards the ultimate deterrent, and that is nuclear weapons. And given Iran's proximity to nuclear weapons capability, this is a particularly dangerous moment. And unfortunately, again, the Biden administration is completely absent in all of these discussions because it has proven to be the junior partner in its relationship with its strongest ally in the region, Israel.",

But the reality is that thisis an administration in Iran that is very open engagement with the west and is very keen on getting some sort of economic reprieve even in the form of very narrow, limited transactional deals with the west. I think the problem that they have, and they probably got a better understanding of it, in this week of diplomatic speed dating in New York, was that some of Iran's objectives are in conflict with one another. It's very hard to get sanctions relief from the west when you're on the opposite side of the west, it gets to the war in Ukraine, because Iran is assisting Russia, or you're on the opposite side of the United States when it gets to tensions in the Middle East. And of course, Nasrallah's killing has just sharpened all of these choices for the Iranians, but I think they are -- at least until last week, they were desperate for some sort of a nuclear deal, which now is in question. Because as of days ago, there's a lot of discussion internally and a lot of voices are calling for Iran to weaponize its nuclear program as the only viable shield against Israeli assertive actions against them and their allies in the Middle East.",

As well as a story I came across during my travels, and I distinctly remember the U.K. media, maybe even yourself covering this, when an Israeli occupation soldier, Gilad Shalit, was captured in 2006. And in 2011, he was released for over 1,000 Palestinian political prisoners, hundreds of whom were women and children, hundreds of whom were being held in administrative detention without trial or charge. And at the time, I just thought this was an insane imbalance in value for human life. Never could I have imagined though that that imbalance in value for human life would be so exponentially magnified at the time of this film's release where we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians killed, maimed, burned, blinded, nearly 2 million displays.

You know, there was an idea about 20 years ago, a book came out called \"What's the Matter with Kansas\" by Thomas Frank. That hot button cultural or social issues had been leveraged or seized by the far- right or, you know, conservative movements to convince some people to, quote/unquote, \"vote against their own best interests in economic terms,\" and that might be abortion or other kind of cultural and social topics. It never quite sat well with me, and the notion seems to suggest that people are stupid. I know they ain't stupid. I think it's more like this, if we're talking about a place and the people who have been on the losing end, in a lot of ways, simultaneous with in the case of white voters, racial privilege, I would say that the Democratic Party, for a few decades, didn't have much of a ground game, if you will, in those places. And there's the Electoral College results in strategic use of resources, where are we going to invest and where are we not? And, you know, I'm in my mid-40s and I've never experienced a Democrat knocking on my door during a campaign season. So, that's one. And then, at that precise moment, let's say during my '80s childhood, the Reagan era or even into the '90s, during my adolescence, all of a sudden, I'm hearing on radio stations, on those long drives down country highways, Rush Limbaugh or conservative talk radio, then following from that was Fox News and now, of course, our social media era, there are messages that have co-opted the terms and the symbols of that place to somehow suggest that a rural identity means these particular political ideas or that those things are synonymous. That was -- that's intentional. It's been successful. If nobody's looking at you, it's -- it feels like an invalidation. It feels like you're unseen. It feels like maybe you're growing the food or extracting the resources that are fueling other people's lives who are looking down on you while you're doing that work and nobody's talking to you. And then, if somebody shows up and talks to you and looks right at you, even if it's a bunch of lies and just, you know, to my mind, a horrifying message, we are -- politics is an emotional business. It's not necessarily so rational as it is felt. And I think that's true across party lines in a lot of ways.",

And I waslike, you know, cheering for anybody that they beat the odds to have their story told. That said, it did strike me as kind of a conservative polemic, particularly toward the end of the book. What felt to me like a lot of finger wagging at the very place that he comes from and the people that he comes from, penning their, you know, poor outcomes or negative life circumstances on their own decisions with some sort of moral framework relating to character, as someone who I've never -- I've always rejected the narrative about getting out, so to speak. You know, I have been very fortunate to -- in my career. But I live in rural Kansas today and I went back with an intention to write about and document, that space and experience not in the rearview mirror, and it seemed to me like he was writing a story about the pain and that's real about where he came from, but also, with a very specific framework about you get what you deserve kind of felt like what was an undercurrent or an underpinning, and I don't know if that's fair or not, but it's how it struck me. And that does kind of correlate more with the conservative politics, in my view. So, I'm not all that surprised that he went into -- that he sought elected office and that he's now, you know, kind of exemplar of that kind of conservative, I don't want to say appropriation of, but claiming of certain symbols as though country or blue jeans or cowboy boots means a certain set of beliefs.
