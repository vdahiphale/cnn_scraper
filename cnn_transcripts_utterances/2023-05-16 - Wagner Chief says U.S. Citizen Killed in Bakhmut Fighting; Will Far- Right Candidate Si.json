You're watching a special edition of \"Connect the World\" with me Becky Anderson live from Istanbul where forthe first time in its history, Turkey's presidential candidates will head for a momentous run off race. We're going to bring you analysis on the likely outcome of that. First up though, I want to start in Ukraine this hour where officials say the capital was the target of a particularly intense air assault. Well, that barrage of Russian missiles lit up the skies over Kyiv. But Ukraine says it intercepted all of them, along with a number of drones. Russia however claims all of its targets were hit including the U.S. Patriot Air Defense System. Meantime, the Head of the Russian Mercenary Wagner Group says an American citizen has been killed fighting in the Eastern Flashpoint City of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces are claiming substantial gains on the outskirts there. CNN's Sam Kiley is joining us from Southeastern Ukraine. I want to start if we can; with a frightening night for residents of Kyiv an attack launched Sam from the north, the south and the east. This was largely a failure. But it was a noisy night. Tell us what we are learning about what happened overnight and how that plays into the trajectory of this war at this point, Sam?",

      "sentences": "Well Becky, I think the key issue here and you put it in your intro very accurate there --accurately was the intensity of the attacks on Kyiv. This is a new tactic. We have seen the Russians in the past use mass formations across many different cities, many different targets combining cruise missiles and swarms of the Iranian made Shahed, so called drones, they're actually unguided, slow moving missiles. This time, though, there was a focus of attention on overwhelmingly on Kyiv. And the amount of time that the missiles were fired within was very truncated. This wasn't spread over many hours. It was clearly an attempt to try to find a chink in the air defenses of the Ukrainian capital by firing cruise missiles, caliber missiles to conventional missiles, and their Kinzhal, the hypersonic so called hypersonic missiles, all at the more or less at the same time, that intent there was clearly to try to overwhelm the air defenses. And they failed significantly. Also, the Ukrainians are claiming that they shot down six Kinzhal missiles that will bring a total of seven that they say that they have shot down. Now, these were, according to the Russians supposed to be invulnerable to conventional or traditional or contemporary air defenses because of the speed at which they travel. But we're learning now that they are actually not much more sophisticated than many other similar missiles that are in the armories, particularly of NATO countries that often hit hypersonic speeds as they descend. And also their guidance systems are pretty primitive to nonexistent so they are not precision missiles in the way that a cruise missile might be. We've got no evidence whatsoever either to support the Russian claims that patriot missile anti-missile missile batteries were destroyed. In terms of the trajectory of all this Becky, I think that what we're seeing here is efforts being made by the Russians to try to counter attack and get inside the command and control systems of the Ukrainians ahead of their much vaunted ground offensive, Becky?",

That's what we hear. One of the soldiers on the Bakhmut says one of the Wagner mercenaries rather, he's inside a building, he then comes across the body of what he claims is an American soldier, including the identity documents. Now, there's no word yet from the U.S. State Department. And obviously, we would not be releasing a name for this person until we have official confirmation of whom he is and what the circumstances were. But what's interesting quite telling about this video is that he's quite Mr. Prigozhin is quite respectful towards the dead soldier that was killed on the fighting on the Ukrainian side, whoever he is saying that he will be given due honors. And because he's assumed to be American will be buried, or rather covered with an American flag and his remains returned somehow to the United States because he put up a fight up until the last Prigozhin says so quite an intriguing statement from an otherwise rather contemptuous individual. Perhaps, I suppose, not unconnected to the fact that he may fear that he could be returning one day to Moscow to face treason charges if the U.S. intelligence documents are accurate in suggesting that he allegedly tempted to sell out his Russian comrades and sell their locations to the Ukrainians in return for a softer ride for his own fighters in Bakhmut.

Because both that coalitions President Erdogan and the opposition have allied themselves with Kurdish parties, it is going to be much harder for Kilicdaroglu to break away from that because the Kurdish vote was quite critical for him this time.

I think, of course, we're all looking back at the relationship between ex- President Donald Trump and Erdogan, which was a classic sort of meeting of supermom, power minds. I think you could argue that Erdogan got the better of Trump on a number of occasions, notably, remember that phone call when he got the U.S. president to order an immediate withdrawal a pullback of U.S. forces in northeastern Syria, which really exposed the U.S. Kurdish allies. So I'm sure that Erdogan would be quite keen for a return to Donald Trump after the 2024 election. So, you know, just as Turkey is in political uproar and uncertainty, I think we have it in the United States.

For example, scientists are using AI to try and come up with newmedical cures; they can scan the scientific literature, find chemical compounds that offer hope for addressing major illnesses. So there are certainly advantages there. AI is being deployed to measure and analyze climate change, and figure out what we need to do in order to mitigate the impact of some of those things. So there certainly are lots of positive applications. And in the hearing, the witnesses really tried to make the point that we need to figure out ways to mitigate the bad uses, while still preserving the good uses. Because there certainly are many ways in which AI can be used to improve the human condition.",

Thievesfrom the Remo clan broke into Dresden's green vault in 2019. Taking off in more than $120 million worth of artifacts years later, only some of those items have been recovered. Well today six of the group appeared in court and five were found guilty. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Berlin. We are four years on; this was an audacious, spectacular, high as brutal as well.

      "sentences": "Yes, first of all, you're absolutely right. It was absolutely audacious and brazen,anything that you could describe it with. And also the loot itself, I think one of the things you were saying is that it's worth about $120 million. At least that's the insurance value. But of course, if you look here into the country in Germany, and also the director of the museum says this stuff is actually absolutely priceless. It's some of the most important jewelry historically in all of Europe. And if you look at today, what happened inside that courtroom, five of the six were actually convicted. And the prison sentences range from about four years, four years and four months to a little bit over six years. And a lot of people felt that that really wasn't very much, especially since three of those who were convicted today actually walked out of the courtroom, they didn't have to go directly to jail. That's because the authorities are saying that they did a plea agreement with these individuals, and that they are able to actually serve their sentences at a later time. So there is a lot of public anger about that here in Germany. And as you said, you know, some of these jewels, it was possible to recover some of them. But the most important, the most valuable pieces have actually not been recovered yet. And you know, the people who are convicted today, they are saying that they don't know where these pieces are. Of course, there are a lot of people here in Germany who doesn't believe that but the bottom line is those very important pieces aren't there. Some of those folks are actually walking free in our harbor. Those jail sentences, obviously, six years, four years that are fairly high and they are going to have to serve them at a later time Becky.",
