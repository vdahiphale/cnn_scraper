And more than 100 million people across the U.S. under winter weather alerts as a major winter storm is set to bring more snow to the East Coast this weekend. Welcome to the show, and we start with clashing opinions on the future of Gaza. There can be no security and stability in the region without establishing a Palestinian state. That is according to the Palestinian Authority President Spokesperson that comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued against a Palestinian state Thursday, saying it would be at odds without Israel's security.

And in an op-ed on Thursday, Israel's Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak called for fresh elections. CNN's Nic Robertson was recently in Gaza right now. He joins us from Tel Aviv, Nic, good to see you. Big questions around this I mean, clearly the Biden Administration and Netanyahu not aligned on the process and of course, the thinking of a two state solution Netanyahu very clearly stating that he told the Americans that he has no intention of the establishment of a Palestinian state.

Look, you're potential partners in the region for building peace and stability in the region particularly Saudi Arabia particularly normalizing relations for Saudi Arabia. You can do that in a post Gaza war environment, if you recognize a Palestinian state, that's a prerequisite for the Saudis from others in the region. Now, that's the White House position. That's obviously a part of position coming from the region as well. So Netanyahu is not that on the head. And this really underscores what Ehud Barak the Former Prime Minister wrote in an op-ed today that Netanyahu is not putting forward a vision for a post war scenario inside of Gaza. He calls it unconscionable. He says that undermines the IDF and what they can realistically achieve on the ground. He said, it leads to a potential Gaza quagmire where you're stuck in a war in Gaza you have escalating tensions and potentially worse on the West Bank and on the northern border of Israel with Lebanon you could get into a much higher escalated war situation there. So he's describing that as you know Netanyahu is failing on that front. And for that point he says it's important to get the support of the Israeli people and for that to be an election and he suggests setting June as a deadline. And that's what he's suggesting to the war cabinet partners, those Unity Party members of that cabinet. And interestingly Gadi Eisenkot, a Former IDF Chief who is in that war cabinet the very tiny war cabinet that enables Netanyahu essentially to continue the war in Gaza. He spoke last night and said look, the Prime Minister needs to level with the people of Israel. He needs to tell them very clearly there is no military victory to be had no complete military victory to be had over Hamas which is what the Prime Minister saying. He also said look, there's no way of getting the hostages out in the near term unless you make a deal. And he also made that point.

Top officials at the White House told lawmakers just the other day that without additional funding for U.S. equipment for Ukraine for weaponry, then things like artillery, ammunition and air defense systems could run out very soon. They could be completely depleted really without U.S. support. And so underscoring the importance of this $60 billion in supplemental funding that the administration has requested from Congress, U.S. officials really sought to emphasize to lawmakers that this is not something that is optional for Ukraine. This is something that if they want to continue fighting Russia, if they want to ultimately push the Russians out of their territory then they need continued U.S. support. Of course, they still have European support. But without the U.S., there are questions about whether Europe might start to pull back at support. There is a question about whether allies might start to get tired of funding the war on their own if there is no U.S. money that is going into this as well. And in the short term we are told that you know this might not have a dramatic impact on the battlefield. Yes, Ukraine might struggle to keep up with its air defenses. It might struggle to find artillery ammunition. But Russia also kind of needs some time to regroup as well. So in the very short term Ukraine might be able to get by without these additional billions of dollars in U.S. aid. But in the longer term this could be really detrimental for Ukraine especially because we don't know what's going to happen in during the election and Former President Trump might be re-elected. And as he has said many times he does not necessarily believe that it is in the United States' best interest to continue funding Ukraine. And so it's really all up in the air right now. And if Russia continues to get support from say Iran and North Korea and the Ukrainians are struggling to get support from some of their biggest partners then there is clearly going to be a discrepancy there and an imbalance that is going to favor Russia in the longer term. And so it's really key right now official safe for the U.S. to continue this funding. But given the gridlock on the Hill right now even arguing over how to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown. It just seems really at this moment that no one knows what is actually going to happen with this funding, Eleni.",
