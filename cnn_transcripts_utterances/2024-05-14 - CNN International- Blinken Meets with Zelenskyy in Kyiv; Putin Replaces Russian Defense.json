He got a lot of pressure, a lot of questions from EU officials. Yet Xi Jinping said that he denies that China is helping to fund the Russian war machine, going into great lengths with a one-on-one discussion with French President Emmanuel Macron. But now that we have Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin soon to sit side by side, it will be interesting to see what kind of approach China will take. I heard from one observer on the ground here in mainland China, who suggested that China is so hungry, so eager to take the lead as a player on the world stage, perhaps it will use this as an opportunity to try to broker some kind of deal with Russia and Ukraine. Unlikely, but not out of the realm of possibility. This is also happening at a time, these two men are meeting at a time when China is really trying to establish itself as a leader of a new world order. And Russia certainly would play a big role in all of that. It is close to Europe. It has military strength. The economic strength, maybe not so much there, but there is a lot of strategic benefit.

But the important caveat that we are being told is that senior U.S. officials don't actually know whether Israel has made the decision to go ahead with such a military operation. Of course, if Israel were to move forward with such an operation, this would be hugely significant, precisely because of what President Biden told CNN's Erin Burnett last week. He made clear that the U.S. would stop sending offensive weapons to Israel if Israel were to go into Rafah. And also, this would just be in direct defiance of the president's repeated warnings to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the previous months. Now, in a sign of how problematic all of this would be in the eyes of the Biden White House, one senior official telling me that Israel has also not come anywhere close to making adequate preparations in terms of housing, in terms of food, in terms of hygiene, ahead of a potential evacuation of the more than one million people who are currently sheltering in Rafah. What is also interesting is that we are increasingly seeing U.S. officials publicly questioning Israel's approach to not only the war, but also what its endgame might be in the conflict. Kurt Campbell telling our colleague Kylie Atwood that Israeli officials often talk about the idea of a sweeping victory on the battlefield and about total victory. But importantly, he said, I don't think we believe that is likely or possible. So that's certainly a sobering assessment from a top U.S. official, as Israel continues to warn that it is going to move forward with the Rafah operation. MJ Lee, CNN at the White House.

At least one United Nations aid worker was killed, another injured. The U.S. says they were in a clearly marked U.N. vehicle that came under attack. Israel says it wasn't aware of the vehicle's route and is reviewing the incident.

It's marked down to the quote, legal expense.REID (voice-over): Facing his former boss, Cohen spoke about his 10 years working as Trump's attorney and fixer while Trump sat back in his chair, closing his eyes, not reacting to Cohen's testimony. Cohen said he enjoyed working for Trump and whenever he received direct praise for completing a task, he felt like he was on top of the world. Cohen told the court that when Trump was mulling a run for the presidency in 2015, Trump warned Cohen, you know that when this comes out, meaning the announcement, just be prepared. There's going to be a lot of women coming forward. Cohen claimed that just weeks before the 2016 election, the editor of the National Enquirer told Cohen, Stormy Daniels wanted to sell her story about having an affair with Trump, which Cohen said would have been catastrophic and horrible for Trump's campaign. Cohen said Trump got angry with him when they spoke about the Stormy Daniels story. I told him that one of the things that we need to do is obviously take care of it. Trump allegedly responded. Absolutely. Do it. Take care of it. Cohen testified that it was his idea to include a punitive damages clause in the Daniels deal to ensure that she didn't speak. Cohen said Trump told him to drag the Daniels payment out as long as possible. In fact, preferably until after the election, because if I win, it will have no relevance because I'm president. And if I lose, I don't even care. And he added this damning allegation. He wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign. Cohen walked the court through the process of creating several LLC's in order to transfer payment to Daniels. Cohen had to front the money himself and used a home equity line of credit because it was paperless so he could hide it from his wife. I was doing everything I could and more to protect my boss, which is something that I had done for a long time. Cohen testified that on October 28th, he immediately called Trump after Daniel signed the agreement, telling him: That this matter is now completely under control and locked down. Cohen said in early 2017, he tried to get repaid for the money he fronted to Daniels. I needed Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg's input for questions about taxes. Cohen said he would be reimbursed over the course of the next 12 months, disguising the payment as like a legal service rendered since I was then going to be given the title of personal attorney to the president.",
