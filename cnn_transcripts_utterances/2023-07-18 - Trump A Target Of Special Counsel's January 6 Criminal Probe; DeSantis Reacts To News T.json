      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I am Jake Tapper and I am live on the campaign trail here in beautiful Columbia, South Carolina, where earlier today, I sat down for an interview with Republican presidential candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.DeSantis was here in South Carolina to roll out a major policy announcement about the U.S. military, but, of course, I asked him about the big breaking news that his key competitor, Republican front- runner and former President Donald Trump announced earlier today that he'd been told he is the target of the special counsel's criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump also said that he's been told to appear this week, Thursday at the latest, before the federal grand jury in D.C. Trump wrote on Truth Social today, quote: Deranged Jack Smith, the prosecutor with Joe Biden's Department of Justice sent a letter, again it was Sunday night, stating that I'm a target of the January 6 grand jury investigation and giving me a very short four days to report to the grand jury which almost always means an arrest and indictment, end quote. Trump's revelation comes as we learn of several important new developments in the January 6 investigation. One, a Trump adviser is expected to appear before that grand jury this week. Two, sources say that the special counsel team has contacted former Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican whom Trump also pressured to overturn the 2020 election. Three, we've learn special counsel investigators have interviewed Wisconsin officials. And, four, in fact, CNN has learned that the special counsel's office has interviewed officials from all seven 2020 battleground states, all seven states where Trump and his allies tried to overturn the 2020 election results. The seven include Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, and Nevada. All of this as a hearing is wrapping up involving the special counsel's other criminal case involving Mr. Trump, the classified documents case in Florida, where a judge told prosecutors a trial date in mid-December would be too soon, the prosecutor said. Then my exclusive interview with Florida Governor DeSantis which we're going to bring you in full this hour, touched on, as I said, his new military policy as well as Ukraine, China, social issues, the state of his campaign and more. But, of course, with perhaps curious timing, Mr. Trump's announcement of his likely pending third indictment came minutes before Governor DeSantis and I sat down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think that's wrong.Alvin Bragg stretched the statute in Manhattan to be able to try to target Donald Trump. Most people -- even people on the left acknowledge if that wasn't Trump, that case would not have likely been brought against a normal civilian. And so, you have a situation where the Department of Justice, FBI, have been weaponized against people they don't like and the number one example of that happened to be against Donald Trump with the Russia collusion. That was not a legitimate investigation. That was being done to try to drive Trump out of office. And so, what I've said as president, my job is to restore a single standard of justice to end weaponization of these agencies. We're going to have a new FBI director on day one. We're going to have big changes at the Department of Justice. Americans across the political spectrum need to have confidence that what is going on is based on the rule of law, not based on what political tribe you're in. And the second thing I would say is this country needs to of a debate about the country's future. If I'm the nominee, we'll be able to focus on President Biden's failures, and I'll be able to articulate a positive vision for the future. I don't think it serves us good to have a presidential election focused on what happened four years ago in January. And so, I want to focus on looking forward. I don't want to look back. I do not want to see him, I hope he doesn't get charged, I don't think it will be good for the country, but at the same time, I've got to focus on looking forward, and that's what we're going to do.

She is the Trump appointed judge who's going to oversee this case through its completion and we're particularly looking for how receptive she would be to the former president's efforts to try to delay this, possibly even delay until after the 2024 election.Now it was clear from her questions and her comments in court today that she is not likely to go along with a plan that has been proposed by the special counsel to take this case to trial in just a few months, in December. She called that timeline, quote, compressed. She told the lawyers, she said, look, cases like this just take more time than that. And she really challenged prosecutors to explain to her exactly how this was not what is called a complex trial or something that could not be completed quickly. Defense attorneys also got up and they continued to insist that former President Trump is unlike any other defendant and that they believe it would only be fair to delay this until after the election. Now, it did not appear that the judge would agree to that. We need at least some kind of timeline, at least tell me when you might know when you'd be ready t go to trial, specifically, defense lawyers said that in early November, they might be done going through discovery. They said they have over a thousand days worth of surveillance footage, they have tens of thousands of relevant documents to look through. What was interesting, Jake, is both sides made a big issue of Trump's status at a candidate. The special counsel opened one of the arguments saying, look, just because he's a former president, he's not a president any more. He said, even though he's running for office again, he should be treated like any other busy important person and his lawyers, of course, really took issue with that. But, Jake, the judge didn't seem interested at all in those arguments. She said, look, let's focus on the process, let's focus on discovery and at least getting a schedule down on paper to deal with the mechanics. Now we don't have the schedule yet. But some good news for former President Trump here out of federal court, this judge definitely appears open to delaying this a little bit longer than Jack Smith would like.",

They said, look, we're representing the former president in a lot of different matters, that takes a lot time both for us and also coordinating with our client and they used all of this together to really push the idea that they're not going to be ready for this criminal case to go to trial any time soon.",

On the other hand, the sheer volume of documents may be at issue here, as is the security clearance needed to review the documents, their surveillance close footage of the actual Mar-a-Lago estate and beyond. By the end of the day, Jake, how extraordinary to think that one's candidacy could determine when you actually might have a trail. Normally, the DOJ is concerned about not wanting to interfere or be seen as doing so. But an indefinite trial date is not in line with what any other defendant would ultimately have.",

The right to a speedy trial is a right that the defendant has, not the prosecution.Let me ask you, Jeffrey, this Trump news could very well, he could be very well be facing three indictments over the span of just six months. How do you think this case into his interference in the 2020 election stacks up against the other two, the Alvin Bragg case and the national -- and the security documents, specifically what charges do you think he could be facing in the 2020 -- in the election interference one? JEFFREY SLOMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA: So, I think what's going to happen is Judge Cannon may be calling the judge in the Manhattan case and if former President Trump gets indicted in the near feature on the January 6 case, then I think there may be some communication between the judges as to how best to schedule this. Obviously, she's concerned about balancing former President Trump's rights to review all of the discovery. It's hard to get a sense as to how voluminous it is. The defense says it's very voluminous. The prosecution says it's a straight simple case that we've been providing documents to the former president's team since June 21st. There was another discovery production recently, of non-classified material and the special counsel has gone out of its way to inform the parties that there's only approximately 30 classified documents. So, there is a limited scope. So, I get a sense that Judge Cannon is going to try and balance and see exactly what's going to be needed for the defense in order tor them to be ready and then I think she'll probably issue an order or something, it sounds like not being in the courtroom, it sounds like that's what she intends to do. With regard to the special counsel's target letter, obviously, we have some type of a blueprint as to the other prosecutions, whether or not the special counsel is going to tailor down to a simple, you know, set of meetings that occurred that conspiracy theories evolved is unknown. But obviously, these are momentous times. The fact that the former president is the defendant in a federal case is quite unusual. So, these are unprecedented times, Jake. TAPPER: Laura, our sources tell us that Trump's legal team was caught off guard by the latest letter and they've been calling lawyers an allies to see if they've gotten a letter too.

This is notable because this is the first time that these alleged fake electors are actually being charged criminally by state prosecutors. This is coming from the Attorney General Dana Nessel right here in Michigan.This all stems from December 14th, 2020, when here in Michigan, 16 of those fake electors tried to storm into the capitol just behind me. They were actually stopped by police but they had fake certificates declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state of Michigan despite that Joe Biden had won this state by 554,000 votes. The police stopped those electors from forcing their way into the Capitol, but they were prepared to try to argument that Donald Trump had won the election. And after a long investigation, by the attorney general, she actually initially referred it to federal prosecutors and DOJ but then actually started her own investigation back in January. She's now charging 16 of those defendants. We've been watching the court proceedings happen throughout the day here. Those defendants are expected to that will turn themselves in, in the coming days. And I will note that there are some notable names among this 16 defendants. One of them is Meshawn Maddock, the co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party. Another one, Kathy Berden, she's one of the Republican National Committee members here in Michigan. So, Jake, this is a notable move by the state's Attorney General Dana Nessel charging 16 of these fake electors. Notably, there's also these investigations into the fake elector scheme in those six other states where those electors tried to submit those fake documents in favor of Donald Trump. Those investigations, particularly in Georgia and Arizona are ongoing. And today, the first state charges against those fake electors for a number of different charges, including forgery, also conspiracy to commit election law forgery. So, Jake, a notable move coming from the attorney general here in Lansing, Michigan.",

But now, the Asia-Pacific really needs to be to our generation what Europe was to the post-World War II generation. And so, what we're doing is how much hard power can we marshal as much as possible to deter China? I think we're in a situation now with how weak we've been that we are going towards maybe having a conflict with China. I think the way to deter that conflict with China is to be strong. So I would have the Europeans do more in Europe. That's more in their backyard. That's more of an interest for them. You know, I would be willing to be helpful to try to bring it to a conclusion there, but I'm not going to diminish our stocks and not send to Taiwan. I'm not going to make us less capable to respond to exigencies and you got to care at least as much about your own border as do you about foreign borders.",

They don't really care about the Russians. Russia will be more dependent on China as a result of that. So I think that's what Xi would like to see ideally. Now in terms of Taiwan, that is a significant interest of the United States. Taiwan is a strong ally. Taiwan is important for us economically and for a variety of other reasons. Also, a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan successfully would have big reverberations in the Asia-Pacific. But our policy is going to be very simple. We're going to deter that from happening. China respects hard power. If you have hard power, if you have strong alliances with the Japanese and -- I visited there a few months ago. The Koreans and the Japanese are getting along now. They never used to get along because they both see the threat posed by China. So we're going to work together. We're going to be much stronger.
