But this argument also comes at a time when the president has a real vulnerability when it comes to the economy, with many Americans still holding pessimistic views about their own personal financial states, and also the president's handling of economic issues.Now, he is making this argument in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, a state that he won back in 2020 and that he's looking to hold onto as this is part of that critical blue wall that Democrats want to see Biden win in November. That includes Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is one of those states that Biden has probably frequented the most this campaign cycle. And it comes as polling has shown a very close contest between him and Trump, with both men vying for the state, and specifically the working class voters here.",

And Donal Trump posting on Truth Social, and complaining about the standard practice for choosing a jury in - or for a criminal defendant who was charged with the crimes that Trump is charged with. But each side in this case gets ten strikes and it allows the attorneys to disqualify a potential juror for any reason they want. But Donald Trump believes that he should have more opportunities to disqualify jurors. He writes, \"I thought strikes were supposed to be limited when we are picking our jury. I was then told we only had ten, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the second worst venue in the country.\" He goes on to repeat similar criticisms about election interference and how this trial is essentially a political sham and one that's using -- or targeting his re-election campaign for president. Of course, that is not the case here.And, of course, Trump is being treated like any other criminal defendant again who is charged with the kind of crimes that he's charged with here. He is taking issue with that. And his lawyers have also tried to make that argument in court, that this - this case is different than any other case. Obviously, prosecutors arguing the opposite. But again, the jury selection process will pick up again tomorrow. We will - they will continue to try to fill those last five jury slots and then pick six - around six alternates to serve. And the judge was optimistic that opening statements could take place as soon as Monday, of course suggesting that timeline and shrugging in court yesterday. So, we'll have to see if that timing sticks. But the case in the trial is moving forward despite Donald Trump's concerns and criticism of the process for selecting a jury. And, Zach, tell us what we know about the jury, but also to reinforce the point, both sides knew about the ten strikes going in, right?",

AKERMAN: If I were the district attorney, I'd feel pretty good. What hasn't really been reported is that the district attorney is using social media to check out these jurors. And they need it for two reasons. One, they want to make sure that none of the jurors are members of the Trump cult. You're certainly going to find that out through their social media posts. And secondly, they want to make sure that they get somebody who is a normal person that doesn't feel isolated from society, that's not going to be iconoclastic and decide to hang this jury. That is the biggest threat that the DA's office has to be concerned about. And right now, based on who's been picked, I think they're in good shape.",

But like you said in the beginning, the main question that police have at this point is who is the person or persons who led these two strangers together ultimately in this deadly conflict.Here's what we do know. We know that William Brock, the 81-year-old man, he says that he was receiving calls from a scammer who was saying that his nephew was in jail and that Brock needed to withdraw $12,000 in cash to bail him out of jail. None of that is true according to investigators. And though I will say that investigators said Brock, though, when he initially got this call, he became hesitant. He was resistant to comply with this scammer's demand. Well, it was at that point that Brock says the scammer started to threatened both his life and his nephew's life. Meanwhile, at the same time, police say that Loletha Hall, she was driving Uber, as she normally does, and she got a call on Uber from either the same scammer or police believe in accomplice to go pick up a package at Mr. Brock's home. And then that's when this violent and deadly encounter happened. And we have that dashcam video from Ms. Hall's car. You can see Loletha Hall, she gets out, tries to inquire about a package. Nothing else. And Mr. Brock, when he - in his words, fearful for his life, holds her at gunpoint. They walk around the car a few times and he ultimately shoots Ms. Hall multiple times. She died later at the hospital. And, Kate, just to give a little insight into what Mr. Brock was thinking at that moment. I want you to listen to some of the 911 call that came just after this shooting. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
