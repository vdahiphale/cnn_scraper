And it may lead to, you know, the rescue efforts that's going on now, to even step-up pace even more. There is that sense that the window is closing because of the oxygen levels on that craft and the gear finally getting into shape. They do have remote operated vehicles that are now able to get to depth down to the bottom that they can physically lay eyes on things. So hopefully, we will have more information very soon. The Coast Guard typically does their press conferences around 1pm eastern time. They push that back a little later today. So that may indicate that they have -- they're trying to gather information and trying to understand exactly what is happening down there, and what they have -- what they have found. And by that time, hopefully, maybe they will have laid eyes on something, and we will have a much clearer picture of what's happening to two and a half miles beneath the surface of the ocean.",

Experts within the unified command are evaluating the information. So just so we're clear on exactly what they know and what they don't know.And as you are making it pretty clear to our viewers, there are still lots of questions to be answered about what they believe that they saw. But just to kind of give our viewers a sense of where they are right now, Miguel. 96 hours of oxygen. That's how much they had. And we're talking about a two-hour descent on Sunday morning, June 18. It is now Thursday. We've all been doing the math and watching to see what we could potentially learn. So, give our viewers a sense of the stakes at this hour on this day, Thursday when they went down on Sunday.",

But people who have been on that craft, people who know OceanGate, and Rush Stockton and PH Nargeolet. More importantly, who is on that craft as well.Extremely able oceanographer very, very capable, deep ocean diver knows exactly what to do in these situations. Their belief is that from the moment from moment on, if they got into a catastrophic situation, and they were still alive from moment on, they would have known preserving oxygen was the most important thing they could do, because they may have to be down there for several days. It is the conditions would be horrendous pitch black, freezing cold, and dwindling oxygen, all three of those things make for sort of a nightmare scenario. But if they're able to stay calm, sleep, use as little oxygen as possible, continue to use the carbon dioxide scrubber which according to people who have been on that before. They all learn how to use that they might be able to survive beyond that 96-hours. So, but the window is closing, and you can tell searchers can consents that, can feel that. If the amount of gear that's come in here to St. John's that's moved out of here in the last couple of days. And now that they're getting to the sea floor and actually trying to see get their eyes on what is down there. And then -- once they find it, getting it from there to the surface is going to be a herculean task as well. So, all these pieces have to come together.

Miguel Marquez talking about the 96-hour oxygen limit, that we're past that but that people who are trained, and several of those who are on this certainly have experience that they know how to extend the life of that 96-hour limit beyond what it normally should or could have for people to survive.",

Certainly, you would assume that during the period where the casualty occurred, whatever failure it was, that you would have some excitement and some panic going on for a brief period of time. And that can bring down your oxygen level quite rapidly.If you then have a strong leader, I assume PH Nargeolet, as well as Stockton Rush, are those, you have to insist that everybody goes down into a sort of hibernation state and uses as little as little oxygen as possible. You could possibly reduce the percentage, the fraction of oxygen in the atmosphere maybe down to 18, maybe even 17 percent. Of course, you have to deal with the CO2 that everybody's exhaling. My understanding is, and I'm not familiar with their construction and their design features, but my understanding is that they're using these fairly recently developed lithium hydroxide blankets that are extremely efficient at scrubbing dioxide, they may have a large supply there, maybe that's not a concern to them to get rid of the CO2.

It coordinates the rescue efforts ongoing between the Canadian military, the Canadian Coast Guard and the U.S. Coast Guard. Now look, Dana, just in the last hour, we received an update from them, saying that they really felt that they had a lot of assets, both on the sea and crucially in the air, Dana. And that issue was to be able to continue to drop those sonar buoys to try and hear those noises.What was also interesting here was that they had sent out the HMCS Glace Bay. What does that have a full medical team specialized in trying to treat people immediately, who may be had oxygen deprivation or any other medical complications as you can imagine, that you would have had from being on that submersible for so long. Again, we all await the update in the next couple of hours and the U.S. Coast Guard, they will give us more information in terms of what this debris field means. Certainly, Canadian officials aren't prejudging it at, all that -- remember, they don't have a human being down there, right? It went down there with the remote vehicle. That means everything that is found by those cameras needs to then be analyzed likely by the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard and other international experts to determine exactly what it is. It may not have anything to do with the Titan. And that is why at this hour, Dana, I can tell you that this search continues, both underwater in the sky and unsurfaced of the sea in case, in case that Titan did still reach the surface of the water.",

They do as best they can. Whether it's the noise, isn't the banging sound or anything that the cameras from that remote vehicle is feeding back. They want to make sure 100 percent they know what it is.This is a Titanic wreck site. That's though the so-called water column, where they sent that remote vehicle down, the one that could actually get to 13,000 feet. So that would be the likely place where Titan would be. But then again, they've made other voyages there before. And for that reason, perhaps there is some kind of debris that they will get their eyes on, and they will be able to either say conclusively that it is not Titan or say that conclusively it is. That is what they are awaiting in the hours to come. And as you rightfully say, Dana, in the meantime, that rescue effort continues and continues to the point that they are ready to surface five individuals and bring them immediately onto HMCS Glace Bay, and treat them medically, if that's what they need.",

The Coast Guard announcing that discovered this debris. Go ahead?Jason Carroll: Right. And again, Dana, just to repeat what, some of what Paula was saying. Again, the tweet going out just a short while ago from the Coast Guard saying, quote, a debris field was discovered within the search area by an ROV. That's one of the remote operated vehicles that you heard Paula speaking about, near the Titanic. Experts within the unified command are evaluating the information. And again, it's a dramatic tweet. But we have to be clear that we are uncertain at this point, exactly what this debris field is. Clearly, it's picking a lot of interests because of where it was found. And this is now why we have to wait to hear from the Coast Guard to hear what they're going to be able to tell us about whatever this ROV has discovered. Now, at three o'clock, just a few hours from now, Rear Admiral John Mauger will be conducting the briefing. I can tell you as we've been out here for these briefings all throughout the week, he has not been present for those briefings, but he will be here today. Again, just to recap, 96 hours ago was when the Titan went into the water, today was the day that the by all estimates they were running out of oxygen. And so, you can understand why this -- when this tweet went out, it piqued a great deal of interest. But again, we have to be just -- we just have to be very certain about this. We can't say for certain at this point, exactly what that debris field is. We should also -- it's worth just noting again who was on board. The Titan's Stockton Rush, CEO from OceanGate, British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman. Paul-Henri Nargeolet a French national, also Hamish Harding, British billionaire. So, at this point, waiting to see what the Coast Guard is going to be able to tell us. We are here at Coast Guard headquarters.

I mean, I don't remember seeing a tweet like this. And the fact that you said that, that John McGraw is coming out, the commander is coming out. Be careful not to speculate.

But I can go through with you that there have been quite a few safety concerns around the Titan vessel that was built and finished back in 2018. We do know that two former OceanGate employees had raised concerns, safety concerns about the actual structure of the Titan, specifically about a toll and how thick that carbon fiber and titanium hole was.We understand CNN spoke with one of those former OceanGate employees who said that, when the hole arrived, it was only five inches thick rather than seven inches thick as that employee says. They had been assured. The other former staffer during a counter lawsuit, alleged that the Titan hadn't gone through the proper non-destructive testing to make sure that structure was actually sound and could handle the pressure that it would face down at 13,000 feet where the Titanic is. Both of those employees said that those concerns were raised to OceanGate management, even to the CEO Stockton Rush, and were largely dismissed. We've reached out to OceanGate about those claims. So far, there's been no response. And we also have obtained a 2018 letter, Dana, that was written by the head of a submersible organization that really warned about OceanGate, as they described an experimental approach to this vessel that they said could have catastrophic consequences. And the big concern was that the vessel wasn't certified. And that it hadn't -- it wasn't certified by an industry group that isn't that I hadn't gone through independent testing in front of an independent third party, industry specialist. Those are not required, according to experts to actually do these types of dives in international waters. But from the experts I've spoken with, they are an industry standard. In fact, the person who penned that letter, who I spoke with Will Coenen (Ph) who heads that submersible organization. He told me that there are only 10 submersibles in the world that can make that type of dive and this is the only one that isn't certified. Dana?",

But clearly, at a time where the oxygen window so to speak, has already closed and it would be then dependent on them, finding some way to extend the oxygen in the vessel.

They are analyzing the debris. But there are so many indicators here that this is something significant, simply because first and foremost, we've got the rear admiral who's going to be speaking about this. Because in the past, when we were out here for briefings, it was one of the captains here who was conducting the briefings before that. Again, the U.S. Coast Guard saying that an ROV one of the remotely operated vehicles came across the debris field. These ROVs which Dana, we've been speaking about for the past few days are equipped with cameras, equipped with robotic arms. And when you think about the Titanic, you think about those who have been down there before. I mean, this is a deep area of the ocean, some two miles or so down beneath the surface and 13,000 feet below the surface. It's a dark, desolate area. But it's an area that has been mapped, that has been clearly sort of indicated in the past. People who have been down there, there hasn't been that many. They know what's down there. They know what they're looking at. And so, logically thinking, if a Coast Guard is going to put out a tweet like that, one would have to think that they know what they're looking for when they get down there.

These ROVs looking below the surface. They're searching in a finite area. And so, once again, logically thinking, you know, when you put out a tweet saying, we found a debris field, we are analyzing it.
