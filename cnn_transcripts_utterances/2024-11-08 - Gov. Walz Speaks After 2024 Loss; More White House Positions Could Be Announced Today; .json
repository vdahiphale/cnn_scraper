There he is with his wife Gwen Walz, a bittersweet message, talking about his time on the campaign trail, bragging a little bit about his record in Minnesota, which will no doubt start speculation about 2028. Believe it or not, people are already talking about that, who's going to take on the Democratic mantle in four years.Continuing in our politics lead now, the big question, who will President-elect Donald Trump hire next? His second administration is taking shape and more picks could be announced as soon as today. We know his campaign manager Susie Wiles will become the first ever woman to be named White House chief of staff. We know Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York is under consideration to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. But while the new boss makes these decisions, there's also new reporting that the Pentagon is expecting major upheaval when Trump returns to his role as commander-in-chief. Let's go first to CNN's Kristen Holmes in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, who else is on the short list for some of the Trump administration roles?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jake, we're learning more names by the minute. Now, just one thing to make clear, these top contenders have actually been meeting with Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, the two co-chairs of the transition team for the last several weeks. That includes Elise Stefanik as you mentioned, who has name has been floated for secretary to the United Nations. There's also a number of other people who have been in the mix like for secretary of state, for example, Senator Marco Rubio. Bill Hagerty is on that list as well. Ric Grenell, a loyalist to Donald Trump, who has butted heads with a lot of Republicans.Just to cast a larger picture here of what exactly is going on inside of the transition, I am told as you mentioned that we could get some names of the White House as early as today. They have been grinding out trying to get this done as quickly as possible so that they can start putting policies in place and start having the administration take shape. And I'm also told, Donald Trump has been holed up at Mar- a-Lago for the last several days, taking calls and holding some of these meetings, going over some of the lists that the transition team had put together of its meetings with these various people for different departments. So that's what's happening right now in the background. The one big thing about the Susie Wiles announcement is it shows you the kind of tone that this administration wants to take. She is a non-nonsense person. She is somebody who had most things filtered through her for the campaign. And she is -- and I am told that she is going to do the same thing for the administration starting with the transition. So I am told right, now there are still conversations happening about the structure that was put in place for the last several months and whether or not they're going to continue with it. But they are churning out names and we are likely to hear them. They could come as early as today, but certainly, over the next few days, we're going to see a trickle of those names.",

That is something that officials here have been discussing in terms of how they would actually respond to that, what would a response look like if the president were to actually order active duty troops to these cities to engage in this kind of domestic law enforcement?And if he did, you know, a former senior military official who served under Trump said that that would be very significant. It is not something that the president would be able to necessarily water down to the American people. It would be, quote, a very big deal. And another thing that officials here are gaming out is, of course, what is going to happen if Donald Trump reinstates an executive order known as Schedule F which would essentially reclassify a large amount of apolitical civilian employees across the federal government, including here at the Pentagon and allow them to be more easily fireable. That is something that defense officials here are scrambling to address before he enters office trying to kind of whittle down the list of people who would be at risk of being moved into that category, because of course they're trying to create you know, as minimal of a disruption as possible to the day-to-day operations here. But clearly they are concerned. They are having these conversations about whether there would be resignations, for example, if an unlawful order were issued, and importantly what the chain of command would look like if Trump did issue uh that kind of order to deploy those active duty forces.",

The former president was eager to understand at a granular level why he was no longer in the White House and even though their dinner took place in early 2021, the subtext of his line of questioning was, how can I do this again and when?

They created an army of influence -- social media influencers and others to reach them online. Some of us tried to signal the alarm about that months ago that we're we simply were not communicating effectively with our people., Two years ago, we were saying that when talking about, hey, Joe Biden says the economy is doing great but people aren't buying it. So I think that's a more productive conversation than, you know, who did what to whom and when. I do think however strategically if, Vice President Harris would have had more time, she could have replicated the Obama model which was remember they spent a year understanding who the Obama voter was, how to reach them what to say to them and then turning them out. She didn't -- she had 107 days and in a campaign that was designed for a very different candidate. So, you know, who knows if there'd been an open primary or this or that.

So, Julia, Trump's hope is that more products will be made in the U.S. Is that is what is happening with Steve Madden?",

      "sentences": "In a word, no. This news should be music to Trump's ears, to your point because the whole point of tariff is to make U.S. imports more expensive and to bring that production back home, except Steve Madden aren't going to be producing in America because it's just too expensive.Look they've said it's going to be sourcing goods from Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil and a few others. And by the way China's already been accused of circumventing U.S. tariffs by moving goods through Mexico into the United States. So the next administration could end up playing a kind of tariff whack-a-mole too. But, Jake, the real key here is that firms are already acting even before new tariffs hit.",
