Thanks and good evening to everyone tonight.Is Donald Trump getting closer to another indictment? The former president has already been indicted twice now for two separate alleged crimes, a hush money scheme and the classified documents saga. And now, he is potentially facing yet another. Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the election, it's clearly escalating this week. CNN has learned that Smith is focused on a chaotic shouting match that you might remember unfolded at the White House, six weeks after the election. Now, that is where these baseless ideas were floated to block President Biden's victory, including martial law and seizing voting machines. Here are some of those who were in attendance at that meeting in their own words. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There are many key questions that are still unanswered, including are any of these actions and were any of those proposed ideas against the law?

You can talk about the path and developing a defense. What you can't do is potentially talk about future crimes, right? It cannot be a strategy session for doing wrong in the future. And having lawyers there does not protect it and make it privileged. So, what it sounds like is the special counsel is digging into whether there were potential crimes effectively being plotted at that meeting. And whether you call it seditious conspiracy or something similar, it's basically, were there plans to instigate violence, to rile people up to the extent that the election results would not be accepted and that people would basically lead to violence in trying to stop Congress from signing off on the Electoral College vote.",

They could have taken a few weeks after the election, in good faith, to look into whatever theories they thought they may have. But by the point of this meeting, it was so clear that, like Pat Cipollone said, where's the evidence?

And, basically, what it came down to, he had no evidence to support those claims.

And the game of expectations, tragically, again, because I'm not a Trump fan, has accrued to Trump's benefit because he's had two indictments against him, yet his numbers are still rising. And the game of expectations with regard to DeSantis has not worked out so well. I think one of the dangers that Ron is playing right now is trying to be sort of Trump on steroids with regard to sort of social issues. I think that there are really deep problems in this country with regard to the debt that's mounting, government spending, inflation, historic bedrocks of what Republicans used to be about, but they're not getting talked about, Ron is not talking about him, other candidates aren't talking about him.

You know, originally, it started as a group of folks who were going to try and steer the conference a little bit to the right, because that happened to be our perspective, particularly on economic issues. But then it became simply a Trump lapdog wanting to hang on to or be close to power. It was with glee that the chairman would hold up a conference phone, say they got the president of the United States on the phone. But it's also the reason that somebody like Justin Amash said, I'm out of here, I'm leaving. He left the Freedom Caucus because it had become so untethered from the ideas that it originally stood for. So, it's sort of adrift. I don't know what it's about these days. Maybe it will come back around. But the fact that this was the last straw, it's a straw that should have gone a long time ago, because this is somebody talking about all kinds of crazy conspiracies that I think are harmful to both Republican ideals that are conservative ideals -- I don't know what Republican ideals are anymore -- but conservative ideals that we ought to be about advancing, and, frankly, democratic process.",

Number two, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition. The ammunition -- they call them 155 millimeter weapons. This is a war relating to munitions. And they're running out of those, that ammunition, and we're low on it. And so what I finally did, it took the recommendation of the Defense Department to, not permanently but to allow for in this transition period where we have more 155 weapons, these shells, for the Ukrainians, to provide them with something that has a very low dud rate, It's about -- I think it's 150, which is the least likely to be blowing.

The market for conspiracy theory materials, whether it's books, podcasts, merchandise, or films like this is enormous. These people have disposable income and they put their money where their mouth is. They feel like they are sticking it to the Hollywood elite, ironically, by helping prop up theaters at a time when the theater industry is still really struggling to bring people back.Here's this huge group of people buying tickets for strangers who probably aren't even going to the movie. So, you know, in one sense, you feel like Hollywood should thank these people, but there's a feeling of all pulling on the same rope together, of all trying to fight back together. And these people, they wanna be seen, they wanna be represented, and they feel like buying tickets, whether for themselves or their church group or complete strangers. is a way to push back against these horrors that they think are infecting the whole world.",

She's a mother to Selena, and Audie Cornish spoke to Tammy for a report on the lawsuits for CNN's new show, the whole story with Anderson Cooper. Here's a little peek. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  What Tammy did know at the time was that Selena had figured out how to block her mother from seeing her online life. She had saved her fingerprint and I didn't know she had saved it in my phone. So, like if I'd fall asleep or whatever, she would use her fingerprint to get in and change the settings. TAMMY RODRIGUEZ, FILED LAWSUITS AGAINST INSTAGRAM AND SNAPCHAT (voice- over):  Once the pandemic had started, she was posting more, she became more recluse. She was focused on how many likes she has, how many followers she has, how many followers she's losing, who's messaging her.
