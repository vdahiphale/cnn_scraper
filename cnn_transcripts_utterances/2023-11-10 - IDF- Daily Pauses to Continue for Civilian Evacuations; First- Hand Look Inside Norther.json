The Israelis, though, seem unmoved by that. These four-hour pauses seem to be, you know, localized and well short of White House demands. And if anything, the offense just seems to be ramping up. ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: John, it's not just short of White House demands. It's also short of demands from Arab leaders, for example. And the Emiratis and the Qataris reiterated the need for an immediate ceasefire right now, in order to allow civilians to get out of harm's way, and also, of course, to offer for more humanitarian aid to go in. But from Israel's perspective, these tactical localized pauses, as they are calling them, is -- strikes, from their perspective, a balance between allowing Palestinian civilians to get out of the Northern parts of the Gaza Strip, which is the focus of Israeli operations and where their ground forces are. And to enable them to get to the relative safety of the South of Gaza and also to allow for more humanitarian aid in at the same time. And we've heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu there. You have Gallant, the defense minister, also reiterating that this doesn't qualify as a ceasefire. And I suppose from Israel's perspective, of course, it also has to think about what the Israelis, the Israeli people are wanting, which of course, is the return of those 240 or so hostages still being held by militants, Hamas and also Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. And that there can be no ceasefire. So in order to not break that promise, and that unwavering commitment to not have a ceasefire, to keep fighting until those hostages are released, I suppose that is one reason why this is simply being called a tactical localized pause. And as you say, this is falling short of the longer humanitarian pause, for want of a better name, that the U.S. is calling for, and of course, the immediate ceasefire of actions that the Arab world and many others in the international community are calling for, John.",

And also, why make them sort of that message, which was sent out to the people of Israel. Is that some kind of -- you know, what's Islamic Jihad hoping to achieve with that? O'SHEA: This is classic. And I wrote this after I left Iraq years ago. This is hostage terrorism. Terrorist groups who use the criminal act of abducting and holding hostages, and individuals against their will to announce their agenda, raise their profile, negatively influence world opinion, disrupt, degrade the political will and decision-making ability of their declared adversary. Their adversary is Benjamin Netanyahu. And in this case, they have an old Israeli woman and a young Israeli boy, arguably two of the most vulnerable of these victims, a young child and a grandmother, that are putting pressure on Netanyahu himself to call for a ceasefire, so that medical aid and electricity and water can be delivered into Gaza. Because it's affecting everyone, not just the Gazan citizens, the Hamas terrorists fighting the Israeli offensive but the hostages themselves are feeling this. And that's why a grandmother and a young boy are the perfect messengers for Hamas to reveal, or Islamic Jihad to reveal this message by that proof-of-live video to the world.",

Details now from Barbie Nadeau, reporting in from Rome.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Vatican's announced a crucial change in rules for LGBTQ Catholics. Transgender people and babies born to same-sex couples can now be baptized in the Catholic Church in some cases, as long as they continue their religious education and do not cause, quote, \"scandal or disorientation to others.\" The change is a 180-degree turn from previous rulings in which the Vatican often seemed to slam the door to the LGBTQ community. Pope Francis has spoken positively on LGBTQ issues in the past, saying the church is open to everyone, including members of the gay community. He also said that criminalizing homosexuality is an injustice. POPE FRANCIS, LEADER OF CATHOLIC CHURCH (through translator): This is not right. Persons with homosexual tendencies are children of God. God loves them. God accompanies them. Criminalizing people with homosexual tendencies is an injustice. NADEAU (voice-over): The new rules are welcomed by Catholics in the LGBTQ community, but they offer conservatives in the church another point of contention. Before the new baptism decision was announced, conservatives led by U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, warned that too many changes can lead to confusion. The new rules still mean homosexuality is a sin in the eyes of the church, but they do offer an opportunity for inclusion in an ancient institution that often seems slow to change.

At least four missile and drone attacks in Iraq and Syria since Wednesday, leaving three U.S. service members with minor injuries, according to U.S. officials.Hours earlier, a weapons storage facility in Eastern Syria was targeted by U.S. airstrike. Officials in Washington say it was controlled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard, believed responsible for many of at least 46 attacks on American troops since mid-October. Disturbing new video from Sudan's West Darfur region is raising concerns of a new surge in ethnically-driven killings. Troops who appear to belong to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are seen rounding up civilians from one ethnic group, who are yelling racist slurs and a whole lot worse. More details now from CNN's David McKenzie. And a warning: his report, as you would expect, contains some graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The evidence of alleged atrocities in Western Darfur keep on piling up. On Wednesday, we brought you these videos geolocated to the outskirts of El Geneina, in Western Darfur. It shows Rapid Support Forces, and other allied militia believed rounding up the people from larger African ethnicities in that city, in some cases abusing them physically, in other cases racially abusing them verbally. We don't know what exactly happened to these individuals who look terrified in the video. This is all taking place here in El Geneina, in Western Darfur, in the region we believe, close to an Army base where the RSF attacked in recent days. And I want to show you this disturbing image, which shows at least 12 bodies. We've blurred some of those bodies, but you get a sense of the atrocities that have been happening in that region. We've managed to geolocate this image to the same area as some of those videos, but we do not know yet whether it's the same individuals you see in the videos that are in the still image. Nor do we know exactly when this image was taken. The U.S. embassy in Khartoum has said they're deeply disturbed by the eyewitness accounts of ethnic targeting happening in West Darfur. Thousands have been streaming over the border into Chad in recent days, according to Doctors Without Borders. But there's no sign of the violence abating. And the RSF, who denies any involvement in ethnic killings or targeting in response to our query, says that they will be pushing on to another major center in that region.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If you are among those still in Northern Gaza, this is what life looks like now, the heart of a battle zone. \"May God protect us,\" this man says. \"Those who do not have the means to leave, we will have to stay where we are. It's as if they sentenced us to death.\" ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): The Israeli military continues to call on all residents of Northern Gaza to move South. It is the forced exodus of an entire population, Palestinians say. But some are unable or unwilling to heed the warning. Thousands of them are taking shelter at Gaza City hospitals. Among them patients that can't be moved, families too afraid to travel through bombs and bullets, and medical staff loyal to a duty of care. Doctor Muhammad Abunamuz (ph) says he has sent his family away, but he will stay behind. \"What can be done? There's no other way out of this. There is no safety,\" he says. \"That's why it's best if I get my family out so I can focus on treating patients.\" On Wednesday alone, as many as 50,000 people made the perilous journey South via the time-limited corridors set up by the Israeli military. REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): They're moving, because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the North, and that the South is safer, a safer area where they receive medicine, water, food. They understand it's an improvement. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): But the South is not safe, and hardly an improvement. Israeli airstrikes level homes here, too. And the conditions for the estimated 1.5 million now cramped in this corner of the enclave are described as inhumane. Thousands of the displaced are living on the street. \"There is no aid, no water. The toilets are closed,\" she says, \"and no bakeries. We get a single loaf of bread every three or four days after waiting in long lines for half a day.\" And U.N. shelters are overcrowded. At one site, at least 600 people share a single toilet, the U.N. says. And as for humanitarian assistance, it is so far a drop in the ocean of need. VOLKER TURK, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: This is the gateway to a hellish nightmare, and then I see in front of me the lifeline that would bring relief and humanitarian assistance, which until now has not been enough, woefully inadequate. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): The conditions are so dire that this family says they decided to leave a U.N. shelter and move back into the ruins of their bombed-out home. \"We're still afraid, of course, for our children, but it's the lesser of two evils,\" this father says. \"At least it's better than being surrounded by disease, hunger, and fear. At least here our children are at home.\" With three out of every four Gazans internally displaced, the U.N. estimates home is what so many dream of here, but many fear that sense of normalcy will never return.

But such proposals have been characterized by the Biden administration as a mistake. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We must also work on the affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace. These must include the Palestinian people's voices and aspirations at the center of postcrisis governance in Gaza. It must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.
