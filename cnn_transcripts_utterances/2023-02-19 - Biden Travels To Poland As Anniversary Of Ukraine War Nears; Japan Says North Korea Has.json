He will deliver a message of solidarity just a few days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-blown invasion of Ukraine. He will reaffirm united support for that country. And his visit comes on the heels of the Munich Security Conference where the U.S. staked out some hard-nosed positions on several fronts, accusing Russia of committing crimes against humanity and warning China not to provide lethal aid to Russian troops in Ukraine. Let's go straight to the White House, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, you know, we saw the vice president, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, all delivering these very tough messages to both Russia and China. Tell us more.",

Former president Donald Trump will travel to East Palestine, Ohio, yes, East Palestine, Ohio, on Wednesday to meet with community members in the wake of that toxic train derailment there earlier this month. This as Ron DeSantis heads to New York to speak at a pro-law enforcement rally. Overnight Trump once again lashed out at his potential rival, announcing in a 1:00 a.m. Truth Social rant, sounds familiar, he will no longer call DeSantis, quote, \"Meatball Ron,\" a reference to him being Italian, I suppose. Going on to say Jeb Bush is his hero, his beaches and state were closed for long periods of time. His testing for the China virus,\" this is in Trump's words, \"didn't work out too well and his loyalty skills are weak.\" Joining us now to unpack that, if that's even possible, is former Trump administration official Gavin Smith and our old friend, CNN political analyst Paul Begala.

And this is based on many years of observing him. He's not good in empathy. We all recall when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico and he was throwing paper towels around.So he's not good at empathy the way that other presidents, Bush or Clinton or others, were. And he's not good at shifting the spotlight off of him.

If she didn't believe that she could be president, she wouldn't be running.Now when we talk about polls, I think what we should be talking about is that there's an AP poll that came out this week that says six out of 10 Republicans say it's a bad thing that Donald Trump would be at the top of the ticket in 2024. That's a bad number for Donald Trump. You know, another thing related to a poll is when we look back at 2016, what do the polls tell us? The polls told us Donald Trump would never be president. Jeb Bush was the frontrunner. Scott Walker was a strong contender. And all of that seemed to blow up.

It's a razor's edge state. It's a state Mr. Trump carried by 10,000 votes in 2016 and then lost by 150,000 or so to Joe Biden. So in the wake of that, why has Michigan gone so hard against the Republicans? Some of it is I think Democrats are doing a good job. I think Governor Whitmer, Lavora Barnes, the state Democratic chair, they're fantastic. But also some of this is a revulsion to what is quite obviously extremism in the eyes of Michigan voters. It's exactly where they need to not be. It's really -- I mean, I guess as a Democrat I'd be happy. But as a professional, it's malpractice to double down on what just cost you the statehouse, the state Senate, the attorney generalship, secretary of state, the governorship, the Supreme Court and the school board.

I mean, that's essentially what was going on here.AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, MEDIAITE: Right. I think that's the crucial thing to remember about those weeks after the 2020 election, is that FOX News was the first network to call Arizona for Biden. And that enraged Trump, his supporters and his campaign. And that outrage eventually trickled down to FOX News' viewers. If you see it in the texts between Tucker Carlson and his producer, who told Tucker Carlson one night in the weeks after the election that the viewers were outraged about this call and that the network should do something about it. And Tucker Carlson actually tried to get Jacqui Heinrich who's a prominent reporter, White House correspondent at FOX News, tried to get her fired in text to Sean Hannity, his fellow primetime host, because she fact-checked their claims -- Trump's claims about the election. So there was this pervasive fear at FOX News because of the Arizona call, and because a lot of the fact checking of these election claims that were happening. There was this pervasive fear that viewers would flee to Trumpier pastures like OAN and Newsmax and these upstart conservative outlets that were embracing these lies more aggressively.

That's the classic litany of propaganda and misinformation, disinformation that we've been hearing from Russia throughout this entire war, even including the justification, quote-unquote, for launching the war or relaunching the war in the first place almost a year ago now.What we have seen is allegations against Russia's forces really everywhere that they have been deployed, individuals found shot in the back of their head with their hands tied. Credible stories of rape and sexual violence, including against children and elderly persons. Attacks on the civilian infrastructure, et cetera. So these -- we're seeing these atrocities everywhere that Russia's troops are deployed. And now we have this determination of crimes against humanity involving also Russian political officials. So there really is no equivalency to what the few allegations that we have heard against Ukraine's forces. And in most respects, Ukraine has responded appropriately. They've indicated they're opening an investigation. They've started to gather evidence and they will ensure that their troops are adhering strictly to the laws of war.",

Until then, what we can do is document all of the crimes that are being committed.The international community has been remarkable in the degree to which it has activated a number of different pathways to justice. So of course, there are investigations in Ukraine. Their courts are open and active, and the prosecutor general has recorded over 65,000 potential incidents that are being investigated with assistance from the international community, including the United States, which is funding a group of experts that are informing the prosecutor general. Then of course you have the International Criminal Court, which has seized of this matter given Ukraine's consent. And then there are courts around the world that have opened investigations as well with prosecutorial authorities, working together under a joint investigative team within Europe to collect information, collate it, analyze it, prepare potential indictments. So as soon as Russian perpetrators start to travel, start to leave, get tossed out, make the strategist decision that, you know, I'd rather face justice somewhere than potentially fall out of a window, as we've seen happen.",

I don't know what a soft landing is anyway, but all you have to do is look at the data and there are many canaries in the mine. Last year we ended with Americans had a trillion dollars of credit card balances up 15 percent year over year. Our savings rate has gone from pre-pandemic around 9 percent to 3percent. We're saving less than ever. The number of Americans that are behind on their car payments is, you know, at record levels. 30 percent increase year over year. So the bottom line, the only reason we're not in a recession right now is because we had almost $3 trillion of accumulated savings during the pandemic. Americans are spending through those savings to make their ends meet and those savings are going to run dry this year, and I think we're due for a really, really painful correction.",

They can still finance their cars. The percentage of money they spend on eggs is obviously de minimis, right? But for the rest of Americans, when you're spending 70 percent more for eggs, right, you're now in a car that has negative equity, but you locked in high interest rates, what are the first things you do?You try to cut back on those monthly payments and you start scrambling. So in 2008, it was, you know, subprime lending. In 2023, I think the leading indicator is those car loans. And there are a lot of people who don't want Americans to feel like a recession is coming because then spending dries up. 70 percent of our GDP in this country is consumer spending and once the consumer pulls back, then that's where the recession really gets underway.",
