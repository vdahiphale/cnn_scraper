It's considered to be the biggest antitrust case in decades, and it could have major implications. The case focuses on Google's wildly popular search engine. According to the Justice Department, nearly 90 percent of all searches start with Google.DOJ alleges that the tech giant has stifled competition and harmed consumers by paying billions of dollars to device manufacturers to be the default search engine on smartphones and computers. Google denies doing anything to illegally restrict competition, maintaining the \"people don't use Google because they have to. They use it because they want to. Joining us now is CNN Media Analyst Sara Fischer. She's also Senior Media Reporter at Axios. Sara, I'm fascinated by this case, because it's been so long since we've seen something this big, but also because the Biden administration has made this type of thing a focal point of their anti-trust agenda, anti- competitive agenda but this is the biggest test by far they've had.",

We have not seen the U.S. government go after it big Tech Company, like this since Microsoft in the late 1990s and by the way, the repeal of that effect of that was huge. The only reason Google was able to become the behemoth it was today was because the DOJ imposed such strict penalties some were appealed.

Their quarterback was one of the most glamorous people in all the sports, Broadway Joe Namath.Joe Nemeth is 80 that's, how long it's been. And in most of the years since they didn't even come close to the Super Bowl. But they have a good defense. They were disappointed in the number one draft choice of a couple of years ago, Zach Wilson had to come in and play after Rodgers was hurt last night. So they go and get Aaron Rodgers, truly one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, and that electrified their entire offseason. He's a tremendous presence. They're going to be terrific this year. That's what everybody thinks. And then on the fourth play of the game, he suffers this injury. X rays were negative, but they're almost certain that an MRI which will happen later today, probably later this morning that an MRI will confirm that he has a torn Achilles, which means that he's out for the entire season. Best case scenario, slim chance, an ankle sprain, and then he'd still miss several games. The irony of this if there is one, and as Joe Buck put it, you had the call that he had last night on ESPN, he put it perfectly he said this is the definition of a Pyrrhic victory, a victory that comes at an almost unacceptable cost. And who is the hero at the end of the game. In contrast to Aaron Rodgers, a marquee name, here's Xavier Gibson, who played college ball at Stephen F. Austin in Texas wasn't even drafted at all signed as a free agent and it was a big deal on the HBO show Hard Knocks when they told him that he had made the team. He's a Cinderella story. So the big glamour guy is out. And the Cinderella story wins the game. So at least momentarily, there's jubilation in jet land. But there's a lot of apprehension about what happens next.",

And despite that, Trump still came out on top, which indicates to me that, you know, the Ron DeSantis his major thing has been COVID lock downs.
