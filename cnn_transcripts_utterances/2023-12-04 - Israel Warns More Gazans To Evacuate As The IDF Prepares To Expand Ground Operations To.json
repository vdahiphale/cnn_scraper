      "sentences": "Thanks for joining us. Well, the war between Israel and Hamas is expanding in Gaza and leaving devastation inside the enclave as Israel pursues those who carried out the attacks on October 7th. Israel Defense Forces now say that ground operations are expanding to include all of Gaza, including southern areas where many have taken shelter.The IDF is warning civilians to evacuate large areas within the enclave. But it's unclear how many are receiving those warnings given there is limited electricity and internet services. The IDF also says it killed a Hamas commander in an airstrike Sunday. Israeli officials say he was responsible for carrying out some of the deadly raids inside Israel in October. Meantime, the official Palestinian news agency says strikes hit the Jabalia refugee camp Sunday for a second day. Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us now from London with more on all of this. So, good morning to you, Elliott. So, what is the latest on Israel's expanding ground operation across all of Gaza? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST:  Rosemary, Israel has yet to finish the job in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, but as you say it's already saying that it's expanding its operations to the southern part of the Strip. Indeed, according to a Daniel Hagari spokesman for the IDF that Israel is expanding its operations to all of the Gaza Strip. And any hopes that Israel may go in a little bit more lightly as no less than U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was calling for just the other day may have been dashed by the comments we heard from Israel's chief of the general staff Herzi Halevi saying that Israel's operations in the southern part of the Gaza Strip will, in his words, be no less powerful than those operations in the north. And already we've seen rising civilian casualties in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, as well. Israel, as you say, has been issuing evacuation orders to large swathes of the southern part of the Gaza Strip. But either the message isn't getting through or it's not being fully understood. When CNN spoke with a spokesman for the IDF, Jonathan Conricus, he was asked what more Israel could do to help them evacuate safely. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And you know what UNICEF said? They said that it's not possible to do so.And UNRWA said it's not possible and there were people throwing words around like war crimes and other things when we were trying to evacuate people into relative safety. And now we're seeing kind of a repeat of that same practice where we're damned if we do and we're damned if we don't. And as Israel ratchets up its military campaign to all parts of the Gaza Strip, there are more moves on the diplomatic front, as well. The U.S. and also the French with President Emmanuel Macron on his way to Qatar are trying to resurrect that truce agreement that lasted a week and that saw hostages abducted by Hamas during its attacks of October the 7th being released in exchange for Palestinians being held in Israeli prisons. But from where we are right now, that seems like wishful thinking. It doesn't seem like that truce is going to be resumed anytime soon. Rosemary.",

Sultan Al- Jaber is the UAE's climate envoy and also heads the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.He made the comments November 21st at a climate panel event. He said phasing out fossil fuels was inevitable but that the world needs to be pragmatic about it -- pragmatic about it, suggesting the shift could negatively impact global economies. Some countries at COP28 are calling for a fossil fuel phase-out. Others want a phase-down, which has weaker language. The head of one climate advocacy group says Al Jaber's statements raised deep concerns over his ability to lead the U.N. climate talks. It's Finance Day at the COP28 Climate Summit, that means more financial discussions and the potential for climate action and disaster support funding to be announced in the coming hours. In addition, Saudi Arabia will host a side event promoting its clean energy plans and the U.N. climate agency could publish a new draft showing what kind of progress countries have made in the latest push to fight global warming. And CNN's David McKenzie joins me now live from Dubai. Good to see you David. So, what more can be expected in the day ahead? DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, we can expect more events here at the COP28, as well as the ongoing negotiations on whether the language that they come up with is strong, calling a phase out of fossil fuels or weaker, calling for a phase down. Now, it may seem like semantics but it could have a very real impact on the amount of effort the world puts into reducing emissions and those comments that have surfaced from the COP President certainly are worrying to many. There have been a number of people telling me here that they worry that there's a trust deficit with this COP 28 because it is hosted by an oil rich nation and led by a man who is in charge of the state oil company. For their part the UAE, officials are saying they are in this, like everyone else and that solutions need to come from everybody. You know, the climate change crisis that we're dealing with is often talked about in terms of billions of dollars flowing in to help solve these issues. We spent some time with extraordinary people in South Africa to show that it really doesn't take much money when the need is there.

A military spokesperson said Israel will forcefully strike any threat posed against them. The United Nations estimates up to 1.8 million people in Gaza, nearly 80 percent of the area's population, is internally displaced from Israeli airstrikes, or as a result of Israeli airstrikes. That estimate comes as the IDF warns Gaza residents they need to evacuate further south for their own safety. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th. That is according to the Hamas-controlled ministry of health in Gaza. That death toll is expected to rise in the coming days, especially with renewed airstrikes by Israel.

The sheer number, the magnitude, all of the injury and all of the killing was like nothing I had seen before. Every day felt worse than the day before. And we were running out of -- initially, running out of antiseptic solutions and especially dressings for burn. But by the end, we had run out of morphine, we had run out of ketamine that we use to anesthetize patients that needed dressing changes. I was having to do really painful dressing changes to keep wounds clean, with nothing but paracetamol and no ketamine as the ketamine ran out. And the day that I decided to leave, literally 5:00 in the morning, that day. We finally ran out of all of the anesthetic medication. We're no longer able to treat any of the patients in the O.R.
