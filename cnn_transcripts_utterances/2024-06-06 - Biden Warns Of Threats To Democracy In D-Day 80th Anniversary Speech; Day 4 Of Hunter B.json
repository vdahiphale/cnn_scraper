Of course, at the actions have told a different story. There has been a significant delay in the delivery of aid to Ukraine, which the Biden administration has acknowledged has put Ukraine in a weakened position on the battlefield, which has created a need for it to ramp up its strategy, which now includes being able to strike over the border and hit Russian or positions inside of Russia. So, certainly, there's a lot to digest here and a lot both for the loftier messaging that the White House had been crafting for recent weeks, but also really tangible messaging for both allies and adversaries around the world of what President Biden stands for and what the world leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with him stand for as well -- John.",

It will be very helpful to Ukraine, just as has been the long-delayed army tactical missile system provision and the Ukrainians are putting that to very good use, especially against targets in Crimea. They're making Crimea over time, increasingly unlivable for the Russian military, having already sunk some 40 percent or so of the Russian Black Sea fleet, which is very difficult to replace because they can't get warships through the Bosporus at a time aboard, due to the Montreux Convention which Turkey enforces.And that's very significant achievement because it opens up the Western Black Sea for Ukraine to export grain, hugely important for their fiscal situation and for countries like Egypt whose food security depends on it. But no, I'd like to see these limits lifted as well. It's -- I have considerable admiration for the way the administration led the Western world, NATO, and others in the wake of the invasion, kept it all together, avoided Putin driving a wedge between Europe and in North America, between East and West Europe, and so forth. But these delays on certain decisions I think have really been somewhat unconscionable. The delay on the M1 tanks which delayed the Leopard decision by Germany, the delay on a ATACMS, a delay on Western aircraft. Inevitably, we always say yes.

John, good morning.This means barring some sort of last-minute miracle, unforeseen miracle, there's no way Donald Trump is going to stand trial in Georgia before the 2024 election and raised the question of whether he will ultimately stand trial in Georgia at all. And look, this is because the Georgia court of appeals making very clear to the prosecution of Donald Trump in Georgia cannot continue until the Georgia court of appeals ways in and decides on this issue of whether or not Fani Willis should be disqualified. You mentioned too that the deadline for that decision is March 2025, that come to well, after November's election. And look, if Donald Trump is elected president, that effectively means the chances of a trial ever happening go down to zero. But look, this is not unusual or this is unusual because the appeals court typically when it takes up an issue stays proceedings in the trial court. It means that work in the trial court cannot continue while the appeals court weighs an issue. But in this case, Judge Scott McAfee, the trial court judge, did right in his order that work would continue his courtroom, even if the appeals court took up the disqualification issue, the appeals court weighing in though yesterday saying, no, we're going to push pause on all work in this case as it relates to Donald Trump and some of his co-defendants, until we sort this matter out. And look, that means that we're going to spend the next several months instead of preparing for a trial, we're going to be re-litigating this issue of whether or not Fani Willis engaged in an improper romantic relationship with her top prosecutor and whether she -- benefited financially from that relationship in a way that represents a conflict of interests. That's something the appeals courts going to have to determine looking at all the evidence that was presented during those hearings, several months ago. Remember, we've watched those play out live Judge McAfee deciding no, she can stay on the case if Nathan Wade left. The appeals court now, can overturn that decision if it decides to.",
