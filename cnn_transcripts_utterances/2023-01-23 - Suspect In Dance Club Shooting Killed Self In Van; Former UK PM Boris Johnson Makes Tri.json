He matched the age of the victims who are older. This is not a club that we might think of a club like 20 and 30-year-old. This is more of a social club that he has some relationship or connection to someone there, whether through relationship or employment.

Pentagon officials have also assessed that in some areas, Wagner's fighters have had more success in the war than Russia's own military.

International law, the laws of war defines mercenary as someone who's been specifically recruited to fight in an armed conflict and who's going to be financially rewarded in a way that's substantially more than an ordinary member of the armed forces.But one of the other criteria is that if you are a national of a party to an armed conflict, then you do not meet the definition of mercenary. If in Ukraine you have Russian nationals fighting on behalf of Wagner, then they would not meet the definition of mercenary and therefore would not fall within the international legal definition. So I suspect that what the U.S. is doing here is trying to ensure some accountability for these actors, for example, by putting more sanctions in place.

We're now in a phase where we need to be able to hold those personnel responsible for the atrocities to account.So either that has to be done at the national level, it could be done via the International Criminal Court, it could be done through human rights mechanisms. There are a whole variety of different ways to hold these actors to account. We could have states exercising universal jurisdiction, so that would be a situation where a state exercises jurisdiction over a case, a situation of a trust is being committed outside that country, but for example, torture. And if the human rights violations are serious enough, then the country can claim to, sorry, excuse me, can prosecute the individuals in that country. And so, you know, there are tools there. But the problem we can't put the toothpaste back in the tube at this point. We need to be looking seriously at these kinds of actors and putting in place mechanisms at the national level to stop them being recruited, to stop them being trade, to stop them being financed. And I suppose that is what the U.S. trying to do with this new law or this new provision, and I guess it's going to try and target particularly the financing of the Wagner group.",

Those arrested at the National University of San Marco could now face charges related to occupying the facilities according to Peruvian interior minister Vicente Romero. This is one of the latest cases of unrest that has gripped Peru over the last several weeks. A new wave of violent protests forced authorities Saturday to close the ancient citadel of Machu Picchu, one of Peru's main tourist attractions. A railway track was damaged there, leaving more than 400 tourists stranded. The rail service was suspended briefly in December for a similar reason. Later on Saturday, Peru's foreign trade and tourism minister Luis Fernando Helguero said in a statement all of the stranded tourists have been evacuated. Among those evacuated, he said, there were 270 domestic tourists and 148 foreigners. The statement also said the Cusco International Airport which is used as a connecting point by many international travelers had reopened after being closed on Friday. Flights were temporarily suspended Thursday from the international airport in Arequipa, Peru's second largest city after protesters tried to storm it. So far, more than 50 people have died since the protests began in early December and more than 1,200 have been injured, according to Peruvian Ombudsman's offices. Protesters want new elections, the resignation of current president Dina Boluarte, a new constitution, and the release of former president Pedro Castillo who's currently in pretrial detention. Castillo was accused of rebellion and conspiracy after trying to dissolve congress -- charges he denies. He was ousted by impeachment on December 7th. Rafael Romo, CNN -- Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
