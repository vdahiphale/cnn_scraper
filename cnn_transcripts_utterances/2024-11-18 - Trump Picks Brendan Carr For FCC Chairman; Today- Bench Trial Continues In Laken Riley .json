He had been first nominated by Trump in 2017 to join as a commissioner. So why is this important? The FCC is an independent agency. It's overseen by Congress. But that hasn't stopped Trump from calling on the government to revoke certain broadcast television licenses, usually in response to interviews or coverage that he doesn't like. As for Carr, he wrote a chapter on proposed changes to the FCC for Project 25, the Heritage Foundation's plan for a second Trump term that Trump tried to distance himself from during the campaign. In that chapter Carr talks about promoting free speech, \"reining in big tech,\" and promoting national security. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Kight:  I mean, what we see over and over again with these picks that have been coming very quickly is that Trump is finding people who really agree with exactly his kind of -- kind of tear it all down mentality when it comes to the federal government. The same is true for the FCC. We know that Trump has been very critical of the media for a long time -- from the very beginning. And this has been a big issue for conservatives -- for people who are in kind of that MAGA universe who feel like big tech is using algorithms or other means of restricting conservative voices. It's something that House Republicans have been investigating over the past few years. And so he found someone who really does agree with a lot of those things. It's someone who has been very critical of the Biden administration. It's someone who has defended Elon Musk, who many people view as kind of the victim of media or big tech trying to silence him despite him now owning X. And so it makes sense in one sense. He's very much a Trump pick. He's someone who is going to say the same kinds of things Trump says at his rallies and publicly, and he's someone who really does talk about making big changes.",

And some Democrats spoke to Axios saying that they just feel like she is still trying to be the Democratic leader in a way that is unhelpful when they feel like Hakeem Jeffries is now their leader and someone that they respect, and that that's building tension there.

Obviously, we know she's a nursing student -- or was a nursing student there in Georgia. And so the testimony so far has been from her roommates, which gave the indication that she did have this smartwatch and that they tracked it and noted that there was no movement on the smartwatch. They went to the scene themselves of the trail where they did the \"Find My App\" application, noting that they found an ear of the iPod which seemed to be hers there after reporting it to the police. Not only did the roommates testify to their activities and who she was and what she meant, but what they discovered, but also them getting police involved. And then we saw body-worn camera of the officer trying to perform lifesaving measures, being unsuccessful. And, of course, it's showing the body there. We're looking at the technology that you alluded to. And so far, it has seemed to indicate -- and, of course, in opening statements were heard the use of DNA. The DNA of the jacket of Mr. Ibarra that has the blood and hair of her. The fact that there were fingernail -- on her fingernails -- apparently underneath there was DNA of Mr. Ibarra. And so it's been very compelling and hard to listen to testimony with respect to the guilt or alleged guilt of Mr. Ibarra. And there will be more to come in terms of DNA, in terms of the medical examiner, and in terms of cause of death, the hits on the head. Wow, just tragic. The potential testimony about suffocation, et cetera. And so it seems to be compelling evidence as to his guilt but there's a ways to go at this point.",

So while Trump could come in and turn off the use of the Army tactical missile, which is what's being considered right now, he can't tell Britain and France to roll back their policies. So the result hopefully will be that Ukraine will be able to hold on to Kursk so when they get to the negotiating table -- that Trump has pledged these negotiations -- that they'll say OK, we'll trade you this for parts of the Donbas or even parts of Crimea that you've seized.
