      "sentences": "Well, the fact that the Supreme Court here really rejected wholeheartedly that broad theory that people said would have potentially upended the way that elections are run.The chief justice here, writing for the 6-3 majority, came in to say that, no, state legislatures do not have the final say when it comes to how elections in their state should be run, that state courts have the authority to step in and potentially overrule some of the laws or rules that partisan state legislatures might put into effect. Chief Justice John Roberts looked to history and said that courts throughout history have always been the arbiters as to what falls in line with state or federal constitutions. Conservatives, many of whom backed Donald Trump in the 2020 election, had been pushing this theory that, because the Election Clause of the Constitution says that legislatures should be the ones to prescribe the time, place and manner of elections, they interpreted that to mean that legislatures had the final say when it comes to how elections are run and even how voting maps are drawn. But, today, the Supreme Court rejecting that, and the Supreme Court notably stepping in here, when many people wondered if they would, in fact, actually rule on the merits of this case, because the North Carolina State Supreme Court had heard this case, actually, again, as the Supreme Court was considering it, but the Supreme Court essentially saying here that they had to step in here because of the 2024 election looming. And if this question was sort of still up in the air, it could have really led to a real power struggle between state legislatures and state courts. But now we know, moving into the next election, that state courts can step in to maybe overrule some of the things that state legislatures put into effect. Importantly, though, this opinion did say that state courts might have some bounds, and that would potentially lead to further litigation. So we could still have litigation in this realm. I will note, guys, that there were three dissents led by Justice Clarence Thomas. They basically said that the court shouldn't have even gone to the merits on this case. They should have just rendered it moot, since it was heard again by the North Carolina State Supreme Court. But there was a very interesting quote from Justice Clarence Thomas, saying that, basically, the majority in this case was opening -- quote -- \"a new field for Bush-style controversies over state election law and a far more uncertain one,\" of course, alluding to the 2000 case Bush v. Gore, when the state recount in Florida was stopped, essentially handing the election to George W. Bush. So, like I said, this might not be the end of the litigation on this topic, but, for now, the U.S. Supreme Court really clamping down on this idea that state courts can't weigh in on decisions made by state legislatures when it comes to federal elections, guys.",

But when you listen to that tape, I mean, he says things like, \"I will show you an example, and these are the papers.\" And you hear these papers rustling around.

So, Jack Smith is pretty confident he can get this in. I think it goes to Trump's state of mind. In other words, one of the significant elements of proof that Jack Smith has here is, he's got to prove that Trump understood that what he was doing was wrongful, was unlawful. And, realistically, I think it's sort of a win-win for him. If -- the only way I would see this not being admissible is, essentially, if Trump never tries to make an argument that he didn't understand the classification rules or wasn't -- he abandons his declassification defense, that sort of thing.",
