And in one of those regions Kherson, Russian installed leaders have now accelerated the relocation of 60,000 people on Wednesday. Putin has also ordered increased security across the so-called annexed regions as well. Also Russia, especially in provinces in neighboring Ukraine. And here's what the U.S. president had to say.

What's so striking is if you just look at all the candidates that ran in this latest leadership race, seven out of eight of them were in the cabinet up until the early -- the resignations earlier this week, and the only person who wasn't there and out of those eight was Rishi Sunak, who of course, had a very different way of approaching the fiscal situation was ultimately rejected because of the way that he stepped away from the Boris Johnson government. And there are so many factions here now within the Conservative Party, and this Brexit party that promised people that this was the new global Britain that would be the envy of the world now looks increasingly like a party that is out of touch and does not really have policies that can solve the problems of the 21st century, John.",

And you could say irony, although at the end of the day, it was so obvious what the letter was really getting at and how it was making very specific allusions to statements made by the Prime Minister Truss, about responsibility, credibility, and so on, that the message was not really lost on anybody. And I think ultimately, at this moment, more resignations will come and really Truss will survive as long as the Conservative Party as long as it takes them to figure out whether or not they can find a new leader, or whether they will ultimately have to give up power and go to a general election.

And one of the things that I think is just part of human nature is, if you've got governors in those areas who respond directly to Putin, directly to the Kremlin, you of course, have generals that report fairly directly to the -- to the Kremlin and to Putin himself. We have information that Putin himself was calling up and directing military operations. And I think this, in part, is just a desire on the Kremlin's part to try to make sure everybody knows who's in charge in those Russian areas that surround Ukraine. And the answer is, it's the military. It shows that they're very concerned, I think, about sabotage operations, paramilitary operations on the part of the Ukrainians into Russia, behind Russian lines. And for that reason, I think, among several others perhaps, is why martial law or martial law light, one stage before that, has been declared in those areas.",

So I think it's a desire to have a better logistics train, a better communication command and control. And again, there are two reasons for that. The first is the logistics have been such a horrible part of this war for the Russians. The Ukrainians have been so good at disrupting the logistics. They weren't great anyway, but the Ukrainians have had significant success. And then again, the other thing is simply firm command and control, to make sure that the Kremlin, when it wants something done, there's not a governor fighting with the military commander, fighting with, you know, one of these self-proclaimed, you know, fighters that are fighting inside of Ukraine. So it's an effort, I think, to streamline that and, hopefully, make the whole war effort more efficient and better.",

One of them reads, \"Say no to COVID test, yes to food, no to lockdown, yes to freedom.\" The other banner reads, \"Remove dictator and national traitor, Xi Jinping.\" People involved in the demonstration could be jailed or even worse. Chinese draconian zero-COVID policies have descended millions of lives into chaos. Fights with COVID enforcers; screens for freedom from locked apartments; protests for food and supplies. During the snap lockdown in an airport in Southern China, security even held guns near travelers. Entire cities are still being locked down over a handful of COVID cases.

The pandemic is also Beijing's perfect chance to upgrade its surveillance technologies, including mandatory smartphone health apps that track the daily movements of virtually all 1.4 billion people. Yet many in China have adapted to the new normal, with regular COVID test and rolling lockdowns. But back in New York, this Chinese artist is doing what he can to remind the world that, while they've moved on from COVID, millions in China are still suffering under the weight of lockdowns and repression.
