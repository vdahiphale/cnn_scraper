And during that time, she at one point wanted to do a line-by-line reading of the public disclosures that had been made so far by the special counsel's office on how much money they spend for the work that they're doing. That prompted the Justice Department attorney to tell her that they are fully committed to continuing to fund special counsel Jack Smith to pursue this prosecution to its very end. And Judge Cannon then asked more questions, even harsher questions, about how under the law the special counsel's office is able to operate legally, something that she's been grappling with now over the course of two days in these hearings, at times getting a little bit quippy with some of the prosecutor's answers, telling him not to cut her off. But at the same time, on the other end, Donald Trump's lawyers, they are really swinging for the fences on trying to get politics into this proceeding. They are making legal arguments. They made them extensively today. But, also, they keep asking Judge Cannon for more oversight, more hearings. And then, twice, Emil Bove, the defense attorney for Donald Trump, said that there are extraordinary things with the special counsel's office that could be curbed if there was more congressional oversight there and then previewed a little bit of the hearing that's about to take place in a couple hours before Judge Cannon over limiting Donald Trump's speech, also called that an extraordinary effort by the prosecutors at the Justice Department to limit Donald Trump's speech with this upcoming debate and on the campaign trail -- back to you.",

And then, when a different Joe Biden, an incredibly animated Joe Biden, showed up, they pivoted and said, oh, Biden must be on something. He obviously -- this is not the Joe Biden that we have prepared people for. They will have an explanation for any kind of debate Biden has. If Biden has a good debate -- and Biden -- listen, Biden's been a good debater over the years. If he has a good debate, they will come up with some excuses to why that worked for Biden that's not having to do with anything that bears any resemblance to reality. So I don't really think they should worry about setting expectations, because, regardless of what happens, they will have some crazy cockamamie theory for why Biden showed up and performed better than they have expected Biden to show up and prepare.",

These guys are so well-defined, but are you plausible for the next four years? Because of his age and because of what people have observed, the polling shows that the American people don't think Biden is plausible for the next four years. And because of the way he left office, a lot of people don't think Trump is plausible for the next four years. So coming out of a debate like this, you're trying to drive, who is the most plausible person who can hold the office for four years? If I were either of them, that's what I'd be driving for.

I mean, you want to get the biggest percentage of the 90 minutes over the target of your issues. And so if Trump can steer it to inflation and immigration for most of the time, that's a success. And if Biden can steer it to, say, abortion and January the 6th and whatever, that's a success for him. I mean, obviously, they're running on such different issue sets, their ability in the moment on stage to pivot and try to get back to the issues that work for them, we will see who's the most skillful debater.

And it comes just on the heels of Prime Minister Netanyahu saying over the weekend that the current phase of the conflict ongoing in Rafah against Hamas and Rafah is coming to a close. And so what he said is that they're going to continue, the Israelis are going to continue -- quote -- \"mowing the grass\" in Gaza. But they're going to shift their operations to the north. So this is an opportunity for U.S. officials to get further clarity on what mowing the grass in Gaza continues to look like, as there are continued issues with getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza, because one of the reasons, of course, being the continued Israeli military operations ongoing there. And, of course, they will focus in on those questions as to what the Israelis are planning in the north. We know that U.S. officials have not explicitly told Israel that they are completely opposed to operations against Hezbollah. But they have warned them that this could turn into an all-out conflict quite quickly. And that is the U.S. concern right now. They want to de-escalate things and their concern about it going in the opposite direction. I also think that we should expect there to be conversations about weapons sales between the U.S. and Israel, as Netanyahu has complained in recent days repeatedly that those weapons from the U.S. and Israel have slowed to a trickle.

He also spoke about the hostage deal, the cease-fire deal that's on the table at the moment that President Biden has very publicly endorsed.

But he also said at the same time that, once that cease-fire is over, he had every intention of going back into Gaza to try and eliminate Hamas. He said he is not ready to give up on that ambition. Now, this did provoke fury among the hostage families, saying that it is not good enough to say only some of the hostages will come back, that he has broken his contract with the people of Israel. We also heard from Hamas saying that it shows that he is rejecting the deal on the table that President Biden has endorsed. Now, since that, he has tried to walk back his comments somewhat, saying that he is still committed to the Israeli deal that President Biden is standing behind, also saying that Israel will not leave Gaza until all 120 hostages are brought back, the living and the dead.

There's another video where you can see people who have blood on their faces and their mouths. You see another video where you see someone throwing an egg at one of the protesters. You see it right there on your screen. It happens quickly. But, again, it's just all of these fights that broke out and that people are right now calling out, leaders here in L.A. You mentioned the president, the governor of California, all of them saying this is unacceptable, Mayor Karen Bass saying that she's calling for additional patrols in the area and around houses of worship, so just people denouncing this and calling it out and saying how horrific this is and how it does not belong here in Los Angeles and really anywhere, especially not outside of a synagogue -- guys.",
