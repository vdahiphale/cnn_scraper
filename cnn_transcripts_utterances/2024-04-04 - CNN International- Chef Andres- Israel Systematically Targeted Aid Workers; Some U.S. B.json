If you're just joining us, here are some of our top stories today.Rescue teams in Taiwan are searching for more survivors a day after the island was hit by its strongest earthquake in a quarter of a century. Officials say the quake killed at least nine people and injured more than 1,000. More than 100 people remain trapped and dozens are missing or unaccounted for. World Central Kitchen says its operations in Gaza remain closed for now, and it's not yet decided when it'll resume its vital work. The group immediately suspended its mission there after the deadly Israeli strike killed seven aid workers. Joe Biden is expected to speak by phone today with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One official described the U.S. president as angry and increasingly frustrated and fully prepared to make that known after the deadly Israeli strike. The World Central Kitchen's founder, Chef Jose Andre, is lashing out over the incident, accusing Israel of systemically and deliberately targeting the aid workers. CNN's Brian Todd has that story.

Brawner Builders says it's created a GoFundMe account for outside donations which will go to family members. The company also says it's providing them with financial and emotional support and counselling. Meanwhile, the city says it's setting aside $1 million in wage subsidies for workers whose jobs could be on the line because of the collapse. It shut down the port of Baltimore, affecting about 8,000 local jobs. The city hopes the money will help companies keep those workers on the payroll. But a CNN investigation has found a number of other U.S. bridges could be at risk of collapsing if they're hit by large cargo ships. That's what caused the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore to crumble last week. As CNN's Pete Muntean reports, one of those vulnerable bridges is just downstream from there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the center of the shipping channel that would have been used by the MV Dali. And soaring above is the four-mile-long Chesapeake Bay Bridge between Annapolis and Ken Island.

That's why we're seeing so many people scrambling to try to find the best weather and get in position to see this on Monday.There are a few other things that make this eclipse really unique, and the first is the length of time for totality. That's the moment when the moon completely blocks out the sun, and that's when day will literally turn to night, so dark that the stars come out, nocturnal animals come out. That is how dark it gets. And so that moment of totality for this eclipse is much longer than it was in previous eclipses. At the longest point, it'll be about four minutes and 30 seconds. So that's a good amount of time to really get to soak in the power of nature and our solar system. Another really unique thing about this eclipse is the fact that it just happens to coincide with the period of peak activity on the surface of the sun, so during that moment of totality, things like solar flares or coronal mass ejections are much more likely than in previous eclipses and could just make for some really cool viewing. But of course, with any eclipse, but this one in particular, the weather is always a factor, and unfortunately, it's not looking like it's going to cooperate in large parts of the United States along this path of totality. Texas and Arkansas, really the weather not looking great there, but places like southern Missouri and Indianapolis and upstate New York and New England, the weather's looking pretty good there. So as always before an eclipse, the eclipse chasers, the diehards are trying to find that best weather viewing condition so that they can see this eclipse, because again, if you don't see this one, it's going to be 20 years before you get to see something like this if you live in the United States.
