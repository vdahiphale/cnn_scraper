So I basically converted this, basically the final generic balance to the estimated GOP seats won. And this is based on a model since 1946. And basically what we expect is that the range that we've been in, generally suggests that Republicans will get north of the 218 seats that they need for a majority, anywhere from basically 226 seats to 236 seats. That's the middle estimate, so obviously there's a margin of error associated with this.

And what do we see. We that in Arizona they have a lead. In Pennsylvania they have a lead of four points. Georgia right now is the 50th seat. Raphael Warnock is up three points. But that is within of the margin of error.And the other thing, I saw an interesting discussion on Twitter which I think illuminates a certain point. Although the Democrats are in the lead in these three seats right, there's basically, probabilistically, this is actually much closer to a about 50-50 chance, because some of these races may go one way and others of them may go the other, especially given the different parts of the country they're in. There may be a poling error in the southwest that works for the Republicans advantage. There may be a polling error in the northeast that works to the Democrats advantage.

So it's not entirely clear what martial law will mean.Typically, of course, it means that the army will take control, that the civilians have no say, and we're already seeing an element or a vestige of that in Kherson in the south of the country where today Russian authorities controlling that Ukrainian town sent text messages to all the Ukrainian citizens living there, telling them that they needed to evacuate the town. It could be what Putin is announcing will be a legal enforcement of those sorts of evacuations, which, of course, potentially puts Ukrainian citizens in the position of being shipped out to mainland Russia and against their will.

Your reaction to this announcement from Vladimir Putin. And I do want to note, it includes the area of Kherson, where Russia today announced evacuations from a city that they acknowledged they're losing control over, yet at the same time, this political statement where Putin says he's declaring martial law. DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: You know, John, it's part of Putin's increasing desperation. It's also part of the whole strange nature of this law where he doubles of this war, where he doubles down on areas that he is increasingly not in control of. If you think about the escalation ladder that we're -- we've been looking at here right now, first, he declares a mobilization. Maybe they've got 300,000 people flowing. They certainly have numbers approaching that fleeing the country. Then he's evacuating troops out of this area he can't hold, but declaring martial law in that region. And this is why so many in the administration are worried about the steady progress toward a possible nuclear detonation because he's running out of conventional options.",
