A recent FOX poll found Trump leading Biden by eight points in Georgia. The same poll shows nearly one in four black voters in Georgia prefer Trump over Biden.

Listen, it's still early in the election season. And I can tell you, as somebody whose name has been on the ballot five times in three years, I know a little something about Georgia voters. And I think that, as we move through this election and it becomes clearer to people that we have a binary choice, the contrast couldn't be more stark between -- about who's ready to serve in the White House.

Biden brought up that failed bipartisan border deal during his State of the Union.He joins us now, one of the authors of the deal, Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. So, viewers could see you saying, \"That's true,\" as the president talked about the different hires that would have been possible without legislation. What were you thinking in that moment? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  Yes, it was interesting. And I was listening to the president, obviously, as he was walking through it, and I could hear some of my colleagues around me saying, \"None of that is true,\" and I was actually listening to the president and said, no, that part is actually true. It would have hired all of those additional agents. It would have expedited the process. It would have also changed the asylum standard, so we can go through much faster. The only way to be able to solve this problem right now legally is to be able to change the asylum standard and to be able to have much faster hearings. The problem is, the president also left out some of the things that he could do right now he's choosing not to do. He has a very open parole system, that literally thousands of people a day are coming across and being rapidly paroled. He is not actually doing what's called first -- the last in, first up for hearings to be able to deter people from coming across by having faster hearings in the process. So there are multiple executive actions for whatever reason the president is choosing not to do. But there's also legal authorities that need to be done as well.",

Did you have any compunctions about it? LANKFORD:  Yes, it is frustrating because there's so much misinformation that came out. But supporting Donald Trump against Joe Biden at this point, seeing the two sets of policies, could not be more stark, where we have the highest number of illegal crossings, under President -- under President Trump was less than a million. We're now pushing three million with President Biden. To see the way that President Trump enforced the border and worked on national security versus how President Biden, under the exact same set of laws, is actually doing that, there's just no contest between the two of which one's more focused on national security issues, which one's more focused on actually securing the border. So that -- there's no contest between the two. Obviously, President Trump is running for president right now. He wants this to be able to stay a major focus during the course of the rest of the year so people can see the stark contrast of that. My focus is and the reason I'm continuing to be able to work on a bill in legislation right now is, no matter who is president this year, next year or 10 years from now, we do have gaps in our asylum law that need to be fixed. So, no matter who is president, that can actually be resolved and we can have a faster resolution to be able to secure the nation.",

I actually personally know people that are in the process of adopting fertilized eggs that are currently being frozen, that they that they as a family can't have children, so they're literally adopting someone else's fertilized eggs that are not going to be used, so that that child can actually come into life. For those of us that are passionate about life, we're passionate about every single life in the process, and we want to be able to have those children actually come into life and to be able to enjoy life like everyone else can. So this is a life issue. It's a great conversation for us to be able to have as a country, but I don't know of any state of anywhere, including Alabama, that immediately stepped in and said what happened in those IVF clinics was an overreaction. So they wanted to be able to fix that liability issue, where they're back to actually having that ongoing process again in Alabama, as they have in multiple other states, including my own. So this issue is a life issue for us, to be able to talk about, when is a life a life? And I think it's a good conversation. Quite frankly, I think it's a wise conversation to be able to talk about, let's value every single life. I don't think some children are valuable and some children are disposable.

And the president had an opportunity to keep in place President Trump's policies, and he chose not to. And now he's blaming the Senate and Congress about a bill. Listen, it's all rhetoric. He has the -- as Obama had done, had a phone and a pen to actually resolve these issues immediately, and he should have done it before. By the time his administration's over, we have 10 million now. We could have 15 to 20 people here illegally. They are illegals. And it's -- just walk through D.C. Go to any city and see what's happening where minorities in Boston, in Roxbury, are being displaced from people who are here illegally. And it's wrong.
