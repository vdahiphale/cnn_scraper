We are down 730, and the NASDAQ is also down. The big board is down. They are all down, and its largely to do with inflationary numbers, which we'll get to in just a second. But that's the market and what you and I are going to be talking about, signs of stubborn inflation dampen hope as an interest rate cut is coming soon, that's why the market is lower. US authorities are reportedly going to drop the guidance people need to isolate for five days after testing positive for COVID. And those Super Bowl ratings reaching into history, it is one large broadcast since the man landed on the moon. All will be explained. Live from Dubai on Tuesday, February the 13th. I'm Richard Quest, in the UAE, as in London or New York, or indeed wherever you might be, I mean business. Good evening to you. Markets in the United States are having their worst day in nearly a year, and it was because of that hot inflation report. The Dow off over 700 -- nearly 730 points. Its sharpest loss since March last year. And look at the number, consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in the 12 months at the end of January, that was higher than had been expected, and there is just one more headline inflation report before the next Fed meeting. The February CPI Index will be released on march the 12th, and the Fed will then meet the following week. The chair of the Fed, Jerome Powell, has strongly suggested that in March if things don't really change, it will hold rates steady. The next decision after that goes until May. And again and again, Chair Powell has said, the FOMC needs to see evidence, more evidence that inflation is moving steadily downwards before changing rates, and despite that caution, the markets have been on a tear. They simply don't believe it is true. The major US averages are all at or near all-time highs before today's losses and investors have been hoping the Fed would cut rates in the near. Now, it looks like they might have to last or wait just that little bit longer. Kristina Hooper is the chief global market strategist at Invesco. She is with me. Now, when you and I speak, I try desperately not to make one swallow into a summer over phrases or one magpie into a winter, but if you take this number, it is pretty clear, the Fed couldn't cut in March.",

In addition to that, the issue of immigration has really driven the attacks that have gone on air, particularly against the Democratic candidate, and New York, of course, has been dealing with this surge in migrants, given the number of migrants have been shipped and have been bused essentially to New York.

It is back down below 5,000 and the Nasdaq is bearing the brunt of the day. It's off more than 2 percent. Today's inflation data clearly dampening hopes of a rate cut in Europe in the near future. The CDC could soon make a huge change to COVID isolation recommendations in the United States, expecting to update its guidance to allow infected people to return to work or school if their symptoms are mild and if they'd been fever free for 24 hours. This is according to a report in the \"Washington Post.\" Oregon have already broken with the CDC guidelines. People who test positive there are no longer expected to isolate for a set period and those without symptoms don't have to isolate at all. Dr. Saad Omer is epidemiologist, former director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. He joins me from Dallas, Texas. Doctor, good to see you, sir. Do these new regulations or potential regulations, do they make the sort of common sense that we're all doing anyway? DR. SAAD OMER, EPIDEMIOLOGIST: I think it's reasonable to align these guidelines with the other respiratory viruses and to modify them given the fact that the immunity, both through vaccination and through infection is all around us. Obviously, COVID remains a significant public health problem. But because of the immunity landscape and because of the fact that it will be easier to implement these guidelines and to follow these guidelines if they are aligned with other respiratory viruses, I think this change does make sense.",

Having said that, I think it is also reasonable when the final official guidelines come out. They should give flexibility to specific organizations. For example, health care facilities might want to focus a little bit more on more, if you will, stricter the practices. Places where there's a high frequency of high-risk individuals, such as the elderly, might want to still be a little bit more conservative than these guidelines are likely to allow. So I think it has to be nuanced. It has to be part of our culture. But I think they're taking the Goldilocks approach, not too hot, not too cold, or, you know, in other countries it's called the Red Riding Hood approach. But in any case, you know, this does make sense with a few nuances that are important.",

For example, immunization coverage for boosters isunacceptably low even in countries where there is a lot of vaccines. In fact, there's no global shortage of vaccines and the capacity is there. The vaccines are available and still in countries like the U.S. and other countries, many other countries, the coverage is very low, unacceptably low, even in high-risk group -- and even in high-risk groups. In addition to that, there are ton of passive measures for which there are resources available. There is technology available such as increasing the quality of ventilation and federation in buildings. Businesses should make it a part of planning. There's space, you know, for work and all of that, and we are not taking advantage of these passive tools that can make a dent.",
