Some people entered the labor market looking for work.The unemployment rate, if you look at the long chart here, it was revised actually, November to be 3.6 percent. So you can see that long decline in the unemployment rate. Those are jobs added. So you can see jobs added, that is the weakest in a couple of years. And that's what Wall Street wants to see. They want to see a job market that is solid but not spinning off inflation. When I look over there at some of the sectors here, leisure and hospitality, health care, construction, 28,000, manufacturing, 8,000 jobs added there. You're still seeing widespread hiring in the country outside of tech and in some cases media. But in other parts of the economy, you're still seeing some strength here.

So, wages came in at 0.3 percent monthly. That's a little bit lower than expectations on a yearly level. That also came in lighter than expectations. The concern for people who are and thinking, well, why are wages going up a bad thing?
