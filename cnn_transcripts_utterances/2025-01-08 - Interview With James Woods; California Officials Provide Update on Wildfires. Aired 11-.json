If you can stay home and work from there, I would recommend that. We will continue to support our partners in the fire service and our other law enforcement partners. But to all in the public who are watching this, a sincere thank you to all of you for your cooperation and your patience as we all get through this together. Thank you.",

As my partners up here have said before, we're facing a historic natural disaster. And I think that can't be stated strong enough. This is not a normal red flag. We have been in partnership with the National Weather Service for days prior to the arrival of this severe windstorm. There's been amazing communication by the National Weather Service, and they should be acknowledged for all of the communication that was put out days in advance. What's critical about that is, it partnered all of our public safety and emergency organizations throughout the county to begin preparations for this. And a lot of the successes we saw over the last 18 to 20 hours is a direct result of painstaking preparations that had gone into place for the last 48 to 72 hours. We saw the long road ahead of us. Our county is known with wildland fires. We just finished working on the Franklin Fire. We have had the Bridge Fire, the Post Fire. This has been a very destructive fire season. This is just going to add to it. Our eyes are on mitigating the impacts from this emergency, working with our community partners, and then charting the course for what will be a long recovery effort. With that, I would like to introduce our Department of Public Works for L.A. County Director, Mark Pestrella.",

We're coordinating across the area with all our partner agencies, including, of course, primarily the city of Los Angeles, in addressing this event today. I'm going to talk a little bit about what our focus is in terms of infrastructure, and then I will move on. Before I do that, though, I do want to acknowledge all of the residents that have either lost a home or who are being evacuated. I do personally understand what that is about, and understand what kind of fear that can put into you. One thing I would recommend to you before you leave that home, if you want something to do, is to close that home up tight, close any openings completely tight to the home, and make sure that access is open to the fire department.",

In L.A. County, there are four fires, and the winds are making their jobs so difficult, winds up to 100 miles per hour, all aircraft grounded due to the high winds there. You see on this map where the fires are for the Palisades Fire, no reported fatalities there, but we heard from officials saying that there were a high number of significant injuries from people who did not evacuate. In the Eaton Fire near Pasadena, two dead there, officials say, and they emphasize people need to evacuate. They are absolutely not out of danger at this hour. It is a very dynamic situation. One of the people who did evacuate yesterday is actor James Woods, who is in Beverly Hills. Thank you for joining us. Talk to us. What have you seen? (CROSSTALK)",

So I finally got through to 911 and said, welfare check, you got to go check on this guy. Well, there was a miscommunication. And I called my neighbor who hadn't evacuated yet. He was fight -- on his roof fighting his fire. He'd been on my roof. He knows my roof now. I said, go in and check on me. He went. He said: \"The door's open. There's nobody here.\" He went in and yelled. He said, \"No, nobody here.\" I said, look, just go behind the pantry. There's a little room. We can see him during the day. He likes to sit there because there's a garden. He went in and found him. He'd been left alone, OK? And it turned out the fire department made the new caregiver leave. And she just does what she was told. They said, we're coming back for him. Well, they hadn't come back from him. I'm hoping that they would have, but there was so much chaos. It was like an inferno. Every house was on fire around us. And he got him out and the house burned down about an hour later. He would have been in there alone. It was just -- and then Robert called us and told us that that house had gone and the house below that and the house on the other side. And then at 11:49 last night, all the smoke alarms in our house alerted our phones at our house that we had just renovated for three years and had just finally moved into about three months ago, all the smoke alarms are going off. So, that's hardly -- hardly a good sign, so I'm not sure, but it wouldn't make any difference, because the whole street has burned down. So I mean, even if you go back to your home -- look, I -- we knew what was coming. And when we were out on our driveway, I looked at -- the smoke was so black. The house across street was on fire. The house next door was on fire. And all the black smoke was down there, and the schools are down there. And I said to Sarah, we can't go down there because they're trying to evacuate the schools and we will just be in the way. And here's the thing that's so important. People have got to evacuate when they tell you to evacuate, because, if you don't evacuate and you think you're going to be out there with your little garden hose stopping a conflagration with flames 80 feet high in 90 mile-an-hour winds, you're not going to be helping. You're just going to be stopping the firefighters, who do such an amazing job. And you have got to be out of the way, man. You have just got to get out of the way and let them do their jobs. And, yes, maybe your home is going to burn down. But let me tell you what's more important than your home is your 94-year-old neighbor and your fellow across the street who is trying to help you and all the friends and family who've been calling all day. And, yes, we're safe. And, yes, I think everybody on our street survived, although I can't get ahold of Robert. And I called a friend of mine who lived in Malibu -- Mandeville Canyon -- or she had called me. \"Are you OK?\" And I said: \"Yes. You have got to get out of there, girl. So we're miles from you,\" I said, \"but we're packed. We're ready because people living in fire zones are ready.\" You have got to be ready to go. And as ready as we were, everything I own is in this room. Every single thing that I own is in this room. We have got a basket of laundry, glasses, pills and the keys to our car. And that's it.",
