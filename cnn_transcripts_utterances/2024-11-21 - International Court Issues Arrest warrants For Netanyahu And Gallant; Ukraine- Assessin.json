Starvation as a method of warfare. We're going to run down the ICC's case against Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister. Also ahead, aerial escalation. Why Ukraine suspects Russia hit them with an ICBM for the first time. And later, you might know her face, but you definitely know her voice. The end of an era for the Simpsons. All right. Live from New York, I'm Omar Jimenez. Zain and Bianna are off today. You're watching ONE WORLD. We begin with significant developments in the Middle East. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Now, it's accusing them of war crimes in Gaza, including, quote, starvation as a method of warfare. Now, a warrant was also issued for a top Hamas commander known as Mohammed Deif, who is believed to have been killed in an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office dismissed the warrants as, quote, absurd and anti-Semitic. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now live from Jerusalem. So, Nic, let's just start with the basics here. How significant is this move by the ICC? What does it mean practically?",

Now, meanwhile, Russia appears to be upping the stakes in its war on Ukraine. Ukraine's military says it is now assessing whether Russia fired an intercontinental ballistic missile during a morning attack on Dnipro. Now, this video shared widely. We're going to show it to you here, shared widely on social media. You see the flashes there, appear to show the moment of impact. We haven't been able to geo-locate it just yet, but it appears consistent with other footage that has emerged since the strike. The Ukrainian emergency service also shared these photos of firefighters battling a blaze following the air attack. Ukraine says the weapon had the characteristics of an ICBM. One Western official says, though, it was ballistic, but not an ICBM. The Kremlin isn't commenting. Following the attack, the Ukrainian president had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A Western official speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Southeast Asia has hinted that this may not have been an intercontinental ballistic missile, just a ballistic missile. There's semantics here, the capability, the range, how long it actually ended up being fired. Ultimately though, I think what appears to have happened here is Russia has used a new type of missile in this particular attack. Their bid, as I say, of showing that there's more in their arsenal than they've used yet. I should point out this obviously had a conventional payload upon it, but much of the arsenal it might be reaching towards are delivery devices that may also contain or may be designed to transport nuclear warheads. No suggestion that's the case, but that's sort of the subtext potentially of them reaching into ballistic missiles of this particular nature. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so if Russia had used an ICBM, many would say, well, that's a signal that it's hinting that it could be prepared to use nuclear weapons. In this instance, it hasn't used an ICBM. I think the consensus view is that it's used either some sort of intermediate range ballistic missile called an RS-26 or as your report was saying, the Pentagon is now saying some sort of experimental medium range ballistic missile. Once again, both of these types of missiles can carry nuclear weapons, but on this particular instance, they were carrying some sort of conventional weapon.

At least the defense secretary of the United States confirmed. That's after the U.S. gave Ukraine permission to fire long range or longer range U.S. missiles at targets in Russia.

So today's events with the launch of that missile that everyone thought might be an ICBM, but maybe it's not an ICBM, has probably compounded that fear, that risk of escalation. And I think that this is a problem that the Biden administration has allowed itself to be deterred by Russia through Russia's use of nuclear saber-rattling, through use of Russia's threats of -- through use of nuclear weapons. It hasn't deterred Russia. It's been deterred by Russia. So this is a real challenge for the Biden administration.",

And the woman's account she's referred to as Jane Doe throughout the police reports she says, Hegseth was giving off a creeper vibe during the conference that they were attending. She said she ended up in a strange hotel room. And when she was there, Hegseth took her phone from her hands. He blocked the door with his body. And she said she remembered saying no a lot. But there was a lot that she couldn't recall. She said at one point, you know, maybe someone slipped something into her drink. But there were other eyewitnesses police talked to who said she seemed sober. She seemed to have her faculties about her as the night went on. There were also competing accounts of what happened earlier in the evening when she encountered Hegseth at a hotel bar. There was one person who said that she showed up and sort of was an intermediary between a woman Hegseth was hitting on, who wasn't interested in him. And so she intervened. Another person said, though, she saw this woman, Jane Doe, and another person flirting with Hegseth. Now, eventually, a couple of days after the incident occurred in this hotel room, the woman, Jane Doe, decided she wanted to seek medical care. There was a rape kit. And the nurse was ultimately the one who reported this to authorities. Now, all of this is very different from the account that Pete Hegseth gave authorities. He said that these were two consenting adults having sexual intercourse. He described, he said, there was always conversation and always consensual conduct when the two of them were in the hotel room. He said he and Jane Doe discussed the fact that she was married and she said she would tell her husband she had just fallen asleep on a couch in someone else's room. And he said that she showed early signs of regret, although he didn't explain what those signs were. Now, his attorney is insisting that he did nothing wrong. Timothy Parlatore told CNN this police report confirms what I've said all along, that the incident was fully investigated. Police found the allegations to be false and this is why no charges were filed. Now, Hegseth is on the Hill today. He just told reporters essentially the same thing. This was investigated and he was cleared. We should know what we do and don't know from this police report, though. The police report doesn't say that this woman's allegations are false. And we're still missing evidence, including the surveillance video, including a memo from the DA's office that could shed light on why they ultimately decided not to pursue any charges in this case. Now, as for this woman, again, who we're referring to as Jane Doe, CNN caught up with her last week. She declined to comment when our team asked her about this incident.

Was it because they believed it was consensual as Pete alleges? I mean, there are some questions that we just frankly don't know. And so if you're a senator and you're looking at this, you're thinking, well, I mean, it's troublesome for sure, but you don't have enough details to really make a clear delineation whether or not you're going to believe Pete or you're going to believe the alleged victim.

There are some solid choices who I think would do a great job in their roles once confirmed by the Senate. But I do take the Senator's point. Look, I used to be an opposition researcher, Omar. And one of the first things that you would do as an opposition researcher when a client would hire the firm that I worked for at the time, you would create an oppo book on the client. You would make sure that the senator or the congressman or the governor didn't have any skeletons in their closet, if you will, that the team wasn't aware of, that they weren't hiding. And if you did discover something, then you would give that information to their team so that they could create a response effort in case said issues were to come up during their candidacy or maybe even after the fact. You just don't ever want to be caught off guard. And so at this point, from what I am hearing, they are beginning to do things a little differently. The team is doing their due diligence. They're looking into people's backgrounds. They're making sure that there isn't anything that could come out that could potentially embarrass the president-elect during these hearings before the various committees. Donald Trump, he believes he has a mandate. I would argue that he has a mandate. He won. He performed better this time around than 2020. And so you want to be able to go in once he's ultimately sworn in. Hitting day one hard, the first 90 days, focusing on the economy, focus on immigration. And you really don't want anything, if you're an advisor to the president-elect, to potentially diminish or damage his political capacity and political capital that he has going into his first couple of days in the White House.

Prosecutors have too much discretion, too much influence, too much power. And I think, regardless of your thoughts about Donald Trump, I think there is validity, writ large for the most part, Omar, to that critique of the problem, to that critique of DOJ in general. So I'm saying, Mr. President, let us find someone with perhaps some institutional experience and knowledge of the DOJ, maybe someone who knows where changes should actually be made. Maybe someone who understands if I'm going to make certain changes, maybe you can merge certain departments together. Maybe certain departments can be smaller. Maybe you are going to change the level of influence by giving decrees to certain divisions within DOJ because you want to minimize that access or that over access, I should say, of discretion that many would say that some of these federal prosecutors have. That would be my best advice to the president-elect in order to move or bring to fruition his critique of the problem, which again, I think a lot of Americans, regardless of their thoughts of him, will probably say, you know what, I think he has a fair point.

I think one, there was some quote from a source hearing audible cries of, oh, my God, echoing down the hallway inside DOJ headquarters in some cases. All that aside, you have a clean slate here for expecting a nomination to come forward. Do we have any sense sort of why DOJ employees were so shocked in some cases at the announcement of Matt Gaetz and whether some of those shocks may be essentially put to the side with the potential of a new nomination coming?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So one of the things that caused so many people in the legal community, in the Justice Department, in U.S. Attorney's Office to be, soshocked and in disbelief of Gaetz as a nominee, is that he has spent much of his time in Congress attacking that very department that Donald Trump was asking him to lead, being publicly in opposition to cases that were brought through grand juries, through the court system, cheering on the judge's dismissal of the Justice Department's work on the classified documents investigation into Donald Trump. Not saying publicly that he didn't believe January 6 was an insurrection when there are many, many people in that situation, in the Capitol riot, who were violent toward police, in that mob. And so this is somebody who had positioned themselves as so opposite to what the career officials, the career employees of the department are doing, the type of work they're doing every day in courts, that they want to maintain credibility. So they were shocked because this was not somebody that they viewed as being on the side of the department. And then on top of that, it just was a lot of disbelief given that he has never been a prosecutor before. You don't have to be a former prosecutor to become attorney general, but it sure helps to understand how that department does its work. A lot of which is not political in nature, it's about going before judges and arguing in courtrooms to enforce the federal law around the country.",

If you're just joining us, Matt Gaetz, the former Florida congressman and appointee for attorney general byPresident-elect Donald Trump, has announced he is withdrawing from consideration for the position. He just announced saying, I had excellent meetings with senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback and the incredible support of so many. It goes on to say that his confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the work of the Trump-Vance transition. And because of that he will be withdrawing his name from consideration to serve as attorney general. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on day one. He does also say he remains fully committed to see that Donald Trump is the most successful president in history. Joining me now is CNN political commentator and Republican strategist, Shermichael Singleton. You've been with us since we got this breaking news. And, you know, one of the things that you had talked about, you said you'd done work in opposition research before. You try to get ahead of these things. You try to find sort of, OK, what controversy might pop up? What might senators ask about in a confirmation process in this context as well? We have a new reporting that's from some of our colleagues that the woman who says she had sex when she was a minor with then-Rep. Matt Gaetz told the House Ethics Committee she had two sexual encounters with him at a party in 2017, according to sources familiar with her testimony. So as we sort of get these drip, drip, drip details from this alleged incident, I mean, what sort of conversations do you have if you're on a team that was responsible for oppo research or whatever, seeing this type of news drip out?",

And my hope is that they will have done or they're currently doing that thorough research and background check on each of these individuals. After the holidays, people will have moved on. They will be thinking about other things. So you have an opportunity to not have a complete reset, but somewhat of a reset with a new name. And again, if I'm looking at a new name to what we were talking about earlier before, I'm looking for someone with the institutional knowledge, with the legal experience, to change the agency in the way that the president-elect would like to see it occur. You can still move forward with his agenda, if you will, with a far more experienced individual who would receive the support of Republicans and maybe even receive some support from some Democrats, at least making it out of committee.",

He was doing very well, but at the same time did not want to be a distraction for the administration, for which he has much respect. Matt has a wonderful future and I look forward to watching all the great things he will do. So Trump's saying, OK, let's let him go. He don't want him to be a distraction. Gaetz posting that this was a needlessly protracted Washington's scuffle he was facing. And what you're seeing come together here in real time, Omar, is the balance of powers. The power of the Senate to look at nominations that even a president of their own party is putting forward and decide whether that is the correct person in these types of positions. There had been discussion before with the Senate, even if they didn't have the votes, just decide to recess and allow Trump to put these people in, those are conversations we were beginning to have from the moment, essentially, Matt Gaetz was acknowledged as Trump's pick for this job. But it certainly looks right now that there were Republican senators who just weren't going to be on board with Gaetz as attorney general, that he was on the Hill this week. And it just wasn't a nomination that even if Donald Trump desperately wanted him as his top pick for any cabinet position, it wasn't going to happen.",
