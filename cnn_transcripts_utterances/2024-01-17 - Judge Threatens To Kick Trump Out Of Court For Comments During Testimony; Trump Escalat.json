Jean Carroll, the woman he's already been found liable for sexually abusing took the stand.Also, tonight, Trump ally Roger Stone on tape, allegedly talking about assassinating two Democratic congressmen. We'll speak to one of them tonight. And later, my conversation with a former Gaza hostage who reveals that much of her captivity was spent locked with her husband and children and others in an exam room at a major hospital in Gaza. We begin with these words, \"I would love that.\" That's what the former president told Judge Lewis Kaplan today after the judge in his second defamation trial threatened to remove him from the courtroom, to which the judge replied, \"I know you would.\" An issue, his comments during plaintiff E. Jean Carroll's testimony. She took the stand today, telling jurors what it was like to endure the most powerful men in the free world, at the time, calling her a liar and denying what's now a matter of legal fact that he sexually abused her in a New York department store in the 1990s, a denial he repeated after court today.

And from there, that just kind of began his reaction to her testimony. A lot of it involved him leaning over to his lead Attorney Alina Habba, whispering to her, and making these statements. And that was not audible to us -- the reporters in the courtroom that were sitting behind him. But at one of the breaks, this is when Carroll's attorney brought it up saying that they could hear, sitting in front of Trump. And they were concerned the jury could hear some of the comments that he was saying, you know, including that this was fake, she's a con job, and it's a witch hunt.

Jean Carroll throughout this, repeatedly denying her efforts because she wasn't properly marking exhibits or didn't have them in the transcripts, you know, just following basic court procedures as a part of this.But I think the fact that Trump was in the room today also speaks to how he's viewing this, which is that it's important for him to be there because he did not attend the first trial. And after that multimillion-dollar verdict was awarded, we had the town hall with him the next day. And I asked him if he regretted not testifying. And he said, no, because my attorneys told me that I shouldn't be there. Today, he made clear that he does feel that he needs to be there, that his presence is warranted. I think there's a real question of, of course, you know, that behavior and the fact that the judge was threatening to be evict him from the room because he was speaking so loudly of how that's going to help him here, and if it is. But it is very clearly something he's using as part of the campaign trail. Tomorrow, he says he can't go. And they asked for a delay in the trial because of Melania Trump's wife's -- or Melania Trump's mom's funeral is tomorrow. He was kind of arguing that he couldn't go. But his presence, I should note, is not required. He does not have to be there. He didn't go to the first one.",

Let's look at habit and custom.When you put something that's vitriolic on many people's, you know, threads, they're going to get rid of it. So you can't make the argument that as a result of deleting it, for example, it didn't happen or it's fabricated or you're telling the jury something that just isn't so. Normal human behavior is if you see something that is so denigrating to you, you know, you want to remove it. And so, I think as a matter of credibility, it doesn't hurt her at all. But just to the general notion of how she felt as a result of this, how it impaired her, how it impacted her safety, how she talked about needing security, I mean, I think it's huge to the issue I addressed before, which is punitive damages.

It reads, quote, \"This disqualifies Haley from presidential or vice presidential candidacy under the 12th Amendment.\" Now, keeping them honest, Nikki Haley is the child of immigrants from India's Punjab province, was born in the small South Carolina town of Bamberg. That's in the United States. Nikki is her middle name, just as Mitt is Willard Mitt Romney's middle name, Robert was Julius Robert Oppenheimer's middle name. The difference, of course, is that although the names Willard or Julius might sound stiff or old-fashioned, they don't sound foreign like Nimarata does, at least to some which for now appears enough for the former president to latch on to.

They have threatened to continue to target U.S. assets as well as U.K. assets. It's those two countries that launched the first set of strikes on Thursday night. That was followed up by a U.S. follow-on action as U.S. Central Command put us on Friday. Yesterday, the U.S. struck a series of anti-ship ballistic missile launchers and then this, further strikes against Houthi capabilities in Yemen here. It is worth noting the context here. Twice this week, the Houthis have successfully targeted and struck a U.S.-owned and operated vessel in the Gulf of Aden. In both cases, it was minor damage and the ship continued on its way here.

I have details now from CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster in London.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): From her recent engagements, the Princess of Wales has looked well and been in good spirits. The first suggestion that she may have been unwell came on Wednesday when Kensington Palace announced she was in hospital, recovering from abdominal surgery. It was successful. And a source told CNN it wasn't cancer related. She would need to remain in hospital for up to two weeks though and up to three months, recuperating at home in Windsor. All engagements and travel are being put on hold as they have for Prince William, as he takes care of his family. Then news that King Charles would also be going to hospital next week with an enlarged prostate. We're told it's benign and it was announced on the same day because it meant he had to cancel a meeting with government ministers on Thursday in Scotland. In total, three out of four of the most senior British working royals out of action. No further updates expected until the princess leaves hospital or takes a turn for the worse. Kate is keen on fitness and enjoys playing sports, so she is expected to recover well. The palaces rarely release private medical details, which is why they haven't explained what the surgery was actually for. But she could have been spotted leaving the hospital and questions would have been asked why she was cancelling engagements. A source told CNN that the king took the view that sharing his condition would encourage other men to have their prostates checked. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
