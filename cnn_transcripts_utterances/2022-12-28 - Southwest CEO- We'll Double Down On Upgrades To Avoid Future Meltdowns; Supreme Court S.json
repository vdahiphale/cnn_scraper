In fact, they're working on preparing two vacant schools to become potential shelters, preparing for migrants that could be coming over the next few days, weeks, months.

First of all, she says that former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told people in meetings to keep some of the meetings off the books. Now that means, of course, keeping them off the official entries in the White House diary. That's a public record.Now, she can't recall specifically what kind of information that he might have been trying to conceal, but that is notable that he was making an effort to keep some of these meetings, again, off the books. Also, these allegations that he was allegedly burning documents. She testifies. She told the committee that she saw Meadows burn documents in his office fireplace around a dozen times about once or twice a week between December 2020 and mid-January 2021. I can tell you, I've been in Mark -- been in that office. I've seen the fireplace, never seen it actually burning. But she testified, quote, \"So throughout the day, he would put more logs on the fireplace to keep it burning throughout the day. And I recall roughly a dozen times where he would throw a few more pieces of paper in it when he would put more logs in the fireplace.\" She says at least twice. Those burnings came after meetings with GOP Representative Scott Perry, who's, of course, linked to efforts to use the Justice Department to try to overturn the election. And lastly, what I thought was interesting here were the interactions between her and her first attorney. This is someone who was Trump funded, funded by a group linked to the former president, Stefan Passantino. Very unusual interactions during her testimony where he sort of corrects her, interjects. There was some discrepancy about her recollection, about the former president's reaction to chance of hang Mike Pence. She eventually got another lawyer, Jody Hunt, a former top Trump Justice Department official. And when he came in, they had to correct some things that she said. So that's really notable because, again, this is someone who is funded by Trump, and it appears to be this pattern of trying to conceal what exactly was happening between the election and inauguration day.",

I can think of a lot of other words for it.But the question will be for the court whether or not the fact that a politician makes a speech and then some -- other group goes and wants to do some type of outrageous criminal conduct from it, ties it back, and whether or not the speech giver is actually the one responsible or is there some protection there? So, I worry that we may, because of the craziness that went on during the last administration, that we may overreact in what we do as far as criminal charges and that type of thing. That's why I think we need to be looking, and I hope the DOJ is looking for a very clean, very narrow case if they are in fact going to decide to charge Trump, and not something that says, well, he must have been the mastermind here, he must have known about it, he must have done this, he must have done that.

That's a pretty weak bridge to stand on there. Doesn't mean that we shouldn't have seen Trump's tax returns. It just means that the timing of it and the reasoning for it at this point becomes suspect and gives the Republicans, I think, a fairly decent argument that the move is political.
