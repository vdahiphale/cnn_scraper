We will also get reaction from a top Democrat, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, as calls grow once again for Congress to pass commonsense gun safety laws.And happening right now, RFK Jr. is on Capitol Hill one day after president-elect Donald Trump expressed skepticism about vaccine mandates in schools. I will speak to the president of the National Association of School Nurses. And, later, Argo is back. The explosives detection dog and his handler will join us as they gear up for a busy holiday season at a major airport. Hello, everyone. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. And new this morning, the police chief in Madison, Wisconsin, tells CNN he is seeking federal help in identifying the source of a gun used in the nation's latest school shooting just days before Christmas break. A teenage student opened fire at a small K-12 Christian school in Madison. A student and a teacher are dead. Six people were injured, including two students who are in critical condition this morning. Two others are stable. And adding to this horror, it was a second-grade student who had to make the call to 911. Police say the killer was a 15-year- old girl. She was a student at the school named Natalie Rupnow. She went by the name Samantha. Police say she shot herself and died. Well, today, children and adults at the school have to wrestle with what they witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADLER JEAN-CHARLES, SIXTH GRADER:  We heard them, and then some people started crying. And then we just waited until the police came. And then they exported us out to the church. I was scared. Why did they do that? Why?",

As far as her age, most school shootings are committed by students. But I also have to point out that there's a lot of misinformation there, misleading information about the risk, about the rate of school shootings. These are exceptionally rare. I know that CNN is reporting there's been 83 this year, but if you look through the cases, four of them occurred inside schools, the rest outside on the playground, on the ball field, not involving students. And of the four that were inside school, three of them were active shooter events, claiming eight lives, four students. Now, that's out of 50 million school students in this country. So our schools are safe. Parents shouldn't feel in the wake of their shooting that their kids are in constant danger. They're not. This is a rare event, tragic, though, it is.",

That is the threats that they're making, the suicidal statements that are not reported in standard see something, say something campaigns. But I do think that there would be a tendency to discount the fact that it might be coming from a female. Females don't do this. And the fact of the matter remains that what's more important are behavioral indicators, the fixations, the grievances, the weapons accessibility. I know they're trying to chase down where that gun came from. Almost all the time, it's coming from the home itself that they live in, where the guns are not being safely kept. And it's a huge issue of firearms in our country and the ready accessibility of people that should not have them. So firearms are the leading cause of death of our children. And there needs to be something done about it. But back to the point is that see something, say something campaigns work. And whether it's a female or a male, a 10-year-old or an 18-year-old, those kinds of warning signs need to be reported to people that take them seriously, investigate and do threat assessment, righteous threat assessment, to determine whether there really is cause for concern.",

They're out there. They're in this country. They're circulating.The bottom line is, the best way to prevent these shootings is to just look for the warning signs and try to make sure that someone who is at risk of doing something like this doesn't have access to those guns.

You will see, tomorrow, I'm going to come shoot up the school or they will talk about Columbine. There's a lot of references to other shooters sometimes.They may be talking about their love of guns. They may be talking about how they want to hurt themselves and others. It's usually very straightforward with the kinds of ominous statements that students will make. And it's not just what they will be saying to other people on campus, other students, but it's also what they're posting on their social media that needs to get-- gets-- to be attended to and reported as well. And I want to underscore point that Dr. Fox talked about earlier is that there are three types of offenders that pose a potential risk to a campus. One are outsiders that show up and do things. And we may not get as much warning sign about that kind of a person. Community-based warning signs, we might see. The second are employment-related offenders. Those are people that might be current or former employees or somebody that's in a relationship with one where D.V. is spilling on to the campus. And then the third type would be students and former students. So it's important to recognize that, if you have got a threat management, program, it needs to include looking at all those three potential threat sources and devising as a school, as a community, as law enforcement methods to intervene and interrupt those unfolding violence pathways, right?",

There is always the risk of availability bias, and it's important to talk about the statistics in the larger context.But, look, when you look at the numbers-- and I take your point. I just want to be specific with our viewers. This is what-- CNN's numbers. Of the 83 school shootings this year, 56 shootings have been reported on K-12 campuses, and 27 on university and college campuses. And I know your point, you're saying, some of these, the schools weren't actually the target. But you did talk about that there were some that have been averted, right, that some school shootings have-- they have been able to stop them before they happened. You're on the record also for being skeptical of the value of school drills for shootings, right? After the school shooting in Georgia back in September, you wrote this in \"The Dallas Morning News\": \"Do students really need to practice over and over again how to sit quietly in a corner of their classroom?\" You continued: \"In the process of trying to protect them through tight security and lockdown drills, we send the message that the bad guy is out to get them, that there is a target on their backs.\" James, I will say, a school official in this case credits those drills IN how her students responded yesterday.

We should low- key it. The faculty should be trained, along with the police. The students, for the most part, should listen up if something bad happens. We should take a lesson from the airlines. No one pays attention when they're given the instructions at the beginning of the flight, but we don't have drills on flights. We just know that the crew has been trained and we will listen up. So let's have low-key trainings. Kids can be told what to do. They can be tested on what to do, but having kids repeatedly sit in the corner quietly, it doesn't take a lot to learn that.",

What school nurses do is provide that information for parents who have what we call vaccine hesitancy. They may have misinformation about vaccines. They may have not heard all the benefits of vaccines or maybe are very fearful of side effects of vaccines. So, Gallup polls show that nurses are the most trusted profession. And school nurses are no exception. Parents trust schools and school nurses to provide health care in schools and provide vaccines. We, for example, facilitate school-located vaccine clinics. But school nurses shoulder a great deal of the work in informing parents, helping parents understand what vaccines do, the efficacy, the risks, and the safety of them.
