He focused more on the fact that the economy was doing well, thatthere are really, really low levels of unemployment, record levels of unemployment, strong growth, manufacturing was doing well, but he wasn't able to really talk to Americans about the cost of living issues and how he was going to resolve that, and how Inflation Reduction Act would resolve that. So I would imagine that she will be better at articulating this message than Biden has been, and she'll focus on talking points that resonate at least with Democrats and possibly with independents, talking about just lowering the cost of food, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Of course, recently, at the campaign rally with Joe Biden, they unveiled this new policy which would lower the cost of prescription drugs on 10 medications and save billions of dollars for Medicare. So, they're focusing on these issues that are really important to American voters. And thus far, she hasn't gotten that specific. She's kind of focused on this idea of hope and optimism and the way that Donald Trump would threaten Americans freedoms.

He didn't really get into other specifics of what he was going to do, and that press conference was a bit of a mess. It was just sort of 50 minutes of rambling. I don't know why he decided to do this in front of a country club and then put all these grocery items and juxtaposed the vast differences of his own wealth with people who are just sort of struggling to pay for these items.

She's spoken more about things that are more positive and uplifting. And so I don't know if there's going to be just this huge policy U- turn with her.

She will have a number of issues to confront, including the economy. It's a point of focus from her predecessor before he left office, really trying to create policies that would create jobs and spending.
