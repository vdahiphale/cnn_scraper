I'll speak with a doctor from the Syrian American Medical Society.The White House appears cautiously optimistic about an Israel-Hamas deal even as President Biden's time in office winds down. And Donald Trump discusses everything from the Middle East to potential pardons for insurrectionists as he's again named \"Times Magazine's \"Person of the Year. It is 10:00 a.m. in Damascus, Syria, where the effort to form a new government is getting a diplomatic push from around the globe. Jordan will host a weekend summit with foreign ministers from Western and Arab nations after the fall of the Assad regime. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the region meeting with Turkey's president and foreign minister. He's stressing the need for unity among rival factions to prevent a resurgence of ISIS. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We want to avoid sparking any kinds of additional conflicts inside of Syria at a time where we want to see this transition to an interim government into a better way forward for Syria. Part of that also has to be ensuring that ISIS doesn't rear its ugly head again. And critical to making sure that doesn't happen is the so-called SDF, Syrian Democratic Forces. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Sullivan struck a tone of cautious optimism, saying that he believes that there is optimism in the air, that there is cause to believe that a deal can indeed be reached, and that he believes the Israeli prime minister is indeed ready to reach a deal.He gave a number of reasons for why things have changed, for why there is more optimism in the air. He said that following the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, that Hamas seems to have changed its negotiating posture somewhat, recognizing that it was no longer receiving the support of Hezbollah and that perhaps other actors that it had hoped would come into play in its defense ultimately will not. At the same time, he also indicated that there were changes on the Israeli side as well, noting that Israel has killed Hamas's leader Yahya Sinwar and that some of its other military successes in Gaza may have made Israel more willing to reach for an agreement. Now at the same time, Sullivan did caution that the United States has said that a deal was close, that a deal was at hand before, and ultimately it didn't happen. So here was that more cautious side that he voiced. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  We have been in a place before where American officials have stood before podiums and said we are close and we were close but we didn't get there. I believe we are close again. Will we get there? It is not yet clear whether we will or we won't, but we are determined to try to drive this across the finish line. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
