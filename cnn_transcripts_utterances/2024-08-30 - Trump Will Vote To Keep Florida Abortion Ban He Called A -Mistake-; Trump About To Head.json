At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation, that you can do an abortion in the ninth month.

Let me read it to you.It says, quote, Donald Trump just made his position on abortion very clear. He will vote to uphold an abortion ban, so extreme, it applies before many women even know they are pregnant. It goes on to say -- and, understand, he is not done. As a part of Donald Trump's project 2025 agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, threatened access to fertility treatments and ban abortion nationwide with or without Congress. And it concludes by saying, the choice in this election is clear. Of course, this vice president had coined the term Trump abortion ban while on the road earlier this year. And that is exactly what this campaign is leaning on, especially with the foreign president's remarks earlier today. Now, the campaign is going to be taking this on the road, too. Next week. They are launching their reproductive rights tour, and the first stop is on Tuesday in Florida. Of course, that state that we're talking about abortion on the ballot with the six- week ban. Now, Senator Klobuchar will be there, as well as the campaign manager, and its going to include at least 50 stops. Now this is going to be primarily surrogates, including the campaign says elected officials, and celebrities. But what this tells us, Brianna, is they're certainly not shying away from this. This is an issue that Democrats think is a galvanizing one with voters and they think that they can get at some momentum here, make inroads among certain blocks of women voters. And so that is what they are clearly trying to do here, both with the vice president herself putting out a statement and then two with the tour to follow next week.",

And so I think the most important thing and what women voters know, and we've seen this time and time again when the opportunity has gone to the voters and they've gone to the polls they vote for reproductive freedom. And so what's most important is to remind voters that Donald Trump is the person who put in place the justices that overturned Roe v. Wade. He brags about it. He's very proud of that fact and he actually has a record when he was president of undermining women's health, for starters, by saying he wanted to overturn the Affordable Care Act.

Of course, that didn't happen.In 2020, people may forget, in October, right after he himself got COVID, he promised he was going to have this miracle drug. He called it a cure from Regeneron that he's going to make available to everyone who is going to be free and everyone's going to be cured of COVID, of course, COVID was a disaster after, you know? And I think it's important remember, too, that even the promises that he kept in stuck with, things like, I'm going to build a wall and U.S.-Mexico border, even then, it's not as though he came to it with a plan for how it's going to be done. He never was able to secure funding for that either, had to declare a state of emergency that allowed them to do it. So it's not -- even if he intended to do this, which there's no indication that he does beyond to the former governors point, that he wants to vacuum up these votes even if he wanted to do it, its not as though he's going to come forward with a plan and how it's going to be done anyway.

But I do think its smart politics is proposal on IVF and it's also something that I think a majority of the Congress would support. He's trying to obviously on all these issues, trying to moderate the Republican Party on abortion for obvious reasons and it's a struggle because of the reasons that were noted earlier.

But there's a second big element to this as well. And that the Ukrainians are saying that they're getting hit by a lot of those Russian glide bombs that the Russians have been using with their air force recently, which allows them to use their jets much more effectively. And the Ukrainian say that is why they need those longer-distance U.S. weapons and need to be allowed to use those to strike deeper into Russian territory to try and hit some of the airfields from which the Russian jets are taking off that are then attacking the Ukrainian positions with some really heavy munitions, Brianna.",

Do you think the U.S. this should give Ukraine the green light to do this. Why? JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Brianna, they should have given the greenlight at the outset. If you're going to use the piece of equipment, you want to use it to your maximum effectiveness. So you ensure that the training is there, that the preparation to receive that piece of equipment is there, that the organization, the logistics to support it, and most importantly, the intelligence necessary to achieve all those great targets, all of that should be in place. And the United States should not have given some incredibly capable pieces of kit the Ukrainians without saying unleashed these bad boys, use them to the maximum effectiveness, go after military targets like fuel depots, ammunition, those lines of communications -- communications centers, headquarters, all those things that the Russians need to bring forces to the fight. If you can attrite those capabilities further away from the front, you make a decision, you make the Russians make a decision.

If you go back to the map that you showed early on, you could see that the Kursk invasion where they are right now is geographically separated by a pretty good distance from where the significant fighting is going on in the Donbas region. That's a vulnerability. It's a vulnerability to the Russians and the Ukrainians. It could be exploited. Forces are not there.So the fact that the Russians have not gone aggressively against the Kursk invasion is because they've got most of their forces engaged where they are right now in the Donbas, in the east. And it also tells you they lacked the flexibility to make that maneuver to hold in one location, to hold in the east, and then to maneuver against the Ukrainians where they are in Russia. The Russian military doesn't have that flexibility. Their leadership essentially doesn't exist. And when confronted with a crisis like this, they freeze. There is no initiative at the lowest levels and that's the problem with the Russians right now. They can't respond to this. They can't see it. They can't detect it. They can't sense what's going to happen next. They really don't have a sense of how this is going to unfold. And they freeze in place.",
